Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","And I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Mr. Abhey Lamba. Sir, you may begin.","Abhey Lamba","Thanks, operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2019. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the Company such as our guidance for the third quarter and full-year fiscal 2019, our long-term financial model guidance, our cash flow expectations, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, including assumptions regarding ASC 606, our maintenance to subscription transition, ARPS, customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, our Form 10-Q for the period ending April 30, 2018, and our current reports on Form 8-K including the Form 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today\u2019s press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss in our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison under ASC 606.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Abhey. Our strong Q2 results led by 28% growth in total annualized recurring revenue not only reflect a healthy demand environment, but also continued execution as we move further through our transition to subscription. We also achieved strong growth in ARPS, billings, revenue and earnings.","There are several key areas that I want to highlight. We had record growth in total ARR and total ARPS on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The same goes for core ARR, which grew 29% in core ARPS. Recurring revenue advanced to 96%. We continue to see steady migration of maintenance customers in subscription with the maintenance-to-subscription program or M2S. And we\u2019ve bolstered our presence in the construction market with the acquisition of Assemble Systems.","First, let\u2019s dive into ARR. I\u2019ll repeat that we view ARR is the best proxy for measuring our progress in the overall health of our business. I noted last quarter that we expected ARR growth to build as we move through the year and we are absolutely seeing that in the second quarter. The strength in total ARR was once again broad-based with all three major geographies showing growth with APAC showing the strongest growth.","Subscription plan ARR more than doubled for the sixth time in the past seven quarters, driven by growth in all subscription plan types led by product subscription. We continue to drive impressive growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.","Looking at our core business, which represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription, and EBA subscriptions. It\u2019s not surprising that core ARR grew in line with total ARR, as our core business drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth. Simultaneously, customers continue to engage with our solutions for reimagining construction and manufacturing. That progress is reflected in cloud ARR, which grew more than 20% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.","You've heard me say many times the construction is our key initial focus for becoming a designer made company. The market is ready and we have compelling technology and products. The biggest contributor to our cloud ARR is our BIM 360 family of products, our project delivery and construction management software that connects design and construction.","A great example of how BIM 360 is being utilized in the field comes from WebCore, a large U.S. based general contractor. They are utilizing a range of advanced technology to support an innovative and efficient approach to construction.","The Company is using Autodesk BIM 360 on the UC Merced 2020 project, which will expand the University of California as Merced campus by over 1.2 million square feet across 14 structures. BIM 360 is enabling WebCore to gain greater efficiency in delivering documentation and coordinated models to the field. They are also using the Forge platform to integrate and connect project data with BIM data, resulting in a single source of information and enhanced project delivery and performance.","We continue to aggressively pursue that $10 billion construction opportunity. And last month, we expanded our product offerings with the acquisition of Assemble Systems, a cloud-based solution offering combined 2D and 3D quantity take off for the construction market.","Assemble is doing something very unique and was one of the first companies to recognize the power of BIM for preconstruction planning and developed ways to efficiently get information out of the model and into the planning process. They extract the information and make it useful and accessible for contractors to help them with bid management, estimating, project management, scheduling, site management and finance.","They were also an early adopter of our Forge platform. Assemble is a team of about 50 people, fairly evenly split between sales and engineering. Their products are used by over 200 companies, including a quarter of the ENR 400 and have been used on more than 7,000 construction projects.","Assemble will enhance our market positioning and contribute to making BIM 360 a more comprehensive solution, spanning across the design and construction phase. We believe this will be a great fit both from a product and people perspective. We know them all well as Autodesk through our Forge Fund was a lead investor in their Series A realm last year.","We are also seeing nice progress with the adoption of Fusion in the manufacturing market, an exciting Fusion customers Fabric, makers of award-winning cycling products. Fabric\u2019s mission is to bring innovation to its industry by leveraging unique manufacturing methods. The Fabric team was initially introduced to Fusion by another customer and started using it for the complex industrial design requirements of bicycle saddles and affords ability to link the designs directly to manufacturing and 3D printing. Then they expanded their uses of Fusion into design, simulation and validation.","Recently they have begun using generative design in Fusion to explore hundreds of practical design alternatives that delivers superior performance and can be manufactured efficiently. They are a great company and they illustrate how manufacturers are innovating with the use of advanced tools like Fusion.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for more details on subscriptions, ARPS and other financial metrics.","Scott Herren","Thanks Andrew. Before getting into the Q2 numbers, I want to comment on the terrific progress we've made since we started down this path to transform our model to subscription and cloud back in calendar 2014. We\u2019ve added over 1.7 million net subscriptions over that time period and it\u2019s now been two years since we sold our last perpetual license.","The mix of our business is also dramatically shifted, as maintenance now makes up less than 30% of the subs and ARR basis, and the new model has allowed us to add a significant number of new customers to Autodesk.","We\u2019ve also migrated over 600,000 maintenance customers to subscription. From a financial standpoint, we are now firmly back in the growth stage. We\u2019re back to non-GAAP profitability, positive cash flow, and we\u2019ve transformed our business from less than 40% recurring revenue, prior to the start of the transition, to a highly predictable 96% recurring revenue in Q2. We still have some ways to go to achieve the fiscal 2020 targets we\u2019ve laid out and believe the best is yet to come, but it's worth noting the meaningful progress we\u2019ve made today.","Looking at Q2, now I'll start with a closer look at subscriptions. Subscription plan subs grew by 290,000 in Q2 with growth coming in all three categories; cloud, enterprise and product subscriptions. Core subscription additions were 88,000 and increased 6% sequentially. We added 31,000 net cloud subscriptions, which is a nice step up from the 18,000 we added in Q1.","It's important to note that net subscription additions continued to be impacted by product consolidation from the adoption of Industry Collections. Again, the good news is that many of these customers are increasing their total spend with Autodesk, contributing to solid increases in ARR and ARPS. The adoption of Industry Collections is happening through the regular run rate of new business, the renewal process, the legacy promo and the M2S program.","New subscriptions for Industry Collections increased 60% year-over-year and represented 40% of the net product subscription additions in Q2. Industry Collections now make up 27% of the total base of product subscriptions, up from 14% in Q2 last year, that\u2019s great progress. This is important because Industry Collections generate higher ARPS and have a much higher renewal rate compared to standalone products and it also signals a deeper relationship with the customers they were able to utilize more of our solutions.","Speaking of the M2S program, we continue to make solid progress in migrating our maintenance customers to do subscription. In Q2, customers migrated 117,000 maintenance subs to product subs. While at less than what we have converted over the past two quarters. Remember that the pool of maintenance subscription gets smaller each passing quarter.","The conversion rate remains strong with over one-third of all maintenance renewal opportunities during Q2 migrating the product subscription. But those that migrate once again about 30% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an Industry Collection.","The renewal rate for maintenance declined slightly sequentially as expected. This is consistent with our long-term model, where we\u2019ve projected a decrease in maintenance renewal rates as we progressed further into the M2S program. The renewal rate for product subscription experienced another sequential increase and we expected to continue to rise as the product mix shifts towards higher value products. Helping bolster that renewal rate are the M2S related subscriptions which have a very high renewal rate as expected because the program was designed to be very sticky.","Let\u2019s go to deeper on this topic, when we first announced the M2S offer, we provided a three-year price outlook to our maintenance customers who converted. As time went on, we heard customer feedback on extending this pricing outlook, so they can plan for their long-term business needs and investment in Autodesk solutions. So in June, we announced that we are extending our price commitment to 2028 for customers to continue to renew after they switch to subscription.","For these converted customers to renewal SRP will increase by no more than 5% every other year starting in calendar 2021 subject to currency movements of course. It\u2019s has nothing to do with the adoption of M2S, but rather putting customers at ease regarding their number one concern that our investment will significantly increase pricing once they move to subscription. This action simply puts into writing, but we've been verbalizing since we lost the program. The cost of living type adjustments would be implemented after the initial three-year price freeze and is consistent with our long-term financial goals.","In each, quarter the vast majority of the new subscription plan subs are added through traditional means. However, we continue to make progress in converting legacy users into subscribers. In Q2, the legacy promo added 17,000 product subscriptions and 35% of those where Industry Collections, which is the highest percentage we ever achieved for the legacy promotion.","Once again the average age of the licenses that are turned in with the promo is about seven years behind the current release indicating there is still a very long tail of legacy customers to convert. There continues to be about 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using an old perpetual license without maintenance plan. We believe that over time we will convert a large number of them utilizing our insides sales team to concentrate on converting this important cohort.","The consistent attribute of the transition is the new customers continue to make up a meaningful proportion of the product subscription additions and represented over 25% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users and people have been using an alternative design tool.","Not let\u2019s talk a little bit more about annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS. ARPS continue to inflect up in Q2. Various pricing changes we made in the past two quarters have the greatest influence on Q2 ARPS. These are been relatively small adjustments such as the price increase associated with the M2S program, lower channel discount on AutoCAD LT and an increase from multi-user subscriptions. Long-term ARPS drivers will continue to be the growing renewal base which comes at higher net price to Autodesk, the increase in digital direct sales also at higher net price to Autodesk.","The product mix shift to Industry Collections, the maintenance price increase for those customers who don\u2019t take advantage of the M2S program and less discounting and promotional activity. We expect ARPS to continue to inflect up for all the reasons I have just discussed as we progressed through the transition.","Our e-store which is like a bigger part of our digital sales grew over 75% in Q2. For the past four quarters, our e-store has generated over 20% of the product subscriptions and Q2 also marked the seventh consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth in our direct-to-enterprise business.","What\u2019s interesting is that while the growth of our total direct business accelerated to its highest range in over two years, growth indirect business grew even faster, leading the mix of indirect business to tick up a point to 72% of total revenue. We continue to believe that over time the mix of direct business will outpace the growth of indirect, leading to a more even spilt between direct and indirect revenue.","Moving to spend management, our total non-GAAP spend came in at $556 million for the quarter, which is slightly higher than expected. However, if we normalize for ASC 340 and foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year growth in total spend would have been less than 2%.","The sequential increase in spend was related to the continued hiring ramp that we\u2019ve been calling up for the past few quarters as we near the completion of the resource rebalancing we announced in Q4 of last year. Our intent for fiscal 2019 remains to keep non-GAAP spend roughly flat at constant currency relative to our fiscal 2018 budget at about $2.2 billion.","Looking at the balance sheet, total deferred revenue grew 20% as reported and 24% under ASC 605. Unbilled deferred revenue decreased by $6 million sequentially to $406 million. It\u2019s important to note the impact of ASC 606 here because 606 require early renewals to be captured in unbilled deferred revenue.","Early renewals in Q2 were $20 million lower than Q1 when some maintenance customers renewed early ahead of the M2S price increase. So while traditional unbilled deferred revenue related to moving our large EBA customers to annual billings increased by $14 million sequentially, it was more than offset by fewer early renewals.","Looking at cash flow, we return to positive cash flow as expected in Q2. Operating cash flow was $43 million which benefited from growth and billings and better than expected billings linearity and cash collections. We used $147 million in the quarter to buyback roughly 1.1 million shares at an average price of $131.52. We continue to be committed the managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.","Now I\u2019ll turn the discussion to our outlook and I\u2019ll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains mostly unchanged from the last few quarters for monitoring the potential macroeconomic impact from various trade and tariffs disputes. There have been some FX volatility but our hedging program is succeed and smoothing of the bigger swings.","Overall, we really proud the results we achieved in Q2 in the first half of the year. As we look at our outlook for Q3 in the second half, we expect to see continuing sequential increases in most metrics, including ARR, ARPS, billings, revenue, spend, earnings, and subscription additions. We expect our hiring ramp to continue in the second half as we finished the rebalancing of resources to the most strategic projects and as such we expect our spend to increase sequentially and would likely be at the high end of our guidance range for the full-year.","Keep in mind the adoption of ASC 340 capitalizes commissions. So we won\u2019t have as big of step up and spend in Q4 compared to historical trends. Also point out the remodeling cash flow to decrease moderately sequentially in Q3 related to the shipping billings linearity that I mentioned earlier, which resulted in more of our Q2 billings being collected in quarter. We continue to expect a sizable uptick in cash flow in Q4 and then will be cash flow positive for the year and the acquisition of Assemble will not have the material impact on our overall results this year.","We have confident and achieving our fiscal 2020 goals that said subscription additions for this year likely will be at the low end of our guidance range, primarily related to the success we are having with the adoption of industry collections and the consolidation we are experiencing with the M2S program.","And one side note with regards to subscriptions, we will continue to report out on subs and ARPS for the remainder of this year, but are not planning on reporting those metrics on a quarterly basis starting in Q1 of fiscal 2020. Of course we use events like our annual Investor Day to report at an important metrics that will help you build out your long-term models.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Andrew for a quick closing comment.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks Scott. I wanted to note that I\u2019ve recently completed my first year as Autodesk\u2019s CEO. It's been an exciting four quarters and we've made a tremendous amount of progress. The three primary focus areas that I outlined at this time last year have not changed and all are on track. So allow me to remind you what new organization is focused on for driving success.","The first is completing the subscription transition. We remain focused not only in the financial results, but on enhancing the subscriber experience and delivering more value to our customers and customers are acknowledging that we absolutely providing greater value with subscription.","Second, is digitizing the Company. By that I mean that we are investing in our own digital infrastructure to create opportunities for our customers to transact and engage directly with us, increase their level of self-service for a wide range of customer needs, and increase our ability to instantly and reliably understand how successful our customers are being with our products.","We've made progress in this area and we have expanded the self-service capabilities in Autodesk account, allowing customers to easily manage users, add seats, align billings, and take advantage of the flexibility inherent in our subscription model. We've also rolled out a broad set of capabilities that help our inside sales and support teams understand the status of the customers they interact with every day.","The third is reimagining construction, manufacturing and production. You should have no doubt that we are absolutely committed to winning the construction space and winning in the new world of digital manufacturing. We've done well to establish early leadership position in construction and we're not going to slow down.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, let me start with you and ask a question regarding the alignment with your sales and distribution model to your product and market strategy in two respects. With respect to the growing intersection of manufacturing that you see through your strategy, can you talk about how you're aligning, particularly the indirect channels to do that?","You've typically separated the AEC from the manufacturing specialties in indirect. Would it make sense for you to increasingly combine or converge the channel specialties in that way to be more directly aligned with your product market strategy that is the focus areas you just spoke off? And then secondly with regard to the self-service model, when would you expect that the e-store could be at least half of the direct business?","And then lastly for Scott, your AEC Manufacturing segment revenues were largely in line with our model, so the upside was as it turned out in AutoCAD for the repackaged AutoCAD. Would you expect for the remainder of the year that the relatively better growth or upside might occur in the repackaged AutoCAD as compared with the AEC Manufacturing segment?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. So Jay, let me start answering your question by just kind of summarizing how we structured the sales force, because I think it actually talks directly to what you're talking about. So at the beginning of this year, we realigned the sales force along with a series of new models. First, what we did is, we of course maintained and invested a little bit more on our major account team. And as you know, the major account team is basically account-based.","So account-based is kind of an industry type model, but it focuses on what's most important to the account, which by the way is the most valuable way to go-to-market with anything, because accounts blend many different things. Some of our biggest accounts are both AEC customers and Manufacturing customers that they have buildings, and maybe they design products. The other thing we did is we built out what we call a mid-market team, which is one level below our major account team.","This is still a team that fulfills indirectly, but it's structured like a named accounts team, in that the reps have a series of accounts assigned to them that they then work with designated channel partners to satisfy. Again, this is the best way to try to scale a business when you see customers of our business is coming together because the accounts are already identified either as manufacturing or construction or architecture accounts or engineering accounts or as holistic \u2013 accounts.","So that model actually allowed us to expand the account paradigm deeper into our channel network, and actually sort of align the channel on an account-based methodology and thinking. The next tier down below from that is what we call territory sales. And the territory sales has essentially split into two pieces, this kind of the more generic horizontal part of our business where it's more picked up by ambient demand. There's not specific accounts called out, but we do market along the specific segments.","And what we've done in that area is we've got the business completely driven by channels. The channels are in the lead there and then we've got the digital piece. The piece that encompasses our inside sales teams and our e-store, which can be highly somewhat verticalized just like what we\u2019ve done with named account sales where a particular inside sales rep might call and just have an e-accounts or just manufacturing accounts, just ADC accounts.","We believe that structure combined with some intermediate steps around accelerating opportunities saying construction manufacturing is the right structure going forward and aligns with some of the concepts you're saying, well a lot of things that our customers do are getting closer and closer together. So that answers to your first question. The second question, I'll answer this way.","Our long-term target for our business is half direct, half indirect. We anticipate that direct piece is going to be half e-store, half major account direct. Our e-store grew over 70% this quarter year-over-year. We are posting impressive growth numbers down there. More and more of the LT business is being captured in that channel.","And I can give you a specific number on when that mix becomes 50\/50 and see what the investment is doing. It\u2019s driving a lot more growth in that channel and we expect that growth to continue to be robust especially as it starts to get more and more robust and say Europe and then APAC first to pick up. There are still lots of room to grow down that channel. And Scott I\u2019ll turn the last question over to you.","Scott Herren","Sure. Your question on AutoCAD upside, we repackaged all the AutoCAD verticals and AutoCAD together into one AutoCAD. We launched that earlier this year. And the whole goal of that was to make it easier to sell, easier to buy, easier to consume AutoCAD. And so some of the benefits we are seeing is from that for sure and I think we will see some of that benefit continue through the year.","I think the second is I think most of you know, we made changes in our channel marketing structure for AutoCAD LT which also rolls into AutoCAD family. When we reduced the channel margins on AutoCAD LT with the goal of having the channels, but more then are focused on selling collections which we see is actually having a quite nice outcome. But when you layer in both the acceleration from one AutoCAD and the change in the channel margin on LT, those are the two things that are fueling the growth in the AutoCAD family.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thanks very much.","Scott Herren","Thanks Jay.","Andrew Anagnost","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Just one question for Scott and then a follow-up for Andrew. Scott, obviously another strong quarter in ARPS and you laid out a lot of the drivers that we should see over the next multiple years to continue to move that higher. I was hoping you gave some color as you think sort of the next few quarters here, how we think about sort of the incremental drivers and ARPS versus what we've seen here in the first half of this year. Then to your comment about sort of collections being strong, obviously a positive to ARPS, could you also maybe provide some color on just the impact to the subscription unit number? And then like I said, just one quick follow-up for Andrew.","Scott Herren","Sure, Phil. On the drivers of ARPS \u2013 the long-term drivers of ARPS are going to be the same one that we've talked about an Investor Day and that I highlighted in the opening commentary. The growing renewal base which is higher net to us, the digital sales continues to grow, that's a higher net to us. M2S \u2013 and M2S both as a long-term driver of growth and also had a significant impact on Q2. As you know, the beginning of Q2, we got a year or two of maintenance subscription, which met the maintenance price index up another 10% and the conversion price index up 5%.","So that's a long-term driver that's also a specific Q2 driver for us on ARPS. And then greater or less discounting and promotional activity, so greater net yield to us across the Board. The LT channel discount change that we made earlier in the year, we're seeing that now flow through, obviously goes first into deferred revenue from deferred revenue into the P&L and ARPS. That was a benefit to ARPS in Q2.","Industry Collections continues to \u2013 we continue to have great success. And 40% of the net product subscriptions added in the quarter were Industry Collections, which is a high water mark for us. That's driving ARPS. It is having an offset. To the second part of your question Phil, that does have an offset to subs obviously, but I think that's a \u2013 in most cases, the customers end up spending more money with us when they make that change from standalone products to Industry Collections. So we drive more ARR and of course higher ARPS and trade-off faster subscriptions growth. I think that's a good trade-off.","And then finally, we made a slight price adjustment on our multi-user products. We also saw the benefit of that for the first time really flowing through deferred revenue and into reported results during Q2. So it's a lot of things that all move right direction on ARPS in Q2 \u2013 probably get ahead of your next year follow-up on this. When you look at our guidance for the full-year, you can see \u2013 we do expect to see continued ARPS growth in both Q3 and Q4 throughout the year.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks Scott. And then Andrew, obviously you highlighted the acquisition of Assemble and if I think about just your construction management, portfolio is broad, and obviously start on the design side, but then BIM, and then the Assemble being able to connect that BIM data into planning systems, then you've got your planning construction management team. You think about sort of lifecycle of CMS. So how do you think about how sort of deep Autodesk wants to go onto the CMS side, because it seems to be you're inching further along kind of that lifecycle, but still being grounded in the design side, kind of like CAD and PLM?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So long-term our goal is to capture every aspect of that cycle. From all the way from designs, you\u2019re preconstruction to site execution into operation. We're very interested in that whole process. And the reason I said this multiple times is because it's moving in a direction of the manufacturing cycle moved in the past. The model is going to become the currency that moves from one aspect of the design process to the next aspect of the main process to ultimately once you do retire or manage the asset and make the next asset.","So we think the model is going to be a critical piece of this process moving forward and we intend to manage the flow that information across the entire process. You're correct and what you said around Assemble Systems that was a classic move for us to double down on the area of pre-construction where we're trying to help people take driven data and turn it into actionable information in the creek pre-construction planning cycle. That's exactly what Assemble it does and it helps us basically drive opened the opportunity in an area that we feel we're highly competitively advantaged in the space.","Philip Winslow","Got it, so CLM not just PLM, all right. Thanks guys.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions here. First, may be for you Scott. Nice job on the billings this quarter. I think clearly the acceleration in ARR is the main driver, but you touched on some other items as well. So just wondering if you could talk about some other factors there are like duration and linearity and how you think about \u2013 how you thought about some of the drivers of ARR \u2013 a billing strength in the quarter?","Scott Herren","Yes. Thanks Saket. Duration really doesn't have an effect during the quarter on billings. If you look at our weighted-average term links of our deferred revenue effect you see on the balance sheet. You see our long-term deferred actually declined again sequentially. So we're not seeing a change in duration this driving billings. It does get back to a lot of the things I just talked about in response to Phil's question about the drivers of ARPS.","ARPS, the layering on of greater growth of industry collections, some of the changes that we made on channel margins, that the growth through the channel, frankly we had a really strong quarter indirect as you heard in the opening commentary and we actually take down a one percentage point in the percent of direct because the channel grew really strong during in the quarter. So that \u2013 if it was a combination of those things, much more so than any kind of one-time benefit that hit billings during the quarter.","Saket Kalia","Got it. That's very helpful. Andrew, for may be my follow-up for you. I know we've talked about renewal rates a little bit, but I'd like to zoom in a little bit on subscription renewal rates in particular. Now that we've gone through a couple price increases. I guess the question is how those trended? I think we've touched on a little bit, but can you recap for us how those have trended and more importantly, how have you thought about those renewal rates for subscription in the long-term model?","Andrew Anagnost","All right, Saket, let me answer that question from a couple of things. First, one of the things that we watch very, very closely here as we watch transition is the maintenance renewal rates in particular. All right, we know that the prices were going to be going up. We modeled in certain changes in maintenance renewal rates over time. So we've got a long-term model and what we expect to happen to maintenance renewal rates as the price is ratchet up on maintenance and as the M2S program progresses.","What I can tell you right now is those renewal rates are smack dab in line with what we've been modeling and what our goals were with regards to that. Now, do the models numbers create the outcome or are we just brilliant modelers in predicting customer behavior? We can debate that.","But what we're seeing is behavior that's right in line with what we\u2019re modeling. The same goes from what we're seeing in the product subscription area, the pure product subscription area. We\u2019re seeing nice increases in renewal rates, what we expected, what we have built into our model. So I think the important headline here is we're seeing things that are consistent with our expectations.","And one of the things that was also very gratifying, and Scott mentioned it earlier in the opening commentary is the M2S program was designed to be very sticky. It's designed to incent our maintenance customers to come over and feel great coming over. And what we're seeing is really high or highest renewal rates for customers that took on the M2S program, which by the way is an important fact that in terms of taking care of our best customers, but also making sure to retain that basis in the future.","Saket Kalia","Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Saket.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","Thanks. BIM is been around for \u2013 I mean I've been hearing people talk about it for at least a decade, but it's doing well. And so the question I have is, so when I talked to some of your customers, some bought it because it was like \u2013 a very few have bought it \u2013 some bought it because of the digital transformation. Others were more kind of I guess cold blooded and saw hard dollar ROI.","So when I kind of think about how markets evolve. Is this a market and you guys have much more visibility in this thank I will. So is this a market that kind of starts with like a hard dollar ROI sale? And then as you kind of get momentum and people say, this is like really important, you'll start to get these kind of bigger deals because you'll hear this digital transformation discussion. And this is exactly what we saw with sales force is what we're seeing with service now and other industries and sectors. I wonder if that's \u2013 how this market is going to play out, so thanks.","Scott Herren","Yes. Look here is how these markets generally play out. There's always a first mover and when you\u2019re talking about BIM, I want to distinguish whether or not you\u2019re talking about. BIM is in the whole \u2013 discipline in building information modeling or BIM 360 in terms of the construction [indiscernible].","What you\u2019re saying is actually \u2013 but let's just talk specifically about BIM 360. What you're seeing right now in the space is that there is a pressing problem to digitize the site. So the mainstream problem, that's the problem that just about every construction company sees is this idea \u2013 well I get digitized my site. I need to get model information to the construction site, I need to get up-to-date drawing information to the construction site.","There's a lot of \u2013 that segment of the market right now because the technology is ready, the customer is ready. They want it and they need it. That's getting that kind of classic adoption curve that we typically see in any kind of technology, more and more people are buying. And now they're starting to ask the question about, okay, so what's the next step?","So if I go and I look at some of our more forward looking customers, especially some of our largest construction and general contractors, they're already looking at, okay. I'm able to digitize my site. But I want to digitize my entire construction process just like those guys do over in Boeing or Airbus and make the same processes that they have for how I build the building, a road or a bridge.","They're experimenting early with this pushing the building information model further and further down into the process. And what's you're going to see is this battle for competitive advantage. It's now becoming who can be more digital first, so that they can increase their fidelity on project bids, cut a few hundred million off their bid for a project because they have much more precise information about what the margin is.","So it\u2019s going to become a digital arms race. And that's exactly what starts to happen in classic technology adoption. There is all sorts of words for it, the tornado and you've heard of many different kinds of words. It's been called different things over the ages. But we're starting to see the early signs of basically a digitalization arms race between various people in the construction space and it's going to play out there.","Richard Davis","Yes. That's super helpful. Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. Thanks Richard.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. So I just wanted to talk a little bit. You guys are obviously well on your way to $6, which was the first target you guys laid out years ago. But as people start to shift the focus to $11, and I know you've touched on this a little bit here, but can you share with us how you're thinking about the contribution from cloud subs, how important are they to getting to that number and how do we think about broader adoption in the construction market given they've typically been really slow to embrace technology? So I guess I'm wondering what do you think the industry needs to see to be more open to leveraging technology. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So let me approach this from a couple of directions. So first off, we're definitely committed to our long-term capital targets that we put out there in various forms, especially at Investor Day. I want to remind you something we said at Investor Day because it's very important for how we look at the company moving forward.","And we look less at the ratios that we've been classically talking about and much more at the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin and trying to optimize that number to provide the right long-term outcome for the company and the right kind of value creation.","So just remember, as we look forward out beyond FY 2020, we're really looking at the sum of those two numbers, revenue growth and free cash flow margin growth is kind of the ways to look at where we're going moving forward, that we remain completely committed to the free cash flow targets we put out there.","Now, when you look at the construction market, so I want to challenge something you said, there already is a large increase in technology spending going on in the construction space. It's not just because of all the VC money that's been invested in this space. There's actually hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue being generated right now on the site execution product.","So what's changed fundamentally is it\u2019s getting harder and harder for these construction companies, especially on large projects to win without having some kind of digitization in their process. They're simply not able to get the margins and hit the scheduling requirements they have without having tighter control over the data flow.","So they've been historically reluctant because the industry as a whole has been historically sloppy. And because the industry as a whole is sloppy, there was no competitive pressure to actually drive technology adoption. But what you're starting to see is types of excellence inside the construction industry where people are adopting, some of our best customers are becoming very digital and they're highly visionary in terms of how they see the construction industry evolving that vision and that move towards being highly digital is changing the way people have to compete in this space.","So it's been slow in the past because sloppy has been tolerated and everybody was sloppy and they were all equally sloppy. People are getting a lot tighter and that's what it's going to change things Heather as you move forward, it's basically back to this fundamental thing about as the secular margin gets more digital the rest of the segments right back into the digital by necessity.","Heather Bellini","Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","You\u2019re welcome.","Scott Herren","Thanks Heather.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Hi guys. Thanks. So a lot of discussion around BIM, not only on this call, but a lot of investor questions leading up to the call. I just want to ask is simply, has the financial results out of your BIM initiatives lived up to your expectations?","Andrew Anagnost","Sterling, we just had 21% growth in cloud ARR this quarter which is a mostly made up of BIM 360. We added 31,000 subs in the BIM 360 space. We are absolutely seeing results that we want to see in this space. You also saw it moved to make an acquisition around Assemble to try to double down. And frankly what we believe is a highly differentiated part of the process for us around preconstruction. It's an area where our customers are actually saying, well, we're glad you're doing this site digitization stuff, but can you do more on preconstruction for us?","So we're actually seeing a lot of the things we expected to see and we're getting increased demand from some of our best customers around the area they want to see us spend more effort on. So I do feel pretty good about where we're going and I feel very good about our prospects.","And one of the things I want to iterate here too, is because I've said it many times, our goal to be number one in this construction space right, looking for number two, we are not. We would never be satisfied with number three, we're going to be looking to be number one and we're heavily focused on doing everything it takes to become number one in the space. And I think you just want to make sure that you hear kind of our commitment to that and frankly our passion for that.","Sterling Auty","And one follow-up again on the space, if you look at the big customers, like ENC 300, et cetera. How are they adopting? Are they going with a single vendor and trying to build? Or are they kind of using a couple of different vendors and a couple of different projects to kind of test the waters and then making their decisions and developing from there.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So I mean [indiscernible] what you see is the biggest in the ENR 100 and top of GC chain. What they do is, they have a combination of vendors they bring in and also they bring custom developed solutions on top of what they're doing to fill the gaps between what they see that no vendor is providing.","Now the great news about the fact that they\u2019re engaged in some of these custom solution executions, they\u2019re becoming big adopters of Forge, because Forge, let them stitch together some of our data into some of their flows in ways that we haven't done the work in some of our off the shelf products to do that.","So everything you just described is exactly what's happening. I will tell you that there's more and more pressure on us to consolidate more and more of the process around the building information model and we're trying to respond to all of those requests, but the way you described it as multiple vendors involved and custom software coming together at the [indiscernible] that's exactly what happens.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Scott Herren","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Hamza Fodderwala","Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala and for Keith Weiss. So it seems like the overall ARR growth was strong, but the cloud ARR did come in a bit below that of the core business? Is that largely just a result of a tougher year-on-year compares and do you see any indication of a reacceleration in the second half from the revamped BIM 360 product?","Scott Herren","Yes, Hamza, the cloud business actually accelerated sequentially, right? So we talked about the ARR being at 21% and the number of subs going from $18,000 net adds, right? So it grew in aggregate $18,000 net adds in Q1, the $31,000 net adds in Q2. So this is actually performing quite well.","You remember this is the last quarter where our year-on-year comparison cloud compared back to a quarter where we were using a lot of kind of seeding strategy, pushing out a lot of high volume, low price, BIM 360 team subs out into the marketplace. So on a year-on-year basis maybe is where you're drawing your conclusion. You look at sequentially how it's moving \u2013 it's actually moving quite nicely. And fueled by the Andrew just said that fueled mostly by the growth of BIM 360.","Hamza Fodderwala","Got it. And then on the direct business, so I understood the dynamic between the indirect business growing a bit faster, but when could we see a more material pickup there given the sales restructuring that you talked about, are there any sort of exclusive discounts that you're offering through the e-store that to incentivize customers through that channel?","Scott Herren","No, we are not. Hamza, I don't think it makes sense to do a lot of that. It's a high class problem to have when you've got the fastest growth rate in our e-store and in our enterprise sales we've had in the last two years and yet the indirect channel is growing faster. So it's not a case that the direct channel is not growing. It's growing really quickly. The indirect channel is just keeping pace at this point. Longer-term, we still believe that settles in closer to a 50-50 blend, but frankly as long as we continue to grow that direct touch space, indirect business keeps pace that that's a good problem to have.","Hamza Fodderwala","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks. This is Alex on for Gal. I just wanted to dig a little deeper in the collection upselling. I was wondering which collections do you see, selling the best and I was wondering if you could give a quick breakdown on roughly how they're split? And then secondly, just on the $2 million user base that are not currently subscribers. What is the aging profile of that pool and are you thinking about any more promos to get them to move over, how are you trying to attract them to become paying subscribers? Thanks.","Scott Herren","So Alex, on your first question we don\u2019t actually provide that level of granularity as you'd expect AEC, which is the biggest piece of our overall business that you would expect the AEC collection to be the bigger piece of our total collection business as well. But we don't provide that that level of granularity down to the vintage of the collections. The overall good news is collections rapidly.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Scott Herren","Your second question on legacy, the 2 million legacy customers, we're making good strides on that, right. We the statistic that we gave earlier is 17,000 took advantage of the legacy promotion that we ran during Q2. Andrew also touched on this in his opening commentary. We will continue to go after advance space, continue to migrate the legacy customers. We continue to see the average of this scattergram of the licenses that they turn in, the legacy customers turn in to take advantage of the promo.","We continue to see the midpoint of that bell curve to be seven years old, seven years behind the current version, which means there's a \u2013 there continues to be a pretty long tail of legacy customers out there. I think what you'll see is through is price is one reason they move. And Andrew, you can jump that on a little bit more on this as well.","The older their licenses, their perpetual licenses, I remember we sold the last perpetual licenses for standalone products more than two years ago. The older it is, the more it ages out, the harder announce for them to work effectively within their ecosystem.","So price is only one lever to get those guys, just with those licenses age, they will come back and need to update the licenses. So we'll continue to farm that base probably more so with an inside sales types through our direct sales to hubs as opposed to trying to just get their price discounts.","Unidentified Analyst","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. Your line is now. Okay. ","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you very much. The core ARR was strong and it was good to see some improvement in cloud subscriptions as well. But Scott, you did mention that you expect net new subs to come in at the lower end of the range for the year. Is that solely because of the headwind on net adds from the M2S consolidation in the back half of the year? And if so, when do you expect that that dynamic will significantly subside.","Scott Herren","Yes, it is mostly related to success with collections is what I would say. Obviously, when maintenance customers consolidate that that turns into a gain in ARR, as we've talked about, but a decline in the total number of active subs. We will continue to fuel that headwind through the second half of the year.","The other things that will fuel though that the other part of your question, which is what's going to fuel the subs growth in the second half of the year, there's a couple of things inside there. One is we'll continue to see increased productivity from the mid-market channel that Andrew talked about. So this is a field sales team that we've put out there that's driving, direct touch with customers and that tier of customer is below named accounts and selling side by side with a partner.","We just started that process the beginning of this fiscal year. So they got their accounts assigned in February 1, first ever of fiscal year. They\u2019ve been meeting those accounts. They've been driving opportunities. They've been filling the pipeline. That business will uptick through the second half of the year. The productivity of that channel, now that\u2019s it\u2019s taking a longer decision will drive that. And the second is just historically new product subs are higher in the second half of the year than they are in the first half of the year. So it will drive that growth in the second half.","Gregg Moskowitz","Perfect.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Gregg, with respect to the consolidation on the M2S side, I said last earnings call that we expect that to work its way out of the system through the second half of this year and the reason for that is very simple. The accounts that are most likely to consolidate our largest accounts. They're the ones that actually make the move from M2S earlier in the cycle.","So for instance, in the U.S., the conversion rates for M2S is much higher than the average. I mean they came out of the gate fast and strong, and the largest accounts are already really moved in terms of M2S. You're starting to see that phenomenon work itself. It's way through. The European market. So you're seeing the large accounts start to take the M2S offering and move.","And just like with any pattern of anything we rollout the Company, I don't care what program it is. APAC comes up to speed third in that process and it will start to see, which has we move towards the end of the year. It\u2019s largest account start to move. So what you will see as these large accounts that moves that are most likely to consolidate will start to flush out as we move to the second half of the year or so. So watch that to happen as we move that mobile. See the headwind starts to slow down.","Gregg Moskowitz","Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Scott Herren","Thanks Gregg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with R.W. Baird. Your line is now open. ","Robert Oliver","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question, just one for Andrew to start. Andrew, I know you won't be held to a number on piracy in terms of conversions there, but you did float last quarter a little bit about some of the initiatives you guys had and I know Scott, you just touched on them as well with the mid market channel, but new sales motions, I mean product messaging, things like that. I was just wondering if you could talk about the progress of some of those conditions. ","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, it\u2019s good. I'm glad you're allowing me to refresh what I said last quarter. There will never be this announcement of some massive non-paying user event that fundamentally changes our trajectory. But you are right, we did roll out in English speaking countries, a new program that allows us to get more information and more direct engagement with people basically using invalid license of the software. That program has been integrated with our license compliance teams and with our inside sales teams.","So we're actually getting leads through that program and getting into discussions with customers. It's beginning to have an impact on the run rates and it will continue to grow. I mean, with all these programs it roll out, we start to get traction with them. We start to understand them more and they start to add more and more contribution.","I think the great thing about the whole non-paying user paradigm here is that it's going to be the gift that keeps giving over multiple years. These users aren't going away. They continued to use the software. They continue to procure more valid licenses as time goes on and we're going to be continuing to reach out with them more and more as we move forward. So look forward just to continue to support the ramp ups in volume that we have built into our models over the next few years.","Robert Oliver","Great. Thanks Andrew. And Scott, I just wanted to make sure. I think you touched on it pretty clearly. But just on that \u2013 but the change to kind of the subscription contracts, if you could just repeat that, I think what you said was, people get the price freeze for three-years and then it subject to sort of a cost of living adjustment under that, just wanted to make sure I had it right? Thank you guys very much.","Scott Herren","Yes, you got it right, Rob. When we first rolled out maintenance subscription, if you remember we gave three-years worth of visibility to what the prices would be for maintenance and what the increases would look like and then what it would be to convert. And for those that converted, we offered a three-year \u2013 they didn't have to pay upfront, but they got grandfathered with that conversion price for up to three years. What we've added to that now, one of the feedbacks that we got from the channel is, okay.","I want to know what's going to happen after that, right. I guess that you're going to grandfather me for three years, but I'm giving up a perpetual license that I'd spend a lot of money on and I did exactly what you asked me to do. I kept the current on maintenance for the entire time that I had it. I'm giving that up, so I want to understand some sense of what pricing is going to be longer term. And you\u2019ve heard us say several times that there would be kind of cost of living price adjustments that go into that.","What we've done is just formalized that, but after the channel that there will be kind of an every other year, 5% price increase subject to currency changes obviously, but 5% price increase, which averages out to kind of a 2.5% annual cost of living price increase every year for up to 10 years. So that's what we've done on M2S. Just to put it in writing, but we've been saying verbally and of course what's been built into our modeling for the entire time.","Andrew Anagnost","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi [indiscernible] on for Brad. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask, unpack the 10-year pricing plan a little bit more, I mean has that extra assurance helps with incremental and tax conversions are all and how does that pricing compared to non-promo subscriptions beyond 2021?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So we didn't provide this clarity because of any issues we're having with M2S program. As you can see, we have very, very robust conversion rates. They're actually ahead of our original model. So we're feeling good about this. We did this communication more to ensure that our sales resources didn't have to have protractive long back and forth conversations about the implications of moving to M2S. It's an efficiency move for us and it's a visibility movement and trust movements regards to our customer base.","So it's purely something that we're trying to do to look ahead to the last year and a half of the M2S program, makes sure it's highly efficient and make sure our customers basically have no questions, all right. And remember, as we look at the three-year period or it was a published price \u2013 increased true up at the end of that three-year period. All we did was given visibility to how the cost of living will play out in years after that.","Scott Herren","Beyond that.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, beyond that. Now your question about promos, are you referring to the legacy promos or\u2026","Scott Herren","Are you asking what's the relative price of this cohort versus the people that come in to a net new sub, because if you recall, when we laid that out, it starts at about a 50% discount for this converted group versus what the price of a new product subs is. And so with these kinds of cost of living price increases, that probably takes place on both lines. They'll continue to have an advantage price for some period of time.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. And just remember as time goes on this cohort, this M2S cohort that moved from maintenance subscription. It starts to become a fairly small percentage of our total subscriber base.","Scott Herren","So with an extremely high renewal rate.","Andrew Anagnost","With an extremely high renewal rate.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. That makes sense. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's Q&A session.

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of this call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor.","As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as, our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014; long-term financial model guidance, including our operating margin goals through fiscal 2015; the factors we use to estimate our guidance; new products and suite releases; market adoption and expected growth rates; cost management efforts; hiring plans; business executions; large transactions; strategic transactions; business prospects and financial results; and market opportunities and strategies, including our transition to the cloud and mobile computing; trends and sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically, our Form 10-K for the fiscal year of 2012, our Forms 10-Q for the periods ending July 31, April 30 and October 31, 2012, and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased with our stronger-than-expected fourth quarter results, capping a year in which we made significant progress on our strategic initiatives and drove meaningful non-GAAP operating margin expansion, despite a mixed economy.","As we near the 2-year anniversary of the launch of our design and creation suites, we couldn't be more pleased with their progress and growth. Revenue from Suites increased 50% over that 2-year period. Suites now represent 30% of total revenue, up from 23% just 2 years ago. We're delivering exceptional value to our customers, who get to utilize and experience more of our broad product portfolio. What's more, we have seen a meaningful increase in our ASPs. It's a win-win. Growth in our Suites help drive the record revenue results in both our AEC and Manufacturing business segments.","The investments we've made over the past couple of years in our major account direct sales continue to pay off. In the fourth quarter, we had a record 45 transactions that exceeded $1 million in value. This is up 25% year-on-year. Even more impressive is that the total value for these large deals increased 36% year-on-year. The list of these large transactions is diversified geographically and by industry. For FY '13, large deals increased by 18%. And we're seeing increasing involvement of our channel partners in these large transactions as well.","Our AEC business had record quarterly results. This was driven by strong large deal activity around the world and growth in AEC Suites. We attribute our strong growth in AEC Suites to the growing implementation of BIM across all disciplines of the AEC industry, including infrastructure. BIM 360 wins in Q4 were concentrated in construction, reflecting our leadership role in providing cloud and mobile technologies to that industry.","From a geographic perspective, Q4 revenue was driven by strong results in Asia-Pacific. Strong growth in Japan and China led APAC's results. EMEA had modest growth as reported, but was better on a constant currency basis. Results in EMEA were led by strong large deal activity in Northern Europe.","The Americas performance was uneven by country. Canada was strong, while the U.S. and Latin America declined. Large deal activity in the Americas at the end of the quarter was strong. I'll also note that a disproportionate piece of the meaningful backlog build this quarter was from the Americas.","Growth in China was strong. Outside of China, results in the emerging economies were disappointing. Emerging markets are typically choppier than mature markets. Some of this is currency-related, but we are also working through leadership changes in India and Brazil. We continue to believe revenue from emerging economies will be a growth driver for the company over time.","Usage and adoption of our cloud and mobile platform, Autodesk 360, continues to grow. Customers across a range of industries are taking advantage of the scalable computing power and flexibility provided through our cloud and mobile services. Autodesk continues to lead the industry in cloud and mobile applications for design and engineering with the introduction of new offerings. On the Manufacturing side, in just a few quarters, Autodesk PLM 360 has expanded to over 10,000 users. We're involved dozens of pilots and early deployments that are the seeds for the future. It's been an exciting and fast-moving first year for us in this space. Customers are giving us great feedback that this solution is dramatically easier to deploy and configure at a cost that is a fraction of legacy systems.","Fusion 360 was introduced during the fourth quarter as the world's first cloud-based 3D mechanical modeling and industrial design product. Fusion 360 allows design and engineering professionals to more easily create 3D product designs and collaborate with others in their supply chains, all while working online.","Simulation 360 is a powerful cloud-based simulation solution that we introduced last fall. Customers have used Simulation 360 to run more than 30,000 simulation jobs and are responding positively to the productivity gains, cost savings and the new business model.","Looking at Autodesk 360 across industries, we saw a significant jump in the number of cloud rendering jobs completed by our customers. More than 1 million jobs were completed in the last quarter alone, bringing our total rendering jobs to more than 2 million.","AutoCAD WS, one of our first and most popular cloud and mobile applications, has surpassed 11 million downloads. More than 2 million unique users now access WS each month.","We are very excited about the growth potential of cloud and mobile services. We are transforming the company in the way our customers utilize the cloud to get their jobs done. Starting later this year, you will see more rental and usage-based offerings from us. These offerings will be designed to give our customers even more flexibility in how they utilize our products and will provide us with new ways to capture new market opportunities.","These offerings are a significantly different model, and we expect adoption and consumption of our cloud and rental offerings to increase gradually over time. As such, we are not anticipating any significant changes to our core business model in FY '14.","We've also successfully brought mobility to personal design on the consumer side of our business. Autodesk 123 Design becomes the first mobile 3D modeling application enabling users to create sophisticated, precise 3D models on their tablet, Mac, PC or via their web browser.","We also debuted an Instructables mobile application, which provides users access to over 100,000 tutorials on do-it-yourself projects in technology, workshop, living and more. We recently surpassed the 50 million downloads mark for our mobile apps on Apple's App Store, which is truly amazing in just a few short years. While our consumer business revenue is very small relative to the rest of our business, it's growing rapidly. Bookings growth from advertisements in FY '13 grew more than 3x year-over-year.","Over the past few years, the vast majority of our cash balance was located offshore. In December, we addressed that structural issue by raising $750 million in our debt offering. We took advantage of historically low interest rates and our investment grade credit rating, securing cost-effective new capital that gives us significant financial flexibility. Uses of this capital could include M&A, continued share repurchases and general corporate purposes.","Looking back on FY '13, we accomplished a great deal, including launching our cloud platform, Autodesk 360, PLM 360, BIM 360 and Simulation 360. Sales of our design and creation suites continue to ramp, and we worked through a realignment of our entire organization to better serve our customers and drive future growth. We accomplished all of those things and more while achieving record non-GAAP operating margin dollars and EPS, as well as record billings and deferred revenue for the fiscal year. Overall, we believe our progress in each of these important initiatives positions us well as we enter FY '14.","Looking forward, the unevenness of the global environment keeps us somewhat cautious on near-term growth. For FY '14, we believe we can achieve revenue growth of approximately 6%. We continue to balance our ongoing spend management measures with making key investments in our strategic initiatives and expect to increase non-GAAP operating margin by 125 to 150 basis points.","As we look at the year, we expect a greater portion of the growth coming in the second half of the year. In the longer view, we remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver meaningful operating margin expansion.","And finally, I want to thank our great employees and partners for their outstanding efforts and contributions throughout the year. Though our results were uneven, we accomplished a great deal. We are well-positioned and excited by the future.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of Brent Thill.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, just on the guidance. You're coming off a fairly easy comp. And just curious to get the assumptions that are underpinning your 6% revenue guide, considering you have what would seem to be a pretty easy comp for the majority of the year.","Carl Bass","Yes, Brent, I think there are 2 things that are competing with each other as we thought about guidance for next year: On one hand, on the secular stuff, we're certainly seeing improvements. We look out there, and you see good indications in manufacturing and certainly strong indications in construction. Data points out there, not huge trends, but certainly good data points. And I feel like we turned a quarter in Q4.","On the other hand, there's no shortage of economic and political volatility. I just witnessed the news this morning, or the nonsense that's going to go on in Washington, leading up to Friday.","So I think we still have a little bit of nervousness, particularly in Europe and the Americas, about how the political situation is going to impact the economic situation. And really, what we wanted to do was kind of drive down the middle of the road, trying to balance those 2 things.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Just as a quick follow-up. The promo, did that create any pull forward? And just from a usage-based perspective, you said there's no big shift, but that was not factored into the 2014 guidance?","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. So Brent, let me talk a little bit about the supplemental upgrade pricing -- simplified upgrade pricing #2. It did have an effect of accelerating revenue into Q4. We talked about it being roughly $24 million out of the first half of FY '14. And so that is an effect that happens, and we planned on that. And it performed pretty much as we planned, a little bit better than we planned, but basically as we anticipated.","The thing to keep in mind on that, Brent, is also don't forget our backlog went up $18 million sequentially as well. So when you think about revenue, that's something to kind of consider.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions around licensing and pricing. The early revenues from the promo is not unprecedented. We've seen that many times in the past. But could you talk about how there might be some residual effect from the price increases for not only upgrades, but the price bump for subscriptions coming in March?","And also, clarification for you, Carl. You mentioned that ASPs went up, which is, of course, true for Suites versus standalone. But at least in the language of your filings, through the first 3 quarters of fiscal '13, had mentioned that net revenue per new license declined as did maintenance revenues per license did decline through the first 9 months of the year. So if you could clarify what you're seeing in terms of those price changes relative to performance earlier in the year?","Carl Bass","Okay. So let me see if I get -- let me work backwards. I mean, generally speaking, yes, we've seen a move from single products to Suites. Both the suite in a new license and the suite as in part of subscription carry higher ASPs. And that is performing according to plan. When we look forward and we -- when you look at the new year, absolutely, as we talked about, you're going to start feathering in some of the increased subscription prices that are in there. As a matter of fact, when you look at the growth in billings, a portion of that certainly has to do with subscription prices.","And then to kind of summarize of that Jay, I'll let Mark try to answer your parsing the fine language in our disclosures. But generally speaking, Suites are doing exactly what we intended. We're giving better value to our customers, they're getting to use more of our software, and we're enjoying higher prices for them.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. And so let me tag team with Carl on this one, Jay, and make sure we hit the mark on the various questions you asked. You talked about -- certainly, we've seen this before on a simplified upgrade pricing. You're exactly right. This is the second leg of what we've done there. We are pleased with the result. And I think in addition to the point that we talked out and called out, in terms of the $24 million impact approximately in Q4, I think you're right in saying that eventually, over longer periods of time, that will have an effect on revenue. And that's all factored and comprehended within the guidance of approximately 6% revenue growth that we've given. So there is residual benefits in the future. I agree with you on that, Jay. So what part of this did we not catch? Carl caught one part of it, I caught the other. Are there other questions remaining?","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","No, you touched on those. Just 2 quick follow-ups. With respect to sales and distribution, you did mention direct sales, but could you be a little bit more specific about how you've expanded your own direct coverage of named accounts and your commitment to invest in consulting services, for example, in connection with driving all the 360 businesses? And lastly, vis-\u00e0-vis rentals, you've been running an experiment on 90-day rentals for Max and Maya. When you talk about rentals later in the year, is that across the product line? And will you limit future rentals to 90-day terms or might they go longer?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I mean, a couple of things about the named account. When you really look at how we distribute, it's a continuum. On one end of the spectrum, we have Autodesk employees working with the customer directly in Autodesk fulfilling that business. The broad middle of our business is business that is done through our network of partners, where our partners sell and our partners fulfill. In the middle, there's a handful of ones in which we cooperate closely with our partners to work with medium- to large-sized customers. What I said in the remarks were, one is, we saw a lot of activity in named accounts. By far, that's the biggest quarter ever in terms of that. And that's just a result of more coverage, just having more feet on the street selling directly to customers. But I was especially pleased that many of those very large deals were actually being done in coordination with our partners. I think what we do ourselves is we open up markets and small ecosystems, networks within companies, but it's really nice to see our partners taking place in that.","On the second one about rentals, you have -- we've been building the back-office infrastructure to support rentals and shorter-term licensing models. It's one of the things we think is important if you look at our customer base in many industries. It's actually project-based rather than annual or multiyear. People ramp up for a period of time and then they want to ramp down. What we look to do is offer more flexibility to customers. 90 days is something we chose to go out there and pilot. What I'd say is, the results have been very promising. And we will limit ourselves to just those 2 products or to the 90 days. More details to follow as we roll it out during the middle of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could talk, either Mark or Carl, about how you're thinking about margins? I guess, if we back out the $24 million that you referenced from the promotion in Q4, it looks like you're kind of guiding to normal revenue seasonality in Q1. But the margins do seem to be taking a pretty big dip down in Q1, only to ramp back pretty significantly in the back half of the year. Can you talk to us about what's going on, on the expense line in Q1 and how we should expect that to trend?","Mark  Hawkins","Sure, Heather, happy to do so. I think you've got the big picture in terms of the $24 million normalization largely in the first half and certainly impactful in Q1. One of the things we looked at is understanding, putting that aside and also running the business and making sure that we're going to have a good game plan that delivers the approximately 125 to 150 basis points of operating margin for the year. We did talk about the fact that revenue seasonality is going to be slightly different in the first half versus the second half, almost by definition of what we're talking about for Q1. And that would relate slightly to the profitability as well.","So we've kept -- I think you can see, Heather. This quarter, we delivered 0% growth year-on-year in Q4 in terms of operating expense. We did 1% in terms of total spend. We got a tight handle on spend. And at the same time, we need to run the business. We need to invest in cloud and things like that, that are going to prepare us, but this is all part of delivering the 125 to 150 margin expansion. Carl?","Carl Bass","We always have certain expenses in Q1. Seasonality is a little bit off this time, not much, but when we looked at it, there were just a bunch of expenses that we noted in Q1, there were onetime things or that are annual recurring onetime things. And when we looked at it, that's just the way the numbers played out. Actually, making any dramatic change, we didn't feel was the right judgment to make at this point. We would have had to go to kind of extraordinary measures to even it out more, and it didn't feel like it was worthwhile. And we have confidence about, as we have shown before, of delivering those margins in the subsequent 3 quarters.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then if I could just ask a follow-up for the federal business in particular, the U.S. federal business for your current quarter, the April quarter, kind of how are you thinking about -- what are your expectations, given everything that's going on in Washington? Can you give us a sense for what you're expecting for that segment this quarter and kind of what you've seen in the federal vertical thus far?","Carl Bass","Only if you can tell me what you've seen. Yes, I mean, we don't know what the heck to make out of the sequester and how that's -- I mean, I think this is unknown territory for everybody. And we saw nothing extraordinary in Q4. Our federal business was not special. We didn't see a lot of people spending ahead of it. So it seemed kind of normal all the way up to today, it seems kind of normal. But I think we're all in unchartered territory.","I think, though, is one of the things that gave us a little pause as we were giving guidance for not only the quarter but for the year is, what effect are these things really going to have. On one hand, you see the sequestration. On the other hand, you see all this movement about infrastructure build and the President being very committed to do that. And so I think they're kind of a wash, and we haven't done a lot of forecasting down to the segment level.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I'm curious in terms of how the guidance for the year -- you commented more back-end loaded. How much of that is macro versus some of the pricing and rental changes that you plan on rolling out?","Mark  Hawkins","My view on this one, a couple of things here, Sterling: One is the pricing discussion that we had just earlier with Heather, I think she absolutely nailed it. I think the $24 million, you kind of take that out of the first half. It was accelerated into Q4. We understand that. The good news in Q4 is we build backlog to a degree. I think when you look at the rental, it's not going to have a material impact on our business model for the year. It actually serves a new market opportunity for us. And we'll continue to do that exactly as Carl described and keep reporting out on that.","So I think the other thing to keep in mind, the third point, is as you know, the second half of the year is a easier compare for us, compared to Q1 last year was 11% growth year-on-year. The second half is a much easier compare and we'll also have a dynamic. I guess the last point that I would say is, we're pleased with the momentum that we've been gathering within our go-to-market team. And we think we'll be able to harvest even more of the business by the time we get to the second half. So those are the thoughts there, Sterling.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And do you think that the rental is not an impact on the business model because it's rental and not usage-based, and that's why it goes after a different part of the market or maybe put another way, would you anticipate as you evolve to add more usage-based pricing and when would you anticipate maybe kind of following like Adobe and some others where you go to a predominantly subscription or usage-based model?","Carl Bass","Yes. So on the first more immediate concern, I think -- I mean, one of my things about is I think the take-up will just be slow. We've seen that historically. When we make more new offerings, it takes a while for them to gather steam. I don't think this will be any different.","Second thing is, I think some fraction of this is actually coming from people who didn't actually pay for our software. There is certainly some legitimate use that's transforming into rental use, but a fair amount of that is, there are illegal ways of having rental models right now. And so I think in some ways -- we're actually tapping into that. People who really do want to pay for it but haven't availed themselves of that opportunity before.","Just in general, you will see us -- similar to Adobe and others, when you look not only at our cloud-based offerings, but at our desktop offerings, offering more subscription-based things. We've been building that program for almost 10 years now. It's gotten to be a substantial part of our business. What we laid out last quarter was how we were going to take some of the desktop offerings and combine them with the cloud offerings. But I think over time, it's really fair to say that you'll see a lot more of our stuff coming from term-based [ph] offerings.","Mark  Hawkins","I think Carl's point was -- is really helpful to you, Sterling. It took 9 to 10 years to get it to the point where we're at right now. We all saw -- seen 2D to 3D transition and such. The end-user market picks up a little bit slower, but I think it adds a lot of credence to Carl's point.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Steve Ashley.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. I'd just like to ask about the domestic commercial construction business. You're probably aware, we've seen some encouraging data points from the ABI data. Just wondering what your take is on the health or probability of a -- seeing a cyclical recovery domestically in commercial construction during calendar '13?","Carl Bass","Yes, Steve. I would say, we're seeing the same thing that you are. Certainly, some of the indicators are up. We're also anecdotally hearing that pipelines are growing. That hiring is starting. So I mean, we're seeing good signs, and I tried to refer to those earlier in my remarks that both in manufacturing and in commercial construction, particularly in the U.S., we're seeing good signs. I don't think we're out of the woods yet. The optimism I hear from our customers is just tempered somewhat by the stupidity I see by our politicians.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Good. And then a couple of quarters ago, you talked about some internal challenges during the sales transition in India, Brazil and Central Europe. Maybe you could update us on where you stand in transitioning some of those folks.","Carl Bass","Yes, yes, so I mean, we're continuing, we have new people in place, they're building out teams. Generally speaking, it takes a couple of quarters for people to get up and ramped up. So I'm happy with the changes we made, happy with the people we have in place. And I expect better performance out of the emerging countries this year.","Mark  Hawkins","Just to add to Carl, Central Europe, we had a really solid performance in Central Europe.","Carl Bass","Yes, yes, we had talked about Central Europe. We had talked about China. China had a good quarter. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","My questions have been asked.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss.","Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Melissa Gorham calling for Keith. My question is around EMA. You saw a nice improvement in growth in the quarter. Just wondering if you could maybe give some more color on how much that was related to the benefit from the promotional activity versus maybe the macro stabilizing versus maybe better adoption of Suites or just any color on what was going on there.","Carl Bass","It's a great question, Melissa. I think the truth is, I don't think we can precisely pinpoint what went on. You've identified a number of the factors. We saw stabilization and improvement from our own execution, both in our organization as well as some of the stuff we've done in emerging countries. We're starting to see improvement in -- some of the secular improvement in end-user markets. The promotion help was offset a little bit by the build in backlog. But we certainly saw willingness of customers when sufficiently motivated to buy more product.","So we saw a lot of good signs. It's really difficult to know for certain the contribution from each of those, but those were all positive things we saw during the quarter.","Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on your debt offering. Are there any changes in how you're thinking about capital allocation, particularly around share buybacks? I noticed that the number of shares that were repurchased in the quarter down ticked quarter-on-quarter. So just wondering if we should expect to see that pick up?","Mark  Hawkins","Yes.","Carl Bass","Yes, let me just say one thing and then Mark can jump in. We actually have talked about increasing the share buyback, and we talked in great detail a number of times about this. This quarter, our purchases were held down by the fact we were actually doing the debt offering, and so we couldn't be in the market for a long period of time. I expect that will rebound in the subsequent quarters. But there was a onetime thing of actually being in the market with an offering. Mark, you want to...","Mark  Hawkins","That's exactly what I would have added, exactly. Well, you can just expect us to continue to over the long term take shares out as communicated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard.","Kenneth Wong","This is Ken Wong for Walter. Kind of building on Heather's question, based on the trajectory that you guys are talking about in terms of the margins, do you guys still feel comfortable with the 30% margin target that you guys laid out there for fiscal year '15?","Carl Bass","Yes, a lot depends -- we're kind of 2 years away. We always talked about an exit rate coming out of FY '15. So we look out there and say, we're making good steady progress, particularly pleased with low revenue growth this year that we were able to have such good operating margin expansion. The probability of us exiting FY '15 at 30% goes down unless the macro environment improves. So if we had 2 more years of a lousy economy, I think it's doubtful. To the extent that it doesn't happen, we will still aim for it in FY '16. So it may be slowed down a little bit by the overall macro, but our commitment to expanding margins remains the same.   Slightly difficult against the growth that we saw this year.","Kenneth Wong","Of course, of course, that's helpful. And Mark, on the DSOs, looks like they jumped up a lot to 74 days. Can you perhaps elaborate a little bit on that? Is it just the back-end loaded quarter? Or...","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. So -- it's a great question there, Ken. Two things, one is, as Carl called out, kind of record deals. Our deals were up -- our big deals were up 25%. They came in at the end of the quarter. And I might add that not only did they come in and we shipped, but we also put a lot in backlog as well, but the ones that came in obviously go right into receivable with no chance to collect yet. So the nonlinearity, the back-end linearity of the timing of the business basically contributed to that.","The second thing I would add to that, that also amplified the shift in linearity, had to do with when we did this simplified upgrade pricing promo. Again, by definition, that gets driven toward the end of the quarter. So as that came in, our billings came in late, too. So those 2 effects can amplify the linearity shift. We had a disproportionate amount in the third month of the quarter. I want to call out to you one important point: our receivables look excellent. The timeliness and the currency of the receivables look excellent. This is purely a linearity shift.","Kenneth Wong","So we should expect the DSOs to kind of trend back down over the coming quarters?","Mark  Hawkins","You should expect that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So like over the -- it looks like over the last 3 quarters, you've made about $260 million, $263 million of acquisitions. So if I kind of do the math, I'm not -- I don't know how much you paid for all these companies, but some of the revenues would fall into last year, but some of it will fall into this year, of the 6% -- 6% to 7% revenue growth, is it -- am I close figuring maybe 1\/4, so 2% or 1.5% of that is inorganic, so that the underlying organic growth is, I don't know, 4% or 5% or something like that, is that a logical conclusion?","Carl Bass","No, I would say, Richard, it's closer to 1%. And given the number -- I mean, we -- so as we look at the year, there are a number of shifts going on in the business. Things that are coming out of the business. And on the plus side, I would say it's not even quite 1%. Most of the acquisitions we tend to do are these small tuck-ins. We're more positioning for the future. So when you look at it, for example, one of the acquisitions was the backbone for all of our social stuff. There were a couple of mobile acquisitions. There were a number in simulation that were really technologies. They'll get folded in. That's more typical of the way we do it. As you know, you've been following us, much more so in very few of the cases have we actually bought real revenue streams.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it. Okay. That makes sense. I just wasn't sure what the ratios were, so that's helpful.","Carl Bass","It's really relatively small and in many cases, it's hard to parse even for us. For example, we make a Simulation 360 offering. It's a combination of stuff that we've acquired over -- acquired and built over a period of years. And truthfully, we don't spend huge amounts of time trying to dissect it because it's a fruitless exercise at some point. We try to look in aggregate at the benefit that we get from the investments in M&A.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Ross MacMillan.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Maybe first one, Mark, just going back to operating expenses. I guess my question is, I hear you on the revenue ramp through the year, but I think the way to model this would imply that there's not a lot of OpEx growth after Q1 as we move subsequently through the year. And I'm just trying to understand on that basis, is there any sort of front-end loading of the OpEx this year beyond normal sort of 1Q seasonal, call it, onetime items? Is there any other aspects to the operating expenses that mean they're higher going into the year?","Mark  Hawkins","Not really. I mean, I would say -- I mean -- for the most part, our seasonality is not that terribly different. There's a little bit of a degree, some of the things that Carl touched on, just a few things here and there, but nothing dramatically different.","Carl Bass","No. The only other thing I would do to try to understand this, Ross, is that this year, we're coming off about 2% OpEx growth. So rather than ramping into it, we're kind of fully loaded at the end of the year. And so when you look off that, many years, when you look at the model, we're coming off years in which we've ramped up over time. This one, we only grew operating expenses about 2%. So that lends a different dynamic to the model.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Two other questions, if I could. Is it possible that you will get to a point where you will -- help us with the aspects of this transition of the model so that we can better gauge if there's any sort of immediate revenue sort of deflationary aspects, either based on usage licenses or more of the cloud offerings? Just trying to understand if there's going to be a point where your business would have otherwise grown faster as a result of some of the transitions, and what you might help us understand the kind of underlying nature of growth to be?","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, I think that -- and Vic [ph] may take a shot and Carl might add in here. I think, Ross, from that standpoint, to the extent that things become material other than, for example, there were experiments and pilots and initial very controlled activities going on, when they become material, you'll certainly hear from us well in advance from that standpoint. I think Carl had called out with all the experience that a lot of the offerings that we have take time to build momentum, not because we don't want to sell them, it's because the way the end market actually works, and the way people apply the technology. So that certainly would be something on our mind to be in front of that communication whenever something is material.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then last one, just on the direct business, is that getting to a point where it's now breaking out beyond that sort of normal 15% of annual sales?","Carl Bass","No, it's not really changing substantially. Just because the other part has grown -- I mean, look, it's a little -- it's grown a little bit faster than the rest of the business. And we'll break it down for you further. But we're also working hard as we do that to make sure our partners are involved in many of the large deals. For us, the most important thing is cracking into the very large accounts, where we've always believed our technology was applicable, but we didn't have a way to go to market. That's the most important part of this for us. It's not breaking it down between direct and indirect. It's really just access to customers who we believe are best served by our products and that historically have underutilized our technology. That's the real thing we're trying to accomplish. But we will continue to give you updates on the breakdown between direct and indirect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Carl, your comments about the politicians was very vague and ambiguous. I just wanted to clarify -- I'm just kidding, that's not my real question. My question was, when you look at Adobe and the big model transition that they're embarking on, I just wonder if you guys have thought about that? Would you take steps to accelerate the transition? Obviously, cloud and mobile and recurring revenues are big opportunities for you guys. But why not just bite the bullet and just offer subscriptions on a go-forward basis across the base and do what Adobe did? You get a short amount of pain in a very brief period of time, then your growth rate starts to pick up and you get the advantage of recurring revenues. I'm just wondering what you thought about the pros and cons of making that wholesale approach. And I have one you, Mr. Hawkins.","Carl Bass","Okay. So to your first point, I have 2 teenage sons, and I expect them to act like knuckleheads. I don't expect members of Congress to act like knuckleheads, but they're acting more like my teenage boys than they should.","On your second question, Kash, we've looked at Adobe a lot. I'd say, let's just step back a second and kind of see the difference. I think in many ways, us and Adobe are trying to get to the exact same point. There's the short side of the -- so if we're at a rectangle and we're trying to get to the diagonal corner, there's the short side and the long side, and one of us took the short and then the long and vice versa. I think they've done a remarkable job on getting their offerings ready with the Creative Cloud and done a nice job of moving their business model there. We've taken a little bit of the long leg and changed our offerings to be cloud-based. I assume in the end, we will both have term-based business models with cloud-based and mobile-based offerings. I think that's the inevitable end game for all of us. So we've done what I consider to be a really good job in getting our cloud-based offerings out there. They're very successful in the market. What I expect us to do this year is do stuff similar to Adobe in terms of the business model. And you'll see a lot more of that during the year. As we gauge the success in our customer base, which is similar, but certainly not identical to the Adobe customer base. We're in larger companies and larger deployments. We'll see what the take-up is there and we'll react to it. I have not ruled out accelerating that if it made sense. And as Mark previously said, we'll give you guys plenty of warning if we're going to kind of step on the gas around that. We -- like we've done repeatedly, we generally go out and test these things. If you remember, like what we did with Suites, a couple of years ago, we started with a couple of very limited tests. They were limited by product, limited geographically. We're doing the same thing this time, limited terms, limited things. To the extent they're successful, we'll roll them out, and if it makes sense, we'll go full speed ahead.","Kash G. Rangan - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Mark, a question for you. The shippable backlog increased sequentially very nicely. And also, on a year-over-year basis, seems to have come down a little bit. I would have probably expected an upward trajectory on a year-over-year basis, can you talk to the puts and takes of the backlog on a year-over-year basis? And why it's driving [ph].","Mark  Hawkins","I think you described it well, Kash. I think it's up $18 million quarter-on-quarter, slightly down year-over-year, $20 million versus $27 million. I think, keep in mind, I think as we modernized our fulfillment and stuff, we expected our backlog would probably operating in a slightly lower zone. One of the dynamics that happened with the major big deals that came in is they came in late, they came in big. And I think that caused our backlog to be bigger than we would have really envisioned it in the current period. And so you should expect that to go down over time, much like we've signaled before. So we're pleased to see it. It was a nice outcome. It was an outcome of a really strong response in our direct business, as Carl talked about, including collaboration with our indirect helping us there and the promos. But you should expect that to be down to more normal levels in kind of the new environment going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Philip Winslow.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Carl, I'm just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more on a vertical basis. You've provided some commentary in the U.S. on commercial and construction and on manufacturing. But as you were kind of contemplating your Q1 guidance and then this coming fiscal year, just kind of how you factored in the relative strength and weakness in the various verticals?","Carl Bass","Yes. So let me just break it down both ways. On verticals, we're definitely seeing manufacturing. Manufacturing has rumbled through this recovery. It's been relatively strong all along. Manufacturing continues to do well. We see some variation on a global basis, but not a huge amount of it. Clearly, the construction market went down the most. It was the most volatile. We see improving -- we see signs of improvement around the world in the construction market. Some of it's driven, I think, by improving macroeconomics. Some of it is, as we've diversified our offerings into more parts, we talked about BIM for infrastructure. We talked about more sales into construction rather than just architecture and engineering. That's a secular factor that's adding into this. When you look at it and break it down a little bit geographically, what we continue to see are: Asia was really strong, even if somewhat uneven. It was strong with particular and unexpected strength in places like Japan. When we look at Europe, from north to south, I think this is not different than anyone's seen. Good strength in the north, average performance in Central Europe and it's weak in Europe. And we're not forecasting any difference there. We talked about uneven performance in our emerging economies. And we're looking for improvement in some of the places where we've made changes to effect that, but we're constantly aware that those are -- have greater variance just naturally. And we think the U.S. as everyone has seen, is recovering but slowly. So hopefully, that cross-section helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, what percent of the installed base do you think has moved to Suites? And what percent do you think have upgraded to BIM?","Carl Bass","Those are good questions. I mean, what we reported is 30% of our revenue is coming from Suites. So if you just took -- if you took your question at face value of what -- who's on it and what are they paying for, the answer is 30%. I think that probably overstates the number that have moved because there are people, as always have been, who are a couple of releases behind. We've made it very attractive, so when they do move, they will move to Suites more likely than to individual products, although they have their -- certainly, they have their choice. So I think the 30% probably overstates the movement there.","When you get to BIM, really, much harder to tell because in some ways, BIM is both a set of products, but it's also a methodology that these companies use. We certainly have crossed the tipping point in terms of -- I would say on a worldwide basis, there is no reluctance, no resistance to BIM being the new technology for how to drive more efficiency in the building process. It's -- like we've said a couple of times, the concept of BIM has really been extended to more parts of the construction process, including construction itself.","So those are all good signs. So I say, while I would have felt we were kind of reaching the majority in architecture and engineering, as the market opens up to construction, we're probably falling back in our penetration because the market has opened up. There are many more opportunities for us to bring BIM into the much bigger part of the market, which is the construction part.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then Mark, I just wanted to follow-up on margins in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. Were they impacted at all by the simplified pricing and the larger deals at the end of the quarter?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, I think a couple of things here from that standpoint, Brendan. The $24 million of revenue that was accelerated in certainly had a favorable effect. Keep in mind, we sequentially build our backlog by $18 million. So most of that went into backlog, if you think about it from that standpoint in terms of a net effect.","I think the other thing that we did is, if you look at our total billings growth was 9%. And so that was a good thing. And you can see that as you look at our deferred revenue hit a record $835 million, up 16% year-on-year. One of the effects of that is that we paid for some commissions for some of the stuff that came and that was billed, but that didn't show up in revenue yet. So I think those were some of the effects that impacted it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","It sounded like in the quarter, you had good strong results from China, made some leadership changes in Brazil and India. I guess I'm wondering, from a 4-year perspective in your guide, are you sort of assuming more of the same there? Maybe a rebound in the back half of the year from some of the leadership changes, but a good strong year from China?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, we're really assuming kind of business slightly improving to the extent that Brazil, India, Russia outperformed. That would be upside to what we're forecasting right now. We tend not to want to get too far in front of ourselves and assuming that changes we made will pay off until we've actually seen them. We're certainly confident in making those decisions, but we don't go so far as to forecast improvements that we haven't seen evidence of yet.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then one point of clarification for you, Mark. In terms of the $24 million promotional rev, how much of that was actually in guidance?","Mark  Hawkins","Most of that was in guidance, Matt. It was the vast majority of it. It was a little bit of the upside delighted us. It came in a little bit stronger, but the vast preponderance of that was within guidance.   It's just nice to see the execution and people responding to the value.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","If I may, I'd like to ask just one sort of tactical question and then just follow-up with one strategic sort of question. On the tactical side, you all haven't talked much about, in this call, about kind of having put the problems created by the sales reorg in Q1 and then your channel policies Q1 a year ago behind you. The results speak to the idea that you have. But I wanted to offer you guys a chance to comment on that. And specifically, I was curious, where do you feel about your progress in rebuilding your pipeline that had become somewhat hollowed out because of those changes? How do they look to you now? And related to that as well, I'd ask, how are you doing in terms of getting your AEC resellers and your Manufacturing resellers to work together and bringing in the best person to sell a deal instead of competing with one another? So just any thoughts there and then I have one quick follow-up.","Carl Bass","Yes. So I would say, we're certainly feeling like we've seen improvement. If the worst of it was in Q2, we saw steady improvement. As we look at the planning and forecasting for next year, that's getting sales quotas and compensation in place for our sales force, we're in a much stronger place than we've ever been. We've also worked really closely with our resellers to modify some of the things that upset them and -- or better explain the things that may have upset them, but we still think were the right things. So we've worked closely with them to make sure that we're better aligned. So I feel better -- I feel much better about our relationship with our resellers heading in. And I have substantial evidence on the inside that things are much better in place than they were last year. There are a lot of moving pieces at this time last year. And this year, I feel like it's much more nailed down.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you feel like those issues are pretty much behind you now?","Carl Bass","I sure hope so.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, all right. I think we all do so. Okay. And then my follow-up question, a little bit more on the strategy side. You have gotten a bunch of questions on this call on the move to more subscription-based or rental-based offerings. And you've been pretty clear that you don't expect much, if any, near-term revenue from that. What I'm curious about is, as you make more progress in that product transition and ultimately a business model transition potentially, how much can subscriptions get to in the mix? And kind of the other part of the question is, what are the implications for your channel in this shift?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I would say 2 things about that: The first one is, I mean, in the limit, we can get pretty close to subscriptions being the vast majority of our business. And I'm using the word subscriptions here really in 2 senses: Subscription as we know it today, plus the subscription for term-based offerings. So if you think forward or us we talked about with what Adobe is doing in calling subscription, if you think of that, the majority of our business could -- the vast majority will come from subscriptions. I think that's the nature of where the business is going. What we've tempered it with hopefully all afternoon is saying, we don't expect this to happen too suddenly. To the extent that our customers respond well to this, we may try to accelerate that transition. But we see that as the direction we're headed is in terms of long term subscription relationship, so a long-term relationship with our customers that has all of those characteristics.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And Carl, what -- can you just comment on the -- what are the implications for your channel in this transition?","Carl Bass","Yes, I continue to believe that there are 2 transitions going on: One is the way that people pay for it, and the second is the way the software is delivered. In both of those, I continue to believe that the channel plays an important and vital role going forward. I know there's a lot been written and speculated about this. But if you look out there, in companies that have subscription-based, cloud-based business models, what I see increasingly is greater reliance on a third-party channel. Even ones who started out all direct are recognizing that the benefits of the channel in terms of reach and service are the same, whether you deliver the software by a box or by the Internet. It really makes very little difference. And so I can -- and our resellers get paid on subscription as they do on new licenses. So I continue imagining a world in which resellers play an important role. The only thing that -- like we've said, we're going to continue investing in our direct accounts as long as it continues to make sense and opens up new business for both us and our partners.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Blair Abernethy.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Carl, I just wonder if you could give us a little bit more color on the take-up of the hosted PLM service and maybe a little more background on sort of the size of customer accounts or any industries that maybe you're getting more strength in than others?","Carl Bass","Yes. So we've gotten remarkable progress. Remember, we launched this on February 29. So we're not even 1 year into this. And what we've seen is a fantastic reception by customers. As I've said before, quite publicly, I think some of it is the result of a really quality product offering from us. Some of it is a result of some really terrible product offerings by the legacy providers. Behind the firewall, old iron, multi-tens of millions implementations really are dinosaurs and people are recognizing that.","When we've looked, what we've seen is -- a couple -- less particular industries and more some characteristics. And the 2 characteristics I see most commonly, people who are in fast-moving industries, where there's a premium on getting product to market and where we've been brought in is to accelerate processes that they see as impediments to getting high quality product to market more quickly. That seems to be the defining characteristic. We've seen a good cross-section from small to large, although I'd say in small companies, we tend to be used as the only PLM system in which they look and they say, \"We always wanted PLM, but we couldn't afford it. We know we needed it and we're brought in there.\" In large companies, it's more often to fill in the gaps into places where companies have chosen or cannot afford to take their old monolithic system or the process is so dynamic and they want to get moving quickly on it. So in those cases, we're more a supplement.","The replacements of existing PLM systems have mostly happened in the small to medium ones. So a lot of places, we're sitting alongside existing PLM systems. In other ones, we're clearly seat for seat replacing them. We'll give you more as we update this. We said we have about 10,000 seats out there. But many of these are pilots. They've already expanded once or twice, but they are nowhere near what I think the eventual size of the implementations will be. Hopefully, that gives you some more color on it.","Blair H. Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's great. If I could just follow up, Ross' question on the direct sales reps. What's the capacity looking like there in terms of feet on the street that you have today at the end of fiscal '13? And what are your plans? Are you adding bodies this year?","Carl Bass","Yes, we will be adding bodies this year. I would say in a targeted way. And the 2 places where we're really interesting, there are specific countries where we feel like the model has proven itself quite well, and it's proved itself not to be cannibalistic relative to our other business. So there were certain countries in the world where we're definitely light in terms of the new number of direct salespeople. And there are a number of places, particularly in selling into construction, the PLM business, we just talked about the simulation business where I think we need more direct sales there, too.","So those are the kind of places. I don't think we'll try to upset the applecart in terms of the other places, where our business is doing well and rebounding, and I don't want to interject more disruption there. But in a number of those very specific places, I think it could really help. And we could see a substantial increase in the number of feet on the street.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Dan Cummins.","Daniel T. Cummins - B. Riley & Co., LLC, Research Division","Can you tell me -- tell us how much visibility you guys have into use cases with respect to specific Revit deployments regarding, let's say, a building start versus a retrofit or a rehab? And a follow-on to that is, do you think that your partnering or your M&A strategy or your government relationships affect your ability to tap faster or more broadly into green retrofit? How big an opportunity is green retrofit for Autodesk in the next couple of years?","Carl Bass","Yes. So it's very hard to tell from Revit deployments per se because Revit is a desktop piece of software. So we don't always know what it's used for. From some of our other offerings, like our BIM 360 offering, the online project collaboration, we know a little bit more and certainly from our large customers, we know more about what the usage of it is. I think with -- during the downturn, there was a fair amount of refurbishment and renovation. What's going to happen in the next couple of years is mandates around sustainable building. We've seen stuff starting with the GSA in the United States. On a worldwide basis, governments are adopting new standards that we think are really important. So first, it was just the adoption of BIM as a better technology for governments to get more for their money. Secondly, we're starting to see specific mandates around building performance. I think both of those things will drive it. Some of them are a little bit far out when they first initiated or legislated. They gave people like time to 2016 or 2020. But those aren't so far out anymore. And I think we'll see a pretty good business. We've done a number of things in our product development process to accommodate doing much more for refurbishment and renovation. And we've done a fair amount in terms of building performance in energy analysis for our building professionals. So I think it'll be a good thing. I'm not sure it'll will be dramatically different this year than next year. But if you look over a few number of years, I think it will.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of this call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2014, long-term financial objectives, including billings and recurring revenue growth, factors we use to estimate our guidance, new business model introductions, new product and suite releases, market adoption and expected growth rates, cost management efforts, hiring plans, business execution, business prospect and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our rental license offering plans, our transition to cloud and mobile computing, our educational vertical strategy, trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially.","Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2013, Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30 and July 31, 2013 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the 8-K filed on today -- with today's press release and prepared remarks.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results were driven by strength in our core AEC and Manufacturing segments, as well as continued strong adoption of our suites. I'm pleased with the results despite the negative impact on revenue, on currency headwinds, the change we're making in our education vertical and the impact from the U.S. government shutdown. Considering these factors, I feel good about how we finished the quarter.","Our AEC business continues to perform well, driven by what looks to be a broad-based recovery in the commercial construction market. As we highlighted at our Investor Day last month, the construction vertical represents a significant opportunity, and we continue to gain momentum in that market. We also continue to broaden our BIM portfolio. Last quarter, we closed a couple of small acquisitions, bringing our BIM tools that further are -- that further support our infrastructure projects. We're also pleased with the adoption and usage of BIM 360. The anecdotal feedback we hear from our construction industry customers suggests it is the dawn of a new area in construction technology.","Our highlight for the quarter was that we signed our biggest ever BIM 360 enterprise agreement worth over $1.5 million. This existing customer renewed its agreement with Autodesk for about 20% more in total billings than their previous contract. They will deploy BIM 360 as part of their strategic goal to transform their business and increase their competitive advantage. This is exactly the type of transaction that supports our long-term growth assumptions. We've only scratched the surface of the construction industry, and we're well-positioned to tap further into that $7 trillion market.","Our Manufacturing business had solid results. Once again, we built on our momentum in the automotive segment and extended that success to the automotive supply chain. Areas of strength included rapid adoption of our manufacturing suites, as well as our industrial design, visualization and simulation technology. Our 100% cloud-based PLM 360 had its strongest quarter yet as it gained momentum with small- and medium-size businesses in industrial machinery, automotive and high tech. These companies share common process challenges around the supply chain, engineering chains and quality management. For instance, PLM 360 was selected over traditional PLM offerings by a Midwestern manufacturer for its functionality and superior ROI. This customer has grown to represent several hundred thousand dollars in PLM 360 billings to date.","While it's early, we're also seeing encouraging usage of Fusion 360, the world's first cloud-based software for industrial and mechanical design. Since its launch just a few months ago, there are now over 20,000 users. Our Fusion 360 customers are doing some amazing things from making lightweight drones to 3D-printed violins.","For most of Autodesk's history, we've been a leader in technology for design and left the work and technical challenge of fabrication and manufacturing to other providers. While we have collaborated closely and partnered with many of these companies, we have long believed we would provide greater value to manufacturers and we could streamline their workflows. With this in mind, we enter the CAM market last year with the acquisition of technology and expertise from HSMWorks. Earlier this month, we embarked on the next step on our path toward a better manufacturing process by making an offer to acquire Delcam, the industry's leading CAM technology and brand. We see a significant opportunity given Delcam's technological expertise, strong market presence and sterling brand. The combination of the companies is a significant step forward and what we hope will increase productivities for customers of both companies. As an added benefit, we will be utilizing our foreign-based cash for this transaction. We currently expect the transaction to close early in our fiscal year 2015, after which, we'll be able to speak more freely about our integration plans.","Another area to highlight during our third quarter results is the continued strength in adoption of our suites, which grew 21% and now represent 36% of total revenue. Growth was led by exceptional strength in our AEC suites. As we discussed last month at our Investor Day, users of our suites have high maintenance subscription attach and renewal rates, which supports our long-term goal of generating 20% more value with our subscription customers. Our strength in suites came partly at the expense of our volume channel products, AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT. While we did see improvement with these products in EMEA, it will likely take a few quarters to rekindle growth in this area.","From a geographic perspective, performance was solid. EMEA and APAC had solid growth on a constant currency basis. Our performance in the Americas was better than it appears for the reasons I mentioned earlier, especially in the U.S., where changes we're making in the educational vertical and the U.S. government shutdown had its biggest impact. Normalizing for these things, revenue in the Americas increased year-over-year. It was also great to see revenue from emerging economies return to growth, with all of the BRIC countries growing on a constant currency basis.","Just a couple of months ago, we announced the availability of most of our core products as rentals. Our customers wanted more choices and flexibility in how they access our portfolio of design, engineering and entertainment creation tools. We expect rental plans to be attractive across all of the industries we serve, especially for freelancers, start-ups or businesses that are project-based in nature. While it's very early, we're encouraged to see that many of the rental customers are new to Autodesk, which, once again, supports our long-term growth and model assumptions.","As we outlined at our Investor Day last month, the addition of recurring revenue streams coming from rental, cloud and consumption-based usage will significantly increase, making for a more predictable business [indiscernible]. We'll begin to see the transition start this quarter as we anticipate approximately $50 million of enterprise license revenue will move to the balance sheet. We anticipate a larger impact from the model transition in fiscal year 2015 and plan to provide you with more details when we release our fourth quarter financial results in February. We're excited to move forward on this business model transition and give our customers even more flexibility to utilize our products. We'll discuss this and more with thousands of our customers at Autodesk University in just a couple of weeks.","Over the past few weeks, I've spent time with our customers and partners in both EMEA and APAC. While the global economic environment remains uneven, it does feel as if things are beginning to improve. We know that our technological leadership and global brand recognition have positioned us well for long-term growth and industry leadership. It's not just the business model that is changing. We're expanding the markets we address and increasing the ways in which customers can access and use our products. It's an exciting time for Autodesk, and we look forward to reporting on our progress along the way.","Operator, we'd now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Carl, I had 2. You mentioned that most of the customers for the new offerings are new to Autodesk, which is great. I'm wondering if you could share with us what the initial thoughts are from your existing customers about the new offering. And then secondly, how do you think the decision to do away with upgrade pricing a little more than a year from now will impact people wanting to kind of buy a boxed product one last time at a discounted rate next year?","Carl Bass","Yes. Sure, Heather. So 2 things is we were really encouraged. We did believe that a lot of the people who would end up wanting to rent software would be new to Autodesk. That's what we saw. Obviously, there were some of them who were existing customers. I think it falls into that category of some people doing it just to meet peak demand loading, which would be existing customers. Others are doing it as freelancers or on a project basis. So I think they were both usage cases in there. And so like we said, it's pretty early, but we didn't see anything that was outside what we kind of predicted happening in the model from the first results. What I see happening is a result of us kind of preannouncing the elimination of upgrades, and this has been confirmed by all the resellers I've spoken with. I think what we expect to see is probably more people moving to subscription rather than buying one last time. The tendency will be to buy and then protect their investment rather than just to buy and know that investment, they need to -- they may need to buy a full new copy.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just to be clear, do you think they'll buy a boxed product and attach maintenance to it? Or will they just say, \"You know what, I'm going to skip that and just go to the rental offering?\"","Carl Bass","I think it will be predominant -- I think it will be predominantly, one, and have fewer amount, number two. But we'll start telling you as we figure it out. But my instincts and experience in this business would tell you more, number one, and I would say 10% to 20% in the number two.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about your comments about modest improvements in some of the customer behavior and give us a sense of how that's trending. We've heard, obviously, the opposite from some of the other technology vendors. So if you could maybe talk about the sustainability of that a couple quarters out. And then, Mark, just a quick question on deferred revenue. I believe that the sequential decline is just a seasonal change. There's nothing else to read in there on the DR.","Carl Bass","Yes. No, Brent, our customers always behave well. But what we started to see is that really solid results in AEC. And I think we've been as clear as possible that we think it's being more led by C than by A. A lot of what we're seeing is really construction customers retooling their technology base, and that the market for commercial construction has improved on a global basis. That's what we see in the U.S., and from my travels in both Europe and Asia kind of confirm that. Same thing we're kind of seeing in manufacturing. I mean, what we saw in manufacturing, I mean, I know there have been some data that's come out that is contrary to this. But what we've seen is an increase in buying from our customers and a prediction about them spending more during the next year. So we're pretty optimistic, and this is both my interpretation of what we're seeing, combined with what our partners are telling us. Mark?","Mark J. Hawkins","It sounds right on. And then also, Brent, you hit the nail on the head. The -- while our deferred revenue is up year-over-year 7%, the sequential pattern fits almost perfectly with our 5-year kind of sequential history that we look at from a norm standpoint. So you absolutely are on the right point there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask a little bit more about manufacturing because this was certainly one of the better performances we've seen in some time. Was the strength primarily on the automotive side, Carl, or was it more broad-based? And just at a higher level, do you think we have possibly turned the corner in this sector?","Carl Bass","Yes. No, I think it was more broad-based. I mean, I -- what I would say is I saw broad-based improvement economically. And I think in automotive, I think we've been competitively advantaged. So I think that's more of winning business away from our competitors in automotive, whereas in consumer products and industrial machinery, I just saw a general improvement and a healthiness in most parts of the world. We talked about emerging countries. Japan has done well. The only place where I still see continued weakness is Southern Europe.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, Mark, just a quick one for this [indiscernible] Q4 guidance. Is the education impact on revenue again a couple of basis points -- a couple of hundred basis points as it was in Q3?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, I think if you think about it, I think 1 to 2 points would be a good number to look at on the whole company, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted to stay on that subject. How do you think about -- if you plan your business about a recovery? I mean, Europe looks a little bit better. U.S. is still kind of more in the early stages of recovery. What are the metrics numbers that you're looking at? Are you looking at PMI or anything? Anything to help us to kind of share the confidence that you have.","Carl Bass","I mean, we always look at external economic factors like PMI. What has been a better indicator is our actual business and our pipeline of business. And so I'm more reacting to what I see in terms of business that's come in and that business that we've lined up in the pipeline. It's always tempered somewhat. But as we've seen, I think some of the macroeconomic indicators and some of the indices have been really misdirections to what's gone on. I think if you had gone back 3 to 4 months ago, you would have said manufacturing was improving, but you saw many companies' results be subpar. So we're much more interested in what we thought we would do, what we thought the building or sales pipeline would be, how we were able to close deals, the size of those deals. So they were more transactional metrics.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like the transition is going to start more in earnest next quarter. I'm curious, what sort of new metrics might we get next quarter, perhaps a number of subscribers? And is that something that we'll get on a quarterly basis?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, Matt. We're -- one of the things -- you're absolutely right. We are -- the transition is going deeper in Q4 as we talked about the $15 million in enterprise license revenue going to deferred revenue, as for the discussion we had at IR Day. I think there's a number of metrics that we're looking at as we prepare for discussing the FY '15 guidance in terms of what we'll guide by and also what we'll track externally. And so certainly, we revealed the subscriber information we did just a couple of weeks ago, 1.9 million active subscribers of -- about 4.7 million of subscribers that have [ph] potential there, of which 1.9 million are active today. And we're going to start updating that eventually over time, so stay tuned for the FY '15 guidance. We'll get much more granular on both the metrics we're going to guide by and the metrics we're going to disclose. I hope that helps, but you can imagine some of the metrics we've -- we're going to be putting forward.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's great. That's helpful. And then maybe one last question on this. I'm curious that you guys are primarily a channel model. What's the response been thus far from the channel?","Carl Bass","So far, I'd say the channel is primarily reacting to business, which I think most of our channel partners had a good quarter. I think most of our channel partners have a wait-and-see attitude about many of our programs. Some form initial opinions. But right now, I think they see rentals as being additive. They think the elimination of upgrades in the future is a net positive. And they're more positive about the cloud offerings than I've ever seen them. As a matter of fact, for the first time this quarter, I had some of our own sales force start asking me or complaining to me that we're not doing enough on the cloud. And so we're starting to get in balance and how far in front of customers we are with some of our cloud offerings, certainly, when the sales force brings that up as an issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, Mark, I'd like to refer back to one of your longer-term objectives that you talked about last month at the Analyst Meeting, specifically getting 20% more value from new and existing subscribers. Perhaps you could clarify how you do that. If you look at the 5-year period ended fiscal '13 earlier this year, you had a cumulative increase in your average revenues per maintenance seat of about 25% under the existing model. And then that was largely due to mix, it seems, plus some better AutoCAD attach and renewal. So are you expecting that mix will be the predominant driver to the improving value that you are talking about from subscribers? And does that 20% build on the already enlarged maintenance revenues that you had over the last 2 years? Or is it just a path [ph] from a different starting point?","Carl Bass","No. So the starting point is when we described it today, and so it's additive over that. What I think the 2 biggest drivers that we'll see is one is the mix of suites, as we disclosed. We said let [indiscernible] of our revenue is in suites now. So I think where we'll come from suites and that mix towards suites from single products is a big driver. The second one, which we think will add substantially, is the addition of services, web-based services, to our existing customers or to new subscribers of those services.","Mark J. Hawkins","I would absolutely say that with the SaaS offering, it's going to add, I think, the rental. We're going to penetrate even more and create -- we're going to have more subscribers that's going to bring more revenue as well. And then, Carl, I feel good also about the enterprise offerings that we have and how that's kind of super-sizing deals with the enterprise folks, so just to complement your point.","Carl Bass","Right. I think the enterprise is definitely one to add. We tried to detail a little bit, as you remember, at IR Day. Our customers who use these flexible licensing plans, they get more, but they often pay more.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. I don't know if you're able to speak more about Delcam, given the regulatory limitations, as best you can. Could you distinguish it from the manufacturing software investments that 2 of your larger peers made many years ago to sell, of course? And what is now Siemens have been in similar-sounding areas with their DELMIA and Tecnomatix acquisitions. So how are you going to be positioned differently from what they've had for many, many years in the manufacturing area?","Carl Bass","So I'm not as old as you, Jay. I can't remember that far. But what I do know is what we're really interested in is in taking these digital prototypes and these models that we built and actually manufacturing them. And I think if you look at the portfolios, the product portfolios of some of the other companies, they're pretty widespread at what they try to do. We built a very successful business and factory design and plant design. And what we're trying to do is complement that. We very specifically -- we're looking at the CNC tool market and being able to do that. And we think it's taking advantage of these secular trends in what really is the application of microprocessors to manufacturing technology. And so I think in some cases, it's just timing that we see this big growth because the availability of these high-capability, high-performance machines. And we saw it as a limitation in terms of the workflow that people couldn't get all the way to the end, and we felt that, that was important. I think if you look at some of the workflows out there, even in the biggest automotive and aerospace companies, the workflows are not good, they're incomplete, there's data loss and fidelity problems between tools, and we need to change that. The thing that's really driving this, Jay, at the heart is that we're really interested in our manufacturing customers who are putting a premium on the agility. It's about their ability to innovate and bring stuff to market more quickly. They've gotten to the point where quality is assumed, and what they're all interested in is, \"How do I innovate? And how do I bring products to market quickly?\" And one of the ways to do it is, all the way from prototyping to final manufacturing, you get from end-to-end faster.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I was going to ask about maintenance attach rates and renewal rates. Have you seen any change [indiscernible] metrics here in this recent quarter?","Mark J. Hawkins","Steve, this is Mark. Yes, let me just address that. We -- in terms of the actual rates, we don't disclose that. I know you know that. We look at the changes period-on-period. It gets a little bit lumpy. It gets a little in flux at times. They're slightly down. But I think the thing that I look at, [indiscernible] the fact that our [indiscernible].","Carl Bass","Hopefully, everybody could hear that.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, there was a little bit of background noise there, but I hope folks got that. So, Steve, did that cover it for you?","Operator","Your next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk about -- you gave guidance for the $50 million impact from the business model transition during the Analyst Meeting. I'm wondering if you could talk about, given the conversations, Carl, that you've had with customers over the last, I don't know, 6 weeks or so since that event, what have you learned about the appetite for those types of arrangements? And how should we think about that as we go forward from Q4?","Carl Bass","Like we told you back then, we've always been the one that has been the obstacle. Customers have always wanted this. We wanted to recognize more revenue upfront. So customers have been thrilled with our willingness to offer software on terms that they've always wanted. The opportunity might grow this quarter, but it's a little bit limited by the renewal cycle. And so it will come up during the year. So we think people are enthusiastic about it and merely be a function of when their renewals are up.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then just on the LT product, I think the talk coming out of the Analyst Meeting was you were going to drive a bit more promotional activity in the volume channels and so forth. And it sounds like, still, that business was not as good as maybe you'd like it to be. I'm wondering, did you -- how far did you turn on the promotional activity in those volume channels? And should we expect that to turn on further as we sit here in Q4?","Carl Bass","I think we turned it on. I think we turned it on sufficiently. I think it takes a while to respond, and we saw patchiness. I think there were places that responded really well, and there were others that didn't. So we'll report more after the quarter end.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, and just building on Carl's point, I think that exactly describes the LT situation in the AutoCAD side of it of some of the volume products. Keep in mind, Walter, one of the things that we observed this quarter is part of the real success we have with suites growing at 21% year-on-year, which we're very pleased on, had a little bit of a trade-off with AutoCAD point product going to AutoCAD suites, which grew roughly 50%. So we really like that dynamic. We would take that dynamic all day long. I think that just complements the AutoCAD side. Obviously, the LT is more the marketing-led activities that Carl talked about.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Mark, at the Analyst Day, there was also some discussion in your prepared remarks about looking at ratable recognition for some of the non-rental and other contracts. Wondering if there's any update that you can share with us. Since you're waiting until February to give an update on next year's guidance, I think we're all super curious what the magnitude of the adjustments we're all going to have to make, and I think that's going to be a big part of it as to whether that's going to happen right off the bat or if we're going to have to wait for that.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, Sterling, I don't have any new news to share with you. I think you absolutely got it right that at the IR Day, we talked about a couple of things. One, our recurring revenue, by the time we end this 4-year plan that we covered from '14 to '18, is going to be 70% or more. And then we also talked about the intention to drive ratability, even separate from recurring, in a way, to build on the comments that Carl made about customer-friendly things that really free people up to have even more flexible terms. But I don't have anything to share with you at this stage, but that is an intention that we'll be looking at and working on and driving throughout the course of this plan that we've described at IR Day. You got the right issue. We just don't have any news to share with you at this stage.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And one follow-up. In terms of the $50 million going into deferred, the sense is that's a smaller number of enterprise contracts. Why wouldn't the overall number be bigger since these programs are fully available to users?","Carl Bass","It's the size of the enterprise base and the number of contracts that come up for renewal in that quarter. So, for example, as an enterprise customer, even if the renewals came up in the fourth quarter but it was a 2-year term or a 3-year term, it might not be this year. So we haven't gone back to customers who their renewal is -- we haven't gone back to customers who renewal would be next year or the year after and opened it up to them yet. That's what we're driving much higher number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So 2 quick questions. One, Carl, you talked about people new to Autodesk. Do you have any sense if those are switches from other vendors? Or are these people that were living in a cage using carbon paper and things like that and they finally decided to use this thing called a computer? And then secondly, on the -- we didn't talk about -- a lot about it, but the Media and Entertainment business remains kind of choppy. Do you have any sense as to what gets that thing back on track? Or is there anything you can do on that side of the house?","Carl Bass","Yes. So, no, I think they probably were using computers. I'm not sure they were paying for the software they were using on those computers. It's probably a more reasonable explanation of what was going on. On the M&E side, most -- the software part of the business continues to do well. A large part of the money coming out of that business continues to be hardware, which we're happy to see. If it bleeds out over time, it's absolutely fine. We're much more interested in the software component of that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Harris Heyer","This is actually Harry for Phil. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the kind of performance across segments with regard to certain geographies. I know you've given a little bit, but could you talk a little bit about Southern Europe and maybe how you think about a turnaround there? And, obviously, you've just given some color on the Media and Entertainment segment, but any other segments that you think are poised for some strong growth in the coming quarters?","Carl Bass","Yes, I'll give a couple of opinions, and then, Mark, please join in. First one is we're not doing any planning about Southern Europe getting better. We leave that like to the ECB and others. I mean, we just don't see any reason to be particularly optimistic about Southern Europe, and none of our plants contemplate an improving economy in Southern Europe. That being said, we continue to see strength in Central and Northern Europe, the U.K. in particular, and that's across segments, so happy to see that. We're happy to see solid stuff amongst the emerging economies. And we like the results that we saw in Japan. So...","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, and I would just add Canada. It was great to see also a nice strong growth in that respect.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, I want to just follow up on that emerging markets commentary because a lot of enterprise companies this past quarter saw weakness there. Obviously, you saw some nice strength there. What do you think accounted for the recovery that you saw versus maybe some folks more broadly?","Carl Bass","I think, truthfully, we had easy compares. Last year, we found that we're challenging some of the emerging economies. And in a number of places, we did some things around pricing changes and promotional stuff that I think helped. In a number of places, we raised the prices, and we saw that demand remained the same despite an increase in prices.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, Mark, I couldn't hear your full response to Steve Ashley's question. [indiscernible]. The first part came out about -- but you broke up on the billings part. So can you just repeat that commentary on the maintenance billings?","David Gennarelli","Attach and renewals.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, right. So for attach and renewal, just to be clear, 2 things I would say here, Brendan. One is that we don't typically give out or we don't give out the rates at all, number one, but we give directional view. Directionally, it's always a bit lumpy. They were down a bit in terms of the quarter-on-quarter period. I think the more interesting point that I was trying to make was that our subscription billings were up 11% year-on-year. So that, to us, is important, and that's driven by the fact that we had good subscription, our performance year-on-year both on single year and multi-year. And we also had our SaaS offerings, although smaller, contributed to that. And so for us, we also saw the benefits of suites and the fact that more suites have better subscription, and the actual ASP content of that was attractive. So we like that. The rest of it flexes around a little bit, but that's probably the more salient point, Brendan, to share with you. Can you hear that okay?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ross Macmillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Mark, I had a question on maintenance, and it's less about the specifics around attach and renewal but more about the variability in growth. So if I look at your maintenance billings, I think last quarter -- or this year, you've gone, I think, 16% growth, negative 17%, and in this quarter, up 11%. And I thought it might be related to multi-year. But when I look at maintenance revenues, plus change in short-term deferred, you see a similar pattern with a big decline in your fiscal second quarter and then a rebound this quarter. Why are we seeing such variability in maintenance billings?","Mark J. Hawkins","Well, a couple of things here that I would say. First of all, there are seasonality factors that are strong in that respect, Ross. So one of the things I look at, just to kind of get a sense of how things are going, is my 5-year of historical average quarter-to-quarter. And when you look at that, you can see patterns of strong seasonality in any given period, I think, is one of the dynamics. Secondly, I would say, don't forget, there's some special things that have happened if you look at the trailing 12 months that you're referring to. We had activities a year ago, Q2, where, effectively, we changed the pricing in terms of what would have an impact on multi-year subscriptions. And so that has a certain effect in terms of pulling of subscriptions. So there's been both pricing changes, there's been activities of that nature, plus you overlay historical seasonality, and that's the dynamic that you can net out. But I think when you look at seasonality in aggregate, I think it's a lumpy business, so to speak. And it's not off the mark in that respect, let alone if you did the overlay with some of the kind of special events that have happened in the last 12 months. Ross, I hope that helps.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful, especially on the pricing piece. Maybe one follow-up. As you talked about the ASP uplift, you said 2 things: mix and, I guess, attach of the SaaS products, the 360 products. What's your plan in terms of giving us disclosure around 360 product attach? Or how should we think about you helping us understand that evolution, if you will?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, absolutely. 2 things. One is, as soon as this becomes material, you can be sure that we're going to be breaking that out to try to give granularity. We try to give a lot of granularity of what's going on, but anything that's material, we really wanted to be upfront on that, number one. And one of the things also, Ross, that I think is important to reiterate is that as we look to FY '15 in the guidance, one of the things that we look forward to talking to you about is things that we will disclose. It's a fresh point to talk about what we will disclose and also, frankly, what we will guide. And so if you look at and you're extremely well-versed and people that are going through like transformations, you can see the metrics that they guide by, the metrics that they disclose. Ours won't be terribly different from that and especially once things become material. And so I think those 2 things ought to frame it nicely for you. One thing we do know is that SaaS is going to be an important ingredient for us to hit 70% recurring revenue in FY '18. And, obviously, over time, that is going to definitely be material. So we look forward to furthering this discussion at the February guidance discussion. Does that help, Ross?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful.","Mark J. Hawkins","Thank you, Ross.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Williams with Encore (sic) [Evercore].","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the 360 offerings and your comments that they're going to play a big role in the -- moving to 70% on the recurring and the subscription basis going forward. You touched on the first sort of million-dollar-plus deal in BIM 360 in the quarter. And I know you've talked about PLM 360 adoption and SIM 360 being strong. But, I guess, sort of how close are we to million-dollar deals in some of these other 360 offerings? And then sort of how receptive is the base to layering on these 360 offerings, I guess, going forward?","Carl Bass","Yes, we saw the first over a million-dollar deal in BIM 360. We've seen deals of nearly that size or -- and there's certainly deals in the pipeline for much larger numbers than that in the PLM one. I don't expect to see million-dollar deals in SIM 360 in the short term. Some of that is consumption-based, and that will take place over time rather than upfront. I think the big variable is around Autodesk 360 because it's a much more broad-based one. And in 2 weeks, when we're at Autodesk University, we'll be disclosing a lot more about Autodesk 360 and make it clear what that is. We'll also talk a little bit more about AutoCAD 360 at that point as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I want to ask more sort of a strategic question. When we talked to your channel partners and guys in the field, one of the feedback that we got was what they thought would be even more effective to getting non-maintenance paying customers to paying maintenance would, rather than just not doing upgrades would be attaching more functionality that you only get with maintenance. Is that part of the program? Is that something you guys are thinking about, kind of putting it perhaps more carrots with the sticks out there from moving people onto maintenance?","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean, one of the variables we have to figure out is as we offer these new web-based services, there are 2 things we can do: we can offer it in subscriptions, just bundle it in, to increase the attach rate. The other thing is when the services are really value-added is charge customers who are either not on maintenance or who already are in maintenance but are getting much more value. So we try to separate into those 2 categories of kind of the convenient things that are nice and should really be bundled for all our customers, and those would be a big incentive to move more people onto maintenance. But when we look at some of the offerings, these are substantial value over what we offer today. And we think if customers want to avail themselves of the services, they should pay for them.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then just a more tactical [ph] question on the impacts that you saw from federal. Is that something that you expect to be a 1-quarter blip or is the general dysfunction in D.C. likely to drag on for some time?","Carl Bass","Personally, you're trying to just get me going, I know, Keith.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Exactly.","Carl Bass","My prediction is the general dysfunction continues, I don't think it will affect our business. I'm more worried about continued episodic breakouts. I think there's still much more opportunity. And even after today, it doesn't look like even the Senate is becoming more bipartisan and congenial place to work. So when the debt ceiling comes up again, I mean, there's plenty of opportunities for these knuckleheads to get off the railroad tracks, and I'm more worried about that than I am -- ongoing dysfunction and our dissatisfaction with Congress is fine as long as the government spends money. It's when they put a halt to the spending abruptly like they did. And in that case, we very specifically saw deals that we thought were in the pipeline just freeze up. I mean, there was no one to call to write the check.","Mark J. Hawkins","I mean, to build on Carl's point, that probably cost the Americas a couple points of growth, the shutdown itself, which is add that to some of the other headwinds, including we even had a point of FX in Americas, which is unusual, a headwind, and then the educational strategic change. And you can start to see where the Americas is actually performing, a little bit of a better mode than meets the eye.","Carl Bass","And as always, we hope these deals haven't gone away. And as people getting -- have gotten back to work, we start to see some of the deals come through. But we continue to [indiscernible] I think through the next 2 years, you're going to see episodic dysfunctions in addition to the chronic form.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Steve Koenig with Wedbush.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You guys have been pretty transparent about -- sorry, I didn't catch that.","Carl Bass","No, I just said, as long as it's not about the government, we're happy to answer your question.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. No, I'll stay away from that can of worms.","Carl Bass","Exactly.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to dig into your model change. You all had been very clear and transparent on all the different pieces of it. I think the one piece of it that I feel a little bit in the dark about is how quickly and, more qualitatively, how to think about how you're going to make that change from perpetuals to some of that revenue being ratable. What is your thinking on what will drive that? And how quickly will that get driven?","Carl Bass","So, I mean, there's 2 aspects, so let me speak to the first. There's perpetual being driven to recurring, which I think is largely driven by programmatic stuff we do. And I think we've outlined a lot of it. There's another aspect of it of driving it to ratable, which is really more around accounting. And I think Mark tried to answer that. We're working through a lot of these issues right now. As soon as we have answers, we'll communicate them. But maybe, Mark, you want to add some color to that.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, I think that's exactly right, Carl. We have kind of the natural things that are going to drive a recurring from a product and services basis that are straight up the SaaS, the rental, the subscription maintenance out of the pool of opportunity we have with our core business, including the activities that are happening with suites and all that. And then I think there's the other aspect of it in terms of what we can do as we reconfigure our offerings with perpetuals and what would that -- what kind of possibilities does that create to further move that to ratability because of the nature of what's being configured that's based on the offering itself that would clearly cause a different kind of an accounting. And that's something that we're exploring. And I think what we're trying to share with you is the intention to fully and robustly explore that throughout the course of this business plan that we shared with you from FY '14 to FY '18. And, obviously, as soon as we have news that we can share with you, we will share with you. But at this stage, we don't have news on that front. But that's certainly our intention is to continue to work that topic.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Dave Gennarelli for closing remarks.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining us.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference David Gennarelli, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer and Sue Pirri, VP of Finance.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2015, long-term financial model guidance, including billings, subscriptions, and recurring revenue growth. The factors we use to estimate our guidance, new business model introduction, new product and suite releases, market adoption and expected growth rates, our expectations concerning large deal activity in the fourth quarter, business execution, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our desktop subscription offering, our plans, transition to cloud and mobile computing, trends and sales initiatives for our products, and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, our Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2014 and current reports on Form 8-K, including the 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today\u2019s press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thank you, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Building upon the momentum we generated in the last two quarter, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. The results were consistently good across geographies, industries and product offerings. ","Strengthening our core AEC and manufacturing businesses led to better than expected results, including record revenue and deferred revenue. We advanced our business model transition with strong subscription additions and continued adoption of our enterprise agreements.","If you also consider the $26 million backlog balance into the quarter, our total business capacity for the quarter was exceptional. From a geographic perspective, we experienced broad-based strength. All three of our major geographies grew double-digits on a constant currency basis led by growth in EMEA. The areas in which we are seeing weakness are those affected by geopolitical turmoil.","Our strong results and AEC and outstanding growth in our AEC suites can be attributed to the continued adoption of building and infrastructure industries. BIM is now not just limited to desktop products, but is available in cloud and mobile technologies that support access to infield and real-time information.","We closed several large AEC transactions in Q2 including a nice win and a competitive stronghold with Autodesk Advance Steel, a technology we acquired with the acquisition of Graitec a few quarters ago.","We also landed meaningful wins with our structural detailing and fabrication offerings. We continue to steadily grow our user base in each of our AEC cloud based technologies including BIM 360, AutoCAD 360 and InfraWorks 360. BIM 360 in particular continued to grow at a rapid race -- rapidly.","We had numerous wins including one with a large European construction firm proving once again that the construction market is primed to embrace the full benefits of BIM.","Our manufacturing team delivered very strong results driven by growth in industrial machinery, consumer products and automotive. Acquisitions we made in both plastics and composite simulation are particularly significant for the aerospace industry. In Q2 we closed deals with three major aerospace engine manufacturers.","The Delcam business is performing well and contributed almost $11 million in revenue to Q2. We're pleased with the early results from this business and look forward to advancing our position in the CAM market. Our cloud-based PLM 360 product nearly doubled its billings compared to Q2 last year.","We also launched the PLM 360 mobile application in Q2 making PLM 360 the first truly mobile PLM solution. As I mentioned earlier, we had another strong quarter with 74,000 subscription additions. As expected and similar to last quarter the majority of the subscription additions were maintenance subscriptions.","With the discontinuation of the upgrade program at the end of this fiscal year, we are seeing a lot of customers take advantage of the upgrade discount one last time and we are experiencing a higher than average maintenance subscription attach rate.","The desktop subscription offering product for AutoCAD LT had its first full quarter of availability and has performed well out of the gate. What's fantastic is that we also experienced solid growth in perpetual licenses for AutoCAD LT. So it's clearly the case of AutoCAD LT that the desktop subscription program is expanding our reach and bringing new customers to Autodesk.","Another element of our business model transition is offering our enterprise customers more flexible licensing options. In addition to being a great benefit for our customers, these contracts create a larger recurring revenue stream which is recognized ratably. In Q2 we doubled the number of large million dollar plus transactions compared to Q2 last year and we transitioned to approximately $10 million in enterprise license revenue to deferred revenue.","Given our strong Q2 performance and our optimistic view of the macroeconomic environment, we've raised our FY '15 guidance ranges for billings, revenue and subscription. We also narrowed the operating margin range keeping the high end of prior guidance.","As you can in the numbers, margin upside is muted this year for a number of reasons. This year's operating margin assumption includes the impact from the business model transition, investment in our cloud infrastructure, the dilutive effect of the Delcam acquisition, as well as incremental investment spending on key initiatives.","Additionally commission and our employee incentive program are volume related and increased based on our better than expected billing performance.","It's worth repeating that our business model transition will not be perfectly linear and that the amount of business that we transition at a number of new subscriptions will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year-to-year. We are expecting the transition to progress gradually in FY '15 and then ramp more significantly, by the time we get to FY '17 and FY '18.","Lastly, I'll give you an update on our CFO transition. We've started to interview candidates. In the meantime we have a strong finance organization build of talented people to bridge the transition. I think most of you know Sue Pirri, who has been with the company for over 10 years. She is leading our finance team and is here to participate in the Q&A.","So to wrap thing up we were really pleased with our overall results in Q2 and the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to feel great about our opportunities and the direction of the company. It is rewarding to see our mobile and cloud based products adopted by our customers.","These products solve important customer problems and clearly position us as the industry leader as the engineering inevitably moves to a cloud and mobile computing infrastructure. It's still very early in our business model transition, but we are encouraged by what we experienced in the first half of the fiscal year.","We look forward to building on these early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription based model over the coming years.","Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is now open.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Thanks. Good afternoon, Carl. On EMEA you had meaningful improvement in the growth rate. And I'm just curious in terms of what you're seeing in that region, given the growth has really been lackluster and you're your finally seeing that return to healthy growth.","Carl Bass","Yes, I think over the last couple of years it was certainly the other part of your -- we talked about it repeatedly is that in Central Europe was doing well, but was being dragged down by Southern Europe. We hit the bottom in Southern Europe. In other ways we are starting to see a consistent rebound.","So EMEA did well but kind of as I noted in the remarks, the only places where we saw geographic weakness was in EMEA and that was due to what was going on in Russia and the Ukraine and what's going on in the Middle East. Other than that EMEA did great.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. You mentioned construction. And I believe that this has been one of the bigger net inflows of money, when you look at the new revenue inflow into the company. Correct me if I'm wrong, but give us a sense of what you're seeing there in terms of the sustainability, as well, what you're seeing on the construction segment?","Carl Bass","Yes sure Brent. Some of it is driven by increased business activity in construction, but some of it also was that were secular move to seeing more money within the AEC industries spend by construction companies on technology. That's been going for a long term. There is this other more cyclical thing that goes with the economic activity.","That's been good across geographies, but I think as much as anything it's just the adoption of technology by construction companies and as they realize the benefits they historically have been severely under invested in technology.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [Matt Primo] (ph) for Greg. Thanks for taking my questions. So despite the huge licensed revenue upside, it was a bit surprising to us that subscription revenue was generally in line with consensus expectations. Could you comment on renewal rates this quarter?","Carl Bass","Yes, renewal rates, Attach and renewal was really high. Everything about subscription was good.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Great. And do you still expect the geo and bus core adoption of desktop and cloud subscriptions to be pretty broad based by Q4?","Carl Bass","I think you will start to see -- they are doing well but being overwhelmed by the maintenance subscriptions. I think you will see Q4 throughout next year and beyond. So, what\u2019s going on with -- the desktop stuff is good, cloud subscriptions are good. They\u2019re just being overwhelmed a little bit by the maintenance subscriptions. It\u2019s a good problem to have.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Thanks. Good afternoon. Carl, I would like to ask you a longer term question about your operations and your corporate infrastructure, meaning how are those operations in infrastructure being prepared or are they prepared so the new increasingly hybrid business model that you\u2019re going to have over the next number of years, in effect what I am asking is, are you going to have the capacity and the efficiency that you\u2019ll need for bigger channel engagement and improve order processing, I know that sounds very dull but I think it\u2019s very important for the company and improve your systems for customer engagement, especially as volume is deliverable, so will likely increase materially over the next number of years?","Carl Bass","No Jay. You\u2019re absolutely right. There\u2019s actually two ports of operations in infrastructure, let\u2019s take a minute. The first one is just the increased amount of order processing, because the nature of the subscriptions being term based some of them are for shorter period of time and the perpetual licenses, so there\u2019s a huge effort underway to make sure that we can handle the financial transaction aspect"," But there\u2019s also a customer facing aspect of this. There\u2019s a sales engagement part and there\u2019s a marketing effort as well they are really all tied together, that the finally overall customer experience with what we\u2019re doing also because as you know such a huge amount of our business goes through our channel partners, it is having our channel partners engaged as appropriate in some of those activities. So, the operations and infrastructure is big on that.","The second part is just in terms of providing cloud based engineering and design services. We\u2019ve been building out cloud infrastructure as well. So, both of those things are critically important for the future.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Okay. My follow up is on the new cloudy parts of the business. As of the data available in the first quarter 10Q, only 5% of your subscriptions revenue was non-commercial maintenance, in other words run rate of somewhere between $55 million and $60 million was from non-classic maintenance let\u2019s call and the new subscription services.","Could you talk about the growth of that business in the second quarter and more importantly what has happened for that to become a lofty $100 million business over time instead of a mid eight figure kind of business like today?","Carl Bass","One thing I\u2019ll say is, in October at our analyst day, we\u2019ll give you a lot more detail on this. Right now what\u2019s going on with our cloud subscriptions are they\u2019re exceeding all the projections we had. The business is doing well, there\u2019s a lot more stuff coming online, some came on in Q2, there\u2019s a lot in Q3 and Q4. So, these are growing business and so far I am happy with the results.","As to becoming a multi $100 million business I think both our desktop and our cloud businesses will become that and it\u2019s kind of inevitable. I think we\u2019re right on track to do that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks for taking my questions guys. Congrats on the quarter. Certainly, this year seems to be seeing a benefit from the elimination of upgrades next year. Carl, I'm wondering, when might you eliminate perpetual sales? And maybe more generically, what is the framework for eventually pulling this license option?","Carl Bass","I'll ask you Matt, what do you think is a good timeframe to do that.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","I would certainly probably depend on the products, but the market generally wants it -- seems to be wanting it sooner than later.","Carl Bass","We\u2019ve been looking at considering it seriously and we\u2019ll talk again a little bit more about this in October what our plans are. Right now, we have a fair amount of transition going on in the business with the elimination of the upgrades and certainly inspiring people to action. But as we move into next year, we\u2019ll have more to say on that.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","That's great. And maybe dovetailing on that same question, obviously, you're seeing some early success on the subscriptions side, the cloud subscription side. I think you've talked in the past about seeing a 20% or more value from those customers. Is that still the case, or in some cases do you see even more value from those types of deals?","Carl Bass","Some are more and what\u2019s been interesting to me, and somewhat surprising is the number of cloud subscribers and some of our cloud based products are just attracting new people to Autodesk.","It was interesting. I was with a customer the other day, and asking them why they choose in this case PLM 360? And they said they just wanted to build on a 21st century company, we are building new kinds of products and our entire infrastructure is going to be in the cloud.","So our first decision point was who has a cloud based PLM. And second what was the best? So we are finding companies that were in our natural customers before and so that\u2019s happening and in addition, very specific to your question. Yeah, some people are moving more quickly to the cloud then within our forecast.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup","","Hi, thanks. In the prepared remarks you talked to about the gross and license revenue primarily related to upgrade revenue increase that you saw in the quarter. Can you quantify that and what license is sort of an apple-to-apple basis if you would, promotional on the upgraded side is, as of the period you were in the quarter?","Carl Bass","So first of all, I'll let Sue jump in, but what I would say is generally speaking our promotions have been going down as the year has progressed so compare to Q1 the promotional activities going down.","The time frame is getting shorter. But my experience in the years of doing this is when we have a like generated by the removal of the upgrades, you're not going to see a wide disparity of activity among so channel partners. They are very focused on this in bringing in this business of it buyers.","Sue Pirri","That\u2019s right. And we don\u2019t actually breakout upgrade portion of license from the rest of license but I think it was right, the important part is , the important goal for us is to get us many of our customers on the curve version before upgrades go away. And we\u2019re \u2013 the channel partners tend to focus on, the most compelling offer in the quarter and that\u2019s really what people are focused right now.","Walter Pritchard \u2013 Citigroup","And then just a follow-up sort of related to that. You didn\u2019t talk about there is a impact on subscribers from the promotional activity. And I guess if I look at the pace you're on track to add subscribers during the year, you\u2019re talking about 200 to 250,000 this year.","If I go back to fiscal 2013, you added about 250,000 sort of the high end which you\u2019re adding this year really without any help from significant amount of promotional activity like you have this year. And so I guess while I look at those two numbers, I'm kind of understand why, we are convinced here that, that really is a significant amount of demand per subscription, if you\u2019re not that where you are in 2013 levels while driving promotions pretty aggressively.","Carl Bass","","So I mean the way I look at is first of all I'm not sure exactly what time period you\u2019re looking at but all through this there were significant promotions with us weeks. We were making very attractive offers, and moving our customers from there point products.","So I mean we always have promotion going on. I think just the nature of the business, and promotions give a small financial incentive for the customers, but there are also way to focus our entire go to market activity among our sales and more teams as well those are of partners.","So in some ways to look at it is, it\u2019s less the incentives it\u2019s more the goals of what we are trying to accomplish. And what we are seeing is moving amount of people on to subscription that were non subscription, we also noted in the remarks that the attached rates are a big bump as well. So we are happy with where our subscriptions are going.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest","Thanks so much. Carl, I have a follow-up on your comment to Matt about, the new subscribers. People are new to Autodesk. Do you have any number on what percent of the subscriber base you think are generally new users that weren\u2019t previously Autodesk customers?","Carl Bass","I mean we certainly have numbers. We haven\u2019t been disclosing it and particularly let me separate, it\u2019s not the maintenance subscriptions that are capturing those, I\u2019ll tell you more about that. what we\u2019re seeing is in the desktop subscriptions and particularly I called out LT and while historical rate to LT are being maintained we are also now have this new category of desktop subscriptions and that\u2019s doing more plus what I was noting is in a number of our cloud based offering, build 360 PLM, 360 some of the others, we are seeing customers who just weren\u2019t there before.","We\u2019ll try to give a little bit more color about that. But it is certainly attracting new customers and as I pointed out last year at Investor Day, I thought in some cases, some of the markets were engaged in kind of the terrestrial battle where it is kind of that \u2013 so it\u2019s with still minimal amounts of market share shift as we are offering a new technology platform we are finding people who really like being on cloud and mobile and selecting elsewhere before, they maybe even happy with another vendor.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest","We\u2019d heard just sort of anecdotally from the folks in the channel, but it could have been as much as 20% of the subscribers are generally new people. Does that seem like a ballpark number?","Carl Bass","I\u2019d hate to guess, but I will go do a little bit work on this.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest","Terrific and then just following up on Walter's question on the maintenance subs, you obviously you had good attached there. Any sense of where we are within the installed base the number of folks who done upgrades to get to subscription now and what percent may remain or what kind of market size that looks like?","Carl Bass","Our best indications are guidance in the revised upward guidance. We see continued strength in \u2013 as I talked about in the last call, we said the Q3 maybe the weakest for the quarter, but we thought Q4 would be a big quarter.","The hardest part of that figuring this out is, there is a way more subscribers left and we know we will be some behind. Then real question is just how many.","So, we can meet everyone of the expectations we have set. And there are still people behind we\u2019re trying to minimize that as much as possible.","But you know, when we look at that base, it goes back. We think of going back about in the three to five year category and when you go back five years, there maybe people with company\u2019s \u2013 company\u2019s can\u2019t have a business, they may have consolidated, they may have shrunk.","So it\u2019s a little bit hard to procure exact hand on, how many of those seats are active today. So problem will be able to know the answer too much better in the future.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. I\u2019ll keep on track with the, the very hard questions to answer.","In terms of business model transition, we are seeing really good evidence sort of the new subscriber add We are seeing good evidence you guys on targets as sort of long term buildings target. One of the things that\u2019s tougher for us to give ability into his, that the target of uplift in customers value.","I was wondering if sort of give us your view as sort of how you\u2019re doing on that metric of whether you kind of seeing, that movement that upper movement in customer value that you guys are looking for?","Carl Bass","So what I would say I think the base is too small to know of the whole thing. Remember a lot of the guidance we gave around was over five year plan, we are just in very beginning of that.","So I\u2019d say the anecdotal evidence is strong, but it's certainly not on a big enough sample size. So, I don\u2019t think we need any core strength, and I don\u2019t think it's anything different. I just don\u2019t think as big enough to really be certain.","Again when we get to Investor Day in October, be happy to treasure detail some more of that about how we\u2019re doing according to plans.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","And then as a follow-up. At the end of last year when I was first talking about business model transition, you guys actually broke out on the guidance sort of how much license revenue is always going to move into those term contracts and going to the balance sheet.","This quarter you called out what happened in the quarter that just passed in 10 million. Do we have a better handle on sort of what the cadence of that movement is going to be on a go-on forward basis? Have you guys just sort of been able to sort of give a little bit more visibility into the accounting there?","Carl Bass","Yes. We knew a little bit more. We certainly know on the enterprise side what\u2019s going on there. And as we always said, just as a matter of historical fact, a lot of the contracts come up in Q4. So, we\u2019re seeing more moving Q4 just like we did in the prior Q4.","So there is going to be a seasonality to that. As we get to the accounting on moving other parts of our business that were recognized upfront to a more ratable business model. We\u2019ll fill you more as we go. And we have gotten hands on that. And in addition, there\u2019s been some complication and there have been some new accounting guidelines issued at the same time.","They work together and we will describe more of that. Sue you have anything you want to add there.","Sue Pirri","No, I think, you\u2019re right. We will talk more about it at Investor Day and we continue to do work with our finance team and the auditors and we\u2019re finally understanding that accounting around ratability.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open, please go ahead.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Thank you. I\u2019d like to just drill down on the AEC business, to Brent\u2019s question earlier you talked about that being strong but really being two parts to it. One, cyclical recovery, and two, just greater adoption by the contractors part.","Just for cyclical part, wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing across the major geographies, the U.S., Europe and Asia Pac? Where are we in the cyclical recoveries in AEC by geographies?","Carl Bass","So, what I would say, I think in all three geographies we are seeing strength. A very informal way is just to look at the cranes in every city you travel to. Everywhere you go, you can see rather large commercial building going on as well as a big investment in infrastructure.","I don\u2019t think we\u2019re at the top of the cycle yet. We\u2019re somewhere on the way up, it\u2019s been building for while and continues to build. I have no better way to forecast how long the uptick is going to be but it\u2019s been sustained, right now it seems strong and consistent across geographies.","When compared to last time it feels healthier. It doesn\u2019t have some of the bubble aspects as last time. And so, right now, we\u2019re feeling really good about what\u2019s going on and because it\u2019s been one on the coming after the 2008, 2009 downturn, and it hasn\u2019t gotten too hot too quickly. What we\u2019re seeing is company\u2019s willingness to invest in retooling.","They recognize in places where they\u2019re having these technology and they will not spend money to really get onboard. And, it\u2019s nice when it comes slowly enough that they can invest in new technology, train their teams, start to see the benefits, come back and reinvest again and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing this time.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","And then, with respect to Delcam, just wondering what kind of geographic breakdown that $11 million of revenue might have, not looking for exact numbers just looking for some kind of subjective commentary on how that might have broken down by geo?","Carl Bass","We want to break it down. One thing to remember about when we look at things like acquisitions, the thing you have to remember is that it is you also have the differed revenue right down, but it may not be consistent across geographies. But if I just want to speak more generally the Delcam business is really strong in Europe.","And, probably a better way to look at Delcam is by the industry\u2019s reserves and it really does well in aerospace and automotive. There are certainly parts of industrial machinery and others but the way to think about Delcam is computing on the very high end in automotive and aerospace machining.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Bellini, please check your mute button.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Sorry about that. Yeah, it\u2019s Heather Bellini. I have a couple of questions for you Carl and Sue. The first one would be, you mentioned that maintenance attach has been higher than, has been running I guess even higher than you expected. I am just wondering if you could give us an idea in percentage terms, how much higher you\u2019ve seen it thus far this year for the first half versus what you saw the last fiscal year?","And then, the second question would be related to, can you give us kind of rank order for us, top three things that drove the deferred upside? It was much higher than the Street. And then, I guess the last question is more of a capital allocation question Carl. You have been very successful in the transition thus far and I know you have very big plans as for how you\u2019re going to exit a few years from now.","What\u2019s the current thought around being more aggressive and issuing debt of something of that nature in order to really take out a big plug of your stock give you\u2019re executing on your plans so well?","Carl Bass","Okay. So, I don\u2019t want to breakdown the percentage upside. Su, you want to break it out?","Sue Pirri","I can tell you the categories. The categories in deferred are obviously maintenance.","Carl Bass","I was talking about the upside in attach rate first, but.","Sue Pirri","No, we don\u2019t break that out.","","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","\u2026is it running 20 points higher, is it running 10 points higher, it\u2019s not a specific number that we\u2019re looking for.","Sue Pirri","So what I want to say Heather is, it\u2019s meaningfully more \u2013 we\u2019ve seen that in a couple of quarters in a row, but with the current attach rates we have, it\u2019s not going to be 20 points more obviously.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And the other two questions? On what drove the deferred upside, if you could around the quarter.","Sue Pirri","Yes, so we don\u2019t breakdown the specifics of where the increase in deferred came from but the things in deferred obviously consulting plays a part in it that the maintenance is in there, there are some support, there\u2019s a variety of things in deferred and one of the big move is consulting during the quarter, some of the deferred consulting and services.","Carl Bass","If I had to put two things, I\u2019d put one as consulting and the other one is from regular maintenance. Just the upside in maintenance drove that as well.","Sue Pirri","And Carl the last one.","Carl Bass","Yeah, on the capital allocation. We\u2019ve been working on capital allocation plan. We did an offering, it\u2019s probably year or two now. And we\u2019re always, we just review it with the Board as well and we have nothing to announce at this point but we\u2019re certainly looking at it and making some decisions about capital allocation.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Carl Bass","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Yeah, thanks. Hi, guys. Wanted to actually ask about suites. It\u2019s been a while since we talked about the idea of what kind of average uplift that you\u2019re getting on a suite sale versus a point product and more specifically where are you seeing the strength in the suites, whether it\u2019s the highest end suite, the mid range or the lowest?","Carl Bass","All through this, it\u2019s really been the mid range suites that have done the best, which is where we wanted to. I would say we overestimated the people who would go to the low end suites and we underestimated the two other categories above, the medium and the high. And we\u2019ve seen more consistently going there.","We are getting the uplift, it\u2019s one of those time which our modeling ended up being very spot on and it\u2019s been very consistent over the last few year. So, we\u2019re seeing the uplift, the strategy around the suites has worked really well and really according to plan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","And the follow up is actually in the media and entertainment. In the prepared talked about some of the impact is end market demand. Some of it is on the move to subscription. How should we think about where the media and entertainment revenue line goes from here, is it something that actually could start to fade away?","Carl Bass","No. I think, as we always try to distinguish, media and entertainment they are two different parts of the business. There is the creative finishing. Creative finishing has been diminishing, some of it is just nature of the market and some of it has to do with the hardware component in there which we no longer sell.","And then there\u2019s the other part which is the software part of the business. The software part of the business is good and healthy and we like all the dynamics in that part of the business. What we see in the other part less happy with it.","That\u2019s been going on for the last half dozen years in the creative finishing part.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from [indiscernible] from Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and one question and a follow-up if I can. First Carl, nice growth in subscription billings. As we think about the total billings guide for 10% to 12% growth this year, how do you think about the related growth profiles between license billings and subscription billings?","Carl Bass","Yeah, I think what we\u2019re going to see in the short term is just because of -- as we\u2019ve talked about activity in the channel I think we will see subscription billings grow faster. I think what you saw in the first two quarters is a good indicator. As I pointed out 90 days ago that Q3 maybe the anomaly in the year and Q4 will be very strong in maintenance subscriptions once again.","Unidentified Analyst","Sort of, and then for those customers that are buying an update while they can before the deadline, can you remind us at what point will those same customers be forced to come back and either buy another professional license at full price or maybe finally cave in for maintenance in order to stay current.","Carl Bass","Well they really have to something. If they buy an upgrade now along with maintenance they they're on and they only have till the end of the year.","Unidentified Analyst","Well, so just to clarify that, so a customer that\u2026","Carl Bass","The only other choice they have is just to buy. If you don\u2019t want to get our maintenance, you buy a perpetual license. You do not buy maintenance and then some number of years from now when you\u2019re comfortable with the new product, you buy another perpetual license.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I wasn\u2019t sure if there was a time period where Autodesk would stop supporting. Maybe in the past it was after three years, Autodesk would stop supporting some number of versions of its software but it sounds like it\u2019s more customer based that's the one that it comes\u2026","Carl Bass","Yeah, and the truth of it is there is a half-life to software. Given the integration with enterprise systems and the data and the training, the software becomes less valuable over time. If you\u2019re not on the latest releases, it just becomes difficult to communicate with those folks in your ecosystem and it just becomes difficult overall. So the value of that license definitely diminishes over time. Being more than three years back is not practical for most companies.","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities","","Thanks for taking my question. I have got one short question and then a slightly longer one to follow-up. So on the short question. Could you give any color on that Q3 EPS guide looked a little light.","Carl Bass","Yeah, we try to cover it a little bit. At least in my open commentary I listed a whole host of reasons that are in there. Some of these returned some expenses due to the over performance. So compared to last year, there\u2019s more in bonuses and other compensation related expenses. There\u2019s also continued investment in building up the infrastructure and relationship T.J.\u2019s question.","We talked about building back office systems as well as a cloud infrastructure. So we\u2019ve been investing in that and then I detailed a number of other ones but there\u2019re continued investments that we believe are really important for the future of the company.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities","Okay that\u2019s great and then I want to ask this well on concerning Europe, if had any concerns it would be about reaching data points out of Europe where they seem be weaker not only Eastern Europe but even in Germany and Italy etcetera. And I am wondering you did make some comments that you saw weakness in sort of part of Europe.","Was this an -- and obviously this was offset in Q2 just because license upgrades were strong or other regions are so strong that they get and then I guess the other part of that question is do you see anything changing there? Did you linearity suggest anything or in addition how do you factor the recent macro data points in your guidance for Europe?","Carl Bass","Yeah, so couple things. So the only part of Europe that I really called out as weak were Russia and then Ukraine and the other part was EMEA, was what\u2019s going on in the Middle East. So those are the two areas.","What would you think of most of traditional Europe actually performing sharply. Just like when I saw the numbers out of Germany, I was surprised by it. We don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s just -- we haven\u2019t seen that at all. So it was a little bit surprising to me but can surely take a bit of it into account.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. Carl, how confident are you that having a very limited window for selling upgrades may not -- the strength as impressive as you\u2019re seeing in the quarter is not coming at the expense of what would have been license business next year or perhaps even subscription business because I would assume that just getting on the update and getting on maintenance would certainly take the pressure off of the customer to consider a new license or a subscription and as a follow-up, I think it\u2019s almost a year since the launch of the subscription initiative.","Is it because the company is still in a dual mode selling the license and subscription not as happy as you are with the subscription update, well clearly, it's doing better than your total forecast. But I would assume that given such a big change that we would see that Adobe type of whizbang effect right out of the gate. But is it because you\u2019re selling the license and the subscription that we\u2019ve not seen that big breakout this year? Thank you","Carl Bass","Yeah, no, no, actually all the guidance that we did, that we talked about five years in, as you just referenced Adobe I\u2019ve said this before, while there are certainly similarities between Autodesk and Adobe there\u2019s also a big difference. Adobe went and made the more dramatic step of eliminating perpetual licenses for most of their desktop products and that accounts for the difference on one side.","On the other side it is, we had already a very large installed subscriber base and it was related to maintenance relative to what adobe had, so the starting points are a little bit different and the actions we have taken, we\u2019re still selling perpetual licenses and they\u2019re not. So I don\u2019t think looking directly, laying one graph over the other does much good on the other hand. The general trends that both us and Adobe -- and I think others in the traditional desktop software business is looking at are all the same things.","So we just stepped back for a second and say what\u2019s this going to work like in the future. Three years from now it will be surprising to me if anybody is really running very much perpetual desktop software.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","And the impact of the upgrades, Carl, to what extent do you think it might have been at the expense of next year\u2019s demand for licenses and subscriptions or maybe not strong cost.","Carl Bass","I don\u2019t think the upgrades have much to do with next year\u2019s subscriptions. Some of the people are certainly deciding now to upgrade and buy their licenses ahead of that change. There\u2019s always a small effect but as we\u2019ve talked about before, there will be new emphasis next year for something else and it\u2019s a large install base and we\u2019ll tap into a different part of it and hopefully motivate it appropriately.","Sue Pirri","","The other thing that I would add is as we\u2019re seeing the folks upgrading, we aren\u2019t seeing higher cash rates with these customers and getting closer to Autodesk to being on a maintenance subscription is a good lead-in for us marketing other products for them and eventually priming them for the desktop subscriptions and the cloud.","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator instructions). And our next question comes from Matthew Williams from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.","Matthew Williams - Evercore Partners","","Hi guys. Thanks so much for fitting me in. Most of my questions have been answered at this point but Carl I just wanted to -- if you could provide a little bit of color on maybe what you\u2019re seeing out of the consumer side and now it\u2019s -- lot of focus has been on the enterprise with what you\u2019re doing but I think longer term you guys have highlighted quite an opportunity on the consumer side. I was just wondering if you could give an update there.","Carl Bass","Yeah sure. What\u2019s going on with the consumer is really exciting. We\u2019re getting close to more than 200 million users in the consumer space. Over 50 million up monthly unique users in the consumer space. So this is turning into something substantial. We continue to do more in that market and we\u2019re succeeding with that.","We\u2019re also kind of bridging the gap between some of the consumer stuff for some of things that have been delayed in the consumer work and what\u2019s going on in the more industrial markets. One thing that I didn\u2019t touch upon but we did announce that we were doing a 3D printer.","Autodesk was actually designing and manufacturing a 3D printer. That\u2019s going really well. I am very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve to date. I am sure we\u2019ll be showing you the 3D printer in October. Prints are coming out of it all day long and it\u2019s sort of really exciting and so well I am excited about the consumer opportunity in and of itself and we\u2019ve just spent the last 50 minutes talking about the more industrial part.","There\u2019s this interesting segment in the middle as well that we see developing on the small new industrial that transitions out of the consumer but all signs are really positive with the consumer and in many ways, they\u2019ve been a great leading indicator of the other stuff, much more willing to adopt cloud and mobile stuff ahead of the enterprise.","Matthew Williams - Evercore Partners","Great. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate it and maybe just one quick follow-up. I know the channel\u2019s been focused on really getting customers hurrying on subscription. As we start to look in the next year when the upgrade option goes away and the focus is just a little bit more towards desktop subscription and the cloud offering, what sort of work or investment do you need to do to make sure the channel\u2019s ready to really help drive growth in those areas as well?","Carl Bass","I don\u2019t think there is anything dramatic going on that needs to happen with the channel. We work really closely with our channel partners and when I am able to report really good results like this quarter, it is the result of the combined activity of every channel partners.","So they are doing really well. They are really optimistic and one thing that did surprise me this quarter was I did notice in your guys\u2019 channel checks not actually picking up on the strength in the quarter so there\u2019s some level of disconnect that I don\u2019t quite understand they ended up looking to probe into a little bit more but our channel partners are really optimistic about the rest of the year going into next year.","I am surprised that didn\u2019t come through in some of the conversations with you but it certainly came through in the results. Si I think you\u2019ll see only small incremental changes in how we work with our channel partners.","Matthew Williams - Evercore Partners","Great. Thanks and congrats on the quarter.","Carl Bass","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","","Thank you and I am not showing any further questions.

Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors.","As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full year FY 2016, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.

And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We continue to be pleased with the progress of our business model transition. Strong billings, deferred revenue growth and recurring revenue growth were highlights in the second quarter. 55% of the second quarter revenue was recurring compared to just 44% in Q2 last year. What's more, our ARR, or annualized recurring revenue, increased 23% year-on-year in constant currency. That's real progress on the business model transition ahead of what will be the bigger transition period when we discontinue selling new perpetual licenses. We'll talk more about ARR and its importance at our Investor Day event next month.","We're also pleased with the growth of new model subscription types. They continue to show strong year-over-year and sequential growth. Subscription additions in Q2 were led by desktop subscriptions, again comprising more than half of our total subscription adds for the quarter. Since we launched desktop subscriptions last year, we've seen a steady increase in volume and an increase in the percentage of annual contracts, which is now approximately 80%. As expected, AutoCAD LT continues to lead all desktop subscription products, which is important because LT has historically been our highest volume product and represents the biggest opportunity to convert non-subscribing LT customers.","Our channel partners have also been steadily increasing their desktop subscription business. In Q2 last year, approximately 40% of our desktop subs came through our channel partners, and that has increased to approximately 60% this past quarter. Total maintenance subscription additions for the quarter were lower than expected. Despite strong attach and renewal rates, we no longer offer upgrades for non-subscribing customers and we simply had fewer opportunities to attach a maintenance subscription. Our focus for the rest of the year will continue to be on converting non-subscribers to subscribers.","One area that helped drive billings, but was neutral to the subscription count, was an uptick in multi-year maintenance subscriptions. We removed the discount for multi-year maintenance subscription and that prompted a surge of activity. The upside for Autodesk is securing the relationship with the customer for multiple years and collecting the cash up front.","We're quickly approaching the end of this fiscal year when we stop selling new perpetual licenses for stand-alone products. We started the process in Q2 when we stopped selling new perpetual licenses for AutoCAD LT in Australia and New Zealand. The results were very much in line with our expectations. We experienced a surge of buying perpetual LT licenses prior to the cut-off date. Combined seat volume in perpetual LT and desktop subscription LT grew on a year-over-year basis. This is clearly a positive data point as we look ahead to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for most individual products at year end.","Looking at the AEC industry, BIM adoption continues to fuel our business in addition to the general strength of the commercial construction market. We're excited about our cloud-based products like BIM 360 and the recently introduced A360 Collaboration for Revit, which connects building project teams with centralized access to BIM project data in the cloud. This new product had a great win in Q2 where it displaced a competitor on a major U.S. airport project. On the structural engineering side, our new offering, Advance Steel, gained momentum with numerous competitor displacements in the quarter.","Looking at our manufacturing business, our automotive solutions continue to lead the way. We can count almost every car company in the world as a customer. There is broad use of products from conceptual design, all the way through manufacturing, and we've seen substantial expansion of the use of our products throughout the auto industry.","And we're really encouraged by what we're seeing with the adoption of Fusion 360, the first cloud-based 3D CAD system. Fusion 360 connects the entire product development process where users can design, test and fabricate in a single cloud-based tool. Usage is growing quickly and we're delighted to see that the majority of our customers are switching from legacy desktop systems, such as SolidWorks. We'll talk more on how engineering software is moving from the desktop to the cloud at our upcoming Investor Meeting.","Our simulation portfolio experienced strong growth in the second quarter with new business centered in automotive, industrial machinery and consumer products. Simulation provides key insights for our customers to design and manufacture better products. We also saw continued investment from large automotive supply chain customers investing in solutions for advanced materials. Our new NASTRAN-based solutions had wins in many new and existing accounts.","From a geographic standpoint, it continues to be an uneven environment. Strength in the U.S. is being tempered by continued weakness in Japan. Japan impacts both our APAC revenue as well as our PSEB revenue line, as Japan has historically been a significant market for LT. We also saw weakness in most of the emerging economies and despite recent news to the contrary, we saw strength in China last quarter.","Following my comments last quarter, others in the industry have been talking about their approach to the Internet of Things. We believe that capitalizing on this opportunity will require more than applying yesterday's technology. To bolster our efforts in this area, today we announced an agreement to acquire SeeControl, the innovative developer of an enterprise IoT cloud-based platform.","The SeeControl service helps manufacturers and system integrators to net analyze control and manage things remotely. Just as we have changed the CAD, CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we are doing the same with Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects. This is an exciting area, and we are looking forward to developing it.","Now let me get back to the business model transition. I'll reiterate that this transition is not just about moving to a subscription model. We are transforming our business and the products that our customers use. The cloud is enabling our customers to think differently about how they approach design, simulation, production and collaboration.","I'll also repeat once again that our business model transition will not be perfectly linear, and the amount of business that we transition, the number of subscription additions and the mix of subscriptions issued will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Our transition will not look identical to some of the other high profile software company transitions for many reasons, including a significant difference in our customers' price points, competitive position, our channel, and the fact that we already had a maintenance subscription business that represented approximately 40% of our revenue before we started that transition.","We've made good progress in the transition to-date, and we are now ready to accelerate the process. We'll start by ending sales of perpetual licenses of AutoCAD LT in APAC with the exception of Japan at the end of this quarter. Next week we'll announce the date for when we'll stop selling new perpetual licenses for suites, but I'll say that we are accelerating our plans that substantially move up that date.","At our Investor Day event on September 29, we'll provide you with our updated view of our model transition and our enthusiasm about the steady state. In the meantime, new disclosures that we made today around ARR, the percent of recurring revenue and the change in the end of sale stage for perpetual licenses illustrate the progress we've made so far and our plans to capitalize on and accelerate this early success.","As we look at the second half of FY 2016, we remain confident in our billings and subscriptions outlook. We've updated our revenue outlook based on a greater than expected portion of our sales shifting from perpetual licenses to new subscription types which are deferred and recognized ratably. FX headwinds remain persistent, but they haven't gotten much worse than the first half of the year. We continue to believe that FY 2016 will be more back-end loaded than usual given the deadline for end of sale for new perpetual individual product offerings.","To wrap things up, our strong conviction in the model transition is supported by our results. Undergoing this transition will provide our customers with greater flexibility and a better user experience, while creating a more predictable recurring and profitable business for Autodesk in the years to come.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Carl, I just wanted to clarify a comment you made that the lowering of revenues really related to the business model transition, not a material change in the actual core operations or traction you're seeing with your solutions in the market?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so, Brent, yes, let me try to be as clear as possible, and, Scott, feel free to jump in. It is really just a transition from \u2013 so no change in volume in business. This is really about how we're going to recognize the revenue that comes in. And what we saw in this quarter and we're projecting and in some cases programmatically accelerating is that more of the revenue is going to move to ratable, which is just arithmetic, to get to the fact that revenues are lower, even though there's no change in the fundamental business.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just to your comment on Japan. It's been an issue for many vendors, but there's also another issue which I think Adobe has highlighted, that Japan really hasn't made the move to cloud. And I'm curious, as you move the transition to more subscription in cloud, how do you think that market reacts as you start to remove the core? It seems like that may pronounce the weakness there for a little bit longer than perhaps than we think. I'm curious if you could just provide any comments on how you think that will play out?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, sure, Brent. First of all, I think it is true that as we've seen over the years in adopting new technology and business models, Japan has never been the leader, and I don't expect that to change. I mean, one of the ways that we're doing this transition that does give our Japanese customers a way to change is people who have perpetual licenses and maintenance can continue to stay that way. So we will have avenues for people to continue buying that way, and so for the majority of customers, it will change, but they can control it to some degree.","The second thing that's interesting is what I'm seeing which is more anecdotal at this point; there is a split in the Japanese market. So on many of the new things we're doing, so like these new products like Fusion, which is a cloud-based CAD product, we're having dramatically better results in Japan. We're just releasing a Japanese version of the product because it's been so successful, and that kind of runs counter to what we're seeing in the mainstream.","So I wouldn't say that this enthusiasm for the cloud trumps what will be traditional customers' way, but there is a new generation that is looking at doing things differently, and there's definitely at least an undercurrent in Japan of that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thanks, guys, and I appreciate you taking my question. I just had a question on the subscriber mix that you saw this quarter. If I just compare the press releases over the past couple of quarters here, in Q4 you talked about the majority of the subscriber additions being maintenance subscriptions. In Q1, you said half were traditional maintenance, half were new type. And then this quarter, you talked about the majority of subscriptions being the new subscription types. Just wondering what trend you're seeing there? And also, maybe help us think through just the ARPU of sort of a traditional maintenance sub versus the subscription subs? Thanks.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Phil. As we look at the trend on the subscriber adds we saw in Q1, the previous quarter, for the first time, roughly a balance between the net subscriber adds that were coming in from maintenance versus those coming in from the new model. And in the quarter, we disclosed they continued to be strong. So the new model sub adds that are \u2013 they're just two big elements inside our subscription adds, new model and maintenance. The new model sub adds continue to be strong, both year-on-year and sequentially.","When you look at the maintenance adds for the last quarter, they actually come in two pieces, too. Renewals, so existing maintenance and then new maintenance sold attached to new perpetual license sales. Renewal rates stayed strong and then on the new sales the attach rates stayed strong. What we're seeing, though, that a little bit of downward pressure on the new maintenance adds is really a different pattern this year versus what we saw last year.","Last year when we announced the end of sale of upgrades we saw a pretty linear path of customers buying those upgrades throughout Q2, Q3 and Q4, about the same each quarter. What we're seeing this year is the customers that are going to buy perpetual license at the end of the sale are more back-end loaded. We saw this with the test that we ran in ANZ where it was closer to the end of the actual end of sale in Australia and New Zealand that, that buying activity took place. And we've said all along we think this is going to be a back-end loaded year because of that and that's really the trend that we're seeing inside the subscriber adds.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Then talk about the difference in...","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","In ARPU?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. When you look at ARPU, of course, the overall blended ARPU of those two types is quite different. And even within each type it's very sensitive to whether you're talking a desktop subscription for LT versus a desktop subscription to PrDS. So it's blended to such a level that it's hard to glean a lot of intelligence at the summary level. But when you look between just the average price of a desktop versus the average price of maintenance, a good example would be AutoCAD and an annual maintenance there sells for between 15% and 20% of the SRP of the new license versus a desktop license for a year would sell at about 40%. So, using that as an example, it's roughly half.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. So in other words you did a higher mix of your higher ARPU subscribers as far as the new adds this quarter?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. That's correct.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Cool. Thanks, guys.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Oh, terrific. I wonder if you could go back through, you talked about the growth in long-term deferred revenue and you had talked about seeing some long-term contracts with maintenance and something about some dynamic around the renewal of maintenance. Can you just walk us through what drove that growth in long-term deferred revenue on maintenance?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, sure. Carl mentioned in his opening commentary, we had a strong quarter for multi-year maintenance sales. And so you know what drops in the long-term is anything that's deferred beyond 12 months, and when you sell multi-year there's a bigger component to that than normal. So that's what's driving a bit of an outsized growth. The deferred revenue in total was quite strong, up about $80 million sequentially quarter-on-quarter, driven by what we just said, the higher mix of our sales coming in ratable models versus up front. And then within those ratable models most of your maintenance was strong. And so that dropped an element in the long-term versus current.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Steve, what really drove it was we offered a discount for people who were paying up front for multiple years before we announced the elimination of that discount, and so people wanted to get in on it, at least some of it, before that offer expired. So it drove a little bit of business.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sort of a bump in multi-year.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. It just drove multi-year. It didn't drive subscriber count and had no effect on revenue essentially.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, that's the other interesting point is that when you add a multi-year, it's still just one subscriber, so it boosts the billings line, it doesn't necessarily bump the subscriber line.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then I was going to ask about the desktop subscription traction you're getting in the channel. What percentage of that is LT? I mean roughly, I'm not looking for a number.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. It's the largest individual piece.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And it matches the product mix. I mean the one thing I would say about adoption of desktop subscription, just to step back a little bit, is I won't particularly say any industry or product line is any more inclined to do it or not. It seems like our customers are endorsing the move to the new model, and it's pretty consistent across the board.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I had two questions, if you don't mind. The first one, I'm just I guess trying to reconcile again the comments about the transition kind of accelerating with subscription adds showing up of only 61,000 in the quarter. I mean, I know we don't have a ton of history with that, but I'm just trying to reconcile that comment, if you could give some color there?","And then secondarily, I noticed obviously you guys started giving out annualized recurring revenue. And I know that the definition of that is in the glossary, but the 55% that you're showing, the recurring revenue in the table that you have, if we just take subscription revenue I think and divide it by your total revenue, that's about 52% I think of revenue. So is that ARR if we were to try and translate that into numbers? Is that about, I don't know, $18 million or $20 million higher than what your subscription revenue line is showing? I'm just trying to get a sense of what you want us to do with that number besides look at a percentage that's growing. And I want to make sure I'm translating it into dollars appropriately. Thank you.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Heather, sure. On your second point, the reason we start to give that out is as we go through the transition and we're in this somewhat hybrid state where we're selling both new model types and perpetual license types, obviously the faster we make the transition, the more people that buy the new model types, the faster recurring revenue, both on an annualized basis and in any given quarter will trend. And so that's the point of providing that and we'll spend more time talking about this...","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, no. I know why you're providing it. It's not about why you're providing it. How are we supposed to interpret the 55%? Is that annualized recurring revenue, the 55% you're pointing to, I'm just trying to confirm, is it 55% of the $613 million that you reported, which compares to your subscription revenue, which is about 52% I think off the top of my head of the total? I mean, I'm just trying to get behind the number because...","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","...you're not giving us the dollar amount; you're giving us a percentage. I want to make sure I'm thinking about the percentage the right way.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You are. It's actually 55% of the $610 million that we reported, but that's right. You're thinking about it...","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Okay. Perfect. Okay. And then to the first question?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. On your first question, the \u2013 I'm sorry, do you want to...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. Go ahead, Scott.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, the acceleration that we're talking about again is the acceleration of the transition. And so what you see within the subscriber adds is both new model adds and old model adds, if you want to think of maintenance that way. The new model adds continue to accelerate and so the growth right there both year-on-year is huge. Even it's strong sequentially for the new model adds. And that's why you see us taking actions like going to end of sale in LT in APAC at the end of this quarter everywhere except Japan and we'll announce next week when we hit end of sale for perpetual on suites. So that's the acceleration and that's what is showing up in the subscriber adds.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the one other comment that we put in there that may have been slightly too obtuse was this idea that what we're seeing with these end of sales is that people are not buying \u2013 they're not taking advantage of it until late in the promotion. And so for example, the opportunity on some of these things to attach maintenance to, they're not availing themselves of it. And so I think we will see some unevenness in these numbers on both the maintenance, old maintenance and new subscription as we go through the next two quarters and into next year before we terminate the program.","So there'll be a little bit of volatility there and it's behavior that we're at this point really not that good at predicting. We've never gone through this transition of doing the end of sale of either the individual licenses or the suites. So it's a one-time phenomenon. I think all of us will be slightly imperfect at predicting that.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Hi and thank you. Carl, with respect to the termination of the suites, just to be sure we understand what you're saying, you are moving it up from the end of fiscal 2017 as previously planned and so in effect, you've decided to have a rip the BAND-AID moment off, the way Adobe decided to do three years ago. They originally started with a longer transition period in mind and then of course they went to do it much more quickly. So you are in effect doing something similar now. Is that what you mean to do next week?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I mean, so in essence, you're right. I'm not sure we've ever exactly announced what it was, but I think we certainly intimated it clearly enough. And yes, I think what we saw, we wanted to make sure that both our customers and our channel partners were ready for this transition, and we started out with a model of this that enabled us to take longer to do it than folks like Adobe did. And what we've seen is a willingness, a huge willingness on the part of our customers to use this new model. In many ways, it's much more favorable for them.","And then secondly our channel partners, which we told you were always very vulnerable if we did the rip the BAND-AID off in the beginning, are successfully transitioning their businesses and their customers through this. And so just like many of you, and I can't tell you how many of you have told me, why don't you rip off the BAND-AID? Yes, we're going to have a rip the BAND-AID off moment, and we'll give you the details on it next week and then we can certainly talk about it a month from now when we all get together.","But that was exactly what it was about, and in many ways, this is really beneficial for us. It is non-trivial to run the two things simultaneously. Also we've just in terms of reporting financially, it makes some of the results somewhat confounding. Just, how does this go up and not this go up? And all this does is it accelerates that transition for customers, resellers and certainly for the financial community. And so earlier next year than we had previously planned, we come out of that and start seeing also the economic benefits of that as well.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","You've alluded now a couple of times to the readiness of the channel. To the extent that you do accelerate the business model transition, would you necessarily accelerate the change in the channel model itself, in other words the agency or fee model that we've talked about a number of times? Would the two necessarily go hand-in-hand, as you've also alluded to in the past?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I mean as you know we are constantly adjusting the channel model. At the very least, it's an annual phenomenon around here. And much of it is kind of carefully planned with the other programs that are in place and in consultation with our partners. And so we've worked really closely with them and many of the things that we think were appropriate for the beginning of the transition we've put in place and we've talked about them before, and as we get towards the end of the transition, we'll move through to those things that we said were coming.","So I think every part of it has to move together to make sense. And so with the acceleration of the announcement of the end of sale, along with it go channel programs and incentives and a number of other things.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","All right. If I could maybe just squeeze one more in, you alluded to focusing on...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, who would stop you, Jay?","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Maybe Scott.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks. So you alluded, Carl, that in the second half you would focus on unattached or non-maintenance paying customers. Setting LT aside, are you referring specifically to the upgraded but not attached base that was part of the 2.9 million, that famous number from the Analyst Meeting last year?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, yes. The famous 2.9 million.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Right. But...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's exactly it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. But of that, 1.3 million was upgraded, not attached, not counting LT. So that's the number you're going to be converting?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well both, Jay. I mean, we'll focus on that LT base as well, right? So the goal will be to, in addition to acquiring new customers with the new models, which we're doing nicely, will be to progressively go after that legacy base, LT and non-LT.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And one of the things that has been a very pleasing upside is just because of the price points and the difference in characteristics amongst our LT customers, we were more anxious about them and the new model transition, and if anything, the adoption there has been as strong as in any other part of the portfolio. And I think we mentioned the one place that we're nervous, which is Japan, which is certainly meaningful in terms of LT, but when you look at, for example, the other industrialized countries, Western Europe, United States, we just don't see much difference there. And fortunately, that simplifies the programs and allows us to do more things holistically. And yes, in a way that makes sense and is easier to communicate to everybody. So we're just going to continue to do that and we're really pleased to see the LT customers coming along.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, and the upside there, of course, is LT had the lowest attach rate previously. When we sold our perpetual, it had the lowest attach rate of maintenance, and so seeing that LT customer set move to desktop gives us a chance to bring them along with us and to pull them in as subscribers.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much, and good afternoon, guys. So you had a pretty big uptick, actually a very big uptick in subscription billings, up 52% year-over-year but I was hoping, Scott, that you could parse this a little more for us. Can you tell us how much of this growth roughly came from greater end market customer acceptance of your subscription program as opposed to a lengthening in terms just by virtue of the increase in multi-year subs that you referenced?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. It was both but, of course, the size of our maintenance base is so much bigger, just the base that we've built up over the last 10 years. The number from a pure number standpoint it overwhelms, but we saw strong growth both \u2013 crazy growth year-on-year in the new models but strong growth sequentially. But multi-year maintenance also drove a big chunk of that subscriber billings upside and that's just a function of the size of that install base moving.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then maybe just one for Carl; if you could sort of talk about what you're seeing in terms of activity levels on your eStore, and just when do you expect that eStore could become material for you guys? Thanks.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I mean, the eStore at this point is becoming material. I mean, we're getting to the point we'll start reporting, maybe we'll start giving you some insight into it, but it is becoming a sizable portion of the business. And I'd say one way to think about it is there's our eStore, but there's just electronic distribution and sales that includes many partners all the way from folks like CDW, Dell and Amazon all the way to our traditional partners doing online distribution.","So electronic sales and distribution is becoming more important. Our eStore, we continue to sell it at this price. So it is a reference marker out there but many people just buy for convenience through there and it's growing substantially. And so quite a good point to take away is we're preparing for Investor Day and talk a little bit more about the electronic channel. But they're clearly the wave of the future and in particular, as we look at many of our new products, many of them are almost exclusively through the electronic channels or at least starting out more even with our traditional channels.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard of Citi. Your line is open.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Scott, I wonder if you could talk about the rental uptick you're seeing and how that may differ or not in manufacturing vertical versus the AEC space?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Walter, we're not seeing a big \u2013 Carl touched on this earlier. We're not seeing a big difference in the uptake rate either by product or by industry vertical at this point. I mean, I guess if you look at it by geo, you might see a slightly slower uptake of the new model types in Japan. But holding that aside, we really are seeing a pretty consistent uptake in the new \u2013 the desktop subscription model, which is the rental model, across product lines and across segments.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then, Carl, you're buying this, the company on the Internet of Things side and it just seems if I put myself in your place, you guys have quite a bit going on. I guess how do you avoid getting distracted here with a big business model transition and you're now entering a new market, it seems like that could be a risk.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I mean, well, one of things I'll say, we do acquisitions all the time, kind of routinely. But if you want to step back for a minute and just look at Autodesk in general, there are two big things we're doing. The first one is the business model transition. We've spent a lot of time in the prepared remarks as well as already on the Q&A talking about lots of that and I'm sure we will continue for the next number of months. What sometimes gets lost with all the conversation about that is that we were probably in the biggest transformation in the engineering and design software space we've ever seen, so as big as mainframe to workstation or workstation to PC, the shift of engineering software moving to the cloud is as big and more inevitable than any of those other transitions.","And the alternative to doing acquisitions like SeeControl is to miss out on big parts of the market and we just look and say, well we want to come out of this as not only a more sustainable, less volatile model on the business we have today, we wholly expect to be the leaders in cloud computing for engineering and design and one of the ways to do that is to continue to develop stuff internally, the other is through acquisitions, and whether it's stuff we're doing with PLM 360 or BIM 360 or what we'll do with the Internet of Things, on that side, we think that's really important. And I would at least urge you to look at both the lack of competitive movement there.","Most of our competitors don't think the cloud is that important for their customers. They're making halfhearted to nonexistent attempts to do anything about it. It's a bury your head in the sand kind of strategy. So when you look at it, they are, particularly in legacy business, whether in PLM or anything else. So we've let these things like the Internet of Things or moving CAD or PLM or CAM to it as being a critical part of what Autodesk looks like a handful of years from now.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, and, Walter, the other think I would just add to that, because your question was about distraction, I don't see Internet of Things as a net new segment for us. It fits very much hand-in-glove with where we're headed in manufacturing, and where we're headed in AEC. So it's more of an adjunctive to a couple of pretty strategic segments we are already in, than it is something that's net new that we're adding to the plate that we now have to build entirely different structures for.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. I think some others in the market have positioned it as a new segment. I think Scott is absolutely right, and if you just break it down a little bit, I don't know anyone building commercial buildings nowadays who are not thinking about instrumenting and monitoring their buildings to improve the efficiency of running their operations. And whether that's a commercial real estate or industrial space such as a factory, or a power plant, everybody is doing it. I think very few people are designing new products that aren't number one, enhanced by Internet of Things technology. And I think most everybody is trying to collect data and analyze it so they can build better products for the future. And so this is really kind of the foundation of technology to get that started, and we certainly have more work to build into a business. But I think it dovetails exactly with our existing businesses.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anil Doradla of William Blair. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Maggie Nolan (38:56) in for Anil. My first question is on the new incentives. You mentioned that there had been a discount for customers buying subscriptions up front. And I'm wondering are there any other incentives that you will be rolling out to help accelerate the transition to the subscription base and how you hope to achieve that subscription that we'll need to see in the second half, given that that's where your guidance has remained consistent?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So, let me just be clear on this one. So the first one was, what we were trying out on the subscriptions was the renewal \u2013 was the removal of a promotion. And people buying ahead of that removal.","Unknown Speaker","Okay.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so that was just the discounts going away, and people just saying I want to buy now and pay less. What I think you will see going forward is we will continue to promote the move to desktop subscriptions. We'll talk a little bit more about it next week and beyond that and I think if anything, the bias right now, is to accelerate that and promote it more. Having seen the success we saw was to kind of double-down on that and encourage people to move more quickly. I think it serves all of us well to do that.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Makes sense. And then my second question was you mentioned that China wasn't much of a headwind in the second quarter. I'm hoping you can give a little more color around your view on that going forward? And what kind of limited that headwind in the second quarter?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I wish I could. That is one of the confounding things amongst many. Yes, there are certain places in which the economic reports coincide nearly perfectly. We're seeing really strong business in the U.S. and all the economic reports out of the U.S. including the one this morning continue to be strong. And it actually lines up with everybody's kind of impressions. You walk around major cities and there are cranes everywhere, the job market is tight, unemployment is low.","China always on the reporting side is a little bit of a trickier place to actually understand and I don't really understand to what degree and the flip side of that is Japan is where there's definitely some dissonance between our results and the overall economic one. We're digging into it a little bit more to understand. I'd say at this point we have an imperfect understanding and just for everyone, I mean, we spend a little bit of time trying to understand it. But in some of these things, when it goes beyond what's actionable and what we would do differently as a result of understanding it, it starts being diminishing returns for us to play macroeconomists.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Maggie (41:41), maybe the better way to think about China is to step back and say what drove that growth in the quarter, and it's obviously China is a very active construction market. I've been there, as Carl said, you see cranes everywhere. BIM is actually taking off in China. You look at major projects like the new Shanghai Tower and it's being built with BIM start to finish. So that's what's fueling the growth. I think the second part of your question what to expect given the events of the last five days or six days, that's the one where it's kind of a, who knows, at this point.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Some of our theories include things like the government has been putting a lot of money into infrastructure projects and some of their injection into the economy are things that generally benefit our kinds of customers but that's a little bit of speculation on our part. But it is possible and once again, it's one quarter data point now that we're kind of lined up we'll see going forward what we see in the next quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Sure. Great. That helps. Thanks for taking my questions.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. You're welcome.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks. Hi, guys. I've gotten a few emails from investors. There's a lot of terms being floated around during the call and I think there's some confusion. Can you clarify for investors when you talk about the new model, how much of that are you talking about in terms of pure product subscription versus maintenance versus anything else. Just clarify the term for some of the investors.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Sterling, and we started talking about this last quarter as well. And when I say new model I'm thinking of certainly desktop, cloud and our enterprise business agreements. So everything that is ratable and subscription based is what I would drop into the new model. And then if you look at what's not there, obviously the biggest chunk is our maintenance business that's tied to our perpetual licenses, and then there's some smaller consulting and some smaller CFIN and some other bits. But think of new model as desktop, cloud and EBA, largely.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And the other big topic for last couple of weeks from investors is, Carl, go back to that Analyst Day when you talked about the 12% billings CAGR, 20% uplift in customer value, 50% increase in subscriber, especially that 12% CAGR in billings has been the one that's been on investors' minds. Can you either comment tonight or at least give us some idea if you're going to talk about how that actually shapes out under the new accelerated transition when we get to Analyst Day?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think probably the best thing to do is to tell you that we will talk about it at the Investor Day, and what we will do is we will update the financial model and our understanding of how the transition continues. And so we'll show you lots of detail about that and hopefully remove some of the confusion that exists about how we go about it. And what we did a little bit as a preview is to start pointing at some of the metrics that we think are more appropriate to understand the transition. We told you at the time, some of these were our best guess and mapped most easily to the history before it, and we said as we learned more about it and understood it better and would better pinpoint the things that we're looking at. And I think we did that today and we'll do more of it at the upcoming Investor Day.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Sterling, your notes have actually touched on a lot of the key dynamics in that transition as we move from a hybrid cloud model to one that is much more pure subscription model.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, I appreciate that. Last quick one, as you look at the last two quarters and the subscribers, is there anything in terms of seasonality or dynamics that would change one quarter versus the other in terms of total number of subscribers that we might expect or the mix in terms of those that are pure product subscription or desktop subscription customers?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I think obviously that the big effect that we'll see on total subscriber adds in the second half will be the attach rate, which we've said our attach rate of maintenance has grown materially over the last four quarters. It continues to be strong, and so as we see that end of sale of perpetual licenses at the end of Q4, a lot of those perpetual licenses with our current attach rate, that will drive a significant uptick in subscribers in Q4. For the new model types, they continue to grow \u2013 we're not seeing any seasonality in the new model types yet. They're growing year-on-year and they're growing sequentially at this point.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think we'll begin to understand seasonality in them later, but right now, they're so overwhelmingly affected by our promotions and the timing of announcement like end of sales that I would say that's certainly the first order effect and any seasonality is the second order one that won't get sorted out till later.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. Maybe just dig in on that subscriber count a little bit. Last year you guys saw a big seasonality into the second half of the year as upgrades went out, I think it was up like 36% from the first half into the second half. This year to get to the midpoint of your guidance you're looking for an even bigger seasonality and it seems like the answer of sort of how you get that bigger seasonality is the expiration of perpetual licenses on a significant part of your product portfolio.","So it's a two-part question, like, one, is that the right view, that is sort of primarily what you see, sort of a bolus of (47:35) subscribers into the back half? And two, maybe a little bit more philosophical, how do we understand sort of the true level of underlying demand when the past two years have been heavily influenced by these expirations? Or how do you guys get confidence into the level of underlying demand?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the answer to your first question is yes. You're fundamentally thinking about it correctly, and we do expect it to be much more back-end loaded because of the size and the importance of the products that will no longer be sold beyond the end of the year.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. But just for a bit of an order of magnitude on that, we talked about it being roughly half of our new model types. So not maintenance attached to perpetual, the new stuff, being roughly half of Q1 and better than half of our Q2 sub adds. So you can start to get a sense of it's not a new material \u2013 it's not a huge revenue driver at this point, in terms of our subscriber adds, it is a pretty significant chunk of our subscriber adds; the new model types. But yes, fundamentally what will drive the significant uptick in the second half is the end of sale of perpetual at the end of Q4.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then secondarily, just on the more philosophical, what we keep on emphasizing and we'll give you more insight to in a month, is that the business level remains where we expected it. The big difference is the way people are choosing to buy the products. It's not about the underlying business demand. It is fundamentally about the way they choose and, therefore, with the way they choose the way we account for that. And that's why we as well as you I'm sure are looking forward to when it all becomes back to a single model. We told you at the very beginning of this that the hardest part was going to be running a hybrid model where you have two, because goodness in one model looks like badness in the other and vice versa. They just eat away at each other and so getting back to a more holistic single model will be good, and that's back to Jay's comment about ripping off the BAND-AID. What we said, and we'll give details next week, is we're going to do that sooner than we were otherwise planning on doing.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Got it. On the SeeControl acquisition, I think Walter was talking about the potential for distraction coming from SeeControl. I think the other risk that investors see is OpEx growth coming from it. The longer-term target is assumed there'll be relatively muted OpEx growth over the next couple of years. Is SeeControl or acquisitions of this type, is that putting that let's call it mid-single digit OpEx growth profile for the next couple of years, does that put it at risk, by any sense?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not at all. The acquisitions like SeeControl and the others are all within the same envelope. When we gave that guidance, and as we move through it, we're consistent to that. We presumed it in the beginning even though we didn't know which acquisitions, and as we consider them internally, they are all within that. And you saw the OpEx growth this quarter that kind of \u2013 I mean it's right in line with everything that we told you would be the OpEx growth, and so no. These acquisitions are not at all \u2013 and as we've said before, both the small and this one getting to a medium size, wouldn't do that. The only exception I would ever say is if there happened to be a large one, I'm not saying there is one. We are not contemplating it any time. But as you know, large acquisitions and the costs they bring in the first year would affect that. But that is not in the plans and we're holding true to the mid-single digits OpEx growth.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then one last one from me, just in terms of free cash flow growth; you guys had talked about free cash flow growth being in line with billings growth. Mix shift has taken the revenues down a little bit, but I wouldn't expect that \u2013 that should not probably impact, since billings expectations stay the same, that billings and free cash flow model should stay roughly aligned?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, that's right. I mean the top line of \u2013 so free cash flow the way I would define it, is cash flow from ops minus CapEx. There's no significant changes coming in CapEx. The top line of the cash flow from ops is net income, and that will flow off of billings.","Keith Eric Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Excellent. Thank you, guys.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush. Your line is open.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just focused on the new model subscriptions here. I'm trying to rationalize some of the commentary with what we heard from the checks in which the desktop subscriptions, that promotion didn't seem to be doing nearly as well as the license plus extended maintenance promotion. And I'm wondering if the \u2013 you know, the success that you're having in the new model adds, could it be that given the lower ARPUs for the cloud products, is that helping significantly? And then maybe one follow-up on that as well.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, no, it's not about the cloud subscription. This is really comparing maintenance subscriptions to desktop subscriptions. I don't know how to answer the resolving it with the channel checks...","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Yes.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...that's always been a riddle beyond my pay grade. But no, don't think of it as something else and there's something not to understand. This is exactly people moving to desktop subscription for the kinds of products you imagine.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, that's exactly right. And the checks are \u2013 I think everyone knows this, but it's very difficult to extrapolate from a small subset to worldwide growth...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...and it's just always subject to variability.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, just from your point of view, because of our interactions with the channel is different, we're always somewhere between bewildered and bemused at reading the notes on channel.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sure. Sure.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And sometimes they're strikingly accurate and uncannily so and other days we're like did they talk to someone who had a bad day. And so we can tell you what we know about it but I mean, just to be very clear about that think of that as maintenance versus desktop subscriptions.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. So that's helpful. I guess for the follow-up kind of related, so it's not fair to ask you what's different about my checks, but I guess maybe going back to the mix, maybe the mix of people selling the desktop subscriptions. I would just comment we heard that most of the resellers were short of \u2013 well short of the goal that Autodesk gets set for them for the year and there was a lot of inconsistency around what that goal was. So, is that \u2013 yes, go ahead, sorry, Carl.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no, no, sorry, Steve, go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Just to finish it off.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You were posing the question.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Yes. Just to close that off, we're guessing that it seems that larger resellers are doing better. Is there a mix differences across the size of the resellers? You're clearly concentrating your efforts on making life better for those large resellers; just maybe any insight there or further commentary.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So first of all, sorry for trying to cut you off there.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","No problem.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I'd say is as we get deeper into this we'll do more analysis on it. Right now we don't have any distribution that looks dramatically different there. I mean, it's certainly an interesting question as to whether or not we're seeing anything there but I would say for the most part we did not see any of that.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, and we haven't structured the back-end so as to be different for large versus small, any more so than the normal channel structure would dictate. So there's nothing there that would favor that.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, okay...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, you know \u2013 yes.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sorry, Carl, go ahead.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I was just thinking that the mix of distributors and stuff out there and just going \u2013 but what we'll try to do is a month from now, we'll try to give you a little bit better insight into whether we see any variability in terms of the performance, but there's nothing that jumps out at us through the analysis of the quarter results that gave us any indication about that. But one thing I would say, though, about goals, and I think sometimes this is misconstrued in terms of people doing channel checks; it is true that sometimes our sales management team gets aggressive when we want new programs.","I'm just trying to send a message of what's important. I think in more steady state businesses where we really understand the performance you might set your overall target at 102% of what you expect, and the 2% on for example $600 million a quarter when it's relatively steady state is understandable. When we move to new things, sometimes we get aggressive and sometimes there is a little bit of a \u2013 assigned to the channel partners. Just directionally, this is where we expect you to have we think this is what's important and so sometimes some of the sales targets out there are more aggressive and they're definitely not consistent in terms of targets relative to what we think we will attain.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay, well thank you very much for taking my questions.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your line is open.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, thanks. So I know the cloud kind of helps you guys compete better, but one of the hardest parts that I hear from guys that are thinking about switching or companies that are thinking about switching from one vendor to another is the fear that the engineers have with regard to their old models won't translate over seamlessly. So how are you guys channeling that concern? Is that still an issue, or is that a legacy issue? Is that a data issue or is it not an issue at all? Thanks.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think this used to be a huge issue in the industry. One of the things that we've done with both our cloud and with the products is hopefully made it more of a non-issue. We will read in models from almost any vendor, dozens and dozens of different formats and operate on them almost as if they're natively. And I think, look, I would be worried if I had a 77 set of plans with 12 million parts in it. So the question is not does it translate, but how do you check that it translated 100% correctly?","And so I think there are some industries that will be slower in adopting this, but I think we're getting to the point where the majority, the mainstream of customers, deal with files that come from heterogeneous systems every day and have worked through that and have come to trust that the translation of these things just works well.","The one thing that's really good about this is moving this to the cloud has, digging a little bit deeper on the technical side, two nice benefits is that number one is the translations that existed in desktop products we were not able to see and could not see the failures of. When they're on the cloud, you can look at the failures. The second thing is as you recognize whatever shortcomings there are in the translation process, you can update those translations instantaneously. So there's a lot of benefits. Sort of while we're wholly protecting the customers' data and IP, you can actually give them a much better experience, and so it's one of the many benefits of doing this cloud-based engineering.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Richard.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead sir.","Abhey Lamba","Thanks, Operator, and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2020. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.

All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in the press release of slide presentation on our Investor Relations Web site.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Abhey. Building on our strong performance in Q2, we delivered another quarter of solid execution in results with revenue, billings, ARR, earnings, and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations.","For the first time we delivered over $1 billion in quarterly billings outside of a fourth quarter, and our last twelve months free cash flow came in at nearly $1 billion, breaking yet another company record. Broad based strength across our entire product portfolio and all geographic regions drove these results. We have strong momentum in Construction, are gaining share in Manufacturing, and we continue to make strides in converting the non-paying user base.","Before we dig into details from the quarter, I want to recognize the hard work put in by the entire Autodesk team, especially our colleagues in the bay area who ensured that our business did not experience any disruptions despite our San Rafael office, and many employees\u2019 homes being without power due to wildfires in the final days of the quarter. Our business continuity planning was flawless and the entire team went the extra mile to ensure that we did not miss a beat under very difficult circumstances.","Now, let me turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our third quarter results as well as details of our fiscal 2020 guidance. I\u2019ll then return with insights on key drivers of our business and provide an update on the progress of our strategic initiatives before we open it up for Q&A.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, ARR, earnings and free cash flow all performed ahead of expectations during the third quarter. Revenue growth of 28% was driven by strength across the board, with subscription revenue as the biggest driver.","Acquisitions from the fourth quarter of last year contributed four percentage points of growth. The revenue upside versus our guidance was largely driven by deals with up-front revenue recognition, including those with the federal government or that include certain products like Vault and VRED.","Some of these transactions were targeted for the fourth quarter and closed early. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our strong execution in the quarter. Total ARR grew by 28%, which is impressive in light of a tough year-on-year compare.","Our Cloud ARR grew164% tied to strong performance in Construction. Excluding $113 million of ARR from acquisitions, growth in our organic cloud portfolio came in at 35%. BIM 360 Design was once again the biggest driver of our organic Cloud revenue growth, with strength across all regions.","Indirect and direct revenue mix remained at 70% and 30% respectively. Revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 29% in the third quarter. AEC revenue increased 36% and Manufacturing rose 15%. Geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 30% in Americas and APAC, while EMEA grew by 24%.","Our maintenance to subscription program, or M2S, now in its third year, continued to yield great results. The M2S conversion rate increased to an all-time high of 40%. The uptick in the conversion rate was expected as our maintenance renewal prices increased by 20% in the second quarter, making it more cost-effective for customers to move to subscription.","Of those that migrated, upgrade rates came in at 21% in line with expectations. Net revenue retention rate continued to be within the range of 110% to 120% during the third quarter, and we expect it to be within this range in Q4.","Similar to Q1, some of the deeply discounted three-year subscriptions from a previous promotion came up for renewal. This group of customers renewed closer to list price, and we were pleased to see the total value from the entire cohort grow.","Billings grew 55% to more than $1 billion. The growth was driven by our organic business, contributions from Construction, and the return of multi-year contracts closer to historical levels. We believe our customers\u2019 willingness to make long-term commitments to our solutions underscores the business criticality of our products. And we are closely monitoring the rate of multi-year buying to ensure it doesn\u2019t create a headwind to future cash flows.","Remaining performance obligations, or RPO, which is the sum of billed and unbilled deferred revenues, rose 32% and 6% sequentially to almost $3 billion. Current RPO, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months, was $2.1 billion, an increase of 23%. This is a solid leading indicator of the strength of our business.","On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins were very strong at 92%, slightly up quarter over quarter and up two percentage points versus last year.","Revenue growth, combined with our disciplined approach to expense management enabled us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 13 percentage points to 27%. We are on track to deliver further margin expansion in Q4 and approximately 40% non-GAAP operating margin in fiscal 2023.","Moving to free cash flow, we generated $267 million in Q3. Over the last twelve months, we generated a record $972 million of free cash flow, demonstrating the power of our subscription model and strength of our products.","Lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. During the third quarter, we repurchased 856,000 shares for $124 million at an average price of $144.49 per share.","Year-to-date we have repurchased 1.7 million shares for $264 million at an average price of $156.16 per share. In addition, we paid down another $100 million on the term loan associated with the fourth quarter fiscal 2019 acquisitions and intend to repay the remaining $150 million by the end of fiscal 2020.","Now I\u2019ll turn the discussion to our outlook. Our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business remains unchanged from last quarter. As you will soon hear from Andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in segments experiencing some near-term headwinds.","Our full-year revenue outlook has been updated for the upside we experienced in the third quarter, partially offset by the early signing of some transactions initially targeted for the fourth quarter.","At the mid-point of our updated guidance, we are calling for revenue and ARR growth to be approximately 27% and 25%, respectively. Additionally, currency is now expected to drive an incremental headwind of about $5 million to our full year revenue.","We are adjusting our ARR outlook as some of the expected Q4 upfront subscription revenue was recognized in the third quarter. Additionally, fourth quarter ARR is being impacted modestly by the currency headwind.","As a reminder, we calculate ARR by multiplying our reported quarterly subscription and maintenance revenues times four. Our billings forecast has been updated to reflect our strong performance and the momentum behind multi-year deals.","We expect long term deferred revenue to be in the mid 20% range of total deferred revenue at the end of the year. Strong billings and operational execution are driving the upside to our free cash flow outlook for fiscal 2020, which is now expected to be $1.30 billion to $1.34 billion.","Looking at our guidance for the fourth quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $880 million to $895 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to $0.91. The earnings slide deck on the investor relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions.","Looking out to fiscal 2021, we expect continued strength, with revenue and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range. In line with our normal practice, we will provide a more detailed fiscal 2021 forecast on our next earnings call.","In summary, I want to remind everyone that since our business model shift, we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenues, less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses.","We are committed to driving revenue growth while expanding operating margins. We delivered revenue growth plus free cash flow margin of 62% in the last twelve months and plan to end the year at around 67%. Overall, I'm proud of our performance and are confident of delivering on our near-term and long-term targets.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Scott. As you heard, resiliency of our business model combined with strong momentum in our products and great execution by the team helped deliver another outstanding quarter despite continued uncertainty in some parts of the world.","In terms of the macro conditions, demand remained relatively in line with the second quarter. The business environment and our results improved slightly in the UK and central Europe, and our commercial business in China continues to perform well despite a slow down in state owned enterprises.","During the quarter Robertson Group, one of the largest independently owned construction companies in the UK to cover the entire construction lifecycle, significantly increased their adoption of our BIM 360 portfolio. The company deployed our software on over 60 projects over the last three years and estimates a 28% increase in productivity. This is an incredible return on investment.","We are thrilled to be partnering with a company prioritizing such impressive continuous improvement. In another example, one of the largest automotive parts suppliers in central Europe nearly doubled their EBA commitment with us this quarter.","With the move to electric vehicles, the customer knows innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. So they are investing in retooling their factory and migrating from 2D to 3D. Our customers understand the benefits of investing in growth opportunities under all kinds of economic conditions.","These examples underscore the importance of our products regardless of the macro environment as well as our customers' commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead of competitors.","Last week, we hosted 12,000 people at Autodesk University and customers walked away excited about our current products and our vision for their industries. In fact, 32% more customers attended the conference this year than in the previous year. Across the board, customers are looking to Autodesk to help them digitally transform their businesses and make them more competitive.","Before I go into strategic updates from the quarter, let me also acknowledge that, for the fifth consecutive year, AU Las Vegas was a carbon neutral event. This sustainable effort is reinforced and expanded by Autodesk\u2019s commitment to achieve company carbon neutrality in 2020.","We\u2019re also delivering and continuing to investigate ways to help customers realize their sustainability goals through automation and insights in our technology. In fact, over the next few years, we intend to ramp up our financial commitment to this work by investing approximately 1% of operating profits in the Autodesk Foundation.","Now, let me give you an update on some of the key initiatives, specifically our continued traction within Construction, gains in Manufacturing, and successes in monetizing our non-paying user base. These are the initiatives that continue to be key drivers of our business.","In Construction, the breadth and depth of our product portfolio continues to make our offerings more compelling for our customers. In the last two years, the number of participants from the Construction industry at Autodesk University increased over seven-fold to approximately 3,500.","At AU this year, we announced Autodesk Construction Cloud, which combines our advanced technology with the industry\u2019s largest network of builders and powerful predictive insights to drive more productivity, predictability and profitability for companies across the construction lifecycle.","Autodesk Construction Cloud is comprised of our best-of-breed construction solutions, Assemble, BuildingConnected, BIM 360 and PlanGrid, and connects these solutions with Autodesk\u2019s unmatched design technology, such as AutoCAD, and our 3D modeling solutions Revit and Civil 3D.","The announcement included more than 50 new product enhancements across the portfolio and deeper integrations, including powerful new artificial intelligence that helps construction teams identify and mitigate design risks before problems occur. Autodesk Construction Cloud is being well received by customers and supports our long-term plan.","PlanGrid and BuildingConnected continued their momentum, delivering $113 million in ARR with growth coming from new customers as well as adoption by existing Autodesk customers.","During the quarter, one of Australia\u2019s largest construction and infrastructure companies expanded its relationship with us by adding PlanGrid and BIM 360 to its existing product set.","The transaction resulted in the largest new product agreement for PlanGrid globally and the largest regional enterprise deal to date. We are helping the company adopt cloud-based technologies to improve project delivery and safety.","The depth and breadth of our solutions, that many other vendors in the space cannot deliver, is very appealing to our customers. For example, we enhanced our relationship with EBC, one of Canada\u2019s leading construction companies focused on infrastructure, buildings and natural resources, by adding BuildingConnected to their existing portfolio of Assemble and BIM 360 solutions.","Our sales team demonstrated how we could help manage their systems more effectively and prepare them better for the future. We were able to meet their needs for the design and construction phases of the building lifecycle for both the commercial and infrastructure industry segments.","We continue to focus our investments on infrastructure, which has performed well in prior downturns. This focus could offer us greater resiliency should the macro environment weaken. We recently announced availability of Collaboration for Civil 3D, which is now included with BIM 360 Design, and enables teams to collaborate on complex infrastructure projects.","We also continue to gain market share in the infrastructure space. This quarter we significantly expanded our relationship with JR Group, made up of seven companies responsible for operating almost all of Japan\u2019s inter-city and commuter rail services.","As part of our strategic collaboration, all seven of the group\u2019s companies will use our tools such as Revit, CIVIL 3D, and AutoCAD, over competitive offerings to develop a nationwide BIM rail standard.","Moving to manufacturing, the business is performing extremely well as we continue to gain share from competitors with steady innovations in generative design and Fusion 360. We believe a large number of small and medium-sized businesses will look to upgrade their vendor stack over the next few years, which is a clear opportunity for us to grow market share.","Similar to last quarter, we had a number of competitive displacements of SolidWorks, MasterCAM, and PTC Creo. For instance, a 3D display designer and manufacturer in North America replaced SolidWorks and MasterCAM with Fusion 360 because of its integrated design and CAM capabilities.","In another instance, a manufacturer of plastic machined components in the UK displaced SolidWorks and another CAM vendor with Fusion 360 in their design and manufacturing workflow. The company was attracted to Fusion\u2019s cloud based collaboration capabilities in addition to the integrated functionality and price point.","Our success in Manufacturing is not limited to small and medium-sized businesses. We are making inroads in larger organizations as well. During the third quarter, Daifuku, chose Autodesk as the best design software partner to move from 2D to 3D solutions.","Based in Japan, Daifuku is the worlds leading material handling systems supplier serving a variety of industries, including the manufacturing, distribution, airport, and automotive sectors. With its new EBA the company has standardized on Inventor as its 3D platform and is also considering Revit for future building initiatives.","We continue to invest in our Manufacturing solutions, in fact, some of you might have seen the exciting news coming out of Adutodesk University last week. We announced a partnership with ANSYS and our customers will soon have an option to use ANSYS\u2019 simulation solutions while running our industry leading generative design workflows in Fusion 360.","We also announced the introduction of a new end to end, design-through-make workflow for electronics in Fusion 360; providing key capabilities such as integrated PCB design and thermal simulation.","This is something our customers have been asking for as the market for smart products continues to grow. With Fusion 360, users can take those electronic ideas and physically produce them in the same product development environment, bypassing the current disconnects between design, simulation and manufacturing that make data importing and translation necessary.","Lastly, we are looking forward to meeting some of you at our Manufacturing event at the Autodesk Technology Center in Birmingham UK on Monday, December 2nd. At that time, you'll learn even more about our solutions and strategy in the space.","Now, let\u2019s close with an update of our progress with digital transformation and how it is allowing us to monetize the non-compliant user base. Our investments in our digital infrastructure have given us unprecedented access to non-compliant users\u2019 product usage patterns.","We continue to learn more about these users and are in the process of expanding our compliance programs in additional regions. During the quarter, we signed 19 license compliance deals over $500,000, including three over $1 million. The mix of deals over $500,000 was equally distributed by region and one of the million dollar plus transactions was with a commercial entity in China.","Our approach to creating positive experiences for our customers as they become compliant is paying dividends. For instance, one large manufacturer in central Europe was paying for less than 10 manufacturing collections and had some old perpetual licenses.","Our data indicated much higher usage. We worked closely with our partner and senior management at the company to identify and fix the non-compliant usage, resulting in almost a million-dollar contract.","The experience provided during the process has opened the door for us to discuss competitive displacement to further expand their usage as they now view us as a true partner rather than a software vendor.","I am excited about our year to date performance and looking forward to a strong close to the year. We continue to execute well in Construction, and are making competitive inroads in Manufacturing with our innovative solutions.","I am also proud of the strides we are making in converting the current non-paying users into subscribers. Twenty years ago, Autodesk was known as the AutoCAD Company, today through the rapidly growing install base of 3D products like Revit, Inventor, Maya, and Fusion 360, we lead the market in bringing the power of 3D modeling and the cloud to all the industries we serve.","We are highly confident in Autodesk\u2019s ability to capitalize on not only our near term market opportunity, but also our long-term opportunity connected to the rise of AI driven 3D modeling in the cloud. Because of this, we remain committed to delivering on our fiscal 2023 goals.","With that, Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Hey, Andrew, hey Scott; thanks for taking my questions here.","Scott Herren","Hey, Saket.","Saket Kalia","Hey, Scott maybe just to start with you just on the ARR guide and the adjustment. It sounded like there was a little bit of a tie-in with the upfront deals that signed in the quarter. I guess the question is, were these upfront deals that were originally expected to come in as subscription, but then came in as upfront? I guess from an ARR perspective I just -- I imagine signing it in Q3 as a subscription wouldn't make as much of a difference to Q4 ARR, but I'd love to just understand the dynamic there around the upfront deals this quarter and how it sort of impacted the ARR outlook for the year?","Scott Herren","Yes. It's a great question, Saket. Thanks for putting it out there. I think you are probably not the only one scratching their heads. Here\u2019s the way you got to think about it. The -- if you step back and think of the way we define ARR, its actual reported subscription plus maintenance revenue for the quarter. And then we annualized it by multiplying by four. So we'll give you a full-year ARR number. What we're really saying is, just what we think our Q4 subscription revenue numbers -- subscription and maintenance revenue number will be times four.","What you saw in Q3 is we had a fair amount of upside in the revenue line versus the midpoint of guide revenue was $18 million higher than the midpoint. Some of what drove that was upfront revenue. We always have a little bit of upfront revenue. So we have a couple of products, smaller products that under ASC 606 don't qualify for ratable treatment. So we sell them just like a subscription. They look -- the economics of them looked like a subscription. The customer buys it. They have to renew in 12 months. But under 606 you have to claim on that revenue upfront. It's small product like Vault that fall in this category.","What happened in Q3 is we had a handful of deals for this small product set that we felt were coming in Q4. Actually we got closed in Q3, and because they are upfront that revenue moved out of Q4 and into Q3. And there's no tail. There's no ongoing -- all of their revenue is recognized upfront. This happens every quarter, but this was particularly magnified where we had a handful of these deals that we thought were coming in Q4, actually came in Q3 instead. So, good news is Q3 looks super strong. The downside is that creates a headwind to the Q4 subscription and maintenance revenue and therefore to the Q4 ARR calculation. So it's kind of a combination of ASC 606 in the way it treats. So just a small subset of our products and then how that gets rippled through in the way we calculate ARR, which is actual reported revenue times four.","What's important to remember is a couple of things. One is, the way the rev rec works is not necessarily -- it doesn't reflect the economics of the transaction. We sell these on a subscription basis and they look to our customers just like any other subscription. So there's changes there are isn\u2019t reflective of any kind of change in the overall economics of our business. I think the second is, when you peel back the growth that we're going to see in subscription revenue this year and you can derive this from the guidance we just gave you, Saket, we see subscription revenue continuing to grow for the full year, because that's an accumulated metric. It's Q1 plus Q2, plus Q3, plus Q4.","When revenue moves across quarter lines, it doesn't matter when you aggregate it to the full year. For the full-year we see subscription revenues growing into 29% to 30% range. So still feel strong about that. We just got this anomaly between kind of the way 606 treats a small subset of products and how that gets reflected in our ARR. That's what you see in the ARR guidance change.","Saket Kalia","Yes. Sure. That makes sense. It sounds like those Vault deals were maybe term subscriptions which under 606 kind of requires that that upfront\u2026?","Scott Herren","It has more to do with the product, Saket, than the way we sell it. We sell it just like we sell every other product. 12 months you -- they pay us upfront. They get access to the product at the end of that 12-month period they either renew and continue to use the product or they don't renew and they lose access to the product. So it's really transparent to a customer. It's more -- some of the details of the offering itself under 606 don't qualify for ratable treatments.","Saket Kalia","Got it. If I can ask a quick follow-up for you, Andrew, just to get off accounting. I mean really interesting development in the CAD market. Just more talk about SaaS adoption. Obviously we saw Onshape got acquired. And clearly you compete here with tools like Fusion 360. But curious how you think about SaaS adoption in CAD? And what if anything that deals can mean for Autodesk competitively?","Andrew Anagnost","First off, let me just kind of say that I have a lot of respect for John Herstig and the work that he has done over the years. I\u2019ve respect for Jim Heppelmann and the work he has done in the past. And I think there are important forces in this industry, but the way this is all coming down and characterized is just off. Okay. So let's talk about what we all agree on and what's happening, what's really happening in the markets. So here we all agree on. Multi-tenant SaaS is the future of our business. It's the future of the entire software because I have been saying this for seven years now, okay? Seven years and we've been executing on it for seven years. Fusion 360 is a multi-tenant SaaS offering with the SaaS business model.","Here's the other thing we agree on. What does this SaaS means? It means three important things. Data; the cloud is going to revolutionize data flow in the manufacturing and product development industry. Is just going to revolutionize multi-disciplinary data flow, data flow across various parts of supply, it just going to revolutionize data flow, compute, compute power. We're able to deploy compute power through the cloud in ways we've never been able to before, what we do a [general] [ph] design, that's all computed off the desktop. It's all \u2013 that is all a cloud compute exercise.","And then the last thing I think we all agree on that. We don't \u2013 I'll talk about this equally and some of us are actually executing on it, is that we can layer machine learning on top of this data layer and with this compute and we can start doing predictive analytics and all sorts of predictive and insightful studies on top of what people do. Some of our general design algorithms already incorporate machine learning with regards to how they integrate CAM. So we all agree on that. All right? It's the uniform - and we're all building that to some degree. We\u2019re I think quite a bit ahead and I'll get to that in a minute","But here is what we don't agree on is how you do it. All right? And there is a big difference between the way Fusion and Onshape works. Fusion has taken a strategy where we have a thin client which is a browser and we have a thick client which is installed on the desktop and worked on that cloud data layer. The thin client and thick clients see the world exactly the same. They can't operate without the cloud behind it. There are dead without it. The reason we have the thick client is we're solving an additional problem. It's end-to-end workflow all the way from design to CAM, electronics and all these things. So we're putting a huge amount of power in there that you want \u2013 if you want to get in there in order to solve the bigger problem.","Onshape put CAD in the browser, a thin client. We knew from our thin client experiments early on, which is like seven years ago, that don't work, okay? That boat don't float. And one thing we've just seen from this acquisition is we were right. What was Onshape installed base? Eight years into this experiment, 5,000 subscribers. We did more than that. We added more subscribers to the Fusion base in Q3 than that entire installed base. So we're talking tens of thousands of paid Fusion subscribers. And we're talking about 5,000 subscribers for Onshape. We know exactly why, because that thin client only solution doesn't work. You need a thin client and a thick client.","Sure the thick client will probably get thinner over time, but that's what you need today. And you also need a new business model with the different prices and the different options. So, we just have a different view of how to do it. And we're pretty convinced we're way ahead. I think the data now -- now that we can see the data, we're now confirming that we're way ahead. But that's kind of where we're at. We all see the world the same way. We're executing on it differently and the market is voting with its wallet.","Saket Kalia","Very helpful guys. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Saket.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. I'm wondering at this part of the transition you mentioned the increase in the maintenance pricing, but what are the additional levers that you have to drive increases in ARR growth on a dollar basis moving forward?","Scott Herren","Sterling, it's a lot of the same factors that we've talked about. So, obviously the renewal base continues to grow. That renewal base comes to us at a better set the price realization than a net new does. We continue to drive growth out of construction. And you saw. We gave you some of the data points both in the opening commentary and in the press release.","Construction business drove a $113 million of ARR in third quarter. So, we continue to see strong growth there as well. Well, the core basically grows to a certain degree every year. We've -- I'd say 6% to 8% growth in the core every year. So the same factors we've always talked about that will continue to drive that growth. I think one thing to bear in mind;, we're in year three of the M2S program. And maybe the very first cohort of interest customers we signed. We've locked in their price for three years depends at the end of that time we said they revert to the terminal price, which for that set of customers will be about 11% price increase.","We begin to see the front edge of that even for the M2S base that's been locked in. It will start to ripple in the second quarter of next year. So, besides just our annual price increase rhythm that we've gotten on, there is a few embedded price increases that will be coming through over the next few years as well. So, piracy recapture, construction, renewal base growth into an embedded price increases is what will drive it longer-term.","Sterling Auty","Got it. And then the one follow-up would be your kind of surpassed already what you expect in terms of long-term deferred as the mix. You talked about the percentage of multiyear deals. What I'm kind of curious about is what is the collection terms that you're offering to drive some of the collection of these multiyear deals?","Scott Herren","You know, its standard three years upfront, 10% discount. I think you see most companies that sell on an annual subscription basis will offer that kind of 10% is obviously a bit better than the cost of money over three years, but not a whole lot more. And there's no extended ARR terms. There's nothing else that goes with that. What I'd say just to perhaps get it what's underneath your questions, Sterling is, we're monitoring that very carefully.","And one of the reasons that I went ahead and gave you some headlights on fiscal 2021 both revenue growing in the low 20% range and free cash flow growing in the low 20% range is I didn't want there to be this building perception that because multi-years reverting to the mean, but that was somehow upgrading a headwind and we wouldn't be able to see the same kind of free cash flow growth next year. Obviously it's an outsized growth this year going from $300 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2019 to 1.3 billion to 1.34 billion this year. But we see that growing another 20% next year in fiscal 2021.","So we're monitoring the multi-year -- the percent of sales multiyear very closely. And if we see it begin to run too hot where we think it's not sustainable and it will begin to create a headwind. We'll modify the offering.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks Sterling.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Phil Winslow","Hey, thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. Just question on the next year's outlook its building on your comments just now. When you think about the macro comments that you've made in terms of geographies, as well as the different verticals. How are you thinking about the puts and takes for 2021 and then just one quick follow-up to that?","Scott Herren","Yes. Did you say for 2021?","Phil Winslow","Yes.","Scott Herren","Yes. So first off let me comment on kind of how we view things since we talked last quarter. There really hasn't been a fundamental change in our view of the market right now. In fact, a few things got a little bit better, right? The UK and Germany are still performing below our expectations, but they're growing and they showed a slight improvement in Q4 relative \u2013 I mean, Q3. I can't see that far in the future yet. In Q3 relative to what we saw in Q2.","The same goes for China. We're still not doing any business with the state-owned enterprises, but the business continued to grow just below our expectation. So we actually saw a little bit about firming up not a deterioration in the business, which is a good sign. Now as we look into next year, we're not seeing any fundamental change in the places where we've seen weakness. But more importantly, there's a trend going on that I want you to pay attention to which is a tailwind for us as we move into any situation that we see in the next year and how we feel about next year.","People are moving more and more rapidly to the model-based solutions we're deploying and the cloud-based solutions we're deploying, because they see those as fundamental to their competitive shift. There are competitive dynamics. We're seeing a continued acceleration of BIM. That's going to continue into next year. BIM mandates, BIM project specs is going to continue. Inventor and Fusion 360 are growing as we head into next year. And the momentum on construction is solid.","In addition to that one of the things that we always see as anti cyclical as we head into any kind of environment is infrastructure, and over the last year we've been investing in infrastructure capabilities in our products and a lot of those are going to show up next year and they're going to show up both with regards to some of our construction portfolio and some of our design portfolio. So we feel pretty good heading into next year. And that's one of the reasons why in the opening commentary we affirmed this low single-digits growth in free cash flow for next year.","Andrew Anagnost","Low 20.","Scott Herren","Yes. Low 20. Didn't did I say it's low 20. Sorry. Thank you for correcting. That would have been -- that would have - definitely have said somebody, that your low 20s -- to low 20% cash flow increase year-over-year.","Phil Winslow","Great. That's great color. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on that for Scott obviously you're not guiding to operating income or operating expenses, but also just help me think about sort of the framework for next year, because obviously this is investment year plus acquisitions, just high level, give us your thought process on the expense side. Then I will get back into queue.","Scott Herren","Okay. Alright. Thanks Phil on that. One of the things that we've said is we expected growth \u2013 spend growth and also COGS plus OpEx between 20 and 23 to be in this high single to low double-digit range. If you look at the growth we had this year spend growth and the guidance will be about 9%. But the overwhelming majority of that came via acquisition. So the organic business has been roughly flat now for about four years and there is some pent-up demand for increased sales capacity for continued investment in digitization.","So, what I would model for fiscal 2021 is something towards the higher end of that low single to double-digit \u2013 sorry, high single to low double-digit range. So closer to the low double-digit range for fiscal 2021, but then averaging out in that high single to low double throughout fiscal 2023. Does that get what you're asking about that?","Phil Winslow","Yes. That's perfect. Thank you very much.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Phil.","Andrew Anagnost","We're experiencing some digit dyslexia here.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. I guess just two quick ones, but one just following up on what Phil was just talking about. If you look out to next year would you say that the environment that you're expecting the environment to be stronger weaker or the same than what you had this year when you're when you're thinking about the puts and takes of everything you were just talking about?","And then just was wondering how do you think about in the context of what you were just saying about expense growth. How do you think about managing operating margins if the macro-environment did start to go against you? I am just trying to think about the trade-off between driving growth versus protecting margins, if you could just share with us your philosophy there? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","So we absolutely expect things to stay fairly consistent heading into next year. I like to highlight the counter cyclical aspects of our business right now with regards to BIM mandates, with regards to the momentum around displacing SolidWorks and Mastercam and smaller accounts for fusion with regards to digitization and construction, with regards to infrastructure because these are important things to keep in mind. But our assumptions into next year is places where we saw our soft already continued to be soft relative to our expectations. And we're going to continue to see kind of the same thing heading into the rest of the markets. I'll let Scott comment on the investment model.","Scott Herren","Yes. The only thing I'd add to what Andrew just said before I jumping on spend management is, we do think by the way there continues to be an accelerating opportunity that's not necessarily tied to overall macro spend environment in areas like construction and the momentum that you see us gaining in piracy recapture. Understood management question, Heather, you see us really exercise good spend management muscles for four consecutive years at this point.","I feel good about our ability to do that. I mentioned that there is pent-up demand for spend there is. But to the extent that we see the business beginning to trend lower than what we expected of course we'll tighten up on that front. I think it's a muscle that we built. That doesn't -- it's taken time. It doesn't go away overnight. So I think you can expect us to continue to be diligent in management. That said with the revenue growth we're expecting, next year we will not only grow revenues, we'll be able to grow spend and expand margins. We are expecting expanded operating margins next year versus this year. So I think we're pretty well-positioned from a spend management standpoint next year.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks Heather.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you and good evening. Andrew, I was pretty intrigued by your several references to infrastructure which is a business that as you know once upon a time the Company broke out and it looks as though it's still about a quarter to a third of your total AEC business even after including ACS. And so I'm wondering if that's a business that you might revert to reporting out in some way and also just talk about what you think the growth potential is of infrastructure as a proportion of the total legacy revenue?","And then as follow-up longer-term question as well regarding your sales mix. That is to say your 50-50 mix expectations direct and indirect we'd have to wreck potentially be in the store. On that point could you talk about whether you're still confident in the stores becoming half of half or a quarter of the total. What are the limitations you think or risks to that trajectory of growth for the store? And if it doesn't come through how are you thinking about reverting spending or redirecting spending and sales development back towards named account direct and channel?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. So you asked a couple of questions there. So let me let me start on the infrastructure questions. So, no, we're not going to be breaking out the business or providing any more color on what's percentage. But what I can tell you is that we've made some deliberate investments in rail and road, some of those have already shown up this year, more we're going to show up early next year that are targeted at where we believe some of the sweet spots in spending are going to be in areas where we have strength.","You might have also noticed that we moved similar Civil 3D into the BIM 360 design environment. So now the same collaborative power that we have on Revit models is available for Civil 3D models. That's important. That was something that customers were looking for. And another thing we're doing that you'll start to see progress on is this notion of a common data environment, which is really important to infrastructure projects. And it's important to particularly infrastructure projects in Europe, but even in the U.S., people are really interested in these ISO-compliant, common data environment. That's going to be showing up really soon as well.","So we have made some clear targeted investments that we believe allow us to go where the real opportunity is in that space. And on top of that, if you've been following what's happening with InfraWorks that products really growing up. And it's integration with Esri, and some of the things we've done there are actually pretty compelling and pretty interesting. Now with regards to the long-term targets, alright, so you're right. Right now about we're at 30% between direct and indirect. And the reason for that is not that the stores growing. The store is growing a lot, all right. It's still our fastest growing channel in the Company, okay?","So, our digital direct channel is still the fastest-growing channel in the company. It's a fastest growing. Why isn't it showing more progress towards the goal? The truth the matter is, is that the channel grew well, too, all right. It grew robustly. And I think we should all celebrate that. And at the same time what happens is because right now the store is essentially majority an LT channel. That's not totally true because we sell the whole portfolio there. And we capture a lot of construction solutions usually direct. It's margin neutral right now, because the margin we make off of LT to the channel into the stores the same. So we're getting the same economics.","That said, I'm not backing away at all from the 50-50 split or the 25 -- the half of that direct being from the digital direct channels. We're still going to achieve that. Remember, I always characterized that as a long-term target. And there's lots of things that haven't lit up yet that are going to help with that. Things associated with piracy recapture things associated with construction. There's a whole set of things over the next few years that are going to go into tip the balance on that number. So we're still confident. We're getting the economics we want. So we're getting the price realization. We want especially on the things that would most likely go digital direct. So we are still committed to that mix long term.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","You're welcome.","Scott Herren","Thanks Jay.","Andrew Anagnost","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matt Hedberg","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. The results of converting non-compliant users was impressive. I guess, first of all, was this the best quarter for converting these non-compliant users? And then on a go-forward basis should we expect more of the same as this cadence or are there additional steps that can, in fact, convert even more of these users?","Andrew Anagnost","So Matt, here here's a few things I wanted to characterize there. First off, we're absolutely on the plan that we always intended for this model. Every year we're taking a set of steps that we believe we are going to materially improve our penetration into the non-compliant base. And every year there'll be a set of new steps that we believe will provide some additional ramp-up in that space as well. So what do we do this year? We rolled out in product communication and tracking of how the priority of user journey -- the non-compliant user at journeys through the lifecycle of learning their non-compliant and what options they take as they travel through that cycle.","We introduced those things we rolled it out throughout the year across more and more countries. And yes, we're seeing results that we expected primarily through two things. One, we're increasing better leads to our inside license compliance teams and we are converting people digitally as well through some of the digital communication. But the digital communication also creates these better leads. To put in context we have to kind of get a sense for what happened. Last year we did 21 deals over $500,000 in piracy whole entire year, 21 deals. In Q3 alone we did 19 deals over $500,000. So you can see yes, we are seeing increases in momentum. And there's a whole slew of things that we'll talk about later. There will be doing next year that will provide us to not only get even more intelligence on this space but make it more challenging for the base to jump to another pirated solution. Okay? And that will be a discussion for later. But this is to plan. Every year there's something that rolls out and every year we seem to be getting the results that we want from this program. And given what we know we're doing next year we feel confident we're going to continue to get the results we expect to get.","Matt Hedberg","Super helpful, Andrew. And then maybe, Scott just a quick one for you. On the multiyear renewals it's good to hear that, these are renewing closer to list price. Just a quick question, I wonder if you could comment on the churn you're seeing for these? Is it about what do you expect? That piece would be helpful.","Scott Herren","Yes. Matt it is. And to be clear what I was talking about it is if you remember in Q3 of fiscal 2018, as we started down this path of selling nothing but subscriptions, we offered a promotion for legacy customers turning in your perpetual license. And for a 50% discount you can get three years of the same product on product subscription. That was actually quite a successful. If you remember we get over 40,000 of those. That three-year term came due during this last quarter. While we saw, we expected there to be a higher than normal churn rate and we didn't see that.","But the aggregate value of that customer set actually grew. So I think the promotion was quite successful. I've got people to try to move over to the product subscription and the aggregate value after renewal and they renewed closer to list, not in a 50% discount grow over that timeframe. So it was successful, but it did create a little bit of a headwind on our volume renewal basis.","Andrew Anagnost","On a unit basis.","Scott Herren","On a unit basis. Remember we started talking about renewal also as net revenue retention rate or sometimes I'll call it in our three -- and our three for the quarter continued to run in that 110% to 120% range overall. So this was -- it was accretive to that metric.","Matt Hedberg","That's great. Well done guys. Thanks Matt","Scott Herren","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Hamza Fodderwala","Hey guys. It's Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the fiscal 2020 ARR outlook. So it looks like it was lower by about a 0.5 at the midpoint part of that was FX. And some of that was upfront revenue. Any sense that we could get for the magnitude of the greater upfront revenue because I mean to me it seems like the macro situation in Europe and North America was sequentially better. So I guess why wouldn't that carry forward into Q4 and reaffirmed the 25% to 27% growth outlook that you gave last quarter?","Scott Herren","Yes. Tom, the amount of upfront revenue that moved from Q4 back into Q3 was about 5 million. So that was -- that contributed to the upside in Q3 revenue. But remember the way we do ARR, subscription revenue times four. That by itself was a $20 million headwind to ARR in the fourth quarter. The fact is \u2013 but remember, that's upfront revenue. So there is no tail of deferred once we put that in. And because of 606 we have the claim all that revenue upfront. There is no Q4 impact of those. It just moved from Q4 back into Q3. That you see the full-year revenue.","We see we've guided that point up, because float revenue is an accumulated metric. It's one plus Q2 plus Q3 plus Q4. ARR just taken a snapshot of Q4 subscription and maintenance revenue and multiply by four. So the midpoint of that ARR guidance change was $30 million. Twenty of it was just driven by this effect was about $5 million of incremental headwind from FX and about the same amount of just product mix. Does that does that clear up in your mind the move from Q4 back to Q3 and why it's an impact to ARR?","Hamza Fodderwala","Yes. So i guess ex those changes, would ARR growth have been sort of reiterated if it wasn't for those onetime impact?","Scott Herren","Absolutely. Exactly. And the interesting thing about this Tom is, the economics of our business by the way are completely divorced from the rev ramp issue that we're talking about. The economics of the business are unchanged. It just between having the claim that as non-ratable upfront revenue and moving it back into Q3, and the way we define ARR as quarterly revenue. It's that combination that drove the change in Q4 ARR.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. This is an interesting collision between the way we define ARR and the 606 accounting rules.","Hamza Fodderwala","Yes. It's always exciting. So I guess just one quick follow-up. So the billings obviously came in much stronger than expected. To what extent is the shift to multiyear deals performing better than you expected coming into the year? And should we expect that long-term DR mix to continue trending higher because it's already kind of around the mid-20% range of total that we've seen historically? That's it for me.","Scott Herren","Okay. Thanks for that too. Billings growth at 55% and over a $1 billion of billings in Q3 super strong. And the biggest factor driving that is the growth of our renewal base. That has nothing to do with multi-years. Is just the overall growth of renewal base. Beyond that the contribution from our construction business, construction continues to perform really well. With the noise around the ARR guide, we haven't really focused on the success of our construction business as much as we probably should have. It continues to perform really well and it's driving upside to our billings as well. Multi-year is part of it and you're right, we're already add long-term deferred at about 25% of total deferred.","If you go back historically by the way, back into fiscal 2017 and 2018 before we began this transition, by long-term deferred ran as high as 30% of total deferred at one point. I don't think it gets back to that level. I think we keep it in this low to mid-20% range in terms of long-term as a percent of total. To the extent that it ran hot and I said this earlier in other words we were selling more multi-year than I thought we could sustain longer-term. I'd like to make a change in the offering. What I don't want to do is drive volatility and free cash flow because of the offering we've got out there for multiyear. At this point I don't think we've done that. But if it continued to accelerate that something we take a look at.","Hamza Fodderwala","Thank you very much.","Scott Herren","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Brad Zelnick","Great. Thanks so much for fitting me. Andrew, you highlighted the launch of Autodesk Construction Cloud at AU this year. What excites you most about the offering? How is the customer feedback into the launch? And how do you see it driving growth next year?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. What excites me a lot about this is the way we are unifying the whole entire stack around this common data environment and it's a real great return on the investment we made in BIM 360 docs, because that entire environment is becoming the common data environment and PlanGrid integrating into it, BuildingConnected integrating into it. The existing BIM 360 stack has already integrated into it. And everybody is looking at this insight internally within the development saying wow this is this is an amazing opportunity for us to bring these things together. So the whole ability to have a conversation with the customers about here's the umbrella brand and how we're bringing all these things together so that they actually communicate is a really exciting part of this. And I think it's going to come rapidly and customers are going to be delighted.","When we rolled it out there were 50 new enhancements and there's a reason why those 50 new enhancements were in there is because we invested in acceleration of the integrations with respect to some of these things were moving faster not slowing down. I'm really excited about the pace of what's going on. I'm excited about what the team has been doing. And I'm frankly excited about how well we're winning in the market. People look at what we're doing. They look five years out at the landscape and they say okay I'm going to place my bet with Autodesk. And I think that's a credit to the team. I guess, credit to the momentum they've kept in here. And I think the whole story around construction cloud and the way they rolled it out and told you it is really a great piece of work by the team. So I'm really proud of them.","Brad Zelnick","Awesome. And Andrew, if I could just add another one for you. Your results seem to demonstrate continued success in executing on M&A. How should we think about your appetite for additional deals in both construction and manufacturing?","Andrew Anagnost","Well, we've always said that as we look out to the business we will continue to be acquisitive as we were in the past at the very least. We always look at the market for organic and inorganic opportunities. Right now we feel like our construction portfolio has most of what it needs. We're partnering aggressively. We could potentially do tech tuck-ins around the construction solution. As we look into other parts of the market you know we'll just have to wait and see. What you see as we've demonstrated an ability to capture significant inorganic targets integrate them and turn them into results.","And I think that's one of the things you should notice regardless of whatever we do in the future that we become a serious machine around focusing around what are the real inorganic opportunities, how do we bring them in and then how do you make them successful. And that's our commitment to our customers and to the market.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Brad.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.","Jason Celino","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Building off the last question about the construction cloud announcement, sounds like it's more of a branding grouping all your portfolio products. But what was some of the initial customer feedback that you've heard?","Scott Herren","Yes. The customer feedback has been really solid and here's why, because if the customers don't react to the branding, they don't spend a lot of energy on that, but they do is they react to what we do. All right. So we like the branding because it helps us communicate simply. We were not propagating multiple brands out there. It allows us to focus our go-to-market efforts. It allows us to communicate more precisely at the company. The customers pay attention to what have you done for me. And what they were excited about at the Connect and Construct Event and all the discussions there is the feature velocity. All right. They're seeing us delivering on the integrations that we said we were going to deliver and there are watching us closely.","Every quarter they're going to see, do we do we say we're going to do? Do we do we said we were going to do. So that's what the customers are excited about. They really loved the fact that we're integrating to a common data environment and we're building an ISO standard excepted common data environment. That's something that everybody gets us sums up on. They're really excited with the increased scalability and performance on BIM 360 design which was an area where they were kind of pushing on us a little bit. So those are the kind of things that customers are paying attention to. The branding makes it easier for us to tell the world what we are doing, so that you're going to see us basically amplify that, but the customers care about what we do not what we say.","Jason Celino","Great. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks Jason.","Operator","Thank you. And that ends our Q&A session for today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."],"2652":["Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November 15, 2012  5:00 PM ET","Executives","David Gennarelli","Carl Bass - Chief Executive Officer, President and Director","Mark  Hawkins - Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Executive Vice President","Analysts","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Steven M.

My name is Lory, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Autodesk Third Quarter Fiscal 2013 Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now turn the call over to our host, the Director of Investor Relations, Dave Generali.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our third quarter fiscal 2013. Joining me today is Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and will not be reviewed on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, new products and suite releases and expected growth rates, expected cost savings from our restructuring and other cost management efforts, hiring plans, business execution, certain future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our transition to cloud and mobile computing, trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2012 and Forms 10-Q for the period ended April 30 and July 31, 2012 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call, but we'll not provide any further guidance or update on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on our Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. Our overall revenue results were disappointing. Revenue was lower than expected and stemmed from a weakening demand environment. The positive news is that our ongoing cost control helped us exceed our EPS goal.","It was clear to us that our second quarter's revenue performance was mostly due to our own execution challenges, with the uneven global economy as a secondary factor. It was almost the inverse during the third quarter with a weakening economy taking the lead. Our sales execution improved relative to the organizational realignment we implemented earlier this year. There's still some work to do in this area, but we've made a lot of progress with the new organizational structure.","When looking at our revenue results for the quarter, recall that we had a onetime $10 million license compliance transaction in Japan in the third quarter last year. So normalizing for that, Asia Pacific would have been up slightly, and we would also be showing better results in our PSEB and flagship categories. Superstorm Sandy hitting the Northeast U.S. in the final days of our quarter also had a negative impact on our third quarter revenue results. While we experienced pockets of relative strength in the U.S., Northern Europe and Russia, most of the markets around the world slowed during the quarter, most notably in emerging markets.","We remain pleased with the overall progress and adoption of suites. Customers are seeing the value and the rich array of design features and improved workflow, and we continue to benefit from higher subscription attach and overall revenue per user. Our AEC suites performed particularly well this quarter, with strong growth in our Building Design Suite, Infrastructure Design Suite and Plant Design Suite.","Looking longer-term, I'm extremely pleased with our customers' early adoption of our cloud technologies. Autodesk is the leader in cloud-based design and engineering software, and our customers are tapping into the power of the cloud to do things they couldn't do previously. Autodesk customers have used our cloud platform, Autodesk 360, to perform nearly 1 million visualization jobs over the last year, which amounted to more than 3.5 million hours of rendering. In addition, in October, AutoCAD WS, which is a mobile version of our flagship software, surpassed 10 million downloads. Our BIM 360 cloud platform has seen strong adoption since its launch in June, with more than 21,000 users leveraging BIM 360 services. We're adding more new users of BIM 360 field every day, and our customers are very excited about this offering.","Autodesk Simulation 360, which debuted in September, is a powerful cloud-based simulation solution and has been recognized by industry analysts as changing the simulation market. Customers are responding positively to the productivity gains and cost savings offered by Simulation 360. In its first month, the Autodesk Simulation 360 trial registered more than 10,000 simulation jobs.","We're especially pleased with the first couple of quarters of Autodesk PLM 360, the industry's first cloud-based PLM solution. Autodesk is transforming the PLM industry with an affordable, easy-to-use and simple-to-deploy PLM solution that makes the benefits of PLM available to anyone, anytime, anywhere. Autodesk PLM 360 is now being used by more than 350 companies.","Our acquisition strategy is also centered on adding cloud and mobile technologies to our portfolio. During the quarter, we closed 6 transactions for a cumulative investment of $135 million. These transactions include context social collaboration technology which we will use with Autodesk 360, and Inforbix, which is focused on SaaS solutions for PLM.","We continue to repurchase stock under our ongoing buyback program, with the goal of reducing our total shares outstanding over time. We have strong cash flow from operations for the quarter. Our cash and marketable securities balance was approximately $1.7 billion. Like many tech companies, the vast majority of this cash is offshore. Over the past few years, it's been typical for 80% or more of our cash balance to be offshore in any given quarter. Given the amount of cash used on M&A transactions closing this quarter, coupled with the cash used for our stock buyback program, we elected to utilize our existing line of credit, tapping $110 million.","Looking forward, we believe that the long-term potential of our market opportunity remains intact. We are focused on growth and demand generation, but today's mixed economic environment keeps us cautious on our near-term outlook and makes it difficult to provide long-term revenue projections at this time. It's clear by our actions that we remain committed to operating margin expansion. Despite a lower revenue outlook, we believe we can still achieve year-over-year operating margin expansion of between 80 basis points and 140 basis points for fiscal 2013.","We'll come back to you on our next earning call in February with our projection for FY '14. We were also reassessing our long-term financial model but believe we can achieve a 30-plus percent run rate as we exit fiscal 2015.","Operator, let's open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question will come from line of Brent Thill.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe if you just can compare and contrast the last downturn to what you're seeing now. You mentioned most markets are starting to slow. Maybe if you could just talk to some of the differences that you're seeing. And if you could just also comment on what you're seeing in terms of the renewals, that would be helpful.","Carl Bass","Yes, sure, Brent. I'd characterize this very differently than 2008. My characterization would be that not nearly as deep, not seeing kind of the level of despair almost or kind of hopelessness that we saw during 2008 and the complete freezing of pocketbooks. Instead, it looks like people are being far more cautious, deals are getting delayed but they're not getting canceled. And I would say it's broader. So I don't think it's nearly as deep but broader. I think from the first time, what we started to see is, while our results in the Americas were reasonably good or relatively good to the other places, it's no secret about businesses' consternation about the fiscal cliff. You saw the news, obviously, about Europe this morning, and we're certainly seeing slowing in Europe. With Southern Europe certainly being the worst, and as you move north, the economic condition is improving. And there is some spillover into Asia and some of the emerging economies. So I think it's broader but not as deep as what we saw in 2008.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just on the renewals, any meaningful change?","Mark  Hawkins","No, actually, just kind of building on Carl's points, the renewals and attach actually were either even or up basically in terms of year-on-year comparison. They look solid, and that's one of the things that really reinforces Carl's point, that we're just seeing more caution around business and deals and such. But actually, once people decide to buy, it's a good attribute that they see a lot of value in our subscription, and we like that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, you alluded in the end of your prepared remarks to reconsidering your long-term financial model. By that, did you mean what you talked about at the analyst meeting in June about an evolution to a mostly per user subscription model and usage metering or usage-based model? And if that's what you meant, why not accelerate that process, particularly given current market condition and the change of your portfolio? Then a follow-up.","Carl Bass","Yes, no. So Jay, what I was really talking about there -- I mean, you can follow up, you can ask about the other thing, but the thing I was really talking about is kind of a long-term guidance that we've given for 10%, 12% to 14% growth and 30-plus percent operating margin. I think it's clear to us. I don't think the arithmetic works given at least 1 downturn and 1 maybe minor downturn in 5 years to achieve that. I think what we've demonstrated is, during kind of normal economic periods, we can certainly grow in the teens. What I think we've demonstrated better over the last 2 quarters then during 2008 is a degree of resiliency around our earnings power, and I think we managed to do that. So what we have to really recalibrate, I think if you look now for the period in which we gave the 12% to 14% growth, we'd have to grow it 30% or 40% next year to kind of get there. It's something that's not reasonable. So what we were asking, give us some time, we're going to recalibrate, we'll watch as the fourth quarter proceeds. And then I think the thing is, we'll give you growth rates for the year. We'll give you growth rates for next year, but despite that, we still think we can maintain our projections around operating margin.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. You said as well that you're getting past some of the sales execution issues from the reorg that you had experienced in the second quarter, that got better in the third. Could you talk about other longer-term implications of the industry alignment that you've now put in place? For instance, what it means ultimately not just for sales coverage but for things like the suites, packaging of products, overall coverage of the marketplace as you build out this industry alignment. And just a clarification from Mark, in the prepared remarks, you talked about increasing revenues per user, I think, in the context of maintenance. So did you mean by that, that you're reversing the declining revenues per maintenance seat that you had in the first half?","Carl Bass","Just let me go first and then Mark. Okay. So on the -- just on the industry alignment, what I think industry alignment is really helping us with is our go-to-market activities. Where I think it really helps particularly well is in tailoring messages that make sense and resonate with our customers. It's also very good on kind of 2 parts of our business. One is certainly the major accounts, and you've seen increasingly large deals not only this year but over the last couple of years and greater penetration into really large accounts. If you really recall back to the many times we've shown our curvaceous pyramid where little less than 1% of our customers generate about 30% of our revenue, we're continuing to do that. So it works really well for the major accounts and that business that we do directly, as well as the ones where we work with our partners on specific named accounts. That's where it really has the strongest resonance. As you get into our more horizontal products, it's less effective. So we feel really good about that alignment in terms of tailoring the messaging and the coverage models and understanding what we need for each of the geographies. And I think this is natural course correction. I think we'll continue to course correct. I think we found in some places where we made some mistakes or we went a step too far, and we're figuring those things out and rejiggering it. And we saw that already with improved performance in some places. In other places, some things take longer than a quarter to get better.","Mark  Hawkins","And Jay, just to the second point. In terms of maintenance per seat, basically, one of the things that we're actually pleased to see, we saw it and talked about it at the IR day and we continue to see that and validate that, is that for suites, the actual subscription quotient per seat is actually going up. And so we actually like that trend and macro there. So I think one of the things that we have to be careful of when we look at the seats is excluding education from commercial, which can kind of throw these things a little bit. The other point that I would throw out for consideration is that Q3 marks -- we just eclipsed the anniversary for suites. We're in, I guess, the second quarter of anniversary-ing the suites, and you're starting to see this longer-term effect of people renewing suites at a slightly higher revenue quotient for the subscription. So we actually like that trend.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brendan Barnicle.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Focusing on 2 areas of strength. But the AEC strength and the suite strength seems surprising given the overall macro. What, specifically, you think was accounting for that outlier?","Carl Bass","I'm chuckling, Brendan. In some ways, I'm more prepared to talk about the things that went badly than the things that went well. I mean, truthfully, that surprised us a little bit, too. If I have to look at the AEC, there has been some improvement in the AEC markets from kind of the depths of the recession. We also talked about things like BIM are reaching the tipping point. And with the place we're doing particularly well with our AEC products is in the engineering part, the E part, and in the C part in construction. And I'd emphasize the construction part. And I think what we saw is that contractors realize that in order to be competitive coming out of the downturn, they need to adopt these new technology platforms. Some of the stuff we're doing, particularly on cloud and mobile, is probably the best suited technology for that part of the AEC market than we've had in 30 years. For the first time, we have solutions that people can take to the field and get their work done, and that makes a huge difference. And so I think it's really the retooling of the construction industry that as long as they're willing to invest, they recognize this is as a -- this is just a critical thing.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. I totally agree, Carl. And I think the -- one of the things was just the resounding response to the Building Design Suites, a nice -- really nice -- I think it was at 26% growth there. It was great to see, and it just echoes the kind of comments you're making. People see the...","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, we're tracking it across the world. And there are places where it has become the standard. Governments across the world are mandating it. If governments are not mandating it, owners and operators are. So we're at that point in the market where it takes many years to kind of build that demand, but I feel like we're on the backside of having to build the demand. And we're kind of -- we're just kind of reaping the benefits of all that effort.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then, Mark, on the negative interest income in the quarter, was that related to the line of credit that you mentioned that you used for the stock buyback in the quarter?","Mark  Hawkins","Actually, the -- Brendan, that's a good question. There's -- the other expense, other income is a combination of dynamics. The biggest thing that really affected us there was foreign exchange. The gains and losses for the part of the hedging that is not cash flow hedging shows up there. And that's what it was, is FX fluctuation.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And should we expect that going forward?","Mark  Hawkins","I would, actually, because it's really hard to kind of predict the currency markets. I mean, you'd have to make a call on that, but I think it's tough to expect that one, I would say. It's tough to project that one, let's put it that way.","Operator","Your next question comes from Philip Winslow.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just got a question here on margins. Obviously, you have better-than-expected margin this quarter, but in the guidance, you talked about sort of almost the count of -- like regardless of the revenue growth over the next couple of years here through 2015, you're still committing to a 30%-plus margin exiting fiscal '13. How should we think about that getting there? I mean, how much of your business, because I often think it was somewhat fixed versus variable. So is that wrong versus what I expect? And then also, is there just some excess spending that you think that's going on that you could target further from here? So let's say if revenue doesn't -- isn't worse than what you might be expecting versus your previous long-term growth rates, does that mean we could actually get above 30%?","Carl Bass","Yes. So let me -- I'll take a shot, and then, Mark, feel free to add any colored commentary. What I would say is that the way to think about our business is that there is a strong component of fixed costs, that when you look particularly on the R&D and go-to-market, at least the marketing side of go-to-market, those are relatively fixed. Once we get above that, when we get marginally about it, it becomes marginally profitable. If we kind of hit it out of the park, it gets very profitable. So I don't think it's fair to think of it as purely fixed or purely variable. Once you get past that initial development and bringing products to market, and as we even talked about, if the areas where we're really successful like BIM, it takes years to become that successful. When we first mentioned those 3 letters, nobody even knew how to spell it. They have no idea what we were talking about when we talked about BIM. And now you see it being written into government contracts around the world. So there's a fair degree of investment. When you cross that, you start gaining the rewards from it. Then there is a second component to our business where many of the costs are variable. So some of the fluctuation you see quarter-to-quarter are more related to things like compensation. So sales compensation varies with it. COGS varies. COGS didn't vary that much this quarter, but it was actually the result of 3 or 4 different effects being mashed together in a way that showed no net movement. But there is actually quite a bunch of movement there. So there are variable aspects to our business that are volume-related, but there is a large fixed component. And then the other part we talked about, just to try to give you the whole dynamics around the business, is that in any short period of time, our biggest expenses are people-related. So our ability to change that in the short-term is very limited. But over any period of time, we can adjust to that. I think on your question about 30%, we're comfortable. We're comfortable with the guidance we've given for a number of years, and we're comfortable with it going forward. And that's why we really reiterated it.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. I just -- I think it's spot on. I think we're -- there's not a lot to add to that, Carl. I think that gives a full picture, really.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Carl, you alluded to the fact that execution got a little bit better. I wonder if you could specifically speak to Central Europe and Brazil, which were 2 markets that were challenged in the second quarter.","Carl Bass","Yes. So I would say we saw a reasonable improvement in Central Europe. Central Europe is one of our biggest markets. I was really pleased to see that. Brazil started to turn around. I think it's one of the areas we still have work to do. Some of the things we saw, we have a number of big deals that pushed out of the quarter in Brazil. I just heard today that 1 closed yesterday, another one is being worked. So, I mean, we're making our way through that, but I would say Central Europe is really back on track. I think there's more work to do in the Americas outside the United States.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then I would just like to ask about the share buyback. You spent, I think it was $130 million, and you put $110 million of line of credit on your balance sheet. What is your just appetite and willingness to continue to add debt to your balance sheet to more aggressively be buying your stock in the future?","Mark  Hawkins","So Steve, I think we're constantly looking at our capital structure, and we're constantly trying to look at the overall opportunity with share buyback, obviously, and trying to do the right thing for the shareholder long-term. So I think it's a given that we're going to take whatever actions we think are in the best interest of the shareholder. You're absolutely factually correct in that we have raised the level of share buyback as we said we would do at the IR day. We're starting to take shares out, as you can see, for the last couple of quarters since we said we would. And I think I'm not going to extrapolate or forecast exactly how we're going to shape the capital structure. But I think there's a reason to believe that we're constantly looking at it, and we've never ruled out the notion of taking on debt, for example.","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean, I would just reiterate. I mean, we were very clear that we said we would do share buybacks that exceeded dilution. We specifically did it. We've been doing that since we announced it to you. And I would reiterate, we have been considering our capital structure, and we certainly have been contemplating things like that to continue, being able to maintain that level of buyback that we'll continue to offset dilution from employee stock programs.","Mark  Hawkins","Absolutely.","Carl Bass","The other part of it really to remember, we try to address a little bit, certainly in my remarks, is if you look at our cash positions and how geographically kind of off-balance they are, it's one of the things that also drives us. So not only the need to do buybacks, our need for cash for acquisitions, but also just rejiggering geographically to get money in the places where we actually need it. All of those are conspiring for us to be spending a lot of time looking at capital structure options.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Koenig.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I want to see, Carl, if -- can you comment at all on the potential impact of promotional activity in Q4? And, in particular, any thoughts on your upgrade pricing going forward and the potential for increasing that, and that potentially having a positive impact on promotional activity?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, we have definitely -- I mean, first of all, we're not happy with Q2 or Q3 results. So you can imagine we spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do. We are willing and able to do more promotional activity in Q4 as long as it's consistent with the long-term health of the business. And we've looked at it. There are certainly things that we're going to do, there are things that we've already announced, programs we put in place in the channel. We're taking a more centralized hand in running promotions probably than we have before. It used to be a little bit more left to the various geographical areas, the sales regions to do it. And we've been much more centralized in our control over that. But it is certainly one of the knobs and dials that we can turn.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And, Carl, how would you mitigate any impact on pulling forward revenue from tapping your base in a bigger way than you've tapped in the past?","Carl Bass","Yes. So, I mean, that's what I said. I mean, everything we do around promotional activity is contemplated in the context of a longer term. So if you look historically, we haven't run stupid promotions. We give promotions. We adjust to competitive activity around the world. We react to pricing changes due to currency fluctuations. We also sometimes can stimulate demand by upcoming pricing changes or we can include more things in a particular offering. So we try to do things that are really consistent with the long-term health and the direction we want our customers to move as opposed to taking turns. And as I said before, our business is primarily a channel business. It requires the coordination of us with thousands of partners, and in order to do that, we need a steady hand on the rudder. It's not a business where we -- it's not let's make a deal, and we get up one morning and do something kind of radical. It requires us kind of a steady hand and consistent communication about what we're trying to do in order for these things even to be effective.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then one more question, if I can, for, really, either Carl or Mark. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit more than you did in the prepared remarks about linearity in the quarter. Your comment on DSO sounded like you may have seen a bit of an uptick in October. Can you tell us more about that?","Mark  Hawkins","Sure, yes. I think one of the things that we saw in the linearity for the quarter is it got more difficult as time went on. And so it was one of the -- more of a gradual stiffening of the headwinds, if you will. And so that's one of the dynamics that was signaling to us that something broader was happening. And so that would be one of the things, Steve, that I would say. And then in terms of DSO, I was actually pleased to see the sequential improvement in the DSO, and you could see us bringing it into the -- in the 40s range, 49-ish. And so from that standpoint, I think we've made improvement. There's still more improvement to make. Obviously, in the cash conversion cycle, we try to run it tight. But as you could see with this quarter, the cash flow from operations was solid. So I think that's -- those are the 2 dynamics that were going on, Steve.","Operator","And your next question comes from Keith Weiss.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask Mark a question about expenses.  Second quarter in a row, you did a remarkably good job at sustaining margins, with revenues coming in below your expectations. I was wondering if you could help us figure out really 2 things: one, place the reduction in expenses that we saw this quarter in context to the restructuring that you talked about last quarter; and two, give us a sense of kind of how much dry powder do you have left there. How -- is there still sort of more expenses that you can take out to the same degree if macro gets worse, per se?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, Keith, a couple things here. One is that I really credit our whole company. I think people really instill a really sensible way to spend money. I think people, our whole Autodesk team, has done a good job, and I think you're seeing that in the numbers today. And people really get it. They spend it like it's their own money. That's one of the things I love about our culture. In terms of the restructuring, you're absolutely right. We created some room, if you will, to invest in really critical things like cloud social mobile. And I think what's interesting is, as Carl opened up today, you saw with context on the social. We did some mobile video. We did Inforbix. We're doing things that, actually, we're investing, just like we said we would. And at the same time, we're trying to scale everywhere we can. And so I think what you're -- just to give you context, a, I think people have a good sense of spend management; b, we're investing where we said we would; c, we still have had some headroom, and we obviously manage on the fly to be responsible. We're very committed, as Carl said, to the margin. We've been -- we've come up from the trough. Just to be clear, this quarter is over 1,300 basis points up from the trough in the cycle. We're -- hopefully, that's evidence over multi-years that we're serious about this, and we've made progress. In terms of the dry powder, I hope I never tell you a day where there's not room for improvement. We certainly expect that from ourselves. We're always looking for ways to scale. And at the same time, Keith, we know how important it is to invest in our long-term future, so we make those balances. So those will be my comments. I think there's room for the long-term. Carl, I don't know if you'd add something there.","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean -- first of all, I would second what Mark said. I mean, this was a team effort. Everybody understood the need to do it. And what I feel most pleased about is we were able to control spending without any -- without really impacting anything for the future. People were able to continue to invest and move their initiatives forward regardless of where they worked in the company. And I think that is a testament to really everybody at Autodesk. The second thing I'd say, well, it's not necessarily a muscle I was looking to develop. We have developed a pretty good muscle at looking for the opportunities on spend management, and we have done a really good job at finding things. And going forward, I'd say I think there's plenty of opportunity. There's -- Mark has championed an effort within the company for doing that, and there are things in place for next year. And to Mark's point, I think many of the things that we're doing to improve our expense management is going to be done regardless of what the revenue environment is. So regardless of the demand, we have a number of things there, and we will either take them or drop them to the bottom line or invest as appropriate. But we feel there's a lot of areas of opportunity to continue to improve how we spend our money.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And just to clarify. I think last quarter, we were talking about reducing heads by about 500 and potentially hiring back 250. To what degree was that executed on this quarter? Do we go down 500 and hire back some or all that 250?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, we don't give our headcount by quarter. We do it annually. But let me directionally address that, Keith. We did go down by a little more than 500. You got that accurately corrected. And we have done some hiring that tipped up the number up from that decrease of 500. So we're somewhere in the middle there. I don't want to get more precise on that because we're not trying to establish quarterly headcount reporting. But the reality is, we're pretty much executing what we said we would execute.","Carl Bass","Yes. And the other thing is, just to put a finer point on it, I mean, one of the things that companies do, I think, during periods in which they're being super vigilant about their expense management is there are things that you move inside and outside the company. You go to outside providers and you use less of it or more of it. So remember those things. So while headcount is a good indication, there are also a lot of other things that you really need to get a complete picture. And so in some ways, the best thing to do is just to look at the overall number, because there are a fair number of moving pieces that underlie those results.","Operator","And your next question comes from Walter Pritchard.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Mark, I think 2 questions for you here. First, on the -- I think you said 30% -- or a goal of 30% -- believe you can get the 30% margin by fiscal '15. Which is more than 200 basis points a year and it's more aggressive than you committed to when you had higher revenue growth. Which I would assume higher revenue growth make it easier to do the margin. I'm just wondering how we should think about the path to get to that kind of margin expansion in what seems here to be kind of a new normal that probably has a lower growth rate than you were thinking about when you came out of the last downturn?","Mark  Hawkins","Sure. A couple things, Walter. One of the things we try to be really explicit on is that we -- you're absolutely right. The revenue growth is mitigating the ability to go even faster with our revenue -- or our operating margin expansion as you would expect. And at the same time, what we said is that we're reiterating 30% as the exit rate. So in Q4 of '15, that's what we're driving to as is called out. So that is a little different than saying for the entire FY '15 that we're at 30% plus, and we try to be very explicit on that. And so that takes a little bit -- gives us a little bit of additional runway in the face of a little bit stiffening in the environment in terms of revenue growth opportunity. So that's the first point, I think, is really important to clarify, Walter. I think the second thing is, as Carl was calling out and I'm touching on, we have a number of initiatives to just drive and scale the company that are just good things. And I really like what Carl said. We'll do those if, for whatever reason, the economy got on fire hot, we still want to do these things to help ourself fully create the fuel that we can for the company's long-term well-being. So I'm not going to articulate all the different pathway, which you can imagine, we've been thinking about it, and you can see the real progress we've made. So we're not going to say it's not hard work, Walter. We're not going to say that there could be challenges and such, but we try to be clear that we're not wavering from the intention to keep driving this thing up. Carl, any...","Carl Bass","No.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then -- great. And then, Mark, I think just another question for you. On the upgrade revenue stream, there's been some talk of promotions and so forth there, and you've typically had quite a strong -- even though upgrade is becoming a smaller part of your business, it's declining pretty meaningfully year-over-year. I'm wondering if we should expect that the upgrade and cross-grade stream within Q4 here shows a typical sequential increase that we've been accustomed to seeing with that business.","Mark  Hawkins","Well, I think the tricky thing about that one, Walter, is that we don't kind of pre-signal like our promotional plans. And you're hitting a really good question, which is cross-grade upgrades are a function of promotional plans. So that one, I wouldn't want to guide to specifically. You can -- I'm sure you can appreciate why we wouldn't want to do that right now. But I would say, here's what I would tell you, is that we certainly wouldn't take appropriate promotional plans off the table for driving the well-being of the business. So Carl, I don't know if you have any other comments.","Carl Bass","I agree.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Carl, I wondered if you could give us a little bit more detail about, you said some improvement in Central Europe. I think there was some questions over the structure of the Product Design Suite in this iteration. How did resellers react this quarter, and what else helped drive that improvement?","Carl Bass","Yes, so -- your recall is perfect, Sterling. We spent a bunch of time working with reseller, with our partners in Central Europe just cooperating on account management and interacting with customers. We've done a number of things to work on the offerings, particularly around Product Design Suite for both fourth quarter and what's coming next year. And like I said at the time, our partners realize that they can do well in the short-term by just driving subscription and services. But over any medium period of time, new license growth is actually as important to them as it is to us. And so I think they felt like they weren't being heard about the changes. And remember, there was an odd thing here in which we essentially lowered the prices and our partners were upset because they wanted the prices higher. It's a little bit of an inverse of what you usually expect, and they were upset with us for giving away more value for less money. We had a number of reasons to do this. We put our heads together. We've come up with a plan, and we've started working on it. I think they feel better about the future, and they understand what the plan is. And so better communication. And we actually took a bunch of input from them, and we rejiggered our plans.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And at what point do you think would you be able to communicate some more details around the plan? And how does that affect the other geographies?","Carl Bass","It's a global plan. We've been working on the standardization with global plan. You know what, like Mark said, it's particularly ineffective for us to talk about promotionals -- promotions and packaging ahead of when we otherwise want to release it. I mean, I can assure you right now that we've done a bunch of work on it and worked with them on it. And I've met with several of our Central European partners over the last few weeks, and they feel good about it. In 2 weeks, I'll see a lot more of the partners at Autodesk University in Las Vegas. But I think we're on track there. And as it comes out, we'll talk about it, and I'd be happy to explain what we did looking retrospectively. It will make sense. Not trying to obscure it, but it really undercuts the work of our partners out there everyday if we preannounce things like promotions and packaging.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. Maybe one last question. When you did the restructuring, you had the reduction in headcount. How should we think about when you said you would hire back? How does acquisition headcount fill that need? Meaning, would you hire back some portion of that 500 just direct? Or are you including the heads that come in through acquisition as part of that net?","Carl Bass","We've included the heads that come from acquisition. We think when people join Autodesk, it really doesn't matter if they join through acquisition or we hire them off the street.","Operator","Mr. MacMillan, your line is open.","Carl Bass","Ross, stop typing.","Mark  Hawkins","Ross?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I'm creating some problems in the system.","Carl Bass","You were caught with your hand in the cookie jar.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Exactly. So maybe the first one, just -- I'm just going back to this question on rehiring. Obviously, you've hired back some of the planned rehiring post the restructuring you did. I'm just curious as to whether now that you're sort of resetting the revenue run rate again, whether that's actually leading you to a different conclusion on your hiring plans that you had 90 days ago. In other words, is the current plan to hire back less than you were going to? And I had 1 follow-up.","Carl Bass","Yes. It's definitely less. I mean, we'd be disingenuous to say otherwise. I mean, I think there are 2 things I'd add in, too. We did a reduction in the force, plus there's a natural attrition. What I would say is what we've done so far is we've probably filled the jobs that were made available by attrition and we've added some through M&A, but we've clearly slowed down our overall hiring plan. And we will continue to kind of titrate as we watch revenue in the coming quarters.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I was curious. Obviously, your fiscal fourth quarter is normally the quarter where you have a seasonally strong direct business. Have you recalibrated your thoughts around the direct business, just given the environment?","Carl Bass","Yes. You know what? What -- we certainly thought about it a lot. We've spent a lot over the last 2 weeks probing on this. Despite the overall weak results, our major account business did particularly well. It was particularly strong. Forecasts continue to be particularly strong. The pipeline is strong. I think we've probably applied some management judgment to more conservatively guide and to build ourselves a buffer, should the economy worsen. But I just wanted to leave you with 2 things. Yes, we think there will be a strong fourth quarter in our named account business. And the fact that even during Q3, our named account business did particularly well.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then maybe one very last one, a slightly different topic. But obviously, if we look at maintenance billings, those were down. But we're comping, I think, the challenge of the multi-year promotion, if you will, last year, or the incentive, if you will, to sign early. Is it possible to adjust for that, and give us a sense for what the true kind of like-for-like maintenance billings growth was?","Carl Bass","Well, so you know what we were able to do, and I'll let Mark jump in. I mean, one of the things we were able to tell you is that attach and renewal rates were even to slightly higher. So that was the good thing. It was less than we expected but in line with usual seasonality. Q3 is odd mainly because of when we started this program. There was a seasonality when we introduced the program. I think it would actually be better -- I'll let Mark answer, but it will certainly be better when we finish the fourth quarter probably to look at the year in total and certainly the last 3 quarters. And then we'll have a better handle on exactly what went on. But the individual rates did go up.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes. I agree. The attachment and the renewals went up, and that was a good sign for us, especially as we look at the nature of the economy and such. I think Carl's right. The preponderance of our maintenance opportunity in terms of new maintenance opportunities comes in the fourth quarter, I think it would be interesting for you to look at that and have a complete triangulation on that versus the prior year. That will give you a better feel. I think that's a great way to do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. One, I was just wondering if you could give us some sense of how much Sandy impacted your business in the quarter, given that your business has always been fairly linear. And then I also -- going back to 2 things that you mentioned before. The named account business, you said, did well in the third quarter. So can you give us a sense of where you saw weakness being more pronounced? And then I had 2 more follow-ups, if that's okay.","Carl Bass","Sure. Sure, Heather. Yes, so the first thing is, Sandy is a little bit hard. I mean, we can directly attribute a few million dollars. We can look and say $2 million or $3 million. There's a direct deal that didn't close before the quarter that would have. There are a number of deals in which the paperwork was not completed and we couldn't recognize the revenue. So we'll probably get to $3 million there. I'd probably add a couple more million dollars in business that just doesn't happen. As you know, tragically, both our customers and our partners were greatly affected by it. I wouldn't want to make too -- I wouldn't make too big a deal about the weather. That would be a whole new area of exploration for us in our business. But it was particularly poorly timed for our quarter.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I know, definitely. And then the named account business, so if that was strong, were was the weakness more pronounced?","Carl Bass","Weakness was much more pronounced in the channel business. The named account business -- I mean, what we saw, and this is what's led us to believe -- I mean, let me step back a second, Heather. I think if you look more broadly, I mean, we certainly look at the results of our competitors. We look at the financial results of peer companies, as well as we look at the kinds of companies that are typically our customers. And many of them reported weaker results. And most of them are on a calendar schedule that's a month ahead of us. So the first thing we saw was that. Our major account business did relatively well. But what concerned us a little bit, for the first time, we would probably have more big deals leaking over into another quarter in which we couldn't close, and that's independent to the storm. There were just more big deals that didn't get closed in the quarter. And when we dug down into them, a lot -- we can't identify ones that have gone away, but we have certainly ones where management of our -- of the companies, of our customers, in which they've said, \"Let's reevaluate, let's look at the ROI on this, has to go through another round of approval.\" So we saw some slowdown there. So we're really happy with our performance relative to that, but we did see some slowing. When you look at the place it slowed down, it's the indirect business, and particularly, we call that several geographies. And most importantly, it was the emerging countries, places like Southern Europe and parts of the Americas outside the U.S.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 follow-ups. Can you comment on kind of federal and local spending that you saw, given you have an October quarter end and the obviously federal spend on a September cycle, and then kind of how are you feeling about that for next year? And then I've got a follow-up to that.","Mark  Hawkins","So -- sure, Heather. So just -- this is Mark. Just to give you a sense, you know that our government business is not a big business, per se, but at the same time, we were pleased we set a record for the quarter. It was up. We saw a real growth. It was good to see. I mean, the team works it well. It's not a big part of our business at all, but it absolutely grew.","Carl Bass","Yes, one of the things that are -- one of the things just to know about our government business, while I am really pleased with the results of the government, per se, most of our business in civil infrastructure is related to the private sector that's tied to government spending. And so it's a little bit more interesting to look at the broader results around it. Oftentimes, even when Department of Transportation decides to make a purchase, it ends up being spent in the private sector. So we tend to look at it by industry, but our government results, per se, were good.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the last question I have is it goes back to a lot of the other questions were around the 30% margin goal for fiscal '13. And I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it the right way. Given your uncertainty about revenue growth and given the fact that in the past, you were forecasting kind of higher top line growth levels. Is what you're trying to say is regardless of the top line environment, we'll make this a 30% margin company even if we have to cut to get there regardless of the top line?","Carl Bass","Yes. I think -- well, pretty...","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Like are you solving for margins? Because it's hard to know margins if you don't know revenue, unless you tell me that come hell or high water, you're going to get to that margin number regardless of what the revenue number is.","Carl Bass","I think if you look over, certainly the last couple of years and specifically the last 2 quarters, we demonstrated in an environment in which revenue was far below our expectations that we were still able to drive margins. And I won't go so far as to say we're trying to do -- we're solving for margins, because I think that might indicate too short-term a view of what we think the opportunity in our business is. We think there's plenty of opportunity to invest, and to drive more to the bottom line, and maintain that commitment about margins.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when we think about the progression of margins, it's not like -- I think Walter asked a question before that, basically, to get there, you'd have to be doing more than the type of margin bump you've been seeing the last few years. It doesn't necessarily have to be a linear progression, meaning 250 bps, et cetera, per year, that it could be more of a hockey stick. Is that fair?","Carl Bass","I mean, I think it will be a little bit more steady than that. We won't be looking out hoping some magic happens at the end of FY '15. I don't think that's a realistic way to run the business. But we do think there is opportunity to expand margins along the way, even in a lower growth environment. Having said that, our goal is to drive to higher revenue growth. We're doing lots of things to do that, and it would certainly make the job much easier to do that. But I think we've demonstrated, even without that, we're capable of expanding margins.","Operator","And your final question is a follow-up question from Brendan Barnicle.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly following up. We did see subscription revenue grow sort of in a typical seasonal pattern. Any reason that, that would change going to the fourth quarter?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, Brendan, I think I agree with you that it was a typical pattern. I think you can -- I think we would confirm that. It's in that range. In terms of going forward with a projection of it, we don't guide that one, per se, but I think you got the right read on where we're at today.","Carl Bass","And just to be a little bit more specific, we don't see any reason that, that wouldn't be true.","Operator","There are no further questions. I'll now turn the conference call over to the host.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. So lastly, we're going to be -- we have 2 things going on this quarter. On November 22, we have our Autodesk University event. I know many of you have already signed up for it. If you'd still like to, please e-mail me or call me at (415) 699-0143. We'll also be at the Cr\u00e9dit Suisse Conference on the 28th, the following day.","That concludes our call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This will conclude today's conference call.

Our billings and free cash flow came in at or above expectations and reflect the strength of our business. We are on track with the integration of PlanGrid and BuildingConnected and have exciting achievements to share with you.","Although, our first quarter revenue came in at the low end of our guidance range, we are on track to achieve our fiscal '20 ARR and free cash flow guidance and are reaffirming our fiscal '23 targets.","Our pipeline for the rest of the year is strong and growing, and the underlying demand strength we've seen in prior quarters continues to drive growth in our business. There is no change to our view of the strength of the business or the current spending environment in our end markets.","Before I offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our first quarter results as well as our guidance. I'll then return with further insights into some of the key drivers of our business, including construction, manufacturing and digital transformation, before we open it up to Q&A.","Scott Herren","Thanks Andrew.","As Andrew mentioned, our leading indicators, billings and free cash flow, performed well. Total revenue of $735 million was up 31% and 28% excluding our recent acquisitions. It was within our planning assumptions, although at the low end of our guidance range. This was primarily driven by linearity, as we closed more business later in the quarter than anticipated, which affected the amount of ratable revenue recognized in the quarter.","Overall demand in our end markets was robust, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. Our subscription volume also grew steadily across the board. Sales volume of AutoCAD LT remained strong. And this has historically been a leading indicator of potential demand slowdown.","As you can see, revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 37% in the first quarter, slightly better than the 36% growth rate in Q4. AEC and manufacturing also rose 37% and 24%, respectively.","Geographically, we saw broad-based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 35% in EMEA and APAC, and 27% in the Americas, with strength across almost all countries. We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 36% and represented 30% of our total sales, consistent with last year. Within direct, our e-store grew 45%.","Looking at ARR, total ARR continued to grow quickly, up 33% versus last year to $2.8 billion. Adjusting for our recent acquisitions, total ARR was up 29%. Core ARR growth was in line with our total organic growth, while Cloud ARR grew 164%, propelled by strong performance in construction. Excluding the $83 million of ARR from our fourth quarter acquisitions, organic Cloud ARR, which is primarily made up of BIM 360 and Fusion 360, grew a record 43%.","We continue to make progress with our maintenance to subscription, or M2S, program. The M2S conversion rate in Q1 was consistent with prior quarters, with approximately one-third of maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions.","Of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remained within the historical range of 25% to 35%. As a reminder, this is the last year of the M2S program, and we are continuing to incentivize customers to convert.","In addition to strong new customer billings, the growth in ARR was supported by continued expansion of our renewal base. And as we introduced at our Investor day in March, the net revenue retention rate is a key metric to monitor the health of our renewal base.","Net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in ARR for the population of customers that existed one year ago, or base customers. It's calculated by dividing the current period ARR related to those same base customers by the total ARR from one year ago.","During Q1, the net revenue retention rate was within the fiscal '19 range of approximately 110% to 120%, and we expect it to be in this range throughout fiscal '20. In Q1, some of the deeply discounted subscriptions from our global field promotion we ran three years ago came up for renewal. We were very pleased with the renewal rates of this group of customers as they renewed closer to list price, and the total value from the entire cohort grew.","Moving to billings, we had $798 million of billings during the quarter. On a normalized basis, billings rose about 40%. Recall that last year we adopted ASC 606, which resulted in adjustments of approximately $160 million to our deferred revenue balance and impacted billings, since billings are calculated by taking the sum of revenue plus the change in deferred revenue.","The growth in billings was driven by strong renewals and continued momentum in our core products. We also benefited from some customers renewing early in the quarter due to upcoming price increases. Our recently acquired construction assets contributed nicely to the billings increase.","And in line with our plans, multi-year contracts moved higher, helping our total billings. Recall that multi-year payments are good for our customers as they benefit from stable pricing and a single approval process. Our partners like them as they can sign higher contract values and maximize their cash flow. And we benefit from a more predictable revenue stream and upfront cash payments.","The second and third year of those multiyear agreements are recorded in our long term deferred revenue, which grew by 12% and ended the quarter at 17% of the total deferred balance. As we indicated at our Analyst Day, we expect to end the year with a long term balance in the low 20% range of total deferred revenue, in line with the historical range.","On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we have entered the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins of 91% were up 140 basis points versus last year.","Our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 13 percentage points to 18%, despite absorbing two significant acquisitions.","Moving to free cash flow, we generated $207 million in Q1. Over the last twelve months, we have now generated $550 million of free cash flow, positioning us well to hit our full year target of $1.35 billion. Note that Q1 benefited from the very strong Q4 of fiscal '19 that we had. As you may recall, we had over $1 billion of billings during Q4, some of which was collected in the first quarter of fiscal '20. As such, I expect our free cash flow in Q2 to be down sequentially.","We continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. During the quarter, we repurchased 582,000 shares for $100 million at an average price of $171.84 per share.","Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business is unchanged from the last several quarters. We are not seeing any noticeable impact from Brexit and the various trade and tariff disputes.","For the full year, we are reiterating our fiscal '20 free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.35 billion as well as our outlook for ARR of about $3.5 billion, up 27% to 29%. In line with our initial plans, we expect billings of about $4.1 billion at the midpoint, driven by the strength of our renewal base, new subscription growth, continued normalization of multi-year billings, the flow through from unbilled deferred revenue, and our acquisitions.","When looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal '20, we continue to expect about three-fourths of the free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year.","Looking at our guidance for the second quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $782 million to $792 million, and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.59 to $0.63. The earnings slide deck on the Investor Relations section of our website has more details as well as modeling assumptions for the fiscal second quarter and for full year 2020.","Now I'd like to turn it back to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks Scott.","Now, let me give you an update on some of the key growth initiatives we highlighted at Investor Day, specifically progress made in construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. These initiatives are key drivers of our business both near and long-term.","First, in construction, we are seeing continued strength across the portfolio as we execute on our strategy to deliver a comprehensive, integrated platform that seamlessly connects the office, the trailer, and the field. We had significant accomplishments during the quarter as we integrated PlanGrid and BuildingConnected into Autodesk.","Both acquired companies showed impressive growth, which is important to call out considering that acquisitions typically see a slow down during the integration phase, whereas we experienced accelerating momentum. Post-close, we have won fifteen head-to-head bids against leading competitors in this space. Other milestones included the launch of our first product integration and the realization of revenue synergies.","Q1 was the first full quarter where we had the entire construction portfolio in place, as we closed PlanGrid in December 2018 and BuildingConnected in January of this year. Feedback from customers has been very positive regarding the addition of these best-in-class solutions to our comprehensive construction portfolio, which now includes BIM 360, PlanGrid, Assemble Systems and BuildingConnected, in addition to the design tools we have always sold into that market.","On the technology development front, we were able to accelerate the product roadmap for PlanGrid, which resulted in the introduction of PlanGrid BIM last month. This is a new product integration between Revit and PlanGrid that allows customers to immediately access BIM data in either 2D or 3D directly within PlanGrid on their mobile devices. We were able to deliver this frequently requested feature at an accelerated pace now that PlanGrid is part of Autodesk.","In fact, when PlanGrid BIM was launched we hosted a webcast and the demand was 5x what PlanGrid had normally seen for prior product launches, and the number of customers who requested to be contacted by a sales person following the webinar was also more than 5x what they normally experience following a product-focused webinar.","We've also seen synergies begin to develop on the sales front. For example, APTIM, a leading construction services vendor and joint customer of Autodesk and PlanGrid, tripled its PlanGrid users as part of the Enterprise Business Agreement for its Digital Foreman Initiative.","Other Autodesk products they use include AutoCAD, Civil 3D, Plant 3D, Map 3D and Revit. And because we have been clear with our customers that PlanGrid will be focused on field execution and BIM 360 on project management, there are a lot of synergies between the two offerings that our customers have yet to realize. We are also seeing BuildingConnected thrive within the Autodesk construction ecosystem. Since the acquisition they have grown their user base from about 700,000 to over 800,000.","Now, I'd like to elaborate on the impressive growth comment made earlier. When we made the acquisitions, I said that we were focused on keeping the strong sales momentum going, and that is exactly what happened.","At PlanGrid, the sales teams are continuing to perform strongly with both new and existing customers. For example, they expanded their relationship with Rosendin Electric, a long standing PlanGrid customer with plus 6,000 employees and annual revenue of about $1.5 billion.","The company recently extended its contract for three years and significantly expanded it, in part due to Autodesk's long-term vision. PlanGrid sales have also started to benefit from being part of the Autodesk family.","During the quarter, Jacobs, a global leader in professional services sector and a long-standing Autodesk customer, decided to further enhance its relationship with us by adding PlanGrid to one of its divisions. In making this decision, Jacobs pointed to its current speed in the field, ease of use, and integration with the rest of the Autodesk suite as determining factors in adopting the software.","The Company is currently utilizing PlanGrid on $1 billion infrastructure project. PlanGrid also ended Q1 with its largest ever pipeline of deals. And the momentum continued at BuildingConnected too.","BuildingConnected has introduced new features that continue to make its platform more and more valuable to larger and larger portions of the market. In fact, they had their best quarter ever in Q1 in terms of new business and are seeing their flywheel continue to drive new business on both the general contractor and subcontractor side.","BIM 360 also continues to demonstrate strong growth. In fact, our organic Cloud ARR, of which, BIM 360 is the largest component, was up 43% in Q1. This was driven by strength across the entire BIM 360 portfolio, especially BIM 360 Design, which is our real time collaboration tool for Revit users. We also saw both existing and new customers increase adoption of BIM 360.","A good example here is WeWork, with 485 locations and 466,000 members around the world, WeWork provides spaces and services to help people work, learn and collaborate in more meaningful ways. They expanded their subscription with Autodesk this quarter and are one of our largest BIM 360 Design customers.","We are excited to work with them and look forward to further enhancing our relationship over the coming years. Overall, all parts of our construction portfolio are performing at or above the plan and showing strong growth. I am extremely proud of all the teams involved. They remain focused and dedicated to helping Autodesk grow and drive positive change in the construction industry.","And lastly, I wanted to note that for those looking to get a more in-depth view of our construction business, we are hosting an event on June 4th here in San Francisco, where you'll have the opportunity to hear directly from AECOM, Webcor and DPR in addition to our construction team regarding our portfolio and go-to market opportunity. I hope to see all of you there.","On the manufacturing front, revenue grew 24% as customers see the benefits of our differentiated solution, we are gaining share and displacing competitive offerings in the space. For example, a large manufacturer of locomotives and rail equipment further expanded its relationship with us, they are in the process of deploying our manufacturing solutions across their various divisions and are relying on Inventor, our CAM solutions and factory design utilities to automate their workflows.","Our solutions displaced competing our products due to our simplicity and short implementation cycles, which is in line with their rapid product introduction requirements. Our investments in generative design and Fusion 360 have resulted in more than 100% year-over-year growth in monthly active users for our commercial customers. Users love the cloud-based, comprehensive solution of Fusion 360 and it is disrupting the industry.","Fusion 360 offers unprecedented value and out-of-the-box productivity for concept to production workflows, and that appeals to a large swath of our customers. A US-based specialty pharmaceutical company purchased Fusion 360 to replace SolidWorks for designing and manufacturing auto-injectors.","After reviewing various options, they decided that Fusion 360 provided superior collaboration and data management capabilities in the cloud with no setup or maintenance complications. A Midwest metal fabrication company chose Fusion 360 to replace separate instances of CAD and CAM solutions. They were impressed by our integrated CAD\/CAM functionality and collaboration features. With Fusion 360, they were able to replace CATIA, Creo, Mastercam, and PTC Windchill, allowing them to rely on fewer platforms and to promote collaboration.","Then when it comes to digital transformation, we are seeing the positive impact it is having on our business. We are also making progress in using digitization internally as part of our plans to convert the large number of non-compliant users into paying customers. All new single user product subscriptions are already using identity-based authentication and we continue to move existing customers to this new system.","We are on track to migrate all eligible single user subscriptions to identity-based authentication by the end of the current fiscal year, which will provide a much better user experience for our customers and help us in combating non-compliant usage of our software.","Beyond that, we are already starting to see results from our efforts to engage directly with customers using non-compliant versions of our software and expect our ongoing learning to increase our effectiveness in FY '20 and beyond.","As you heard, there's a lot of activity happening towards the growth initiatives highlighted at Investor Day across construction, manufacturing and digital transformation. These drivers, as well as the large opportunity we see in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers, should result in an acceleration in profitability and cash flow metrics and sustained growth going forward. We are highly confident in Autodesk's ability to capitalize on this large market opportunity and are committed to delivering our FY '20 and FY '23 targets.","With that, operator, we'd like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Phil Winslow","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on great start to the year. I just wanted to drill into your comment about just the linearity of the quarter, Scott you mentioned that the quarter's billings and it was well within your assumed range with revenue at the low end just because of linearity, but your full year expectations are unchanged. Wonder if you could just drill into that, where was the linearity different was it something about specific industries or more geographies, and sort of how are you thinking about the go forward there?","Scott Herren","Yeah. Thanks, Phil. It was - it's certainly within the range of our guidance and our planning, $735 million was the low end of our guidance range. So it wasn't a significant variance from what our expectations were. So we did see those both Q3 and Q4 had - but I'll call better linearity.","So earlier, linearity in each of those quarters, as we came into Q1, Q1 actually ended up with the linearity of similar to last Q1, as opposed to the improved linearity that we've seen in Q3, and Q4, which I guess is not really surprising, given that, beginning of the year, people don't have budgets yet, sales teams are going through sales kickoff, et cetera. So we ended up with the same linearity we had in Q1 a year ago as opposed to kind of the improved linearity we've seen in Q3 and Q4 and that's what pushed us to the low end of the range.","I'll go ahead and answer your follow-up question, which is our assumption for Q2. On linearity is that it'll look more like Q2 '19 as opposed to the improved linearity that we saw in Q3 and Q4, it doesn't really have an effect on the full-year, you see full-year guidance remains unchanged, and you see, actually, Q2 guidance shows a pretty nice step-up sequentially as a result of getting some of that, and that came in a little bit later in the quarter, obviously we have it for the full quarter of Q2.","So it doesn't really change our view at the year. That was a good strong start to the year. Just had linearity more in line with what we had seen a year ago as opposed to what we had seen in the prior two quarters.","Phil Winslow","Then just a follow up for Andrew. It was great to hear some of those wins on the PlanGrid side, BuildingConnected, wonder, if you can provide just more color on this early feedback you're getting now you provided some earlier, but how you think about bringing this into the product line and maybe even also using BuildingConnected even almost as a funnel for PlanGrid as well. Just some more color there that would be great.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So what was the second part you said about PlanGrid there Phil.","Phil Winslow","Sorry to say as a funnel, potentially you're seeing bid management, actually you've been using that as a sort of lead management, so to speak for PlanGrid?","Andrew Anagnost","That's exactly, and actually you've hit on one of the points that's important about this coming year. The PlainGrid folks and the BuildingConnected folks immediately found some synergies between how they approach the market and their individual businesses. So there's a strong flow of leads and discussion back and forth between those two teams, and that plays a pretty integral part.","Remember, BuildingConnected has visibility to the whole entire project bidding environment within the US. And obviously, PlanGrid is super eager to go and talk to those projects about how they can improve site execution and effectiveness and success for their particular projects. So that's one of the big uplifts we're seeing is some of the connection between those two offerings.","And frankly as we brought BuildingConnected in, we saw a very nice surge in their business. Like I said, they had their best Q1 ever in terms of new business, because people just like the fact that they're part of Autodesk and that - what they're focusing on with the bid management is - it's a good tool, they added a lot of features in there during Q1. And it's a solid result.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Maybe first for you Andrew, just picking up off the last line of questioning on PlanGrid. Clearly, it seems like it's off to a good start. And I believe the initial approach here was to let them operate largely separately at least for the vast majority of sales. But it seems like you were able to really cross-sell to some mutual customers relatively early on. So can you just talk about how you sort of envision the combined company maybe looking by the end of this fiscal year PlangGrid plus Autodesk BuildingConnected, and within that maybe touch on the - just a very minor overlap you might have with some products with Autodesk versus PlanGrid, and how you plan on sort of handling that?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So first off, all let me comment on some of those synergies we found in shared accounts. So one of the things we did very quickly as we established how we were going to go-to market with our named account side of our business, and a lot of the places where we're seeing like joint shared updates in our named account business.","So that was a place where we have a named account rep, where we can come in and say, hey, look you know what, we can augment your solution with PlanGrid and we can do some - we can get this project, put it up on PlanGrid, we can get this project put it up on BIM 360 that's where you're seeing a lot of collaboration, that fits within our standard salesforce, and it's functioning really well, and we have an interconnect strategy between those two, and a quarter retirement strategy that allows people to cross-sell and get benefit in terms of quarter retirement for both sides of the equation.","Now what you see that PlanGrid team being highly effective at is doing land and expand in new accounts in the construction ecosystem. And we focus a lot of that team on going out and reaching construction companies that we historically did not touch. And that's where they're spending a lot of energy. So they leverage our named accounts team for some of these synergistic sales and they go out and they find new business out there using their existing infrastructure, which works very effectively.","As we move across into the year, what you're going to see is basically - we're going to maintain that essential structure, but we're going to make sure that we coordinate sales more tightly within the Autodesk construction group as we move towards the end of the year. But we're going to continue to have that synergistic relationship between our named account program and the salesforce that sits inside of the construction group.","And we just - we just think those synergies are going to increase as the year progresses. Remember, we just rolled out a tokenized version of PlanGrid as well, and you know how effective we are at driving usage within some of the named accounts underneath our EBA, so you're going to see that have a synergistic factor as well and it's all brand new. I mean, we're very, very early on, in that.","Saket Kalia","Maybe for you Scott, just to peel back the onion a little bit on ARR. It was actually a little funny, the maintenance ARR number actually came in a little bit below what I was expecting, but I think the consensus is actually a little bit higher. Maintenance at this point is getting to be such a small part of the business, but I guess maybe just to better help - better calibrate, maybe the pace of decline, any sort of idea for how we should think about that pace of decline in maintenance ARR, maybe through the rest of this year or some broad brushes?","Scott Herren","Yes. So it's a great question, Saket. The M2S program, of course, just entered its third year, right, at the beginning of Q2, we just entered the third year of the M2S program. And this is when the more significant price increase goes into effect for those who want to renew maintenance.","Ahead of that what we've seen is the maintenance renewal rates, we're not talking subs in renewal rates anymore, but if we were the maintenance renewal rates have held up very nicely in that space. And so we continue to see both success with conversions. I said that on the - during the script that was in the range that it had been historically, of those that convert the upsell, the collections continues to be good.","We're down to at this point just short of 700,000 maintenance customers left, and that I'm super pleased. We started this with a little more than 2 million maintenance subs, and we've now moved all but at about 700,000 over to product subscription. I think this year is the year where we'll see a lot more of the remainder move over.","So what I would - my expectations is we'll continue to see good success with that moving over. And of those that elect to say - to stay what we have seen is the minus renewal rates are holding up nicely.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Andrew, let me start with you. One of the things that you've talked about with respect to digital infrastructure is your usage telemetry, your ability to observe and collect data about how customers are employing the products, particularly now the - it's mostly subscription. Can you talk about any trends or key observations that you're getting from the use of telemetry particularly in the growing collection space.","Second question there's been quite a bit of commentary in the call thus far with regard to direct sales, and how you're handling the integration of the construction acquisitions. A broader question perhaps about customer engagement, you like some other companies have created a new customer success group, and this has become increasingly common in software. What do they do? And how do you measure the success of the customer success group?","Andrew Anagnost","So let me start with the first question about the kind of the insights we're seeing. So we'll - there's a few things I can tell you, one of the insights we're getting is, usage is continuing to go up, it's going up nicely across numerous product sets. And that's really great to see.","The other thing we're seeing is that collections are seeing usage patterns better than the old suites in terms of how many products people are using, which shouldn't surprise you, because there's more offerings inside - more diverse offerings inside the collections and we're seeing some of those things.","And one of the other things I'll tell you is that the ramp up of \"new releases\" that were moving away from what we would like to consider major releases. People are ramping up on to the latest capabilities relatively quickly including the people who don't pay us, which is important for us to talk about, because it says, that cohort of non-paying users continues to follow us into some of the newer capabilities.","And I think that's important in terms of the future capability of capturing some of that opportunity as we move forward. So yes, we are seeing some more fidelity in terms of usage, and we are seeing some interesting trends and some things that looked a lot better than they were in the suite days.","Now in terms of the customer engagement team. The first thing I want to talk about is what is the team measured on? They're measured on net revenue retention. Okay. That's their job. Their job is to go in there and renew and help grow those accounts, and that's the primary metric they track. They also have metrics around MPS for the interaction that they have with the customers, not kind of global MPSs, but relationship MPSs and network net promoter scores around the various interactions.","But, primarily, we measure them on how well we capture money from the renewal base and net revenue retention in particular. The way they function is a function along the spectrum from low touch - low human touch digital relationships all the way up to high touch engagements.","One of the digital infrastructures we built that's facing this team is what we call the early warning system, it's an umbrella of a lot of metrics that basically give this team a sense for how healthy an account is how healthy are they on their usage capabilities, how healthy are they on their adoption of learning tools, on other tools, has there been a drop off, and it helps them kind of spend their time with the accounts that need the most assistance and the most engagement with Autodesk.","It is a new practice, we've beefed it up, it consolidates several things in the area, but I just want to emphasize the number one thing they're revenue - they're measured on is net revenue retention and that's how we track the success of that organization. Scott, do you want to add anything ?","Scott Herren","No. I think you nailed it. That's - We - the customer success team under Ray has actually done really nice job so far, and one of the things we mentioned Jay in the in the opening commentary is that our net revenue retention rate has stayed right in the range that we talked about at Investor Day. Last year, all year, it was in that approximately 110% to 120% range, and it stayed right there again in Q1. So Ray and his team are off to a really good start.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","I had a question about - I know your referenced to linearity in your prepared remarks. I was wondering, if you could share - if you noticed any impact or what you're hearing from your manufacturing customer base in the quarter just due to the kind of ongoing tariff war that seems to be going on, and if they've given you any sense of whether or not that's impacting their own spending plans? And also - I'm just also just because I'm getting asked myself, you obviously had very good outperformance, it seemed on long term deferred versus some people's expectations. Could you share with us kind of how did short-term DR track versus your expectations? And that's it. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","So I'll take the first part, then I'll hand the second part over to Scott. So you saw our manufacturing business grew quite nicely during the quarter, really strong growth. Now that doesn't mean we aren't hearing from our manufacturing customers that they're seeing pressure in terms of the commodities they use to build their products and things associated with that. They absolutely are. All of our customers are paying more for certain basic things to bring into their business.","But you have to understand what we sell to them isn't a commodity, it isn't a metal or a fabrication or a supplier. It's a mission critical tool and it's a mission critical digital process. And a lot of our customers see these tools and expansion of their investment with us as helping them be more efficient and be more effective when they're seeing cost pressures rise in other areas.","Like a lot of those competitive wins I talked about are really focused on consolidation of multiple tool sets into the single solution we offer, which is easier to deploy. It's lighter touch. It's got more and more end to end things, the different types of price points. So customers are actually looking to us to help them get more efficient, while they're seeing the cost of things that roll in the door to make their products go up.","So we have not seen any kind of backing away of expenditures in our software space. We're seeing no signs of it. We haven't seen it yet, it doesn't mean things can't change. But we also - we do know that our customers are turning to us to make them more efficient. And I think that, that puts us in a good position when they're seeing the cost of other parts of their business go up.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott for the second part.","Scott Herren","Sure. On the second one, it's interesting, Heather, of course what you see showing up in long-term deferred, the sequential growth. There's some of the success we're having in - having multi-year payments get closer to the mean that they had been in historically. We're still not quite there, right? So there's still a little more headroom in long-term deferred to get to what we talked about at Investor Day as that being kind of a low 20% range.","If you look at the growth rate year-on-year, the long-term deferred grew 12%, short-term deferred actually grew 21% year-on-year. So we're seeing really nice performance as you'd expect when you see the billings line grow the way it as has. We're seeing really nice performance across the deferred revenue spectrum. When you add in unbilled, total deferred revenue grew 24% year-on-year.","So it was obviously strong billings quarter that led to both good revenue results, but in particular, strong growth in deferred.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your question please.","Matt Hedberg","Andrew, we continue to hear positive feedback from channel partners around generative design, it really transforming the whole design process. I know this remains a focus for you guys. Wondering about a little bit of an update there on this momentum and really customer receptivity to this - sort of this new way of designing ?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Well, there's a lot going on there, and we're rolling out a lot more in generative tools, especially to the Fusion platform. Manufacturer going to see some new capabilities in terms of generative geometry creation tied to 2.5 axis milling constraints and more of the mainstream kind of CNC applications the customers use. So we'll probably going to see a little bit of an explosion of use of some of these tools as we roll some of this out.","But you're right, we're getting a lot of adoption. And the partners are excited about it, because they can go in and have a very, very differentiated discussion with their customers about what they can do with these tools.","Now one of the things we're seeing, and I want to make sure that people understand this, because people thought, well, these are really advanced things, isn't just like 3D printing focused, and isn't this just for people that want to create organic shapes for 3D printing. The biggest usage right now that we're seeing with regards to generative design is people exploring new types of design options for things that they either had existing or they are building from scratch, and then taking those explorations and turning them into things they can build using their traditional manufacturing methods.","So they're essentially using generative design as a tool to show them new solutions to problems that they wouldn't have naturally found in the first place. And that's one of the exciting things about what's going on right now is that, it's having a real impact in the mainstream customers and on the customers that are kind of looking out on the cutting edge of things. So you're absolutely right, there's lots of reasons to be excited and our partners are really getting engaged in our manufacturing portfolio, because of generative.","Matt Hedberg","And then maybe just a quick one for Scott, obviously, a lot of questions on the construction opportunity. I'm curious when you think about adding sales capacity to this year, how do you kind of think about into the overall pace, and then, how do you think about putting that sort of like more or so in the construction versus A&E or the manufacturing side, just sort of wondering about, just sort of how you kind of allocating your sales capacity adds this year ?","Scott Herren","Sure. Construction is such a massive opportunity for us Matt, it won't surprise you to hear that we rotate a lot of investment into it. Coming on the heels of the acquisitions we did in the fourth quarter, we've also increased spend in each of those. It wasn't the normal buy them and go through a bit of a downsizing, we've actually done the reverse.","We've acquired those companies, integrated them nicely into Autodesk and at the same time increased the investment in construction. So great results out of the gate as Andrew mentioned in the opening commentary, and I think you can expect to see us at this level of performance, and what the market really beginning to turn this direction, you can expect to see us continue to invest in construction.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Ken Talanian","So for the customers that are still on maintenance, do you have a sense for how the percentage of that group who might upgrade to collections compares to the folks who are already converted?","Scott Herren","What I'd say Ken is really haven't seen the needle move much on that. We've had great success at the point of people moving from maintenance over to product subscription, we've had great success having them kind of cross grade and instead of going single product to single product, going single product to collection. And that really hasn't changed over the last six quarters or eight quarters now that we've been tracking into us. So I'm not expecting a significant change.","The one thing I would note in the demographic which is quite not surprising to you, the bigger customers that aren't EBA eligible, obviously the bigger customers that were on maintenance were some of the first to adopt into us and move over. It's not as bigger skew as you might think from the biggest to the smallest, but there is a little bit of a bias to the larger customers. As we get down to the smaller and smaller customers, we might see a point or two difference there, but I wouldn't expect it to be significant. Andrew, anything you'd add?","Andrew Anagnost","No. I think we've seen a consistent pattern, and we don't see anything that would indicate that changing. I agree with you. It's probably going to make a point or two different as we get deeper into that base. Just because of the size and because maybe a mix shift inside that what's left to the maintenance base.","Ken Talanian","And are you seeing any non-payer conversion from the shift to a serial number free licensing model.","Andrew Anagnost","We always see non-payer conversion every year. So one of the things I just have to say, because I say it every call, this non-paying conversion thing isn't going to be this big explosion, all right. It's an ongoing process. Some of these people have very clever ways. They continue to not pay us.","But what I will tell you is that we've successfully rolled out some really interesting ways to have conversations with these customers and engage with them directly. And we are learning a lot that we think is going to play pretty significantly into our long-term strategy with regards to converting these people.","We have direct engages with them. We can track where they go after an engagement whether or not, they continue to pirate or they pursue some kind of other path. So we're learning a lot. And that's what we expected to do this year. Every year, we convert non-paying users into users, every year, we convert more than we did the previous year.","But more importantly, every year, we're learning more about how to effectively engage with these customers. And that should give you a really good feeling about the long-term growth prospects as we start looking at those 14 million non-paying users and converting them over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","I think you gave commentary that you saw strength across geographies, obviously see the pie chart with the percentages. But just wondering for - about some colored commentary. Looking at the PMI results coming out of Europe today, there's been questions in other areas of software around possible squishing as here in North America, what are you seeing from just the macro by geography ?","Andrew Anagnost","So we're not seeing any kind of geography-based slowdowns. And by the way, the PMI in EMEA has actually been in contraction territory for a while. So it isn't like a new phenomena. And for us, we see the PMI as measuring a different side of the demand curve. It's much more focused on the purchasing of kind of the core assets that kind of go in the door and come out as product.","We're selling efficiency in digital transformation. So right now, we - and what - actually let's just look back historically, we've never seen a strong correlation between the PMI and near-term impacts on our business.","Long term, as the PMI phasing contraction territory, you absolutely, eventually would see an impact on our business. Short-term what people do is they tend to buy more of our software to try to invest in digitization and kind of getting their processes more aligned, more efficient. So we're not seeing any slowdown in any geographic areas. And the ongoing PMI results don't signal anything to us in terms of our demand environment.","Sterling Auty","And then one follow up, do you mind as where are we in terms of the various pricing or discount changes both on maintenance and other parts that you had outlined at the beginning of the transition. What changes recently went into effect if any? And what were the impacts?","Scott Herren","Yes. Sterling on the - you're talking about the maintenance to subscription program that we're - that we just began or if you remember, we started that program actually kind of middle of Q2 a couple of years ago. So we just began the third year of that. And at the third year, what we have said then and just went into effect at the beginning of May is the cost to convert - the price to convert would go up by 5%, the price through renew maintenance from last year, the price through new maintenance have got up 20%.","So both of those increases went into effect in early May. So we're sitting three weeks into that right now, not expecting to see any significant change in terms of renewal rate. I do think at this point, it probably becomes a lot more attractive for those that have gone under maintenance, to actually make the conversion.","Through the first quarter what we saw in conversion rates, as they kind of held in at that roughly a third that are converting at about the point of renewal. We'll see now with the difference in - pretty significant difference in price. We'll see how that goes in this quarter and through the end of the year.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matthew Broome of Mizuho. Your line is open.","Matthew Broome","You recently launched 2020 editions to AutoCAD, Revit and some other products. Just curious how early feedback has been for that. So that which new features you believe will have the biggest impact?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So like I said earlier, we've seen pretty rapid adoption of these capabilities as they rolled out, which actually bodes well for how customers are reacting to those things. I don't have any feedback on particular feature sets. Because we're working like a big lumps of areas, like in one area we're working on in Revit in particular, is on rail and things associated with rail and adding capabilities that make it more efficient for rail. So there's going to be lots of areas and each one of these products that are broadly accepted.","But when it comes to AutoCAD in particular, customers are starting to embrace the multi-platform nature of what we've done with AutoCAD, and the way we're making it easy to integrate not only our own storage environments, but third-party storage environments like Dropbox and Box, and other types of environments, so that our customers can efficiently use AutoCAD data in multiple types of storage environments.","One of the features we rolled out and it doesn't get a lot of visibility is that when a customer is inside the Dropbox environment, and they go and they click on a DWG files, it actually launches the AutoCAD - AutoCAD web, the viewer - and it put its full AutoCAD web, and it actually says, you are subscriber, if you're a subscriber they get the edit experience.","But it is the - AutoCAD web version inside these applications, that kind of reach that we're getting with some of those things is actually exposing more and more customers to the power of the multi-platform view we've taken with some of these applications. So I think you're going to hear more and more about what we're doing there.","On the Revit side, you're going to hear more and more about some of the things we're doing around rail and other areas, where we're extending the capabilities to be not just Revit, but in InfraWorks such as more specifically say it's on the InfraWorks side. You're going to hear more and more about some of those things as well. But those are some of the areas that are getting a lot of interest and a lot of traction.","Matthew Broome","And I guess, could you provide a brief update on the media and entertainment business. It looks like there was a little bit of revenue deceleration there during the quarter.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So there's a couple of things you want to know about the media and entertainment business. One, it's very sensitive to large deals. All right. So for instance in Q4, we had a couple of really big deals in M&E. So there was a quarter or a quarter change around media and entertainment just related those deals. Last Q1, we also had a big deal that came in. And like I said, the media and entertainment business of all our businesses is very sensitive to these large deals.","So there is a quarter over compare to that large deal, but in addition and this is something I want you to pay attention to over a multi-quarter scenario, similar to what we did in our manufacturing business, we've retired certain products in that space that we're no longer collecting revenue on and you'll see some kind of year-over-year declines associated with that.","So for instance, we don't charge for sketchbook anymore that product is out there, it's completely free, it's available to people to anybody who wants to use it. That, that money isn't in there anymore, and it shows up in the year-over-year. But those are things that are affecting the M&E business.","We actually had a pretty robust M&E quarter, right? But as I said, there's sensitivity to large deals and this idea that we feel kind of retired certain products especially things like sketchbook that are going to have year-over-year impacts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Your line is open.","Rob Oliver","I wanted to take it back to the construction side if I could Andrew, and talk a little bit about the pricing side. I know you've said you guys favor the named user bundles. How is pricing playing out so far relative to your expectations coming in? And on those 15 deals in particular, where there was head-to-head competition, did price play a role at all? And then I have a very quick follow-up? Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So first off, like I said, we're really happy with the results of construction in Q1, we hit all our goals we're looking good heading into Q2, we're really happy with things that are going on. So let me tell you right out of the gate, that the pricing models are working in their form, but I think I know you're asking a different question.","So like - when we go in against the competitor, let me tell you about the two things that help us win. The first thing is competitors just like the story, they see us with a best-in-class field execution solution at one end, they see us with a best-in-class design collaboration solution at the other end, all cloud-based. And they just look at us and when we tell them look, we're going to connect the building information model all the way from design through to site execution, and we're going to do it with these things in between, they believe us, and they see it and they expect it all of its functionality is going to roll out over time.","And when we do things like accelerate the rollout of PlanGrid BIM into the PlanGrid environment as quickly as we did, people start to say, okay, thank you Autodesk, you're showing us the evidence that we're heading in the right direction.","So they buy the vision, they buy Autodesk role, they don't see anybody else able to do this end-to-end kind of connection the way we're doing, and that's been something we've been consistent about.","And yes, when they go in and look at the business model that we come to market with, they say look yours is a much more customer-friendly business model, this is one I can grow with. This business model over here is this going to penalize me as I grow. So yes, we do see those things. But I want to just make it clear, primary reason we win is the big story. And that's the thing that is getting customers excited. It's the thing that's engaging them, and it's the thing that's bringing more people into our ecosystem and we are seeing that.","Rob Oliver","And just as a quick follow up, and Andrew, you had mentioned on the last call and Scott just reiterated. Did you guys not only absorb the planned R&D at PlanGrid and BuildingConnected but you've ramped that R&D. And aside from platforming and integration, and this - and I apologize because this maybe leading on to the - to for the ramp of other areas that you're seeing from an end-user functionality perspective, that are interesting to you as a possible recipient of those R&D dollars. Thank you guys very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So one of the things, I want to make sure I reiterate. I mentioned this during the last call, but I think it bodes restating, we've definitely applied clear missions to the two product stacks and the two teams frankly and we've actually swapped people back and forth between the two teams. PlanGrid is very much focused on field execution and being the best-in-class tool for field execution. So they're looking to accelerate the roadmap that they had in place for field execution both customer-driven and internally-driven, and that's where they're spending their dollars.","On BIM 360, we're focusing the BIM 360 team much more on closing all the gaps around project management and things associated with project management, RFI flow and all of the things that go - connected to that and then connecting those things back to the PlanGrid environment and the customer see a seamless flow. So we've - this mission-based assignment of teams has been super important. It has resulted in additional R&D dollars going in.","We are absolutely accelerating PlanGrid's roadmap, not decelerating it, and we're accelerating BIM 360's roadmap with regards to project management capabilities. So that, that you will hear more about in June. But I think it's important to just reiterate, where we put the money and how we're spending it to moving forward because we really do want these solutions to survive, thrive, grow and connect together rapidly inside Autodesk. So we're committed to that and yes, we spend more and we brought them in and we got the results we wanted. So I think we're going to keep doing that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","My question Andrew for you is when you look at the maintenance subscription conversion program, can you just give us an update on how much of that installed base has accepted the price increase versus converting to subscriptions and what is left in that third bucket? Any strategy or plans you might have in place to convince the last set of holdouts to get on the program. Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So we never, we never expected that every subscription - that every maintenance customer was going to move to subscription during this program. I think one thing that's important to note is we basically converted two-thirds of them already at this point. So there's really only one-third of the subscription base left from when we started this program. And as we told you over and over again, we've - everyone we've moved, we're growing the value of those customers through consolidation and through other efforts associated with that.","So we have to pause and look at well how far have we come here with regards to this program. And I think it's pretty impressive results given what we're trying to accomplish.","We have always expected that by the end of the year, there were going to be a set of customers left in, and there are going to be a set of customers left in maintenance. But I think also what you heard from Scott earlier is that the renewal rates for maintenance are holding up quite well, incredibly well actually even with the price increases that are in front of customers.","So customers are going with us along the journey. There are going to be some left at the end of the year still on maintenance, and we'll look at what we do in terms of working with those customers as we get to that point. But we're already two-thirds in there, we'll be more than two-thirds by the end of the year, we've been successful in increasing the value of those customers and most of those customers that have moved over are happy and the ones that are still on maintenance are renewing it at robust rates. So the program looks like a success to me.","Operator","Next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Hamza Fodderwala","This is Hamza Fodderwala in for Keith Weiss. Just a couple of quick questions from my end. The first one, so the manufacturing revenue growth really accelerated this quarter and it's been up double-digits for a few quarters now. I'm just wondering what's the inflection point there as far as you starting to really put up growth that's faster than many of your peers, what's driving some of that share gain? And what's the roadmap there going forward?","Andrew Anagnost","So Hamza what you're seeing there is the strength that was always there underneath that you couldn't see, because of all the product retirements we did. Alright. So we've been doing this for several quarters in the core part of our business, which is one of the reasons why we're so excited about, how we're doing in manufacturing in general right now.","You saw declines or slowness in the manufacturing business, because we retired a whole set of products. Some of them we just retired completely, some of them were transitioned into the collections environment, some of them were combined with other products, we did some large consolidations, and this resulted in some revenue that is essentially disappeared. But it showed up eventually in other places, so now what you're seeing is the underlying strength in the core manufacturing business that was always there.","And we're - like I said excited about it and when you look at some of the things that are in the roadmap, what you're going to see is tighter and tighter coupling of this design to make workflows. You're going to see more showing up in Fusion with regards to end-to-end design all the way through to machining workflows and new generative algorithms that take not only 3D printing workflows, but - workflows for 2 axis, 2.5 axis, 3 axis milling operations and automating the geometry creation.","You're also going to see more workflows between Inventor and Fusion. So that Inventor customers can take advantage of the downstream production workflows that are built inside a Fusion. Customers are starting to look inside the manufacturing and - the product design and manufacturing collection and they're cracking it open and they're seeing some things that they think are pretty amazing. That's part and parcel of what's driving our growth.","Customers are consolidating on what we have because they see us. I can take these eight weird things that I had against consolidating this as one thing. And by the way I've got this cloud workflow that makes all my data problems a lot cleaner and it's just working. And I expect you'll see it to continue to work in the future. So I'm just happy you can now see the underlying strength in the business that we knew was there all along.","Hamza Fodderwala","And just a quick follow up. We did hear that there was a price increase on multi-user licenses in May. Just wondering if that caused any pull forward business from Q2 to Q1. That's it from me.","Scott Herren","So we did see and we referred to this a little bit in the opening commentary, Hamza. We did see a little bit of early renew activity, but really the same percent that we've seen historically. So if you add up our total sales what percent were early renews where you'd see people trying to front run the price increases earlier renews. So as we looked at that, it was really in line from a percentage basis with what we've seen historically.","So I don't - I'm not anticipating any change or any kind of an impact to the full year model from that. Having said that, the change we made on multi-user pricing was really to do a better job capturing the value of what we're shipping with that you've seen us make kind of incremental changes in multi-user now for a couple of - couple of years in a row. And it's to better align the price with the value that's being delivered on multi-user.","Operator","At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Abhey Lamba for closing remarks. Sir?","Abhey Lamba","Yes. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. Thanks for joining us. Bye.","Operator","That does conclude our conference.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the floor over to David Gennarelli, Senior Director Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter fiscal year 2018. On the line are Co-CEO\u2019s, Amarpreet Hanspal and Andrew Anagnost; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Amar.","Amarpreet Hanspal","Thanks Dave. We\u2019re after an impressive start with the new fiscal year with broad based strength across all subscription types and geographies. These types of results are increasing our confident in the acceptance of the subscription model and our ability to achieve our goals. There are several areas to highlight in Q1 including, we added a record 186,000 total subscriptions.","Total ARR grew 20% at constant currency. Recurring revenue jumped to 90% of total revenue and we over-achieve on both our revenue and spend goal, leading to better than expected in EPS. As we\u2019ve demonstrated over the past several quarters, we are executing well and making real progress on our two major initiatives, growing the lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and expanding our market opportunity with increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions.","Now let\u2019s dive to our Q1 performance a little more. Before I get too far, I want to note a change in our terminology. New model is now known simply as subscription plan to synchronize with our new revenue reporting terminology. Just like new model, subscription plan consists of product subscriptions and end-of-life subscriptions and cloud subscriptions. We added 233,000 subscription plan subs in Q1, which is even higher, there are seasonality strong fourth quarter of last year.","Once more the net record 186,000 total subscription additions resulting from strength across all subscription plan types and a higher renewal rate for maintenance planned subs. One of the best signal with the health of our business with the strong demand for our core designing engineering product, which is reflected in impressive year-over-year growth of over 170% in product subscriptions even more pleasing was the strength in product subscriptions was broad based, with triple digit growth across all geographies and very strong growth in emerging markets. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growing in emerging countries, unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool.","Subscription plans starts also had a strong contribution from our new enterprise customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we had signed up a record number of enterprise customers for our token base of consumption style EDAs, and that because of the way we count our subscriptions, we see the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 just as we did in the first quarter of last 2 fiscal years. These EDAs contributed a record 44,000 subscription additions in Q1 of this year, 10% more than Q1 of last year. EDAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers. ","The third component of our subscription plan starts is our cloud products. This is the TAM expansion part of our business and we are building on our leadership in the cloud. Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth growing by over 4 times Q1 of last year, and these were driven by BIM 360, our BIM collaboration and construction management tool and closely followed by Fusion our cloud-based design and fabrication tool.","In addition to brand new customers to our cloud products, we are also doing a lot of add on business with our existing cloud customers. A great example of this was a large Australian construction company which had already deployed over a 1000 seats of BIM 360. The company is now expanding the deployment of BIM 360 and integrating it into their project management system which has resulted in the purchase of an additional 3000 seats of BIM 360 by that customer. BIM 360 goes beyond a typical product sale and has allowed us to develop much more strategic relationships with [indiscernible] and other companies as we kept into this huge potential TAM of the construction market, the fee in AEC.","Some of you may have seen that just last week there was a great story in the Wall Street Journal that highlighted that opportunity and prominently featured Autodesk.","Fusion 360 is also expanding our market opportunity. We had a great Q1 win with a UK-based engineering firm that is choosing to replace Team Center with Fusion Lifecycle. This customer also purchased product design collection, which includes Fusion 360 which successfully completed against DSO and PPP solutions. The more people used fusion, the more they are reinforcing our believe that Fusion is a game changer that's driving the future of making things at the expense of our competition.","Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plant sales. However, maintenance planned subs declined less than what we experienced in Q4 through a combination of a higher renewal rate and a smaller pool of renewal opportunities. As we stated in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incest maintenance planned customers to switch over to EBAs or product subscriptions without maintenance to subscription program. ","I\u2019ll now turn it over to Andrew to provide more details on the great results we saw in Q1. ","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Amar. The strong growth in total subscription is fueling growth in ARR. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% on a constant currency basis and reflect the strong uptake of all our subscription plan offerings. Total ARR grew by over 100 million quarter-over-quarter and 20% over Q1 last year on a constant currency basis. And I\u2019ll point out this 40% of our total ARR is now driven by [technical difficulty] that\u2019s up from just 23% in Q1 last year and a clear indicator of significant progress we're making. When we accelerated the transition away perpetual licenses two years ago. We projected the subscription plan ARR with maintenance plan during this fiscal year and we are well on the way to making that happen.","For the second consecutive quarter, we experience the small sequential increase in total ARPS, primarily driven by ARPS growth in product subscription. It's still a little too early to project what ARPS will grow sequentially in Q2 and ARPS is still sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, product mix and promotions. Having said that, we remain confident that ARPS will be positively influence in the second half of the year by less discounting and promotions to our legacy users, as well as the impact of the maintenance and subscription program. Each quarter, the vast majority of the subscription plan subs are added through traditional maintenance.","However, we continue to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. In Q1, we added 26,000 product subscriptions to another successful promo target in our legacy users. The Q1 promo offer 30% discount on a three-year subscription is they turn in their old perpetual licenses. It's the same type of promo that added 28,000 subs in Q1 last year with 70% discount. We\u2019re still finding that more than half of those particularly in the promo are turning in licenses seven years back or older. This is further reinforcing our view, that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to latest software.","They are continuing to be over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using our all perpetual license. Overtime, we will convert a large portion of these users either through promotions like this, compelling new product introductions or traditional means as their product becomes increasingly update overtime, we\u2019re beginning to see this happen already. The other large cohort non-paying users, the non-compliance or piracy based of roughly 12 million worldwide. We\u2019ve made significant gains and being able to more accurately identify these non-compliance users and we\u2019re just getting underway with systemically pursue convergence to subscription. Driving more users to subscription directly aligned with another one of our transition related initiatives to drive more business direct.","Total direct revenue for the first quarter was 30% of total revenue, that's up from 25% in Q1 last year and just 19% two years ago. We continue to grow the volume of business with our large enterprise customers and we\u2019re experiencing exceptional growth of over 300% with our e-store. We expect to continue to meaningfully growth both our direct to enterprise and our e-store business as we go forward.","Now I'll close my section by talking a little bit more about the maintenance and subscription program, because it was easily the most asked about topics over the past quarters. At the end of the Q1, we had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers and we're going to encourage these customers to move to product subscriptions. We'd like them to do so sooner rather than later as product subscription provides them the great value with increased flexibility support and access to our cloud products.","Moving to single model makes the more sense and we'll immensely simplify our customer's transactions with Autodesk. The M2S kicks off with maintenance planned customers that come up for renewal starting on June 1 which is just a couple of weeks away. Along with greater value, loyalty pricing will be a big driver. As I discussed last quarter, all maintenance customers will be subject to a 5% price increase when they come up to renewal and they can choose to move to product subscription for a loyalty discounts of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription and lots of pricing for the following two years.","With this discount will decreased by 5% for each of the following 2 years, so the earlier customers wish the more they'll save. The maintenance planned customer can choose to stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 10% increase next year and 20% increase the year after that. As such, we believe that there will be a relatively small number of maintenance planned customers by the end of FY'20 and we'll be determining the best course of actions for the subsequent renewal periods.","Since we announce this program a couple of months ago, we have been working with our partners to help them better understand the program. We've also provided them with some extra tools that help drive positive conversations with customers and we are incentivizing the channel partners to up sell collections, which would further enhance their cash flow. We're not making projections [technical difficulty] will move over this year or next, but believe we will have a smaller pool of maintenance customers by the time we get to the end of our fiscal year '20.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials.","Scott Herren","Thanks Andrew. Once again, all of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through all of them, but if you want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items, and then talk about our business outlook for fiscal 18. ","Before I get into the numbers, I want to draw your attention to our new format for revenue reporting which greatly improves transparency. You'll now see 3 revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance and one for license and other revenues. In this format, you'll no longer need the reconciliation table in our prepared remarks doc as all subscription revenue which we used to call new model will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be recorded in maintenance line. All remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as license and other revenue.","In this new format, quarterly subscription revenue times four equals subscription ARR and quarterly maintenance revenue times four equals to maintenance ARR and you'll be better able to isolate non-recurring revenues that will flow into the license and other revenue line. Note that one side effect in this change results in additional small legacy products being added into the ARR calculation. As a result, we have slightly adjusted the historical figures for ARR, so that you have an apples-to-apples comparison for our Q1 results in going forward. ","This is an improvement we've been working on and many of you've been asking for the quite a while and I think we can all agree this is clear and more transparent.","Moving to spend management, we're proud that we've been able to drive strong growth in all of our important transition metrics while reducing our Q1 non-GAAP spend by 3%. We know that some of you have been skeptical of our ability to grow our business while keeping spend flat this year and next year, but we continue to achieve our goals by making sure that we're investing in critical elements of our transition while reducing spend in other areas, driving efficiencies throughout the company and the best thing smaller non-core products.","During the stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Deferred revenue grew 18% against the really tough compare last year, when we were still selling multi-year maintenance contracts. As you know with discontinued multi-year maintenance sales in conjunction with the launch of the maintenance subscription program.","You\u2019ll notice another new discloser we added this quarter for unbilled deferred revenue, which we define simply as revenue that has been contractually committed by our customers, but not yet billed and not included on balance sheet. Specifically driven by our multi-year large enterprise business agreements or EBAs. Historically, unbilled deferred revenue was an immaterial number, but as we move forward this year. We\u2019re planning or moving more of our enterprise customers to annual billings with the contract, which are typically three-year commitments.","We are providing visibility for unbilled deferred revenue to give you a more holistic view on our quarterly results. We remained aggressive with our stock buyback plan in Q1 and repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $192 million and that averages out to a little over $85 per share. The downside of our stock price at this level is we\u2019re not able to buyback quite as many shares, but we remain committed to offsetting dilution from our equity plans and reducing our share count over China. Overall, our strong Q1 results increased our confidence with the transition is working for our customers and our partners, it also sets us up for success for the rest of the year and reinforces our conviction in our fiscal \u201920 targets.","Turning to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in emerging markets. As we look at our outlook for the second quarter, we expect a seasonal decrease in subscriptions additions in Q2 consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in the last two years. In the Q1 sub ads have added benefit from a seasonally strong EBAs solid prior quarter and the legacy promo. However, we're pleased with our execution in the current business trends and have confidence in our ability to drive results, we\u2019re taking appropriately conservative approach and leaving the full year fiscal \u201918 outlook unchanged at this point.","Finally, I want to provide an update on our CEO transition. The board is currently in the process of vetting external candidates, as well as both Andrew and Amar. We don\u2019t have any other update on the CEO selection process, other than to say it's a top priority for the board and is progressing as plan. In the meantime, we continue to execute very well through the transition and Andrew and Amar have the board\u2019s full confident to lead the company to ongoing success.","To wrap things up, we\u2019ve executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on this through fiscal 2018 and work toward our fiscal \u201920 goals and beyond.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Mark Grant","Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you\u2019d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter?","Amarpreet Hanspal","Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it. ","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year.","Mark Grant","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. ","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that?","Andrew Anagnost","Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase.","So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway.","We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software.","That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. ","Saket Kalia","Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we\u2019re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward?","Andrew Anagnost","This is Andrew, I\u2019m going to take that one.","Saket Kalia","Sure.","Andrew Anagnost","As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it\u2019s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it\u2019s emerging in mature markets. And what we\u2019ve said consistently and we\u2019re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we\u2019re not changing, we\u2019re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we\u2019re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that\u2019s going and trend that up a bit. You\u2019re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it\u2019s going to put upward pressure on that.","We\u2019re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you\u2019re going to see that. But you\u2019re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we\u2019re more successful in the cloud, you\u2019re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we\u2019re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half.","Saket Kalia","Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others?","Amarpreet Hanspal","Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we\u2019re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we\u2019re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in. ","So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they\u2019re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we\u2019re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we\u2019re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year?","Andrew Anagnost","Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both. ","Amarpreet Hanspal","Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers.","So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions?","Andrew Anagnost","Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer ","Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year?","Andrew Anagnost","All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we\u2019re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going. ","I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we\u2019re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It\u2019s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we\u2019re actually really happy where we\u2019re at.","The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that\u2019s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that\u2019s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you\u2019re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we\u2019re exactly where we select to these.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you\u2019d see in your maintenance is?","Scott Herren","Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn\u2019t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don\u2019t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year. ","Keith Weiss","Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore?","Andrew Anagnost","Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior.","Amarpreet Hanspal","Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around.","Keith Weiss","To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible].","Amarpreet Hanspal","Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question.","Keith Weiss","So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that?","Amarpreet Hanspal","Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability. ","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company. ","Gregg Moskowitz ","Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions.","Scott Herren","Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Okay.","Amarpreet Hanspal","Go ahead sorry.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Sorry Amar, go ahead. ","Amarpreet Hanspal","I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it\u2019s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you\u2019re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you\u2019ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that?","Andrew Anagnost","Look, we\u2019re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we\u2019re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It\u2019s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we\u2019re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering.","The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that\u2019s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we\u2019re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we\u2019re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We\u2019re going to continue to do it and we\u2019re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will.","Amarpreet Hanspal","One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn\u2019t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we\u2019re seeing the promo work, we\u2019re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we\u2019re doing well with that opportunity.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Okay. That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup.","Ken Wong","Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully?","Scott Herren","I don\u2019t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it\u2019s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don\u2019t see that driving any particular bump and extends. ","Ken Wong","Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical?","Scott Herren","Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers. ","Scott Herren","So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer.","And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection. ","Amarpreet Hanspal","This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there?","Andrew Anagnost","Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn\u2019t come down to maintenance versus subscription.","They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription. ","Amarpreet Hanspal","Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward.","Unidentified Analyst","If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted?","Andrew Anagnost","No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it\u2019s really uniform and it\u2019s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it\u2019s playing out exactly the same way and we\u2019re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities.","Steve Koenig","I\u2019m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you\u2019re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you\u2019re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal \u201920 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers?","Andrew Anagnost","So I\u2019m going to answer part of that and then I\u2019m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we\u2019ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we\u2019ve told them, they\u2019re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It\u2019s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it\u2019s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don\u2019t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program.","Scott Herren","Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it\u2019s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that.","Steve Koenig","May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance.","Scott Herren","Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don\u2019t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those.","Andrew Anagnost","We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can. ","Steve Koenig","Sounds good. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI.","Ken Talanian","So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front?","Scott Herren","Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It\u2019s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend?","Amarpreet Hanspal","So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward.","Ken Talanian","Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more?","Scott Herren","Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections?","Scott Herren","EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg ","I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we\u2019re seeing is, we\u2019re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we\u2019ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people.","The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we\u2019re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings.","When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing. ","Amarpreet Hanspal","Monika, I just [indiscernible], we\u2019ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves.","Monika Garg ","Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","The one, so I could say we don\u2019t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that\u2019s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we\u2019re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we\u2019ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types.","Monika Garg ","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Dave Gennarelli, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2013. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2013, long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, new products and suite releases and expected growth rates, certain future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies and trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries. We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially.","Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2012, and our periodic Form 8-K filings, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. These documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during this call are being made as of today.

Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We'll provide guidance on today's call, but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and prepared remarks and is on our Investor Relations section of our website.","We will quote a number of numeric and growth changes as we discuss our financial performance. And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. We were pleased with our first quarter results, which were solid, although somewhat uneven. We had strong revenue growth in Asia Pacific and the Americas, strong growth in our Manufacturing and AEC business segments and strong growth in revenue from suites.","Offsetting these strong growth areas were mixed results in EMEA and emerging countries, as well as a decline in our Media and Entertainment business segment. We also accomplished a couple of significant structural and organizational changes during the quarter that we believe will better position the company for future growth.","There were several areas of highlights in our performance compared to the first quarter of last year: 34% growth in total suites revenue, 19% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses, 18% growth in Manufacturing, and 16% growth in AEC, record revenue in Asia Pacific, record deferred revenue balance, a 210 basis point improvement in non-GAAP operating margin, and 18% growth in non-GAAP EPS.","Much like the past few quarters, our business in EMEA was varied within the region. As you might expect, we experienced weakness in most of Southern Europe and had better results in Central Europe, including a record quarter in Germany.","Within EMEA, we had good performance in our Manufacturing and AEC business segments, while PSEB and M&E did not do as well. PSEB had a tough compare to Q1 last year, when we ran a successful promotion on AutoCAD LT. The economic picture for EMEA is unpredictable, so there continues to be a degree of uncertainty. But overall, the sales environment in EMEA doesn't feel all that different than it has over the past few quarters.","Another area where our results were uneven was our revenue growth in emerging economies. By nature, these markets are much more volatile, and much like EMEA, our results were varied by country. For example, compared to the first quarter of last year, we recorded strong growth in Russia and China but had weak results in Brazil and India. While currency devaluation played a role in both Brazil and India, we are taking actions to expand our business and improve our performance in these countries.","We continue to believe that the BRIC countries and other emerging economies around the world hold tremendous growth potential for Autodesk, and we are focused on improving our performance there.","Our results for M&E were impacted by 2 items: One was an intentional part of our strategy and the other resulted from poor execution. First, as you know, our new design suites combine the functionality of many of the products necessary to optimize the design workflow. The value of providing all these functionality in a suite helps drive increased ASPs. Several of our animation products include 3ds Max, are now available in our design suites, and, as a result, many of our customers no longer need to purchase these products separately.","So as our customers migrate to our new suites, we are starting to see reported revenue for the standalone version of those animation products decline. This is not unexpected. And as we've noted in the past, we anticipate and encourage our customers to migrate to our suites, which carry a higher ASP. The value of the suites is highly compelling to our customers and is the right strategy for Autodesk.","Our results in Creative Finishing were disappointing. Separate from what we're experiencing with animation products, revenue from Creative Finishing declined as we believe customers delayed their purchase in anticipation of a new third-party hardware platform that is expected to be released this quarter, and our Smoke for the Mac product, which will be released in Q3.","We achieved strong results in our Manufacturing business segment with solid performance in each geography. During the quarter, we unveiled our new manufacturing suites, which offer a complete set of integrated and interoperable suites to simplify design, visualization and simulation workflows. These suites also provide a broad range of cloud services to help manufacturers more efficiently design, engineer and manufacture better products faster and at reduced cost.","At the heart of our manufacturing suites is Inventor, our model-based 3D design tool. Since we launched Inventor in 1999, it has become a significant contributor to our growth over the years, and we recently reached the milestone of shipping our 1 million suite.","Our growing Simulation business also performed well during the quarter. We're excited about the launch of the new Autodesk Simulation family of products, which deliver a faster, more accurate and flexible approach to predicting, optimizing and validating designs earlier in the design process.","Our new PLM offering went wide in the quarter as well. Autodesk PLM 360 is our new cloud-based solution designed to transform how customers manage their entire product life cycle. 100% cloud-based, Autodesk PLM 360 was a new generation of PLM that's affordable, easy-to-use and simple to deploy, bringing the benefits of PLM instantly to anyone within the extended enterprise.","We've only been in the market for 3 months, but we're thrilled with the current results. We're seeing everything from large enterprise companies who have legacy PLM systems deploy pilot projects to SMB companies who never used PLM before deploy our new service. This truly expands our market opportunity, and we're looking forward to watching this business grow over time.","Our AEC business segment performed well on a global basis. We refreshed our AEC suites, which had exceptional growth in Q1. We've added enhancements to our AEC suites, expanded cloud services and improved collaboration and data management tools, aimed at helping design, engineering and construction professionals address today's business challenges with enhanced then workflows.","The cloud services I referenced are all part of Autodesk 360, a cloud computing platform that helps users dramatically improve the way project teams design, visualize, simulate and share work. Autodesk 360 offers secure access to project data anytime, anywhere, taking advantage of virtually infinite computing power through a broad range of cloud-based services. Autodesk 360 is now available to all Autodesk Design Suite customers with additional capabilities and greater capacity available to Design Suite customers who purchased an Autodesk subscription.","Since the launch of Autodesk 360 cloud services last September, we've had approximately 8 million unique users and among other things, have utilized more than 3 million hours of rendering services. I've mentioned over the past 2 years that we've been moving to increase usage of electronic software delivery. The purpose behind this move is twofold: to improve customer experience and to help us control cost. We are seeing a positive impact on our cost as gross margins improved during the quarter.","Additionally, at the end of the first quarter, channel inventory weeks was at a record low of approximately 1 week. A decrease in channel inventory and shippable backlog was expected as a result of our transition to increased use of electronic software delivery.","In addition, we completed a reorganization of some of our internal resources, including organizing our sales teams by industry. The changes are intended to better serve our customers and drive future growth.  We also made some adjustments to our channel program for FY '13, drawing on best practices from our various geographies.","So to wrap things up, we've got a lot accomplished in the first quarter and posted solid overall results. While the macroeconomic environment continues to keep us somewhat cautious, we remain confident with our FY '13 goal of increasing revenue by at least 10% and increasing non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 200 basis points.","Operator, we'd now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Perry Huang for Heather. I had a question about the business environment and linearity, I guess, particularly for EMEA, the emerging markets and the U.S. Did you notice any change on the part of your customers as you moved to the quarter? For example, their budgets get tighter towards the end versus the beginning. Or did you sense any increase in hesitancy on spend on their part?","Carl Bass","No, Perry, we really didn't see any change in linearity during the quarter. Nothing different than usual and nothing -- despite the varied performance by country, nothing country by country in linearity.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then I guess, given where you stand today and sort of the conversations you're having with customers, how would you characterize customer demand and I guess the business outlook today versus, say, back in August of last year, like concerns around Europe were also in the headlines, are there any noticeable similarities or differences?","Carl Bass","If I had to say anything, in some ways, I'd say it's better. People are more optimistic, and I think partially, it's that people have gotten a little bit immune in the business community less than in the financial community to concerns over Greece, Spain, Portugal, whatever. So I think there's a sense in the business community that people need to drive their businesses forward. And so while a year ago, it was closer to the downturn in the U.S. and seemed scarier. I think the business environment remains one in which people feel like they need to move their business forward. The only thing I'm seeing that is similar, particularly in Europe, there's -- we had a good quarter in the U.S. and I think if anything, the bias there is upwards. In Europe, we're seeing a tightening of credit. And I think it's all -- I mean, that shouldn't be news to anybody if you're reading the newspapers, that the banks are experiencing some amount of trauma.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, just on Europe, you mentioned that it hasn't really felt any different but it obviously caught up to you this quarter. And you had a fairly easy comp on a year-over-year basis. I mean, from your perspective, how long lasting do you think this is, if you have any visibility you could share with us? Do you think this is a shorter-term impact or are you a little more concerned about the longer-term?","Carl Bass","So Brent, one part I agree with you, it's really caught up with us. The one that's different is, I want to tell you, it's a particularly easy compare. We've run a promotion with LT and a number of other things same time last year. So the compare wasn't -- we didn't feel it was particularly easy. To the substance of your question, I don't think I have anything really to add that's not already out there. I'm not sure any of our business results give an indication of anything different than what everybody is talking about. I think, if anything, we just put a finer point on it and reinforce the strength in Northern and Central Europe and the weakness in Southern Europe. The thing that struck me particularly is that we did well in Manufacturing and AEC and that Germany had a record quarter. And so I think you really just see the tale of 2 nations, and I think it's Northern and Southern Europe are just going in divergent directions.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I guess, on the bottom line you're expecting starting a little bit more -- I don't know if Mark can comment in terms of the expense structure. Were there any one-time event at the beginning of the year that maybe you weren't anticipating that came in, in Q1?","Mark J. Hawkins","Brent, first of all, I would say, no. I mean, I think we are pleased to be able to deliver the plan that we put out there and execute accordingly. So I wouldn't say that there were any things in particular. As you know, we don't guide at a spending level or at an operating margin level for the particular quarter. We focus more on the EPS level. So I think the answer is there's nothing in particular that I would call out to be special.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Returning to the subject of the Europe comp, in terms of the disparity between Germany and non-Germany, first of all, do you do anything differently operationally or on the cost side to respond to these different performances by region within Europe? Or do you let things continue as you had planned before for the year? In addition, still on Europe, do you think that any of the structural changes in the channel over there in the last 6 to 9 months might have had any effect on the ground, in terms of tech data or anybody else going through some of the changes over there, could that have had any effect in addition to the macro effects?","Carl Bass","Yes, so let me just take it backwards. I think the major thing we're seeing is macro effects. On the margin, I think there's many things that we do in our sales execution and channel policies that affects stuff. But I think the major thing -- and as we've seen often, we're a pretty good reflection of what's going on in the economy. As to what we do differently, certainly marginally, there are investments that, for example -- let me a give you a concrete example. The PLM sales force that we continue to build out, we're having great success with our PLM sales. In the plan were headcount slated for Southern Europe, it makes no sense in my mind to go there when there's so much business in the U.S., Germany. As you saw from the results, Japan and Korea did well. So you have other places that are really strong in Manufacturing, and so why not go there instead of go to Southern Europe? So I think when we have incremental decisions to make, the answers are kind of obvious. I think we're taking a more cautious attitude to EMEA as we look to the long term. I really don't know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow and read that the Eurozone is falling apart and Greek is out of it or whether a bank defaults. So what we're doing is taking a more cautious attitude. We've moderated spend in EMEA, and in very specific examples, where it makes much sense, to hire new people in southern Europe or where we have the opportunity to redeploy people from Southern Europe to Northern our Central Europe, we're taking advantage of all of those.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. My follow-up has to do with maintenance. The year-over-year billings increase was a bit light if I were to look at the last 6 months and take into account the upside in Q4, we're still up about 10%. So maybe you could just walk us through the billings performance, the maintenance in Q1, what your thoughts are for the balance of the year? And now that the new suites from last year are, in fact, 1 year old, are you beginning to see the renewals for the 2011 suites?","Carl Bass","Yes, let me answer a little bit and then I'll ask Mark to jump in. I mean, one of the things that we have seen is from some of the channel practices, and we did roll out a new channel partner framework, is we did see some of the business move into Q4, there are incentives in place for our partners and our customers. So I think we saw some there. And I think the view you were taking is a better one of blending it over a period of time, to better analyze it, as I often say, rather than look at one quarter, it's better to look over time. And we're really happy with where our Maintenance billings are without wider lens.","Mark J. Hawkins","I completely agree. And Jeff, I think you're completely on it. When you take a look at the -- both Q1 of '13 and Q4 of '12, and you look at the average Maintenance billings of around 10% and you look at the exact same kind of reference point a year earlier, it's around 10%. We're pleased. It's exactly as Carl described, it's just a normalization while we have implemented these big changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendon Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, you touched on in your comments that you saw re-acceleration in both the AEC business and the Manufacturing business on a year-over-year growth basis. And you mentioned suites. Were there any other factors that were driving that acceleration?","Carl Bass","I think the big one is suites. I think that's what's really driving that, I think, in each of the industries. Manufacturing has held together relatively well. Our customers are continuing to invest. Suites, higher ASPs are all contributing in there. There is certainly a moderately improved construction environment around the world and we're seeing the benefit of that. As I've said, as we've walked through this transition from 2D modeling all the way to BIM, the adoption of BIM is inevitable now. People are doing it, as they see new projects come on, we're seeing increased mandates from governments around the world for building information modeling as a standard deliverable. So I think we have a lot of secular factors in each of the industries. I was really pleased to see both those businesses do well.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then focusing on something other than Europe, the emerging markets. Any changes? I mean, you mentioned that you know you could do better there. Any personal changes or channel changes that are going on in that market, or, for that matter, in the medium product line, as well, to kind of address some of the execution issues you saw there?","Carl Bass","Yes, so a number of things. So first of all, let me just give you the backdrop. I think I say this every 90 days, is that the emerging markets are always more volatile. And so we just have to remember that. Having said that, I was definitely disappointed. We had made personnel changes already. We had some other structural changes in place. There's also an effect of our overall sales reorganization. We're working hard on it but in some ways, we'll watch it as it develops this quarter. I think we've made a substantial number of changes and understand what we're doing, but we're going to watch it closely. I don't see anything systemic. I think this is more of an acute issue.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And anything on the Media side, sort of the same question?","Carl Bass","Oh, the Media? The Media and Entertainment business was a little bit more one of -- we've got a bunch of bad bounces in some ways. One of our hardware vendors pushed out the release of their product, selling our Creative Finishing products on that is -- once there's a new product announced, nobody wants to buy our product on their old products. Because of the way the industry works, we went to market with Smoke for the Mac. It's getting rave reviews. People are highly anticipating it. But it has certainly frozen sales to some degree. And then the third thing I mentioned a little bit is we do expect our reported revenue in M&E to go down somewhat as some of that functionality is incorporated into the design suites. So there are a number of things there. We've made a number of changes. We're on top of what's going on. In some ways, it's an interesting quarter. And if I told you, well, the Americas and Japan we're going to do well, Manufacturing, AEC we're going to do well, I would have never imagined that there was a conspiracy amongst these other -- these smaller parts of our business to make the results less than perfect.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Carl, I was wondering if you could just comment on the large deal activity on the quarter both on a broad basis as well as via major geo?","Carl Bass","Yes, the large deals continue to be up. We made an investment in our major account sales force a couple of years ago. We continue to invest in that. We see really good returns from it. And large deal activity was about double, I think.","Mark J. Hawkins","That's exactly right.","Carl Bass","So double -- double what we saw the year before.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, how are hiring trends over the past 90 days -- or the past quarter, rather? And how are you thinking about net adds over the balance of fiscal '13 at this point?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, as we've seen the turmoil in Europe, we've slowed down our hiring. What we've really limit it to -- I mean, we don't want to compromise future growth so there are key places, for example, I already mentioned PLM sales force in places like the U.S. and Germany. We want to continue to expand that, our sales efforts in Simulation and in BIM. They're paying good rewards, we want to continue. We've definitely slowed down hiring and I feel like we're tapping on the brakes, or it's one foot on the gas, one foot on the brakes is maybe the appropriate driving metaphor. But we're definitely being more cautious not only with hiring but spending in general. And that's why we're able to sit here and kind of reiterate guidance for the year, but it's definitely with some adjustments to the spending plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Daniel Morrison - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Dan Morrison in for Phil. Can you just give a little bit more detail on how business has been trending in the commercial construction vertical? And then whether you've seen any major changes with your customers?","Carl Bass","Like I said, I think the bias in commercial construction is up. Certainly, in the U.S. and Japan, there are definitely more construction starts, more projects being funded. Some of the things that were going on in the United States around financing, that seems to have lifted. So I don't think any of our construction customers would say it's a booming economy. But they've certainly all adjusted their business, and the business is expanding and they're investing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'd like to ask on EMEA what your expectations are for the second half of the year? Are you expecting that, that business improves?","Carl Bass","Our guidance for the year contemplates not knowing what's going on in Europe. So I would say it a little bit more clearly is, we assume it's not going to be much different than what we've seen so far in kind of the trend we've been under. Should it worsen, we'll take appropriate measures. Should it improve, there'll be upside to what we're doing now. But we're not really expecting any difference. And I certainly don't -- I don't have any crystal ball that I think any of you don't have. But I'm certainly not expecting it in the next 90 days. I think given the usual things that go on in Europe during the summer, given the results of 2 elections and the upcoming negotiations, I don't think we're going to see much change in the business environment.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So if we look at the Manufacturing business and the AEC business growing 16% and 18%, yet the suite growth within those, one was in AEC up 51% and in the Manufacturing business up 16%. I just wonder, what is the strength in suites and AEC? What is the color going on there?","Carl Bass","Well, I mean, one of the things you have is that when -- some of it is a direct shift from individual products to suites, and that is the biggest effect that you're seeing. So the majority of what you're seeing going on is that.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just real quickly, on the platform solutions business, was that slower at all in the United States or Asia Pac?","Carl Bass","On the Manufacturing business?","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm talking about the platform solution in emerging businesses market. Was there any weakness or slowing in the United States, let's say, in that business?","Carl Bass","Nothing dramatic.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So my question is actually, I guess, following-on, on Steve's. In looking at a 2Q guide that if you look at the midpoint of the guidance range, I believe, it calls for about 8% total revenue growth. You guys are still confident seeing growth for 10% for the year, which would seem to imply something like a re-acceleration to the back half of the year. So I guess the more pointed question is, what gives you confidence in that ability to, basically, reaccelerate off of 2Q into the back half of the year? Is there anything in the pipeline or kind of what you're seeing from a buyer perspective that gives you confidence of that boost?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, what I'm assuming for the back half of the year is some of the changes that we made will actually have an impact. Certainly, we slowed down our businesses in certain places, and, like I said, a couple of things bounced the wrong way in the quarter. But generally speaking, the most important countries and our most important markets are growing well and we see the bias on them upwards. And so that's why I feel confident about it. Maybe Mark wants to add something?","Mark J. Hawkins","I agree with Carl's comments. And keep in mind, we did grow 11% in Q1. And also, the thing I think about that Carl underscored at the onset, is we've just got some major changes implemented that we actually feel really position us well for the long term. So that's a good thing to have behind us as well.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. So 2Q slowing down from 11% to the 8% at the midpoint of your guidance, does that mean there's still transitions taking place as some of these changes take effect?","Mark J. Hawkins","I think what you should think about is just we're looking at the year and the commitment for the year at 10% plus in revenue growth and approximately 200 basis points in operating margin. And we always talk about, Keith, it's not going to be a perfectly linear kind of spread sheet effect. We've looked at a number of different facts and circumstances, and we think there's a range of guidance we put out and we feel like that probably...","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, if you put Q1 and Q2 together, and then you look at Q3 and Q4, it's not very far off, linear growth.","Mark J. Hawkins","And we also...","Carl Bass","And I wish, with thousands of transactions, we could be more predictable, but that's pretty good.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And if I could sneak in one last one, and you talked about a really good growth in your large deals. And there's one in particular that you guys called out in a press release with Balfour Beatty, which was a large transaction, I think 3 years, $12 million. But in the press release, you noted it was a first of its kind. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color of what made this a first of its kind type transaction in the quarter?","Carl Bass","I think you read the press release more closely than I did. Seriously. I mean, I would actually take a slightly different point of view. I mean, Balfour Beatty is a great customer but it looks like many of the other deals that we've been doing with large construction firms, it looks very similar to a number of the big deals we've done in the last couple of years. Large firms, consolidating their positions, growing their market share outside their core markets, we being able to service them globally, it has lots of the characteristics that we see from our large construction companies as well as large E&C firms all around the world. So I wouldn't have thought of it as a particularly atypical deal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So on the cloud PLM product, does that offer kind of a high level of product data management functionality? Or possibly kind of a derivative question off of that is, if I were a potential customer, could I buy your cloud PLM as a project management layer and maybe then link that into other firms that did, frankly, more gnarly back-end data management effort, so not to diminish what you have, but maybe that would be a quick way to...","Carl Bass","So let me just remind you, one of the things we've done is, with our cloud PLM, we've done in the cloud the parts of PLM, the business process, the workflow that has been historically the promise of PLM. On the PDM side, we actually have a very capable product called Autodesk Vault. If I was to guess, there's probably more data stored in Autodesk Vault than in any of the other PDM systems around. We have more customers. We have more data in it than almost anything else on the market. So we have that. We still believe the product data management thing is probably more appropriate for almost all of our customers behind the firewall. Because it's for work in process with engineering teams. So we actually have a capable one. Having said that, the PLM thing, we believe that the right deployment for PLM, the truly name PLM is on the cloud. And our PLM system will work whether the data is stored in Autodesk Vault, whether it's stored in another so-called PLM system or anywhere else. One of the interesting things as we brought this to market and talked to many of the analysts, in some ways, there's been a little bit of -- people who follow the industry, having been hoodwinked by the PLM vendors. The vast majority of PLM that's been sold and successfully deployed is really a PDM system. The PLM was a name that they put on top of it to make it sound more important, more enterprise-wide. But really, what was being sold was PDM. And so I feel really good about our capabilities in PDM, and I'm even more excited about what we're going to do with PLM because I think it's really the first time ever that there's a solution out there that answers the question of managing Manufacturing processes.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got it, that makes sense. Well, you just need to rename you Vault to Big Data and then that's...","Carl Bass","Exactly. If I can rename our Vault to Big Data and I could get a valuation like Pinterest on something else, Autodesk will be worth like a billion dollars.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Right. Yes. Then you're off to the races at that point...","Carl Bass","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With the strength in the AEC suites up 51%, was there something in particular in this version that is accelerating the switch to the suite? And as that grows, how you do you look at the sustainability, or maybe was there some pent-up demand there?","Carl Bass","No, we moved customers only this time, just like we had done with Inventor last year. But there's real traction in the suites. It is, by far, the most attractive offering for our customers. It will not stay at 51% at all. That's not a reasonable terminal run rate. But we were really pleased. I think, also, what we finally did is we brought together some of the things that we've been working on for a while. So not to get too down into the weaves but as an example, our Revit products used to be separate. So whether you're doing mechanical, electrical, plumbing or structural, we've brought that together into a single product and put that in the suites. We've put in some of the other products that's around it and made for a more complete workflow. And we worked on making sure that the products really met the interoperability needs of our customers. So by doing all of that, it's really a very attractive offering. And as I've said before, I think the majority, if not vast majority, of our AEC customers over time will move to suites.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One follow-up. On the Media and Entertainment, you mentioned a couple of factors that was hitting it. How should we think about the longer term? As you get past those couple of near-term items, how should we think about the Media and Entertainment segment in terms of growth?","Carl Bass","I think you should see a return to historic levels. I fully expect our hardware partner to ship their hardware next quarter. You may see a little impact until Smoke for the Mac comes out in Q3. I'm hoping to see a little bump there. We have huge pent-up demand for Smoke on the Mac. I mean, we've really kind of changed the offering and changed the price point. It was kind of extreme but highly attractive to the market. So we'll see how that plays out in Q3. But certainly, by then, any unevenness will -- should have been moderated.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Carl, I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the pricing changes that you've made. We've seen some of the promotional materials out to the channel and to your customers about some of the deadlines coming up here, and just wondering how we should expect that to roll through the business as we move into the July and quarter and beyond?","Carl Bass","I think you'll continue to see some pricing changes. I don't think there's anything extreme. I don't think you'll see anything radical. In some ways -- the 2 things to look at, and it sounds like, Walter, you were doing both. There are 2 important things to look at. One is what the pricing changes are and not on a per-unit price but on the overall channel framework. I think that certainly influences our partners' behavior. And then secondarily, what we do for these kind of point promotions. What goes on. I don't see any unusual activity around promotions. I think you'll see the usual promotions and you'll probably see the usual, but not consistent across the portfolio, price increases this year as well.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just a question on margins. Your guidance for the year is clear with 200 basis points. And I guess, as we think beyond this year, not specifically looking for a number here, but if I compare your business model to some of your peers in software, your R&D spending, that's creeping into the mid-20s, seems to be high relative to the group. And I'm wondering, as you get beyond this year, do you start to have to bring that number down to be able to continue to expand your margins?","Mark J. Hawkins","We'll probably have to at least cap it where it is in order to do it. But let me remind you of a couple of things and then tell you a little bit about some of the factors that go into the R&D spend. We spend a lot of time looking at this number, and, actually, we've dug deep with some of our peers. We spent a lot of time benchmarking. And one of the things to do is it's very interesting to compare us to people who sell primarily through a channel versus those who sell direct. Because if you look and if you take our percentage of R&D over our total revenue, as compared to our R&D over end-user spend, the overall end-user spend by our customers is probably about twice of what our revenue is. So if a company does everything direct, those numbers are way off. As I indicated, it could be off by as much as a factor of 2. If you limit the group more to the peer companies that sell through the channel, then I still think we're at the high end of the range but it's much more normal. The reason that I think it's important, we're going through a fairly important transition where we think there's a bunch of opportunity, and this is primarily around social, mobile and cloud. And while I think we can continue to invest in R&D and make steady progress to our promise goal of 30% operating margins, we don't want to forgo the opportunity and kind of be left on the desktop as the entire world moves to social, mobile and the cloud. So it's a constant balancing act. Those are some of the factors that weigh into it. And maybe that gives a little bit more clarity in how we're thinking about this.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But comparison to like an Adobe, it's probably balanced?","Carl Bass","Adobe is very fair, unfortunately.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to go back to the maintenance billings again. And I think you mentioned that it make sense for us to look on a blended basis rather than at the 1% growth in the quarter. But the question I have to that is, given the strength in Maintenance billings growth last year in the high teens, almost 20% level, and now thinking about it blended, more at 10%, how would you have us think about kind of how this may play out this year? Is the 10% number more accurate than the closer to 20%? How would have us think about that Maintenance billings growth this year? And then I have a follow-up.","Carl Bass","I mean -- oh, this is Ross, sorry. Ross, I mean, we don't usually guide at that level, but if I -- indications, I'd be on the high side of 10% -- I'd be closer to the high side of 10% than the low side of 20%.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then related to that then. Obviously, you saw Maintenance billings strength last year, especially as you're selling suites and you're going to capture more of that revenue this year through the tail on Maintenance on the suites. Is there anything that's changing around either renewal rates or attach rates? And I guess I'm just curious to whether you -- because you made notice something along those lines in the prepared remarks. Anything that we should be thinking about in terms of how you envisage customers reacting to what are clearly higher maintenance rates as they move to suites?","Mark J. Hawkins","So one of the things I would say to you, Ross, is that if you look at our attach rates and you compare them on a year-on-year basis, really, no change to speak of, we're pleased with what we're seeing with the attach rates. In terms of our renewals as well, I think we've got a really solid performance in the renewals. And I would call out to you that, again, they're higher than pre-recession levels. I mean, we're getting good traction on that, long term. So and as far as anything in particular with suites, we're doing the anniversary-ing of a lot of our suite introductions, so we're going to continue to see the renewal rates. But thus far, I think things look solid.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with Longbow Research.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","I've got one for Mark and then one for Carl. Mark, starting with you, I was surprised at the amount of year-on-year currency tailwind you got this quarter, I think it was maybe 2 points or so to get to that 11% revenue growth. Could you give us any help with what your assumptions are regarding the currency\/hedging impact in Q2 built into your guidance?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes. One of the things that we don't get into particulars on is the actual FX rates and such that we lock down on. But the one thing I can give you color on and just to kind of reiterate, is that we do a 4-quarter layered hedge, and we hedge our exposures not only for revenue but also deferred revenue and such. And so we look at the full equation. And the closer you are, for example, in the current quarter, like for example when we give guidance, we're mostly hedged. And as you go out 4 quarters out, it's less hedged. So that's the -- more of the kind of the dynamic process that we use. But in terms of particular rates, we don't typically share that. But I think you've called out the tailwind for Q1 appropriately.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. All right. And then Carl, for you, maybe what I'd like to do here is just drill down a little bit on the changes in terms of the sales organization internally and the channel program. Could you maybe give us -- drill down and give us a little color on how the verticalization in the sales organization might help you going forward? What the timing of that might be? Where will it show up? And secondly, in terms of the channel, what kind of impact do you expect from the new global rebate program? Positive or negative? Short term, long term? And were there any other major changes that -- aspects to that program that you changed in Q1?","Carl Bass","Yes, what we really changed with the sales organization is, as opposed to the primary way of organizing had been historically geographical, we moved to one based on industry. And what we were seeing is that a manufacturing customer in Germany and one in Japan had more in common than a construction company and a Media and Entertainment company in Germany did. And it only makes sense, given the size of our business, to move there. Also increasingly, our customers are larger, they're more global, they want to be serviced by us in a way that made sense, and it was starting to strain some of the organizational boundaries. So I think we'll do a better job servicing our customers by being organized this way, better job of bringing our products to market. That actually funnels down to our channel partners. And generally, just keeping up with the trends that we've talked about for a long time, which is giving more access to more of our products to more of our channel partners. We always -- a manufacturing customer, for example, could be someone who buys our manufacturing products, our AEC products or Media and Entertainment products. And we felt increasingly, it didn't make sense for them to have to go to multiple channel partners to do that. So we've been on a process to open up access to more of our channel partners. Other changes we made internally are important for us, I don't think they mean a whole lot to the rest of the world. But suffice to say, it's a fair amount of work reorganizing internally and getting everything lined up, both from the finances, the quotas, everything like that. So there have been a lot of people who have worked awfully hard to get this all lined up and do it in a short time frame of both closing out the year and getting us lined up for Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Appreciate the color on some of the early cloud PLM success and realizing it is early, I wonder if you can give us a few more details on some of the enterprise pilots. I guess, in particular, maybe which verticals, early feedback. And then I guess, is there any indication that any of these guys would potentially reduce their spend on traditional PLM?","Carl Bass","Yes, there are definitely 2 classes of customers. The patterns are starting to emerge. We've been in beta for a while, but the product, just to remind everyone, the product released on February 29. So we're barely 2.5 months into selling it. The 2 categories that are emerging, and I gave a little bit of indication of this, is the high end of small- and medium-sized businesses that have wanted PLM, may not be able to afford PLM, or really couldn't get it implemented well enough under their budgets. It was too complex, it was -- it just didn't fit what they needed. So that's one class. The second one is the enterprise ones, which in some of these are much more interesting in that the customer already understands PLM, they understand the limitations of the traditional kind of big iron systems and know what they want to do. And what I would say is, we have not replaced a single one yet. Almost all of the work inside the enterprise at this point are pilot projects. They're pilots where one of 2 things, they have a critical area where they want to see if this is a way that a new kind of deployment will fit their needs or the other one is probably slightly more typical, they do not want to extend their use of the traditional PLM systems. They don't know how to remove them, but they don't want to spend more and they're not going to extend their use within the enterprise, and they want to find another way to do that. And so we're seeing lots of places, departments, functions, processes, where PLM, the traditional PLM was never implemented, or more likely have failed one or multiple times. And they see the advantage to do this. The very interesting part of the color commentary is, I just met with our sales team around PLM this morning, and the customers are very clear about what they want to deploy for them. When we go in and talk to them, they're very clear about a very specific problem in which the traditional systems have proved inadequate, and they know exactly what they want to pilot it on. And so we're helping them do that. And 3 months from now, we'll be able to give you a lot more info.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. Then maybe a quick follow-up for Mark. And Mark, I know you guys don't guide the individual components of revenue, license and maintenance. But given the Q2 guide, which I assume would imply license revenue, flat to down slightly sequentially. Have your assumptions for sort of the full-year 10% or better revenue growth changed from when you initially offered it? Or is this still progressing sort of as you expected based off the initial guidance?","Mark J. Hawkins","I think it's pretty much as we expected. There's always little moderations here or there. But by and large, I think the plan has been the plan, and we're driving to it.","Carl Bass","The plan -- I agree with Mark, the plan is the plan. On the other hand, I would have never expected the particular mix of business and geography we saw in Q1. In Q4, you can talk to me all day long, and I never would have guessed so strong in certain places -- so strong in Japan, that didn't seem so likely, so strong in both Manufacturing and AEC. So I wouldn't have expected the exact mix that we got. And if anything surprised us this quarter, it was really that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] At this time, there are no further questions.

Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at Autodesk.com\/investor.","As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the Company, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2015, long-term financial model guidance, including subscriptions, value per subscription, billings, and recurring revenue growth. The factors we use to estimate our guidance are business model transition, new product and suite releases, market adoption and expected growth rates, cost management efforts, our market opportunities and strategies, business execution, trends and sales initiatives for our products, and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the FY \u201813; Form 10-Q for the periods ended April 30, July 31, and October 31, 2013; and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks.

We will quote a number of numeric growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We finished the year strongly and have good momentum going into fiscal 2015. This was the first quarter of our new business model transition. Considering the substantial sequential backlog we built, along with the strong cash flow in deferred revenue, we are very pleased with the overall results.","I'll get into our business model transition in a minute, but first I'll call out some highlights from Q4. Our fourth-quarter results were driven by continued strength in both our AEC segment and suites offerings. Our AEC business really had a spectacular quarter to close out a record year. We booked a significant number of $1 million-plus transactions, including the largest transaction in Autodesk history, worth more than $20 million.","We made significant progress in driving BIM adoption in the AEC industry. BIM is increasingly mandated on projects, and we're partnering with our customers to ensure they have the right tools to deliver high quality projects. Collaboration and mobility are rising in importance for our customers, and that's what our cloud-based BIM 360 product is all about.","Last quarter, I mentioned we booked our first $1-million transaction for BIM 360. In Q4, we booked more than 20 BIM-360 transactions worth over $100,000, including two new transactions worth over $1 million each. In just a few quarters, BIM 360 has become one of our fastest growing products ever.","Another area of strength in our fourth-quarter results is the continued adoption of our suites, which grew 15% and now represent 37% of total revenue. Growth in the adoption of our suites remains one of the pillars of our growth strategy and supports our long-term goal of generating 20% more value from our subscription customers.","Our strength in suites was partially offset by a decline in AutoCAD, which was anticipated as we look to migrate our point product users to one of our suites. We did see a nice rebound to solid growth in AutoCAD LT, which had particular strength in Asia-Pacific.","I'm very happy with our execution in the manufacturing business. We continue to see significant wins in industrial machinery, consumer products, and automotive. I'm thrilled with the rollout of Fusion 360, the first cloud-based CAD tool for mechanical and industrial designers.","One other highlight is the momentum in our PLM 360 business. We had our best quarter ever, which included our largest PLM 360 transaction to date, worth almost $700,000. We are seeing good traction across geographies and industries. One particularly interesting data point is that almost 25% of this quarter's PLM 360 customers are new to Autodesk. To date, nearly 1,000 companies have deployed PLM 360.","Just after Q4, we closed our acquisition of Delcam, the industry's leading CAM technology. With this acquisition, we are taking the next step in helping our customers manufacture their products. Autodesk and Delcam have many things in common, from a loyal group of talented employees, to a shared desire to radically improve the process of manufacturing. It's really exciting to bring together a combination that will change the way products are designed and made.","So now let me talk about our business model transition. The start of our business model transition is a milestone event that will take Autodesk to a more recurring subscription-oriented business over the next four years.","In many respects, we started the transition 10 years ago with the introduction of maintenance subscription, which has grown to become about 45% of our revenue mix. We're now taking the next step in transitioning even more of our upfront license revenue to recurring over the next four years and beyond, as we build upon the maintenance subscription base with cloud service subscription and desktop subscription, formerly referred to as rentals.","Q4 was the first full quarter of availability for desktop subscription. While it's obviously very early, we're pleased with what we're seeing so far. A meaningful portion of desktop subscribers are new to Autodesk, and the majority is choosing the annual term-length option. We experienced good uptake of our M&E products, which makes a lot of sense, as those customers tend to be much more project-based.","Another element of the business model transition is offering our enterprise customers more flexible licensing options. In addition to being a great benefit for our customers, these contracts create a larger recurring revenue stream, which is recognized ratably. Our enterprise customers have expressed great interest in this type of contract.","While we saw good traction on the new offerings and customers responded enthusiastically, we introduced these offerings a little late in the quarter for some customers to make the change. As a result, we overestimated how much revenue would be deferred. We thought it might be as much as $50 million, but came in at approximately $30 million.","We received very positive feedback from our customers around this new pricing option. Some of our largest customers, including AECOM, URS, Floor [ph] and GHD, moved to the new option. With AECOM, we entered into a global, multi-year, enterprise-wide agreement, which provides all of their users with complete access to Autodesk desktop and cloud services in a flexible model to support their business strategy. It is deals like this that make me confident that these flexible licensing offerings will be a meaningful portion of our large enterprise deals going forward.","At this time, we don't have anything new to report regarding changing the ratability of some of our perpetual license revenue. We'll keep you posted as our plan evolves in that area.","Now I'll take a minute to review our FY \u201815 guidance. For the first time, we're providing billings guidance. During the transition, this will be another way to measure the overall health of our business.","Our initial view is for net billings to grow 5% to 8% in FY \u201815. Our initial view for revenue growth is 3% to 5%. Within the revenue estimate, we have factored in our assumption for moving additional enterprise customers to ratably recognize flexible contracts. It also contains our assumption for increased adoption of our desktop and cloud subscription offerings.","The revenue contribution from Delcam will be muted, especially in Q1, in part due to the typical write down of deferred revenue the first year. Our operating margin assumption for the year includes the impact from the business model transition, investment in our cloud infrastructure, and a dilutive effect of the Delcam transaction. We continue to balance our cost-savings initiatives with the investments we are making to solidify our leadership in the cloud and our business model transition.","In FY \u201815, we're expecting to add approximately 150,000 to 200,000 net new subscriptions. Since FY09, our subscription base has grown 26% to approximately 1.9 million. As we go forward, we plan to report out on the number of net new subscriptions added on a quarterly basis.","Keep in mind that this transition will not be perfectly linear, and the amount of business that we transition and number of new subscriptions we add will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year. We're expecting the transition to progress gradually in FY \u201815, and then ramp more significantly by the time we get to FY \u201817 and FY \u201818.","To help you track our progress, we will continue to provide you with our typical guidance and disclosures. For now, we've added the subscription guidance. As the model evolves, we will include other metrics as appropriate.","We remain confident in our four-year model that we highlighted at our Investor Day last October, which calls for a 12% billing CAGR, 20% more annual value from our new and existing subscriptions, and a 50% increase in subscriptions. We believe we can accomplish this while getting to a 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the end of FY \u201818.","Clearly there are a lot of moving parts as we head into FY \u201815. We feel good about the current macro environment and feel great about the direction of the Company.","Never before have we had such a rich and deep product portfolio, and we've clearly established ourselves as the cloud leader in design, engineering, and simulation. This is important because many of the problems our customers face benefit directly from the cloud as a platform. The early successes of BIM 360, PLM 360, and Fusion 360 demonstrate this.","We're really excited about our new cloud-based services, which complement our existing offerings. The industry is beginning a major technology shift, and we are ideally positioned to capitalize on it. The new business model and technology platform are a win for our customers and us.","Lastly, I want to thank our employees and partners for their outstanding efforts and contributions over the past year. They've done a fabulous job.","Operator, now I'd like to open the call up for questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","","Carl, the billings and revenue guidance are better than what the Street expected, but it does imply a slower ramp to the transition to ratable per some of the expectations. Curious if you could fill in why that is and why not aggressively step on the gas a little harder here in this transition?","Carl Bass","","So \u2013 yes, I mean if you're talking about the other ratable revenue, I mean \u2013 I think on the subscriptions and the cloud services we're doing, we're doing well. You know we'll move our customers as appropriate. On more of the accounting issue about ratable revenue, just stay tuned. You'll hear more as, you know, we get into the year.","Brent Thill","","Okay. And I think we've asked this in the past, but when you look at the operating margin in the last downturn, I think you were not managing the business for the operating margin. And I think now, at least, you have better visibility in the operating margin. But when you look at the 14% to 16%, is that \u2013 do you consider that more of a floor that you don't want to go below that? Or how should we think about that as it relates to some of the other companies are giving guidance on operating margin?","","Carl Bass","","Yes, I think as we've outlined and we demonstrated in October, the way the curve works and the way the math works, it is the floor. So barring any unforeseen events, the way this works, the arithmetic of moving more business to ratable and having more of these subscriptions is the biggest impact.","The second part of it is also, we are investing right now ahead of the curve into our cloud infrastructure. We need to be there as our customers get there, and so we're seeing the expenses now, but not nearly all of the benefit. But if you go back and you just look at how we describe the transition and how we would move through operating margin, the first year was by far the most difficult.","Brent Thill \u2013 UBS","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W Baird.","Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","","Hi, thanks very much. I think what we'd all really like to hear is a little more granularity in terms of the FY \u201815 revenue guidance. You have Delcam contributing some amount. If you could help us there at all with in terms of quantifying that. And then you have the shift to flexible licensing reducing the amount of full year. If we could get some, maybe a parameter, some range around that, that would really be helpful. Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","Let me take a shot at that. Carl, you can jump in. Fill, Steve, on Delcam one of the things I want to call out to folks is the fact it won't shock any of you there's a deferred revenue write down which is significant. But that's only part of the story. The other part of the story is that there's actually \u2013 when you consolidate there's a stub period or a lag period for consolidation. Just to put it in simple language here we're going to get like a month of the first quarter in terms of the even consideration for the revenues so it's not only the write down, it's the stub period, so the way to think about Delcam, think about it roughly in this year, this fiscal year is about 2% of our total revenue. I'll give you a sense of proportion about how dramatically the write off, the write down of the preferred revenue and the stub period impacts us. That should help you right away on that one Steve, from a dimensionalization standpoint.","I think the second thing you're calling out is trying to understand the flexible licensing impact as in this transformation there's three different impacts that are happening. One is the flexible licenses at an enterprise level. One is the SaaS growth and the new offerings and one is the desktop subscriptions and that inner dynamic. What we try to do is help people by anchoring it with the billing and aggregate. So, if you look at the revenue, Steve and look at the billings you can quickly discern the deferred revenue and kind of the impact that's going to to the balance sheet and I can see a lot of you guys are doing that in the Street in your models and we tried to provide that explicitly to give you a sense. So I hope those few things help you, Delcam and how to triangulate on what's going to the balance sheet.","Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","","Perfect. And just a quick follow up, you mentioned you did largest deal ever $20 million deal. About how much of that was billed and recognized in deferred revenue in the recent period?","Mark Hawkins","It would only be a \u2013 that's a booking for the $20 million keep in mind so only a fraction of that would have been built at at onset here, so it's a multi-year deal. I would say just take a fraction of it.","Carl Bass","A tiny fraction.","Mark Hawkins","Yes, a tiny fraction from that standpoint. I think it's a five-year deal, Carl, I think, on that one, right? Don't quote me on that. I think it\u2019s\u2026 ","Steve Ashley \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Company, Inc.","","Okay.","Mark Hawkins","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could share with us a little bit, Carl, about how you're feeling about overall demand trends. we're all very excited about the model transition but how do you feel the momentum is building in the different regions and do you see the environment getting better or is it the same or is can you share with us some color there?","Carl Bass ","Yes, sure, Heather. I mean I would say generally speaking, I mean if you factor out all the other things going on in our business and normalized conditions, I think the demand environment's growing stronger and doing so on a fairly consistent basis worldwide. ","You know the only part of the world that I've seen not really recover is Southern Europe. I mean you know if you go back to pre-2009 levels, it's the only part of the world that hasn't come back to that level. Particularly you know what I'm seeing right now is demand in the US is strong. Demand in Japan is strong, and even though there's more moving part when it comes to emerging economies, the preponderance of evidence right now is on real strength that you bring to your economy, so I'm feeling really good about the demand environment. ","When you break it down a little bit more by industry you know AEC in particular we're seeing a real pickup and a real effort around tools and people buying new tools and that's why I think we saw not only in our BIM 360 business, which you know I try to highlight into my remarks but people don't recognize that , this is \u2013 BIM 360 is close to our fastest growing product ever. You know that's pretty dramatic and for people to be in the first year or so of a product's release spending millions of dollars on a product is kind of incredible, and I think that speaks to the demand as well and people wanting to enter what they see to be an improving macro environment with a new set of tools and processes. So, generally speaking, I see good stuff out there right now.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then can I just ask a follow up that you mentioned BIM 360 and I wanted to ask you what do you think \u2013 what's the key differentiator of, you know, when you're going in and selling to a customer of BIM 360, and even PLM360 if you could share with us why you might be winning those deals.","Carl Bass","Yes I think both of them reflect this idea of using cloud computing and mobile devices to get information to the right place and the right time. So if you look specifically at BIM 360 there really is a lot is going to construction customers who need to get information in the field. ","You know one of the big inefficiencies we've talked about the entire industry has talked about for years is the fact that you have entire crews working without the most up-to-date information. That lack of information that leads to bad decisions and bad coordination, and so that's what we're seeing there. It's kind of similar \u2013 you know the words change, looks slightly different in PLM 360 but it's really the same thing. ","You know instead of thinking of people out in the field, just think of an extended supply chain that might stretch across the world, and people are trying to get that same level of coordination and information fidelity regardless of where they are. And I think for many people, you know, both with BIM 360 and PLM360, the part of the market we're tapping into is the one that's ready for adoption of cloud products. So I think that's the other interesting thing that's going on here. ","In the AEC market, that generally speaking is almost the entire market because they've recognized and organized economically as a federation of companies, and so they're used to sharing information across organizational boundaries, and the cloud is being accepted widely in AEC. In manufacturing, I would equate our adoption more closely to other companies so look at sales force, net sweep, workday in terms of the kinds of companies who come on as the early adopters, and I think we're seeing that same kind of dynamic.","Heather Bellini \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Carl Bass","You're welcome.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Ken Wong \u2013 Citigroup","Hello, guys, this is Ken Wong for Walter. Quickly to clarify, Carl, I think you mentioned you guys closed out the year with 1.9 million subs. One, is that accurate? And then two, if that's the case, isn't that similar to what you guys closed out FY \u201813 with? I wanted to understand the dynamics behind what kept subscription from growing more this year.","Mark Hawkins","","Sure, Ken, this is Mark. Let me just say that we did at a rounded level, it's at 1.9 million. You got it exactly right in terms of paid subscriptions. The fact is that there's year-on-year growth. Obviously since October, is well, when you look at the round two sides of it basically, it turns out to be 1.9 million on a rounded basis, but you can expect year-on-year growth there would be the first thing, I would say.","Ken Wong \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay. And I guess kind of a follow on to that, I know you guys guided 150,000 to 200,000 kind of net adds, and if we were to look from fiscal '12 to '13, you guys did grow roughly 250,000. I would have expected with this big push behind the business model transition that that number would have been higher. I mean should we look at the guide as a conservative number, and you guys expect that to pick up? Or is this more of a, as we look to out years, it should accelerate beyond the 250,000 that we saw from '12 to '13.","Mark Hawkins","","Let me add two points, and just to throw out there. One is that we think it's a prudent guide, number one. Number two is that if you look the linear step up to get to the 50% increase that we talked about in the 12%, 20%, 50%, that would be 225,000 and we talked about it being back-end loaded. So we think this fits right in the spot where you would expect with some momentum that builds over time.","Carl Bass","","You know \u2013 and Ken, what we'll report as we go, I mean and so you and us will get a little bit better indication as we move through the year.","Mark Hawkins","Exactly.","Ken Wong \u2013 Citigroup","Got you. All right. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Mark Hawkins","","You bet.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","","Hi. Thank you, guys, for taking the question. One question from a mechanical engineer to another mechanical engineer or several, with respect to the \u2013 if you look at this quarter, license plus the other \u2013 and subscription, and if I give you credit for $30 million of this deferred license revenue, on an apples-to-apples basis, it looks like the overall business was somewhat down, about 2%, 3%. But if I go back and take away the $24 million that you had benefited due to promotion from last year, you still get a single-digit type of growth rate.","So the question for you is there something else that is not reported in the numbers, maybe a off-balance sheet backlog on other subscriptions? Because if you were to look at the P&L statement, even giving credit for the two one-time items, it looks like business was roughly flattish. And I have a follow-up question. Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","","Yes, sure. No, I think there's two dynamics, Kash, that you want to look at, and you were touching on two of them by is to make sure we look at the math and sink from that.","But, the first dynamic is that clearly we took $30 million to the balance sheet that would have been upfront license revenue. And you know just to be clear and to make a point of it, those enterprise deals, the bookings were closer to $70 million. The upfront license portion of it was closer to $30 million that we pushed to the balance sheet so that normalization alone, obviously, puts us into positive territory in terms of growth at plus 2%.","The second point and the second normalization that you touched on that we press released last year in Q4 is we pulled in $24 million from that standpoint, in terms of the dynamics for the simplified upgrade pricing last Q4. And so if you look at that and you do the second normalization, you're looking at something that starts to approach into the 6% growth rate there. So, you know, again, that's two simple normalizations that we've tried to be very discreet on.","So I think the thing I would look at it you know slightly different, Kash. Actually, am glad to see the growth reigniting. You can see it on billings too, when you make the same normalization. By the way, for the $24 million last year, that's a revenue normalization. If you do the billings normalization, it's $34 million. And so growth in year-on-year billings is also starting to reignite, which I think is a good dynamic.","Just to put a finer point on this, at the very end, as we leave this year, what's interesting, and we look forward to next year, our plan for year one of our four-year plan is slightly better than what we shared with you at IR day back in October. So to Carl's point, the macro is slightly better. We're seeing the growth start to reignite, and so I want to make sure you can see that perspective. Carl any\u2026","Kash Rangan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Got it. Yes.","","Carl Bass","","No.","Kash Rangan \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Absolutely and the final thing with respect to the billings growth rate I think 6% to 8% for this year, and you have got the longer-term CAGR of 12. It implies a pretty significant catch up in the latter years of 16%, 17%. In light of that, how are we to judge your progress against these benchmarks? Should we take your 150,000 subscriptions [INDISCERNIBLE] that you're targeting, multiply it by annual recurring revenue type equivalent. What is the right way to do those calculations to monitor this progress? Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","","What I would do is I would certainly look at the classic things like that we provide to you, but including deferred revenue and things of that nature. But certainly, we try to be very prominent on the subscription target for the year is a good way to start looking at it. And the fact that we also were offering billings.","So if you think about the 12%, 20%, 50%, we're giving you an annual target for the 12%, and we're giving you an annual target for the 50%. And the 12% is a good \u2013 although it will be choppy by quarter, is that billings guidepost that we gave you will be a good indicator to track progress throughout the year, and it will grow in momentum throughout the year and throughout the multiple years.","Carl Bass","","As we have talked about on the 20% number, we think a reasonably good proxy for that is what's going on with subscriptions. ","Mark Hawkins","","Yes. So\u2026","","Carl Bass","","And you know when detailed in October the increase in value per user from subscriptions, so you should be able to see progress on all three of the metrics we laid out for you, in addition to all of the conventional ones.","Mark Hawkins","","Exactly.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Hey, Carl, I'd like to ask you about how you're thinking about the business this year in terms of new seat volume or upfront business for at least the third quarter of last year, based on the last available filings you had, a cumulative 27% decline of new seat volume in the first three quarters of fiscal '14, as you reported it, which ought to set you up in principal for very ease new seat comps this year, as early as this quarter. So how are you thinking about that growth in that new seat metric as you've traditionally talked about it?","Secondly, also as recently as the third quarter, your subscriptions revenue, not counting traditional maintenance, was only about $10 million. If we extract traditional maintenance from the total subs number, that leaves only about $10 million. Would it be fair to say that by the end of this year, given the billings guidance you've given and the backlog you've been adding, that that number should be a multiple by the end of the year, in other words several times $10 million a quarter in new forms of subscription revenue?","Carl Bass","","Okay. You take the second part; I'll take the first part.","Mark Hawkins","","Absolutely. I would say a couple things here. One is that when you start to think about the non-subscription maintenance, part of subscription, you will see that grow significantly. Jay, I think you're all over it. And part of that for \u2013 is the fact that this is going into deferred revenue, and we have billings that are happening that are going to start coming off the deferred revenue into the P&L from a revenue standpoint over time.","That number \u2013 when Carl says we've had the all-time record quota for BIM 360, and we're getting $1-million deals and that type of thing, and we had PLM with a $700,000 deals and things are starting to grow and multiply, this thing is going to build. And you're going to see both the billings growing, and then over time you're going to see the revenue grow. So yes, you should expect that to grow.","Carl Bass","And Jay, I hate to be the bearer of bad news for you, but when it comes to new seats, I think the new seats calculations are going to be a little bit more tricky going forward because of some of the offerings. We have more offerings in enterprise licensing and more flexible licensing, which doesn't break down into individual seats anymore. And so when a company moves from stand-alone licenses that we would have counted as new seats into ones where they are enterprise, we don't break those down necessarily. We'll try to figure out a way to give you more color.","Also, many of the new offerings, PLM 360 and BIM 360, don't break out individual users either. And we'll try to do something about trying to size that for you, but comparing some of this to the previous way of doing business is not going to be as accurate as you might like it to be or we'd like it to be.","The other thing is in some of the old models, if a user bought two products, they're each counted as a new user or a new seat. With subscriptions, when they add them, and particularly, any of the termed offerings, that \u2013 they will not go counted as new. So there are a number of things that are going to make that artificially depressed, in spite of business being good. And we'll work to try to bring some color to that during the year so that you can understand that, because t is somewhat different than the way we've operated for a long time.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Very good. Thanks a lot.","Carl Bass","","You're welcome, Jay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest.","Unidentified Speaker","Hello, guys, this Owen filling in for Brendan. Wondering if you guys are seeing any new use cases from the shift to cloud. And second, I was wondering how pricing is holding up. Thank you.","Carl Bass","","Yes, so I think there are places like some of the things we've called out already. Many of the 360 products are the places where we're seeing new and somewhat unimagined uses. PLM 360 particularly, it's a lot of customers who haven't been Autodesk customers before. It's reaching to a part of the organization that was not one that we traditionally sold to, and they're trying to solve different problems.","PLM 360 for the most part is not about your classic engineering problems of how is it \u2013 what does this product do and how does it perform. It's really around the processes of managing how you get that product to market and service it and maintain it. So that's one place.","Same thing with like BIM 360, with BIM 360, what we're seeing is people who their organization and certainly their [INDISCERNIBLE] may have been Autodesk, users but they probably were not. It's people \u2013 like I said, it's construction people out in the field; it's subcontractors; it's specialty contractors back in the shop who haven't usually been customers. They may have been recipients of paper blueprints in the past, and now they're interacting online, and so you're bringing all those people that have always been part of the commercial ecosystem, but you're now bringing into the digital ecosystem.","And then when some of the products like Fusion 360, we're reaching a new class of designers. It's people who are working on different kinds of products than you might see a more traditional mechanical product like Inventor, and so we're really happy. We think the combination of cloud and mobile devices and this built-in collaboration is really set up to reach new customers. We think it will help many of the traditional ones, but we've been pleased with how many new people we're reaching.","Unidentified Speaker","Thank you. That's helpful. And then second thing I had was on was pricing; how is that holding up?","Carl Bass","","Pricing, stable.","Mark Hawkins","","Yes.","Carl Bass","","It's stable and the relative pricing between point products and suites is maintaining the same differential.","Unidentified Speaker","Great. Thank you guys.","Mark Hawkins","","You bet.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","Excellent, thank you guys and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us some of the initial feedback that you've gotten from your customers and from the channel to the elimination of upgrade pricing at the end of this fiscal year. What responses have you gotten back, because [INDISCERNIBLE] how we started socializing that a little more with the customer base.","Carl Bass","","Yes, so as you would imagine, our channel is enthusiastic about it. They think it's a big spur to their business in the coming year. And I think it not only drives business, but it reignites conversations that channel partners already should have been having with customers.","In some ways, it's been very quiet on the customer front. One part of it is many of these customers are not the ones that are closest to us. They're not on subscription already; they're working on versions back; and so the relationship is a little bit more distant.","So I haven't really heard any negative feedback from the customers. I'm sure as we get closer to a year from now, we will hear some moaning and groaning. But for the most part, very well received by the channel partners, enthusiastically received, and most customers understand the change.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it, and if I could sneak in a follow-up as well. When we've seen channel heavy businesses with more of this attrition model, and this isn't Autodesk comment, it's across the board. Channel partners who are used to selling a box or selling a box of software, typically tend to be a little more reluctant to move to more of a subscription model, selling a subscription. How well has your channel or how receptive has your channel been to the subscription products? How difficult has it been to get them on board with some of these new offerings?","Carl Bass","","So let's take a little trip back through the history machine. The first one was our maintenance subscriptions; like I talked about in those remarks 10 years ago when we first started this, our channel was incredibly reluctant to go into that.","I think it's some of the reasons you pointed out. There was a fear \u2013 at that point, we didn't have a direct relationship. We didn't have contact info. There was a worry about us circumventing them and going direct to customers. Now you look and it's nearly half of our revenue; it is the foundation for most of our partners' business, and so they've come to appreciate it.","Having said that, though, every time we introduce something new, there's an amount of reluctance out there. Where I see it most strongly is not on things like the cloud-based services, the place \u2013 and this is very legitimately an issue for our existing resellers, is they see it on things like the desktop subscriptions. Because if a user chooses to go from the old model to the new model, it affects their cash flow in the short run. And as we've always said, many of our channel partners are much more sensitive to short-term cash flow than any other financial metric. So that's an understandable one we're working through.","When I read a bunch of reports and people said our channel partners weren't doing much with the desktop subscriptions, that doesn't surprise me. That's not the place where the first take up is going to come, and that's not where we've seen it. But as long as the transition goes smoothly and gradually, our partners can work into this new model and still have very healthy, profitable businesses with good cash flow.","Mark Hawkins","","Absolutely.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent, guys. Thank you for the color there.","Carl Bass","Sure, Keith.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thank you, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but have a question on operating margins. Obviously you gave the guidance for this next quarter and the full year. Wondering if you could give us a sense of the progression of margin over the course of the year. And then as far as investments in this year, sales and marketing versus R&D, how do you see those being allocated and what are the key initiatives you're focused on?","Mark Hawkins","","Well, a couple of quick things, Phil, one is that we don't classically break that out and guide that throughout the year in terms of the spend breakup when we get targets and such, number one. I call out though that when you look at Q1, one of the things that we touched on is as we bring Delcam, on board there's even deal costs that are involved. There is the stealth period; there's the deferred revenue write down, separate from normal seasonal expenses and separate from what Carl talked about, which is investing to really solidify our leadership in the cloud and doing the back-office work we need to do to support a scalable business model transformation.","So I think the one thing that you can see is in Q1, there is more pressure than normal because of the transaction itself with Delcam. But beyond that, we're investing to absolutely secure a win, both in the platform and the business model transformation.","Carl Bass","","Yes I would add to that, investments go to market particularly around new products, so bucketed as sales and marketing, but particularly think of being able to reach this new class of customers. We've been investing there. There's a significant investment in cloud infrastructure to build out and get a rationalized platform that we can use globally.","And then the last part, I would stress the Delcam part. Delcam was naturally diluted. When you add the sub period plus the deferred revenue write down, it becomes even more so. It's the arithmetic working against us there.","Mark Hawkins","","And even the deal costs.","Carl Bass","","And the deal coasts.","","Mark Hawkins","","Hopefully that helps a little bit Phil.","Phil Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse","I wonder from the acquisition, I wonder if you could give us any color on the incremental costs that you're expecting to bring on from that.","Mark Hawkins","","Let me say for the Company, Delcam will be dilutive about $0.10, $0.10 to $0.11 for the year. That gives you a sense of the magnitude. It will be accretive in '16. That being said, we're obviously very excited about the strategic aspects of this, the enhanced footprint in manufacturing, which is obviously very strategic. And Carl, if you want to add anything on that, but that \u2013 we're very excited about Delcam.","Carl Bass","","Yes, no, I think one of the things that \u2013 maybe it's worth taking a short amount of time to discuss. All of the sudden in manufacturing, the manufacturing part of manufacturing is getting interesting again. For a long time many companies focused on product design and innovation on product design, and manufacturing was this Six Sigma exercise that was just about optimization and driving costs out.","Our customers are realizing that there's an importance \u2013 and new technology and processes that are coming along, goes by different names around the world. In the US, there's a lot of what you might hear and you might have heard the president talk about the other day, advanced manufacturing. It has to do with new ways of manufacturing and getting competitive advantage instead of driving costs out.","Delcam is ideally positioned to help with that, and so, we've become interested over the last few years in making sure it's not only the ideation and the design and engineering we help with, but we help through PLM 360 with the management of the process, and with CAM software to actually drive the machine tools on the factory floor.","So all of that's important, and I think there's a renewed interest globally in how companies can use their manufacturing techniques and processes to actually have an advantage.","Phil Winslow \u2013 Credit Suisse","That was great. Thank you guys.","Carl Bass","","You bet.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities ","","Hi, gentlemen. Thank you for taking my question. I'd love to see if we can get a little bit more help on the revenue model for fiscal '15, and in particular a few things that could be very helpful here. One would be any feel for where a subscription will trend, either as a mix of revenue or otherwise by the end of the year, and\/or subscriber ASPs.","And then two other things related to the model transition. One would be any help on thinking about the contribution from license upgrades this year. Typically the license upgrades when you guys used to report it ran, on the average, $120 million in license upgrades per year. Are we looking at more like $200 million this year or $150 million or the usual $120 million? And then lastly, any color you can give us on the contribution from rental subscriptions or cloud in fiscal '15?","Mark Hawkins","","So, a couple things here. Let me jump into this, and maybe Carl can add some more. First of all, I'd say the contributions from the upgrades, we're not providing specificity on that. As Carl said, I think the channel is very enthusiastic about that, as we are.","I think you're going to get four bites of the apple. It will be most pronounced at the end of the year. It will build, but each quarter it's going to be an opportunity, and then it's going to build. And clearly, people in the market get the significance of this.","So in terms of dollarization, Steve, I can't provide that specificity to you, but in terms of it's going to help us in each of the quarters with special help at the end of the year. And that's going to certainly \u2013 what's interesting for us is not only the contribution to billing growth, but where the people go is basically into a choice of subscription. So we think that it's a double win in terms of moving our model forward.","In terms of the makeup of the model, the second thing you talked about, I'm actually excited to stand here before you and say that this last year we booked, 45% of our revenue is recurring. It's up from 41% the year prior, and after, as Carl said, a 10-year journey and we're now at the beginning of a four-year journey to take it to a completely different level. And as you know, we want to exit at 70% recurring. You should expect that number to go up, and we're not providing specific guidance on that. But it's early days. It's at the beginning of the beginning.","What we did is we stepped out and said, let's give subscriptions, because that's an important number for everybody to track progress. And then billings, if you think of the 12%, 20%, 50%, mantra, billings is the 12%, and we've guided that for the first time in the history of the Company. And the 50% is the subscriptions, and we have guided that for the first time in the history of the Company. And so those two should be good guideposts to give you a sense of where we're going and what we're doing.","What we want to do Steve is we're not hesitant to provide more metrics as \u2013 when we make sure that they're meaningful, that it's not chatter, and that there's some level of predictiveness in it. So we're studying a number of different things, but we think these will certainly anchor.","And by the way, we've tracked very carefully what other businesses have done. Obviously, ours is a little different than other, very well and very well respected companies, in terms of where they're at. But anyhow, that's what we're doing from a mix standpoint. Obviously subscriptions are going to grow, as we've called out.","And then in terms \u2013 the cloud, early days; desktop subscriptions, early days. As soon as they're \u2013 we think that it's going to be useful and meaningful, we're going to break them out, and you would expect that of us. So Carl, any other commentary on that?","Carl Bass","","No, I think you got it right.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities ","Cool. Can I add one follow-up, which is\u2026","Mark Hawkins","","Please.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities ","On the macro.","Mark Hawkins","","Please do. Yes.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities ","Okay. Great. Thank you. Yes, I'm wondering on the macro, can you guys give any color on the complexion in Europe, middle Europe versus say, France or UK? And also I'm curious on Asia, Japan clearly is helping there. China's been a laggard on the PMIs, and how is that impacting Asia? So any forward-looking thoughts here especially would be helpful.","Carl Bass","","Yes, so what I would say is Europe, in general, has been strong, and we see momentum building in Europe. Central Europe is strong; Northern Europe is strong; the U: doing well.","I still see weakness particularly in Spain, France, Italy, Greece. Like I said, they haven't returned to levels before. I don't see the momentum there, but I think business is \u2013 that really is a new level for business there. I don't see \u2013 I don't see that changing.","When you get to Asia-Pacific, we've seen strength. Japan has been particularly strong; Korea continues to do well. The data out of China that we see doesn't always reflect what we see from our business. I think there are a number of reasons why; you could speculate on why we don't see a perfect correlation.","What we're seeing is a strong China, not overly \u2013 I don't think it's overheated. I don't think it's at that torrid pace as before, but it doesn't seem to be weakening either. A place like Russia, Russia seems to be doing well.","Yes, the other place where we saw a fair amount of business during the last two quarters, but particularly in Q4, was in the Middle East. When we certainly saw some real strength there, particularly in terms of some of the AEC projects that are being built and some really large infrastructure projects that are being started.","So there seems to be a level of investment, and while many of these projects have been on the books for a while, they seem to be moving forward now. And that generally comes from their government's sense of renewed confidence.","Mark Hawkins","","Yes, I totally agree, Carl. I'd even add India, strangely enough, India is just starting. It's small, but even that is starting to stabilize and starting to grow again, small-time.","Carl Bass","","Yes.","Steve Koenig \u2013 Wedbush Securities ","Great. Optimistic news. Thank you, guys.","Carl Bass","","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Thanks a lot. You may have already answered this, Carl, but I wanted just to go back on the subscriber number. Is that a blend of maintenance payers, 360 customers, rental customers, is it a blend of all of those? That's the first question.","And then second, when you think about the 360 offerings, could you force rank which are doing the best and which are maybe not doing so well. I'd be curious to get a sense for the mix.","","Carl Bass","Yes, so the answer to your first question is yes. That is a blend, and during the year, we'll start figuring out which things to break out for you as it makes sense. But the number we gave you was as a whole. The reason why we'll want to break it out, one is to provide more clarity for you, but also as we start talking about whether it's ASPs or ARPU or whatever kind of average, as you get these different kinds of subscriptions, there's going to be very different math associated with each of them. And it will be important ti be able to give you more than one average number for it.","Your second question was about.","Mark Hawkins","","360 ranking.","Carl Bass","","360s, which is my favorite child. This is Sophie's choice. I think if you look at the numbers, BIM 360, has to be the one that's leading the pack; it had by far the strongest quarter. Going in to the fourth quarter it wasn't as obvious, we just had a break-away quarter. We know that we will even come down in Q1 because of the seasonality of the business, but BIM 360 is actually doing well.","I've been very pleased with our progress on all the 360 products. One of the things that you didn\u2019t want that way is when you introduce new products is, and particularly doing it through new channels with new business models, you have to find the right mix in terms of what's the right way to go to market, what's the right pricing, what's the right packaging? And I think we've been relatively successful in a short time in figuring that out.","And it hasn't been without stumbles. As a matter of fact, the one that I just highlighted, BIM 360 as our best, in Q2 I would have ranked it down near the bottom. We were having a number of troubles post-acquisition integrating it and moving the business model forward. We had tripped upon ourselves, and it was through hard work of a lot of people, we got it right back on track and it rebounded from early in the year to being really spectacular at the end of the year.","So I don't think any of these new businesses are without their challenges, but I'm really pleased with how we're doing on the 360 businesses.","Ross MacMillan \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","That's really helpful, and then maybe just one quick one from Mark. On the net subscriptions billings calculation, should we just basically look at the proxy being revenue plus change in deferred plus change in product backlog? Is that effectively going to get us to the same number as you're looking at?","Mark Hawkins","","I think you're on the right track, yes. Yes, that's the right track.","Carl Bass","","The rest is left to a reader.","Mark Hawkins","","You got it there.","Ross MacMillan \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Appreciate it. Thank you so much. Congratulations.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Williams with Evercore.","Matt Williams \u2013 Evercore Partners","","Hi guys, thank you for taking the question. Most of mine have been answered at this point, but I was wondering on the rentals, I think you called out that some of the adoption there had been in the M&E business, which would seem to make some sense. But any more color you could provide on what areas or what segments are starting to really go down the path there, and which ones are looking at that option?","Mark Hawkins","","Sure. Let me start, and maybe Carl can add if he likes. You called out there's areas where people are more project based and very small business, small, medium business project-based people that are trying to enter but may not have the upfront cash flow. M&E is an ideal target, as we've talked about, and it absolutely is getting some nice traction actually and we're getting a lot of good feedback there. That would be one data point.","That's not \u2013 we're getting it in other projects as well; that's one I would call out explicitly. The second thing is that one of the fact patterns is that they're going for the annual, and that's the primary vehicle of choice. And so that also is happening, and I would just say maybe the last bit of color is that when we talk about how we're doing up to the call in this quarter, because we don't give beyond that period, that ramp continues to look really nice. And so those are a couple bits of data, Matt, that I'd like to share.","Carl Bass","","The only thing I'd add is if you want to look at the general trends, I would say among size of business you'll go from small to big; it's getting much more common amongst small business or very small business, much less common with big companies. They have other flexible licensing mechanisms to accomplish the peak demand (inaudible) that this accomplishes. And I think if you look by industry, I think M&E is first; I think AEC is second; and I think manufacturing third. And that reflects the project-based nature of the work within each of those respective industries.","Matt Williams \u2013 Evercore Partners","Great. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thank you guys.","Mark Hawkins","","Thank you Matt.","Operator","","And our last question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","","Thank you, a couple of follow ups. First, Carl in honor of the 20th anniversary of LT this year, do you think you'll be offering rentals of LT for the first time? Those weren't talked about in the initial rentals batch back in September. Secondly, if in the long run you go to mostly an agency model in lieu of the current VAR model, what would be the margin implications for you and for your channel, in light of your earlier comments about their concerns over cash flow and margin?","Carl Bass","","First thing is Jay, around LT, yes, I think you can expect to see us doing desktop subscriptions for LT. We already ran a pilot project in France with really good results from it, some of the same things that Mark highlighted about the rest of the program. We actually saw it earlier on with LT, and we want to continue to expand that, and that's going well.","Your other question is a little hypothetical at this point. We'll move through this. There may be some changes to both margin structure, and there may be some changes to the contractual relationship, particularly the place I would look for it more is on the cloud-based services. I think it's less likely to see dramatic changes on the existing products, but certainly we have been looking and studying and working closely with our partners around the cloud-based services in the best way for them to bring into market. (Inaudible) what we for now, have primarily been doing by ourselves through a direct sales force.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Carl Bass","","You're welcome Jay.","Mark Hawkins","","Yes.","Carl Bass","","Operator?","Operator","","There seem to be no further questions.","David Gennarelli","","Great.

Please go ahead sir.","David Gennarelli - Director, Investor Relations","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thanks for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2015, long-term financial model guidance, including billings, subscriptions, and recurring revenue growth. The factors we use to estimate our guidance, new business model introduction, new product and suite releases, market adoption and expected growth rates, cost management efforts, hiring plans, business execution, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our desktop subscription offering plans, our transition to cloud and mobile computing, our educational vertical strategy, trends and sales initiatives for our products, and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2014 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release and prepared remarks.

These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today\u2019s press release, prepared remarks, and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass - Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Dave and good afternoon everyone. Building on the momentum we generated last quarter, we are off to a positive start to FY \u201815 strengthening our core business led to better than expected billings revenue, operating margin and EPS. We also made excellent progress on our business model transition by adding over 89,000 subscriptions in the quarter. These results coupled with the significant increase in backlog and record deferred revenue left us pleased with the overall results.","In Q1, we introduced our new 2015 line of design and creation suites, as well as updated products across our portfolio. Our 2015 portfolio offers best-in-class desktop products and powerful cloud services that are being adopted by a growing number of our customers around the world. Customer reaction to the 2015 suites has been positive and revenue from suites posted strong growth once again.","I really can\u2019t emphasize enough the success we have had with our suites initiative and the value that suites have contributed to Autodesk over the past three years. Our customers value the diverse functionality they provide. And it\u2019s worth repeating that suites remain one of the pillars of our growth strategy and support our long-term goal of generating 20% more value from our subscription customers. Our AEC results continue to be driven by the ongoing recovery in the commercial construction market coupled with the customer excited for our desktop and cloud based BIM tools. Continued adoption of BIM in the building and infrastructure industries drove growth in our AEC suites and our cloud based BIM 360 offering.","Cloud and mobile are really resonating with our customers, which is an important step realizing the potential of BIM in construction as we increase our ability to provide the industry with in the field access to real time design information. We closed several large AEC transactions in the quarter including a significant win with a transportation agency for one of the largest cities in Europe. This agency has been a competitor stronghold for many years. They will now be implementing an array of our products including the infrastructure design suite BIM 360 and PLM 360 for use in some of their highest profile road, rail and infrastructure projects. Importantly our AEC solutions will help the agency to become compliant with expanding government BIM mandates.","Our manufacturing business continues to perform well on a global basis. We experienced solid demand in both mature and emerging markets as we continue to expand our business with industrial machinery, consumer products and automotive customers. We continue to make investments in our portfolio and recently expanded our solution to include new functionality like composite analysis technology for our simulation offering. As a result of these investments we are seeing greater penetration in industries like aerospace and automotive.","We continue to make progress with our 100% cloud based PLM 360 and we are seeing some great trends there. What should really tell you about the strength of the product is that shortly after their initial purchase, many customers come back to us wanting additional (suites) that\u2019s the beauty around ease of deployment with PLM 360 and illustrates how users value the product and its potential and multiple PLM initiatives. We are also seeing more and more companies that are religious about the cloud. We closed a number of them in Q1 and we think those types of customers will only grow as we go forward. As a large enterprise company Autodesk has wholeheartedly embraced the cloud.","We closed the Delcam transaction early in Q1. Delcam\u2019s business in Q1 was healthy, but after applying the typical acquisition accounting treatments, the revenue we have recognized was immaterial to the quarter. We are very excited about the early stages of our collaboration which will help to extend Autodesk much deeper into the manufacturing process with the industry leading technology for CAM. It\u2019s great to have the Delcam team onboard as we further broaden our already strong manufacturing solutions.","From the geographic perspective we experienced continued strength in A-Pac led by strong demand in Japan and South Korea. The results in EMEA continued to be mix by country. In the Americas we are pleased with the trends we are seeing. When considering the growth in our backlog, our year-on-year growth in all major geographies was much better than was reported. We are still at the very beginning of our business model transition and we are seeing growth across the board in adoption of our cloud and mobile solutions. We are receiving positive feedback from customers which is a clear indication that the cloud is changing the way the world is designed and made. Customers are changing their mindset to adopt to more collaborative connected environment so teams can now be more integrated and efficient.","We are really pleased with the increase in subscriptions in the quarter. As anticipated the vast majority were maintenance subscriptions, but we are encouraged by what we are seeing in both desktops subscription and cloud subscription. After wining a pilot project in France for the past two quarters, we launched the global availability of AutoCAD LT as a desktop subscription last month and it looks to be off to a great start. This was nice to see when we consider we also posted growth in perpetual AutoCAD LT licenses. Both desktop subscription and cloud subscription namely Autodesk PLM 360 continued to expand our leads and bring new customers to Autodesk.","Another element of our business model transition is offering our enterprise customers more flexible licensing options. In addition to being of great benefit for our customers these contracts create a larger recurring revenue stream, which is recognized ratably. In the first quarter we transitioned $30 million from license revenue to deferred revenue. As expected, the amount transitioned in Q1 was small and similarly expect to see a small amount transitioned in Q2.","I will reiterate that our business model transition will not be perfectly linear and that the amount of business that we transition and the number of new subscriptions we had will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. We were expecting the transition to progress gradually in FY \u201815 and then ramp more significantly by the time we get to FY \u201817 and FY \u201818. Given our strong Q1 performance and our optimistic view of the macroeconomic environment, we have raised our FY \u201815 guidance ranges for billings and revenue.","So to wrap things up, we were pleased with our overall results in Q1 and we continue to feel great about our opportunities in the direction of the company. It\u2019s still very early in our business model transition, but we are encouraged by what we experienced in the first quarter. We look forward to building on these early successes and transitioned Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription-based model over the next four years.","So, let me take a minute to talk about what we announced yesterday at MakerCon. For the past few years, I have been frequently asked about Autodesk rolling opportunity in 3D printing. And I have been fascinated by the promise and frustrated by the reality of 3D printing. So, we are developing an open software platform for 3D printing called Spark, which will make it more reliable, yet simple to print 3D models and easy to control how that model was actually printed. Spark will be opened and freely licensable to hardware manufacturers and others who are interested. Same for our 3D printer, the complete design of the printer will be made publicly available to allow for further development in experimentation.","I will also introduce our own 3D printer as a showcase and reference implementation for Spark. We will have more to say on this later in the year, but wanted to let you in on this exciting development. To be clear, this does not impact our four-year financial targets of 12% billings CAGR, 20% more annual value from our new and existing subscriptions and a 50% increase in subscriptions while getting to a 30% non-GAAP operating margin by the end of FY \u201818.","Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","I am sorry there, sorry there, we just couldn\u2019t hear you. I just wanted to ask quickly on the subscriber count, obviously much better than we are expecting, can you talk about what \u2013 were there any promotions during the quarter that might have driven that and the guidance for the full year wasn\u2019t moved? Can you talk about with the strong performance, why didn\u2019t the full year range move at all?","Carl Bass","Yes. So, first let me just give you an answer on the promotion. I think the thing that\u2019s probably the most important figuring out what went on was the fact that we announced the elimination of upgrades next year. So, that\u2019s probably the driving force more specifically than any promotion. There were actual promotions tied to it and different opportunities for our customers to pickup on subscriptions, but that really the motivating factor there. On the guidance for the year, our feeling was it was a really good quarter exceeding our expectations. We would like to give another quarter to understand it. And if we were to have another quarter like this one, we would already be there. So, we understand how it changes our guidance for the year, but we figured we\u2019d wait one more quarter since we are pretty new to some of these metrics and the conditions under we are operating in. Once we get a better handle on them, we will most likely be after Q2.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. And just to build on Carl\u2019s comment exactly. And just obviously we are pleased out of the gate for sure. I just add in addition to the kind of the normal promos that we run to drive things which were pretty much normal activity I was also pleased just to see the desktop subscriptions are growing, albeit it\u2019s a smaller number, the growth rate was attracted in the same with the cloud. And with our enterprise customers as well, we are seeing contribution across the board, but of course to Carl\u2019s point maintenance would be the biggest at this stage as expected.","Raimo Lenschow - Barclays","Great, guys. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS","Good afternoon, Carl, the majority of the upside in your guidance at least in our model was in AEC, can you give us the sense of where you outperformed?","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean the first thing I would say is what we are seeing is a worldwide recovery in commercial construction, so it\u2019s a combination of several factors, the same factors around which you will remember the upgrades affects AEC. We should \u2013 we have seen a rebound across the globe in terms of AEC. It\u2019s also I think we are into that next stage where in the beginning we are really talking about our early adopters of BIM. We are no longer talking about early adopters. BIM is our mainstream and now it\u2019s moving out to the field. And so we are getting to the next part where we are seeing much larger deployments within firms as well as receiving the new opportunity in the construction part as people take this information to the field. On a geographic basis, Brent I mean it was really good all over.","Brent Thill - UBS","And just a follow-up on the geo Asia-Pacific up 15% constant currency, what are you seeing there and I think you called out Japan which has been weak for lot of other tech companies that we all interact with, are you starting to see a broad return there?","Carl Bass","Yes. Brent, so let me just back off the AEC, so we are not doubly segmented here. Just in general if you just look by countries, Asia has been good for us, it continues to be strong. Japan for us has been strong for a while now. And we keep scratching our head because we pay attention to what the other companies are reporting, but Asia has been good. When we look globally the only place is that I still scratch my head about a little bit or some of the emerging countries. We were just joking about Southern Europe is finally growing, but it\u2019s maybe because it shrunk for so long that we knew there was a bottom somewhere. But we already have been seeing lights come back to a number of countries in Southern Europe. So the only ones that are a little bit about only generate high to some of the BRIC countries in particularly with some of the geopolitical stuff going on in place like Russia.","Brent Thill - UBS","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. Carl, just a couple questions for you. I was wondering if you can help us out with of the strong subscriptions that you signed this quarter, can you give us a sense for how many of those, what percentage were sort of 360 club type offerings versus your traditional customers who were attaching maintenance. And also \u2013 if you could also then talk a little bit about your cloud offerings and share with us which one of those are you seeing the fastest uptick in? Thanks.","Carl Bass","Yes. So we haven\u2019t broken out the subscriptions, but I would tell you this quarter is the majority or a large majority Heather, were actually maintenance subscriptions. That\u2019s where we focused a lot of our attention. When it gets to the cloud, I mean there are a couple of things that are doing really well. BIM 360, we talked about a lot last quarter and it was down quarter-over-quarter, but still has a great year-over-year growth rate. So BIM 360 is doing really well. I am really pleased with PLM 360 I talked about it a little bit in the prepared remarks. One of the things we are liking about PLM 360 and this is always a great sign of product that is well liked is that the customer start with the small thing and then they come back maybe one more and then they come back again. And so we are starting to see large deployments of PLM 360. Those are the big ones for right now which affects revenue, there is a lots of other positive signs and we certainly seen trends change in terms of our customers preferences. And while there is still some reluctance to the cloud in our customer base, there are many use cases. Companies are building certainly more tolerant and where some of the forward looking companies are getting aggressive about demand in cloud solutions, so that\u2019s a little bit of change in the selling environment we are seeing.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you.","Carl Bass","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Hi, thank you very much. Wondering if you have any metrics around larger deals and how they are flowing, you kind of referred to it a couple of times here, I don\u2019t know if you have anything you can put your hands on maybe just qualitatively talk about what might be happening with that?","Mark Hawkins","Sure. Steve happy to do so. Every quarter we don\u2019t disclose a number of deals that are \u2013 what we call large deals greater than $1 million deal. This quarter I will just say that it was up year-on-year modestly, but we are pleased to see that. There has been a number of large deals were up.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Right. Kind of forgotten child here is the M&E business I know it\u2019s just 6% of total, when we might we hope that that business might flatten out?","Carl Bass","So I mean there are two parts, I mean a thing to remember that the M&E business are really two parts to it is that creative finishing part and then there is the animation software business. We have repeatedly said the animation software business is a good business, good margins, continues to grow, we are happy with that part of the business. For a long time we have talked about how the creative finishing business was going to shrink. Remember a lot of in that numbers is also hardware that we have been pointing out over time and it continues to go down. So it continues to be the creative finishing business most of the overall M&E. But the animation business we like and really has great synergy with the rest of our business. The creative finishing business is really a changing model \u2013 it\u2019s changing and relatively small market.","Steve Ashley - Robert W. Baird","Thanks, very much.","Carl Bass","Sure Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Hi, thank you very much guys for taking my question. I just wanted to get a little bit more color, you had talked about 89,000 new subs and you also Carl talked about how the majority of that was maintenance subs. So when I look at the expense growth in the quarter on a year-over-year basis I am trying to understand where did that expense growth \u2013 understanding that you are going through this model transition, and you are investing to get sub growth at the same time I was just curious to find out if there is anything off the balance sheet that explains the investments to ramp up your subs since I have add back the growth to the backlog and the amount of deferred license revenues I can get a pro forma margin of about 22% or so which is still a little bit below last year. So I am trying to understand what are we not seeing in the income statement that helps us understand the pace of these investments, if the majority of the subs that you added 89,000 was indeed maintenance subs? Thank you very much.","Mark Hawkins","Sure. So let me take this \u2013 Carl maybe you could follow-up. There is a lot in that question, so we will catch and then try to post that make sure recover all the ground. But help me I miss something. The first think just building on Carl\u2019s comment absolutely of 89,000 as planned and again we talked about this gradual ramp was with the desktops and the gradual ramp with the cloud. This is playing out exactly as planned in fact I would say even a bit \u2013 we are pleased with the way that we are coming out of the gate in total with the 89K, but I just want to be the clear the majority are maintenance but it was of cloud and desktop we planned. The second thing I want to get to is, your question around the year-on-year spend, one of the things that we try to be really clear on is there are fundamentally four things that we are investing in. Let\u2019s get start with the top, we are investing in the cloud to make sure that we have undisputed leadership in the cloud, full start for this whole next generation of offerings that\u2019s been (acted out). The second thing we have been investing is to ensure that is just not a transformation of successful including retooling in the back half that\u2019s being disruption and so on and so forth. Those are not insignificant investments that we are making. We are pleased that we are making those. We are absolutely as consistent with our strategic plan that we have even talked about at the IR Day.","The other costs that we should know that of course pointed out maybe cost including cash some are cost of question if you recall last year being below plan, our incentive for employees was obviously less than 100% target. This year we need to plan for it to be up at 100%. So there is that natural release of cost suppression (indiscernible) such. And then the last thing that is not insignificant is the fact that we have done some significant M&A of which is diluted this year but of course accretive next year and you saw a portion of that in Q1 a month of that in Delcam you will see a full quarter, for example in Q2, because of the consolidation in later part. So (more down) the employee related costs with the unfolding of cost suppression year-on-year, M&A Delcam being the headline, cloud investment being to investment and there you go, very consistent with our plan. The most important thing that I would call out Kash is absolutely reaffirming our commitment for the plan for the year that we talked about at the beginning of the year and absolutely reaffirming our full year plan. So\u2026","Kash Rangan - Merrill Lynch","Great to hear that and also by token I should reduce that 150,000 to 200,000 sub additions are going to be more back end weighted because if I just look at the license revenue and ballpark the number of maintenance subscriptions, you would be pulling in just with your licenses, that alone should be equal to that 150,000 to 200,00 net new subs, right. So I am just wondering if four-year plan really cost for a lot of the rental if you will net new seats are going to be really waited towards the second half of the time period because the apps don\u2019t seem to jive up with the license then to explain the more back in loaded scenario, just perfectly time, but just want to clarify that?","Carl Bass","Kash, I think it would certainly be clear to say that we\u2019re growing desktop subscriptions and our cloud offerings at a gradual ramp as we talked about higher that at IR day back in the October timeframe. We talked about in Q1 it\u2019s just a consistent building I mean we really pleased at the way things are coming out of gate. Where you would expect we have a program for 10 years that\u2019s been maintenance subscription with that numbers going be bigger than the first quarter or so up going the other one.","But the growth rates were pleased with. It\u2019s unfolding nicely and Kash only last thing I would throw out at you is. In addition to looking at deferred revenue which I think you addressed appropriately and as a record for the company up 14% year-on-year I did find for the transition don\u2019t forget our backlog is up $30 million year-on-year and that backlog is not billed or shipped. And so that\u2019s an indicated also demand you should think of us.","Mark Hawkins","Yes. I just one small piece of total idea on the maintenance subscriptions, given the programs in driving people in the subscription. In addition to our increase emphasis on it, I would expect to see that to continue to grow through the year. So, certainly the fourth quarter you can imagine being large because it\u2019s going to be right up against the deadline. Can\u2019t understand quite the shape, but the first quarter was strong, go easy in the second quarter in momentum continues in the fourth one will be strong. There is still little bit about but I would not expect that to slowdown at the end of the year at all, exactly the country?","Kash Rangan \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Wonderful, thank so much. And see it our conference in couple weeks in San Francisco.","Carl Bass","Good, thanks","Operator","The next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest","Hi, thank so much, Carl. I was really interested and maybe a talk a little bit about the pilot you were in France. You\u2019ve rolled that out globally now with autoCAD LT and what you saw in terms of the new users you hadn\u2019t previously been on autoCAD. It gives any color about what kind of growth you saw their percentage or anything more in terms of genuine new users cases you\u2019re saying on that individual in the cloud based version of AutoCAD LT?","Carl Bass","Yeah. What we saw in France, what we saw in the first quarter, the other almost identical amount of perpetual sales as the prior period plus we had a substantial number of desktop subscriptions, just the behave we want to so probably is moderates the growth of little in perpetual but in total it\u2019s a much bigger number and that same dynamic is play as we rolled out in other places. We are \u2013 we\u2019ve done a little bit survey work what is seems to be is there are people who are price sensitive to upfront costs. There are people who have peak demand loading issues the work force change in size and having a more flexible way to get access to the is good and truthfully I suspect some people who didn\u2019t pay for the software. We would like to couldn\u2019t afford to some other reason who are now actually good, were actually given an affordable option are choosing to pay for it.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest","So, if you looked that group that\u2019s either new because of the price point or piracy or whatever, 1% do you think they represent of that total of number of folks who bought it as a perpetual and now bought it in the cloud. Is there way to look at that metric at all?","Carl Bass","The amount of (indiscernible), is only do\u2026","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest","I\u2019m trying to get with actually net new what percent of although you think I can net new is oppose the transition.","Carl Bass","I think is I don\u2019t have great numbers or I would say probably 20%, 30%.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest","Terrific and then have you as you take this out globally anything that yield we doing different that would \u2013 making think you wouldn\u2019t get that same sort of adoption or are markets so different it\u2019s just hard tied out this point?","Carl Bass","No, I mean our senses will be same having said that, having done this job, long enough where you always surprise by behavior in a given countries and is always individual dynamics about the markets. But generally speaking we\u2019ve now proven in to ourselves enough places that we expect for the most part the rollout to be identical.","Brendan Barnicle \u2013 Pacific Crest","Perfect, thank so much that for additional color.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Excellent. Very nice quarter guys and thank you for taking my question. When you at Analyst Day, you talked about this base of non-maintenance paying, but active customers, can you give us a sense of the 89,000 subs are sort of the good progress you had in subs. How much of that was sort of new seats, new customer driven how much of that was going after that base of non-maintenance paying subs as this guys sort of carrying on sort of upgrading and getting on board with the maintenance program?","Mark Hawkins","We don\u2019t have the exact number. It\u2019s a little bit hard for us to get it perfectly, but I suspect the fair number is out of the base of non-maintenance paying customers.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Got it. And then on a different tact when it comes to the 3D printer and sort of the reference architecture, so you have reference architecture for other people to make clone 3D printers, there is a sort of open source Spark software, can you walk us through what\u2019s going to be the longer term? So, how does Autodesk conventionally get paid on this? Where do you see is the path to modernization for you guys or sort of the advantage of you guys going forward and proselytizing this if you will?","Carl Bass","Yes. I think there are really two things. One is if you are going to stand today and one will play out over the year, you need the year. And so first one is our customers make more 3D models than anybody. More 3D printer models come from our software. So, to the extent that we increased the demand for 3D modeling software, we think we will get our fair share of people who now want 3D modeling software. And we have seen that play out. And what we are really trying to do is make that whole work flow smoother. I will date myself here a little bit, but remember, there is a period of time in which Apple felt the need to have a laser writer of its own.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Yes.","Carl Bass","It\u2019s good you dated yourself. Yes, I am glad I sucked you in on that one. Yes, and so it was like as I said, the that second part is a little bit more complex, but we have been doing a lot of modeling software that relies on in order to produce the parts relies on intimate knowledge of the 3D printers. And we wanted to really close tight connection and demonstrate how good the experience could be when you get the hardware, software and material sciences right. And so we will be introducing more software this year and potentially more hardware to take advantage of that. So, stay tuned to that part, but I think the simple straightforward one is everything that\u2019s 3D printed was generally 3D modeled and we are the largest supplier of 3D modeling software.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Got it. So, the Spark software, that\u2019s just about the interface between the design software and the printer itself, it\u2019s not the design software?","Carl Bass","Yes. We are really going to keep a good analogy on this that I have been using try to explain think of the Spark software as a little bit like Android, kind of the \u2013 if Android is an OS for mobile phones, this is an OS for 3D printing and think of the printer and by the way just to make sure that we are speaking to say minus. We are not only giving you reference architecture, we are actually producing the printer. So, we will reference implementation that we will manufacture. And think of that machine as a Nexus One. Google continues to produce cell phones even though the success of it really depends on companies like Samsung and HTC producing way more than they do.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley","Excellent, very helpful. Thank you guys.","Carl Bass","Okay, thanks, Keith.","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Carl, Mark, I would like to ask first about your licensing model for token or usage based consumption of the kind for example that you did with the large contract in Q4. The question is can that time of token-based model be implemented or offered beyond just the large or largest project-oriented customers as an AEC in particular with the sort of thing that could potentially be offered to the SMB customer base. Additionally, is it possible that this model is broadly adopted by large and SMB customers could turn out to be a larger source of repeatable for you than either rentals or even the 360 services?","Carl Bass","Before I go to the most speculative part of your question, Jay, let me answer the factual one which is yes, we can actually we are doing some places and it can be done in more. So, the flexible license that allows people access to more software is a great model. I think it is a win-win here, it\u2019s good for the customers, it\u2019s good for us. We\u2019ve demonstrated it over and over again in the large enterprise accounts and I think it\u2019s true almost all the way down through the pyramid of size of customers. And so there was a little giggle here because we\u2019ve just spent the last couple of hours here talking about doing that more broadly. So you\u2019re on to something that. It could be a big source of revenue when you get to the more secular one. The one I want to throw in, it certainly could be bigger than the desktop subscriptions, I\u2019m not sure it will be bigger than the cloud subscriptions. I think there is a huge amount of value tied up in delivering services through the cloud that were just beginning to tap into and I won\u2019t venture that this is bigger but it\u2019s certainly a meaningful and an important way that customers could get access to more software in a more convenient and affordable way.","Mark Hawkins","I think what you\u2019re pointing out Jay is there is multiple levers for us to get to the 70% north of 70% recurring revenue. And I think that\u2019s good point.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Okay. My second question is the obligatory channel question. First, could you talk about the result so far of having re-implemented the earned back comp model versus what you had previously for the last couple of years. Could you talk about how that\u2019s influencing channel productivity, channel behavior having gone back to that? Also the company has talked about for example at AU the last couple of years about the prospect of channel consolidation. Any signs of that and is that sort of thing that you would watch passively occur let\u2019s say was that the sort of thing that perhaps you might encourage or otherwise get involved in?","Carl Bass","So I think the answer to the first part of your question is it seems to work quite well in Q1. The model seems to be working. When it comes to channel partners I mean these are independent businesses we\u2019re keenly interested but I don\u2019t think we would take an active hand, we haven\u2019t seen any signs of consolidation. I think most of our comments about consolidation have generally been over the long-term. When people ask kind of speculatively what do you think will happen I mean those are we speculated that they will get a figure, we don\u2019t see any real signs of it. The only times that we saw consolidation happening or enter into the channel it\u2019s really doing like 2008, 2009, they are really hard economic times, we saw a little consolidation there but on an ongoing basis generally channel seems to be doing well and I think in particular over the last few quarters they\u2019ve done very well.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Thanks, Carl, thanks, Mike.","Carl Bass","You\u2019re welcome, Jay.","Mark Hawkins","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Thank you very much and good afternoon guys. Carl, you mentioned that the revenue impact from the business model change was less this quarter than in the Q4. Could you tell us that again concentrated in AEC in the Americas, there was the shift to subscription, somewhat meaningful or starting to get somewhat meaningful in other verticals or geos as well?","Carl Bass","It was small enough to hardly matter. I mean I think it\u2019s a time to really look us in Q4 this year when those contracts come up for renewal again. That\u2019s really the time to look at. And I think you will see in Q4 of this coming year being more broad-based both by industry and geo. As we talked about at the time a number of the deals that were on kind of on the docketing Q4 didn\u2019t close and in the end we decide them to close them as is rather than introduce the business model change, it just got hard and we recognize that it was probably best for everyone just to take the business off the table. But I think in Q4 this year where there is more preparation with our account managers working with our large customers I think you\u2019ll see a more broad-based switch.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one follow-up. So after some pretty lean quarters, AutoCAD LT has been doing better recently and putting aside to desktop subscriptions for a moment. Can you talk about what\u2019s driving the improvement in perpetual licenses?","Carl Bass","I think one is the desktop, the desktop subscriptions are definitely helping. You\u2019d see much more modest growth in that number but it wasn\u2019t for that. I think the other thing was as we said at the time is we took our eye off the ball a little bit. And when we paid more attention to it we could actually drive the results.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company","Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citigroup.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Hi, thanks. Two questions. Just first on the upgrades you talked about seeing some strength there and you talked about it possibly strengthening in as you get towards back half of the year. Could you talk about qualitatively on \u2013 are you seeing growth in upgrades year-over-year, how much in any sense as to where we might see that as we exit the year?","Mark Hawkins","One thing Walter I\u2019d say is we don\u2019t breakout the upgrades specifically but I think building on Carl\u2019s comment certainly we saw nice performance in Q1. And I think just by the definition of the fact that the upgrades are going away and just to go to market plans that we have we would expect it to spike in Q4. So that won\u2019t be a shock to see to us to see that happen.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","And then Mark there was a quote in the prepared remarks talking about being committed to returning excess cash. And I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us some framework around how much cash you feel like you need to run the business and therefore kind of to do so much as is excess?","Mark Hawkins","Sure. Well a couple of things here. The first thing I would say is that just kind of historical facts Walter in the last couple of years we\u2019ve returned 70% of our operating cash flow back to the shareholders vis-\u00e0-vis the share buyback and about 80% of our free cash flow roughly speaking in the last couple of years. And so we certainly have shown evidence of doing that number one to kind of backup that fact. The second thing as you know the vast preponderance of our cash is offshore it\u2019s roughly about 75% of our cash is offshore and so we try to keep a balance in terms of the U.S. cash from that standpoint. So I haven\u2019t given an exact number out. There is a number that we look at that we talk with the management team and the board about and I\u2019m not wanting to disclose a specific number but obviously we need to keep some flexibility in U.S. cash that\u2019s the thing I\u2019m most sensitive to for lots of reasons, Walter that you appreciate whether it\u2019s M&A or other strategic reasons.","Walter Pritchard - Citigroup","Okay, great. Thank you.","Mark Hawkins","You bet.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Thanks for taking my question guys. I know at this point you\u2019re not breaking out this split between maintenance and cloud and certainly on quarterly basis subs can be lumpy. But I guess I\u2019m wondering is there a timeframe that we can think about when cloud will be a majority of the sub ads in quarter kind of as you think about attaining your longer term both billings and margin targets?","Carl Bass","We\u2019re not sure while we have a model that says when it is. We don\u2019t really know. The one thing we did say in the fourth quarter is that we\u2019d start giving you more metrics on this as we went through the year. So we\u2019re going to continue to look at it and try to give you a little bit more visibility, we didn\u2019t want to promise it every quarter, we knew it would be lumpy, but probably give us a quarter or two more under in our belt and we\u2019ll start breaking out more the metrics around subscription.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s great. And then a question about Fusion 360 sounds like there is some good success there. I\u2019m wondering what is a typical customer look like for that product and potentially how do you think about adding functionality to expand it\u2019s usage if you think about a more fully functioned desktop CAD solution?","Carl Bass","The way I think about it is Fusion is about form function and fabrication so the kind of people who are using it tend to be small companies, tend to be at the cutting edge and they\u2019re interested in products that \u2013 mechanical products that are ecstatic where the form actually matters and they might actually really be interested in how it\u2019s fabricated. So 3D printed machines so it tends to be the kinds of products you see like consumer products, medical devices more in that category than you would see big heavy industrial equipment. We\u2019re going to continue to add functionality to the trick with it is we wanted (indiscernible) the easiest used product out there, we wanted to be simple and complete in a different way than some of our other offerings like Inventor or some of the competitive offerings.","So we\u2019re really pleased with the progress it has and the one thing about it it\u2019s really attractive in different time of customer. Unlike other times where we\u2019ve introduced new products and there is a lot of consternation amongst our customers and our partners and therefore us that should I buy A or should I buy B I think it\u2019s pretty obvious to everybody involved which one to buy and we\u2019re bringing in lots of new customers. And the premium for them is on things like collaboration it\u2019s working in the cloud, its sharing models and it\u2019s really about a different way to work than I would see in many of our larger manufacturing customers.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets","Right. Thanks. Very helpful, Carl.","Carl Bass","Okay. You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush.","Steve Koenig - Wedbush","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious to get your though qualitatively on this. As your license upgrades go away at the start of next year and your \u2013 but you\u2019re still on your year-on-year model transition, so you haven\u2019t gotten maximum traction you got probably on cloud and desktop subscriptions. What\u2019s the shape of that subscription ad curve next year, in other words should that \u2013 should we expect a bit of a low (valley) next year before things pickup in your (indiscernible). And I guess the related question on to that now and that\u2019s all I have which is just your thoughts qualitatively on the kinds of subscriptions that you have which ones will become important following the good results in maintenance subscriptions, which \u2013 is it the desktop subscriptions next or the cloud subscriptions. How do you expect the competition of your subscription additions to change over time?","Carl Bass","Okay. Let me answer the first question because it informs the second. I think if we did nothing different from where we\u2019re today if we introduced no program changes or policy changes for next year you would see a low in the curve, you would see something downward. Not wanting to have that happen. We have a number of knobs and dials we can turn programmatically and through our different offerings and promotions to change the shape of that curve. So that \u2013 I hope that makes sense. So left without of doing anything it goes down we believe we have a number of things we can do to change that so that it goes up.","When you move to your second question clearly maintenance subscriptions because of the size of it will be the most important for a long time. We \u2013 there are number of things we can do around desktop subscriptions to make them more attractive. If you remember how we made the transition from upgrades to maintenance subscription over the last decade, one of the strongest ways was to provide financial incentives for customers to (mobile) and we can do the same thing with desktop subscriptions. And then the last part is I think for the future the most important are the cloud subscriptions. The cloud subscriptions in the long-term will be the most important but we will never get there from here unless we start with a really strong base of maintenance subscriptions.","Mark Hawkins","I would just add to Carl\u2019s point too. I agree with all that and then also you talked about the leverage that we can put on the bid on. The enterprise it\u2019s a last point that we also have the levers to be able to flip significantly and so.","Carl Bass","Good point, Mark.","Mark Hawkins","Yes, to shut that in.","Steve Koenig - Wedbush","Okay, great. Thanks for your color on that.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore.","Matt Williams - Evercore","Hi, good afternoon guys. Thanks for filling me in. Carl, just one for you maybe more macro-related, you spoke some about conditions in the commercial construction market. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can provide a little bit of an update around what you\u2019re seeing in manufacturing vertical, some of the data points that you can point too? It\u2019s nothing else increased stability there and I\u2019m just curious from a growth standpoint what you\u2019re seeing in that vertical?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I\u2019m a little bit confused truthfully by some of the economic data out there. Sometimes I think people the needle is too sensitive and it\u2019s bouncing too much with some of the manufacturing date out there. What we\u2019re seeing from our business is relatively stable, it\u2019s been stable, it\u2019s growing, it\u2019s relatively healthy across the globe. Again I\u2019d add the one caveat there are a couple of geographies I worry about a little bit, the only one I really worry about is Russia right now. But we\u2019ve seen relative stability just and hopefully steady growth everywhere. So a little bit of economic data coming out is a little bit surprising and like I said we maybe looking at a little bit too much perturbation of needle, that\u2019s a little too sensitive.","When you get out of it qualitatively or anecdotally from talking to customers there seems to be a general comfort amongst most of our manufacturing customers as their businesses are doing well. They\u2019re investing for the future, their focus these days they\u2019ve moved on from being driven truly by quality and cost so they\u2019re really interested in innovation and agility, how do I get better markets, better products to market more quickly, how do I differentiated my products and they\u2019re willing to invest in retooling. They\u2019re doing it in a healthy thoughtful way. So I feel really good about what\u2019s going on in manufacturing and once we have the data plays out over the next couple of quarters.","Matt Williams - Evercore","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And maybe just one sort of follow-up along the same lines there. In the past you\u2019ve talked about PLM 360 and really opening to that new customers. I was just curious if you could provide any update on trends you\u2019re seeing there and if that is starting to move maybe beyond just the departmental sort of deployment or is it moving out market at all just any color on the PLM 360 business would be helpful?","Carl Bass","Yes, the PLM continues to the most and most of the customers are either new to Autodesk entirely where they certainly are in primarily in Autodesk shop. And that continues to be true. The other profile about many of the PLM 360 customers there are companies who have made a decision that their IT strategy revolves around cloud deployments so they\u2019re frequently deploying other cloud-based products like NetSuite, Salesforce, Workday and they\u2019ve made a decision this is the way they go about business. And so when they go out there looking you were obviously the leading or one of the leading choices there. So and what we\u2019re seeing and I kind of referenced it a couple of times, what we\u2019re seeing is increased size of the deployments and that\u2019s the healthiest sign. People start with numbers in the dozens and now they\u2019re getting up to the 100s and what I like most of all that I\u2019m seeing in the PLM 360 business is more small deals and more repeat deals, so we\u2019re broadening the number of deals in the quarter and we\u2019re starting to see the repeat deals in both to meet our indicators of the healthy growing business.","Matt Williams - Evercore","Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Carl Bass","Okay. You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Yes. Thanks. Carl, you touched upon this a little bit in your last answer. So Russia (indiscernible) actually called out specifically saying that it has an impact on the business in the quarter. Are you saying that you\u2019re keeping an eye on it but you haven\u2019t seen any impact thus far?","Carl Bass","No, we have seen \u2013 we have what you said and we\u2019ve certainly seen an impact. And if I had to guess I suspect it\u2019s going to get worse before it\u2019s going to get better. It\u2019s a little on the horizon that says people are about to invest more in Russia. So I think it will get worse, definitely was not a bright spot for us this quarter.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","I think that.","Mark Hawkins","Sterling, that\u2019s a small part of our business.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","I think part of it was whether it would have spillover factored into more of core Continental Europe which is a big part of your business?","Carl Bass","Yes, I haven\u2019t seen that. I mean obviously it\u2019s a big economy and but generally speaking the rest of Europe looks reasonably healthy task. And we didn\u2019t pickup anything during the quarter that we change that opinion.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Got it. On a different topic, can you remind us what in this year\u2019s suite of products in terms of future functionality is there to help motivate the adoption of subscription and maybe what you\u2019ve talked about at least at this point in terms of what might come in the next round of upgrades that again where future functionality that would only be available if you had some sort of subscription attached?","Carl Bass","I think there were a number of things that we\u2019re doing, but I think the primary one is just the fact that the upgrades are going away.","Mark Hawkins","I could tell you all kinds of wonderful things on the other side but I think the truth of the matter is people right now are making a decision of how they want to buy for the future, we\u2019ve told them that perpetual licenses and buying a new one every five years is still an option but there is no way to buy an upgrade and so what I think people are doing is they\u2019re deciding between getting our maintenance subscription or getting on desktop subscription. And that\u2019s probably the primary driver of the behavior in all the upsides you saw.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard Davis - Canaccord","Hi, thanks. So one question I kind of small a little bit and I can\u2019t remember how you wrote it in the note about the other day. But have you been able to kind of encourage kind of what I would call unaided downloads on the web, so that nothing we can love sales (indiscernible) that, but there is no friction with regard to that. I mean, at some point down at the low end of the market, you might be able to have an easy enough brain simple download that would allow you to get revenues without a lot of cost to absorb in sales and marketing expense? Thanks.","Carl Bass","Yes. One of the things we have done extensively is try to ease the download and trial process. We have done it as we have talked in education and we see now millions of downloads in education. We also see thousands and thousands of trials. And the difference between the trial and a buy is really the exchange of payment method. You need a credit card. So what we see a lot of is people most of our sales and particularly our online sales start with the trial of download. And we are getting better at doing it. And I think customers are getting much more comfortable doing, much more comfortable downloading and paying for software online.","Richard Davis - Canaccord","Got it. Great, thanks.","Carl Bass","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Gennarelli.","David Gennarelli - Director, Investor Relations","Alright, thanks everybody. That concludes our call. Lastly, we are going to be at the Morgan Stanley Conference on June 3. And if you need to reach me, you can reach me at 415-507-6033.

And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks Dave. We had a terrific start to FY17 with more proof points that the transition from perpetual licenses to subscription and cloud offerings is going well. We are moving steadily ahead on our two big initiatives: First, we\u2019re increasing lifetime customer value; second, we\u2019re driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions to better serve existing customers as well as expand into new segments. I will share more details on our Q1 results and then talk more about our view around long-term shareholder value creation before getting into our outlook for the rest of the year.","As I mentioned the last quarter, the primary focus for us through the transition is driving subscriptions and annualized recurring revenue or ARR. In total, we added 132,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. New model subscription additions more than doubled to a 140,000. And while we expected maintenance subscriptions to decline, in conjunction with the end of sale of perpetual licenses on individual products, at the end of Q4, total maintenance subscriptions declined by only 8,000, as our renewal rates on maintenance continues to increase. Q1 was the first quarter where customers no longer had the option to buy a perpetual license for individual products such as AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT. As a result, additions from product subscription, formerly known as Desktop subscription, jumped dramatically by 125% sequentially and by nearly 350%, year-over-year. Helping drive product subscription growth in Q1 was a promotion targeted at converting our legacy non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions.","This promotion captured legacy non-subscribers, who are customers that purchased a perpetual license sometime in the past and wanted to trade in their old perpetual license for a product subscription at a discount. It turned out to be one of the most successful promotions we\u2019ve ever run and contributed over 25,000 net new model subscriptions to the quarter. As we annualized the data, the really interesting part was that over 50% of those taking advantage of the promotion were using versions from seven years back or older. We have talked about the opportunity to convert a portion of the estimated 2.8 million non-subscribers, which captions a five-year look back. We knew there was meaningful number of active users beyond that five-year look back, and this was a great validation of that point.","New model subscriptions also got a strong contribution from our enterprise flexible license, or EBA customers. I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call that in Q4, we signed up a record number of enterprise customers who are these token based or consumption style EBAs. And while because of the way we count those subscriptions, we\u2019ve seen the benefits in net new subscriptions in Q1 as we did in the first quarter of last year. These EBAs contributed more than 25,000 subscription additions in Q1 this year. EBAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition, leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.","We also had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions in Q1, which increased nearly 50% sequentially. BIM 360 and PLM 360 continued to lead the way. We are also having success with our other cloud products, such as Shotgun, A360 and Fusion 360. Our cloud-based products continue to bring in new customers to Autodesk. Our newest cloud product is our IoT platform, Fusion Connect, formerly known as SeeControl, a service that helps manufacturers and system integrators connect, analyze, control, and manage things remotely, which is gaining traction. Just as we changed the CAD\/CAM and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we are doing the same with the Internet of Things, enabling our customers to easily incorporate IoT capabilities into their projects.","In Q1, we landed a six-figure IoT deal with an industrial manufacturing company and [indiscernible] competing head-to-head against other well-known competitors. This is an exceptional win because the customer\u2019s considered a pioneer in IoT and has been making connected products as part of their core business strategy for several years. It\u2019s important to note that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 63% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 27% in Q1 last year. We\u2019re also excited about the number of subscriptions coming through our eStore which more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our total direct sales increased to 25% in the first quarter that\u2019s up from just 15% two years ago, and it\u2019s still in the early days for our eStore.","The growth in new model subscriptions fueled a 76% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total recurring revenue jumped to 70% of our total reported revenues compared to 53% last quarter. Total ARR growth was 12% at constant currency year-on-year. Remember, when evaluating total ARR growth relative to our long-term targets that this number will build over the next three quarters as new model becomes an increasingly large component of total ARR. So, we\u2019re very comfortable with the growth we experienced here in Q1. Another metric that we talked about in the recent quarters is the unit volume. When comparing our unit volume to the first quarter last year, it was in line with our expectations.","On the expense side, we are diligently controlling our spending. As a result of the restructuring action we took earlier in quarter, our total spend decreased more than 2 percentage points year-on-year. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less, yet focus on our key initiatives. We are carefully balancing the need for financial discipline with the need to invest to drive the long-term health of the Company. Overall, we are very pleased with the Q1 results, which are a great start to the year and reinforce our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk.","We are eagerly looking forward to the end of Q2 when we start selling perpetual licenses for suites and become fully immersed in the subscription model. Another exciting factor about Q3 is that we\u2019ll begin selling what can be thought of as our next generation of suites called collections. We won\u2019t officially launch it with our customers until next week, but I\u2019ll give you a little preview. Collections will be the most convenient way for customers to access a wide selection of both our desktop software and our cloud services. We\u2019re significantly reducing complexity by offering just three collections, one for AEC, one for manufacturing, and one for community. [Ph] The value for our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite.","We are offering single user and multi-user access, and choices of different turn rates that fit their needs. Suites have been a tremendous success since we launched them over five years ago and collections will take it to the next level by giving greater flexibility to our customers and increasing the lifetime value for us. That\u2019s a good segue to what I touched on last quarter and that\u2019s about what we\u2019re doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. I am [indiscernible] because I feel that what we\u2019re ultimately aiming to accomplish, which is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of design, is being somewhat lost in the noise of quarterly financial results.","Our transition is really happening on two vectors. The first is the business model and pricing transition that is happening now where our customers are moving to churn-based subscriptions. Over the next three years, we expect this process to lead to a highly predictable model and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy to align with the concept of being an all subscription company. The result will be meaningful increases in the business we do directly with our customers at the enterprise and e-commerce levels. In turn, these changes ultimately reduce our cost structure and increase how effectively we serve our customers.","The second vector of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. Investments we have made in this area, which started over three years ago have allowed us to get a sizable lead on our current competitors as well as the many well-funded startups. We\u2019ve seen the platform shift moving before. Incumbents will slowly become less relevant while the world changes around them. We\u2019re investing to secure the future of Autodesk and our new cloud-based products are really the undisputed leaders in their respective categories.","It\u2019s not just about making browser-based design tools, it\u2019s about market expansion. Mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk.","Again, our framework for building long-term shareholder value is to increase the lifetime value of every customer, change our cost structure and the means by which we reach customers, and finally to build the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry as the underlying platform shifts to the cloud. While many people are focused on the business model shift, winning the leadership position in the cloud leads to a long-term, sustainable competitive advantage.","Now, turning to our Q2 and full year outlook, I mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call that the current fiscal year is the most unique in the Company\u2019s history as we complete the transition from perpetual licenses to subscriptions at the end of Q2. None of the traditional seasonality patterns for sales metrics will be applicable. Year-over-year growth rates of traditional and financial metrics will be helpful in understanding how we are performing through the transition. Similar to Q1, hitting the lower end of our revenue range while exceeding our subscription guidance is a desirable outcome for the year.","Our view of the macroeconomic environment\u2019s impact on our business hasn\u2019t changed since last quarter or for the past several quarters for that matter. The global conditions have been uneven. Most of the emerging markets have been difficult but most of the mature markets have been relatively good. As we evaluated our strong Q1 results, we didn\u2019t see any meaningful change in the demand environment.","For the end of sale of suites here in Q2, we expect the dynamics will resemble what we saw in Q4 with the end of sale for individual products. In other words, we\u2019re expecting some surge activity but not a lot. Remember that our unit volume and revenue contribution from suites is much lower than our individual products, and we\u2019ve already seen a significant shift in suites customers to the new model. While this is good news in terms of moving them to a higher value offering now and not having to convert them later, it tamps down our expectations for a surge in volume at the end of this quarter. Also while the promo targeting legacy customers were successful in Q1, we will not be running that promo here in Q2.","Q3 will be our first quarter of subscription only sales across the board and we\u2019ll likely experience sequential slowdown. That\u2019s when you can expect to see promotions aimed at our legacy customers again. If you are not modeling a sequential decline for Q3 already, you should be. And it\u2019s consistent with our expectations for the full year, which are unchanged. And Q4 should be due to show more normal sales trends in our new subscription only model. We made a slight adjustment to our FY17 outlook for EPS, based on our revised tax rate assumption for the year. Otherwise, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for FY17 and our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR over the next four years, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We remain committed to keeping spend growth roughly flat to slightly down this year and flat in FY18. And coupled with our top line projections, we see a path of free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY20 and $11 per share in FY23.","To wrap things up, our business model transition is in full swing now and exceeding expectations. We are really excited to do another major step further along in the transition; and by the second of half of this year, we will fully be in the subscription only model. Customers and partners are embracing the new model, both subscriptions and the cloud. At the same time, we\u2019re driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities, and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come.","Operator, now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays Capital.","Saket Kalia","First, maybe to start off for you Carl; obviously, a nice start to the year for subscription additions. Can we just go back to the 650,000 to 800,000 units that we\u2019ve sold in any given year? And can you just talk about the seasonality of that in a typical year, as well as how much of that might be suites versus standalone?","Carl Bass","Yes, let me give you a little bit. I mean, generally speaking, much more Q4 -- it\u2019s always been, as far as I can remember, back-end loaded, surprisingly heavy in Q4. Q1 is usually up a drop; Q2 and Q3 go to [audio gap] and then Q4 comes out as the usual seasonality pattern. When we go back and look at unit volumes with just in mind of everything we\u2019ve seen historically as well as all of our projections for the quarter.","Scott Herren","Yes. In fact in terms of the split between products and suites -- I know you know this, but the AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT are by far the highest volume. So, we look at unit volumes. They dominate that as well. Suites are higher priced, but significantly lower volume.","Saket Kalia","And as my follow-up, Carl, one of the interesting things that you mentioned was, a fair number of the non-subscribers that converted this quarter were on tools that were older than seven years; and I think the 2.8 million that we\u2019ve talked about historically is for non-subscribers that are on tools five years or less. So, I guess the question is what that number looked like if you included a couple more years of non-subscribers? And as you built a couple more data points, how do you feel about that 30% conversion that you\u2019ve talked about within that base?","Carl Bass","That\u2019s a great question. And I know it\u2019s got a lot of attention. So, let me just back up a little bit and give you a more holistic view of moving people to subscriptions, and then try to place the 2.8 million into context. So, as we were looking at building out the new model that would be subscription-only, we basically said that there were three pools of people that we could draw from, one were the non-subscribers; the second were the non-payers or the pirates; and the third I\u2019ll just call the non-users, basically people who are either not using software or using competitive software and then share shift, we would move them over. So, there were three different distinct pools with different dynamics.","One of the questions came up frequently was okay, what is the size of the people who have bought products but aren\u2019t on subscription? And what we said is our new model -- when we built out our model, we were looking to add about 800,000 subscribers to the total from this collection of sources.","People wanted to know the size of each of these relative segments. Here is a way to think about it. On the non-subscribers, one data point we gave you, it was only just one, was that in the last five years, and it remained relatively constant, which is why we chose it as a convenient data point, there were 2.8 million people who had bought but had an attached subscription. We put a caveat around that that said some of those people may no longer be users; they may no longer be actively using it; they may have come back in by buying a new license; they may have joined a different firm; they could have passed away for all we know. But, we wanted to give a size to it. There are clearly people beyond that, five years, who are still using software as evidenced by that. So, it\u2019s just an indication. And if you look, it\u2019s interesting and somewhat obvious in at least retrospect. But if you look at the legacy promo results, there are more people that bought that were back six and seven years than were maybe years one, two and three. And the mean is around seven years and it is a bell-shaped distribution. So that should give you an indication of what goes on in that base. So, it is bigger. And what we had said is, we thought we could convert 30%. So, taking into account how many people were no longer active or the new model would not appeal to them, we thought we could convert 30% of the base. And that\u2019s what we were indicating was our assumption in the model.","The second one is -- and I think people overlook this and miss out on the dynamics as we move to a more connected experience from our customers is that right now somewhere around half or slightly more than half of the usage of our products in the world is by people who do not pay for it. Once again, you\u2019ve got to put a discount on how many people will actually pay for it when they are forced to. But, at least as many people don\u2019t pay for the software they use as the ones who do.","And then the third one which I would not rule out as an important contribution to the subscription additions are the people who are using competitive products. I think much of what we\u2019ve done to lead the way in cloud-based engineering software is going to be very attractive and will be a source of moving customers from namely the legacy providers who have felt kind of dropped the ball on moving their software to the cloud. So, sorry for the really long-winded answer to your question, but I thought it -- I knew that really would come up and I just wanted to try to put it in a broader context.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Carl, with you and then finish with Scott for the follow-up; I thought it was very useful that you highlighted the technology and product vector of the strategy and not just the model change. So, on that point, could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the timing of delivery of new technology over time? In other words for example, Inventor is being updated seemingly on a quarterly basis; go back in December in AU, we heard about AutoCAD may go to a more than 12-month cycle for major releases. Could you talk about what you think the relevance is of the schedule of various products is to sustaining the flywheel of the subscriptions model? And one almost obviously, missing brand in your portfolio is let\u2019s call it, Revit 360. You\u2019ve got all kinds of other 360s but you don\u2019t have a Revit 360. Is that something that would make sense for you?","Carl Bass","Yes. So generally, the frequency of updates is inversely proportional to the maturity of the product, just broadly speaking that if you were to look and say a very mature product like AutoCAD needs at least frequent updates; products like maybe Fusion 360 gets updated relatively frequently; if you follow Fusion, there\u2019s weekly and biweekly small updates and certainly every month, there is an update with significant functionality. We\u2019ll continue that. In some ways, it\u2019s not the overall quantity of steps delivered. One of the things that changes in this new model is really the frequency. And what I think it changes is also the digestibility. It\u2019s like getting one big roll a year versus having dozens of small snacks. And a little bit what this allows us to do with our newer products is have not only us deploy the software more effectively but our customers more easily discover what\u2019s in it and put it to use as quickly as possible. So, we are going to continue on that cadence of the newer cloud-based products will be frequently updated. The other ones will be a little bit slower. But, both the traditional products and the new cloud services really need to be thought of differently as connected experiences, which now allow us to do things in the ongoing use and in the update that were just not possible before. As a matter of fact, even when we look at some of the data, I was just reporting on in the answer to Saket\u2019s question, a bunch of that comes from frequent connectivity.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay.","Carl Bass","Let me just interrupt. Yes, there is a bunch of work going on online stuff for the AEC industry. The first thing we are doing we have talked about being incredibly successful is what we\u2019re doing with BIM 360. Where we\u2019ve gone most recently is we brought out BIM 360, in the beginning was more enterprise and for the more sophisticated users, but there is a huge demand in the market for the less sophisticated users and distribution of plans and stuff like that. We just did -- we\u2019re just in the process of doing updates to BIM 360 Docs that addresses this much broader need. And you\u2019ll see more of the design and analysis for AEC coming online during the next year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","For Scott, could you give us an update on the capacity additions you have put in place for what you\u2019ve called your entitlements and transactional engines, your back office for the new model? And just a quick clarification, to-date you had the somewhat odd situation of splitting your subs billings between license revenue and subs revenue, could you foresee taking the subs revenue -- billings, rather only into the subs reporting line, so we don\u2019t have to mix and match the two kinds of reporting lines?","Scott Herren","Yes. Let me answer that and the second part first, Jay. I am working on that. I realize that the way we do it is accurate in terms of accounting standards, the way we do it today but confusing from a modeling standpoint. So, one of the things that we are working on is trying to simplify the way we categorize revenue as it comes out of deferred and hits the P&L such that either we can keep maintenance separate from what I\u2019ll call new model subscription separate from license and other. That\u2019s not ready yet but that\u2019s something that is implied and I think it will be a very investor friendly move when we can make that. To your first question on capacity, we see the -- so, we\u2019ve built the entitlement engine. As you think about, it\u2019s a multi-phase process. You have to build capability on the back-end, then each product has to build in the capability to recognize the new back-end and use that as a way of turning it on, so that they can get access to it. And then as those products ramp up, the capacity on the back-end gets tested. So, we haven\u2019t had any problems at this point, as we ramp up the new model subscriptions fairly rapidly. I think it\u2019s now a question of absorption and adoption of the new models.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Looking at the maintenance, the decline of 8,000 seats, so I was curious if you saw any of those maintenance seats actually transition over to subscription; if so, why did they do it and what kind of uplift did you see?","Scott Herren","Sterling, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of that activity right now. We\u2019ve talked about the path that we\u2019ll head down to make that happen. As you know, it\u2019s a higher price to convert; if you\u2019re an existing maintenance customer, it\u2019s a higher price to convert over to the new model offerings. So, what we\u2019ve talked about is driving higher value into the Desktop subscription offerings that make that something that besides being required to do it as you buy additional capacity, is attractive even when you\u2019ve got already got the existing perpetual license and maintenance attached to it. So, the reduction is not driven by conversions. And by the way, the reduction of 8,000 subs, the net reduction of 8,000 subs on maintenance was fewer than we\u2019d expected. It\u2019s more driven by just taking a very high renewal rate, the one that\u2019s not 100% and multiplying it times a very big number of maintenance install base.","Sterling Auty","And then as a follow-up, looking at the sequential change in revenue by the areas, it looks like AEC did not get impacted as much as some of the others. Is that just a natural fact of maybe there is more suite revenue in AEC versus the other two buckets or the other couple of buckets?","Carl Bass","I think that\u2019s a fair evaluation.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather, your line is open. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","I was looking at the ARR numbers and the subs numbers, and it was a really nice quarter as you guys have noted in terms of adding those new model subs. But one of the things I noticed is that -- since the growth in sub numbers is so much higher than the ARR number, the ARPS, if you will, the average recurring revenue per subscription is going down for the new model subs. And I think it\u2019s down something in the order of about 20% year-on-year. Can you talk to us a little about what\u2019s driving that down; is it mix shift; is it promotional pricing? What should we expect on a going forward basis; is that going to settle out at some time; is that going to turn up once we have the suites go fully to subscription? How should we be thinking about that trend line on ARPS on a go-forward basis?","Scott Herren","It really is mixed revenues. As you know, with the end of sale of perpetual licenses at the end of Q4, a lot of the new model subs that we added this quarter of course are the low end models; so, it\u2019s LT and AutoCAD. And so, as those come on line -- and remember the way we measure ARR is we sum the recurring revenue for the entire quarter, multiply that by four and that\u2019s what becomes the ARR. So the linearity in the quarter is one effect but mix is a bigger effect. Actually, you see the same thing in maintenance going the reverse direction, as there are fewer AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD maintenance subs; obviously you probably have already done the math. You see the ARPS is actually going up slightly on the maintenance side but coming down on new model; strictly a matter of mix. That will reverse of course when we get to the second half and into the next year, and we return to a mix that has an equivalent representation of suites as what we\u2019ve seen historically.","Carl Bass","Remember, if you just look at it -- if you go back to what we did around the long-term model, we\u2019ve always said that the current year mix was going to drive this over a longer period of time and particularly as we add the cloud subscriptions, we\u2019ve always kind of suggested that low to mid single digits was the increase that you\u2019d see in ARPS along a longer period of time. So, I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s anything there that\u2019s out of the ordinary or outside the bounds of the model what we have right now.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Credit Suisse.","Phil Winslow","Carl, just help me double click on the macro comments that you made there and obviously sort of no change. But, I wondered if you could just comment about what you\u2019re seeing by vertical, by geography, anything standing out. And as you\u2019re kind of putting your forward guidance here, any sort of major assumptions that you\u2019d highlight that would be very helpful.","Carl Bass","I gave you the general outlook which I would broadly characterize as unchanged. Probably the headline is that it\u2019s unchanged and it continues to be soft in a handful of mostly developing markets and pretty robust across the more mature markets. We paid special attention this time. And you guys have noted and as you noted in your reports. I would say three of our competitors, mostly in the manufacturing space but also one or two in the construction space, seem to have a little rougher time of it this time. And what we were trying to do was just parse how much was self-induced versus macroeconomically driven. I think at the end, I think most of the shortfalls or stubbed toes seem to be mostly self-inflicted. So, we\u2019re pretty comfortable. I just talked to our sales leaders the other day. Yesterday, I met with some of our channel partners who represent a huge percentage of our [indiscernible] channel. And they\u2019re feeling relatively bullish. So, there\u2019s nothing in our guidance or the forecast that would suggest any big change one way or another. Also across industry segments relatively healthy across the board. If I wanted to put a like a little gold star next to anything, I would say AEC seems to be just a little bit stronger on a worldwide basis. Once again, maybe better than the maybe value index is that informal green [ph] count. There are just cities in the world where it\u2019s hard to make green [ph] right now, there\u2019s just so many in use. So, that to me would be a little bit of a bias towards the upside is just strength in AEC. But otherwise stable, healthy, relatively unchanged.","Scott Herren","Keith, when you look at it by geo and you see some of this in the results, we really haven\u2019t seen a change in the demand environment overall. We continue to have obviously the biggest headwind in APAC and within that as we pointed out a couple times, Japan continues to be the biggest challenge for us. But beyond that, Americas looks strong. EMEA\u2019s doing well, particularly on a constant currency basis and the place that we see the biggest headwind right now as we\u2019ve seen for the past several quarters has been APAC, and in particular, in Japan.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard Davis","If you fast forward a year from now and you\u2019ll be through your product transition, at least in terms of end-of-life and I\u2019ve seen this kind of with Kronos. How do you think about mix? I guess with the mix model, how do you think about kind of making the cloud version of the software more attractive than the perpetual license maintenance accounts because I presume you would prefer people to kind of move to that side of the subscription docket? And how do you think about comparatively making those things better and at what pace do you want to try to do that?","Carl Bass","First of all, Richard, I need to congratulate anybody from Davidson. We all are very happy here in the Bay area. [Multiple speakers] Here\u2019s the way I think about it. First of all, as I said before, customers who are on maintenance are historically our best customers. They can stay there as long as they want to stay there; it\u2019s okay. Secondly, I would prefer to move them to one of the new product subscriptions, hopefully one of the industry collections as what will do better for them and more valuable to us. That would be a nice move. Collections going forward will have a fair number of cloud services including the consumption-based models built into them. So that will be a way for customers to become more familiar, more comfortable, and hopefully more desirous of more cloud functionality. The other thing we are dealing with a lot of the cloud stuff is we\u2019re really reaching new segments. It\u2019s this cloud-mobile combination for example that\u2019s allowing us to do -- if you look at the products, BIM 360 and PLM 360 I mean reaching large parts of the enterprise or large parts of an industry that were not otherwise accessible to us. In the frame of timing of three-year to five-year period, I think almost all of the software will run online and will really just have different versions and people will be able to run it in a browser, on a mobile device or as an installed application on their desktop. That\u2019s just going to become par for the course that they will get their tool of choice on their device of choice.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley","I would just like to ask about this, continue on this line of thought of product transformation. I am assuming that part of the game plan or roadmap here would be to introduce some mobile applications to some of your desktop subscribers. When might we start to see timing wise some of that incremental functionality being offered from the cloud to desktop subscribers?","Carl Bass","So, by the way, it\u2019s starting right now. I would say Q2 through the end of the year you will increasingly see cloud services that are available to all of our subscribers. They\u2019ll be packaged differently; many of them will be done on a consumption basis. So for example, you will be able to either buy consumption plans or pay as you go models in order to tap in the power of the cloud. So for example, visualization, analysis, being able to run; many of these compute intensive jobs, on the cloud side, is going to be a part of the rest of the year. And we\u2019ll continue to roll it out. We\u2019ve already seen really good pick up in this. People are hugely appreciating this footing -- sometimes people forget how compute intensive our ops are. So, instead of setting off a job and going for a cup of coffee, people are now able to set off a job on our cloud and then continue working. And so, this has been a big productivity boost. Customers have really liked it; we\u2019re already doing a fair amount of visualization and we\u2019re really starting to see it pick up in analysis and simulation. And I think that will continue.","The other place where we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of cloud-based stuff that\u2019s really important is the second axis that\u2019s important about the cloud, which is all around collaboration and coordination. And those are services that are not only available for just the new cloud-based products, they are actually available for the desktop products as those people have kind of the same kinds of communication needs as anyone else trying to build products.","Scott Herren","And to the point on mobile in particular, Steve, we\u2019ve got BIM 360 Docs out there. And so, if you think of a job site, what you don\u2019t see anymore is the guys walking around with a big bundle of blueprints under their arms; they are using ruggedized mobile devices on the site to do both view capabilities to look at the logistics programs to understand what needs to get done when, to do work flow around conflicts that come up in the field that may not have been envisioned during the design phase. So, we already have apps out there that are leveraging mobility in particular. And as we think about the TAM expansion and construction in particular, I think it goes heavily toward that space, toward the mobile space.","Steve Ashley","Just a quick follow-up; it\u2019s early days on subscription renewals, are those renewal rates on the subscriptions running higher than what you\u2019ve historically seen with maintenance?","Scott Herren","We actually see subscription -- both attach rate where we still have remaining perpetual license sales going up and the renewal of those going up. And it makes sense given that if you have decided you want a perpetual license and you want to stay on a perpetual license -- if you fall off of maintenance, you can\u2019t get back on. So, as you know, you\u2019ll need to update that; you\u2019ll know you\u2019ll want to make it compatible with the latest peripherals with newer versions of companion software that you\u2019re working with. So, we\u2019re seeing both attach rates and renewal rates on maintenance improve.","Carl Bass","One thing you\u2019ll see going forward and we report on it as new data comes in is on the new product subscriptions. I think you will see and this is my best guess at the time, you will see differential rates between the differing term lengths that we have because I think some people choose the term length based on a desire of how they want to pay, but maybe it\u2019s because of a spike in demand. And so I think we will see differential rates for example between annual and quarterly. And as we get data that makes it statistically significant, we\u2019ll report out on that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Shateel Alam","Hi. This is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking my question. So, you had your biggest increase in new model ARR this quarter at over 50 million. You mentioned a few things that helped, like the channel contribution. Just wondering what clicked in the channel this quarter and overall what would you call the top drivers of new model ARR this quarter that may have not been helping in the past?","Scott Herren","Shateel, I\u2019ll start and Carl, you can jump in. Obviously, the first biggest driver of new model ARR for the quarter was the end of sale of perpetual at the end of the prior quarter. So, we talked about unit volume being right in line with our expectations. To the extent that those customers were looking for AutoCAD or AutoCAD LT that drove a huge amount of the increase of 140,000 new model sub adds. I\u2019d say the other piece that Carl\u2019s already talked about but also factored in, in particular on Desktop is the success of the promo that we had targeted legacy users of the software that didn\u2019t have a subscription attached. Those would be the two biggest drivers of the new model subs for the quarter.","Shateel Alam","And then I had one, Scott, for you on your balance sheet. You have over $2 billion in cash, just bought back $100 million in stock. What\u2019s keeping you from buying more stock and how should we think about you balancing share repurchases versus doing acquisitions?","Scott Herren","As I think we called out in the -- I\u2019m sure we called out in prepared remarks, roundabout 80% of that cash of course is offshore. And given our tax structure, it would be quite expensive to get our hands on that and bring it back home but we\u2019d have to get it to do a share repurchase. I think we mentioned in the past that as our business model changes and as tax legislation around the world is somewhat in flight, we are looking at our overall operating structure and that will have an impact on tax structure. But as we stand today with that cash trapped offshore and the current tax structure that we\u2019ve got, I\u2019d say would be a very expensive proposition to bring it home.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Anil Doradla from William Blair.","Anil Doradla","Carl, I had a couple of questions. I think you said something like a 50% sequential increase in the 360 products. Now, was that kind of spread around all the products or was it more BIM focused or more Fusion 360 focused?","Carl Bass","They are in slightly different stages of maturity. But, we saw good growth in all of the products. We\u2019re in the really early stages and by comparison, it\u2019s explosive growth. Each one of these is taking off. But, to look at it a little bit more fine grain, a handful of 360 products are targeted at collaboration and those we have users in kind of clumps as company or company in its ecosystem come on or some of the design engineering products are more -- small teams get at it at a time. But across the board, we\u2019re seeing good adoption of the cloud products and a great response from customers. If anyone wants to do kind of the equivalent of channel checks on the product side, there\u2019s a huge amount of information out there on social media about the acceptance and how people are just becoming aware that there is a whole new generation of products out there.","Scott Herren","Yes. And Anil, what I\u2019d say is it\u2019s the usual suspects; it\u2019s BIM, it\u2019s PLM, it\u2019s Shotgun, and it\u2019s 360, as we pointed out in the opening commentary.","Anil Doradla","And as a follow-up, Carl, you talked about BIM 360; you\u2019re talking about some of the addressable markets which are significantly above the non-subscriber base and all that kind of stuff, so if I fast forward and look at BIM 360 in three years or four years from now, first of all, when do you think you\u2019ll hit the sweet spot or inflection point on BIM 360, and how big could this be in five years?","Carl Bass","This is -- I mean what you can look at out there. And look, it\u2019s very hard when a market doesn\u2019t exist to size it, but you can already see startups out there that are trying to serve some of the markets as well as some of the other incumbents and in total, there is probably a couple of hundred million dollars already being sold in the area of collaboration and coordination software. I think that market is going to grow tremendously. And that\u2019s what\u2019s available to us. It\u2019s really critical that we get out the BIM 360 Docs, like I said. We had incredible success with our enterprise, architecture engineering, construction customers. But we were missing out on the smaller parts of the market and that\u2019s where it really gets the scale. But these are opportunities that are certainly in the hundreds of thousands of potential users and in some cases possibly in the millions. But, if you want to just look more specifically, for example, many of the people on the construction site who will use BIM 360 were not a user of our designer engineering products. If you look at PLM 360, it broadens the use of our manufacturing products throughout the whole enterprise, as opposed to just the people that are involved in design and engineering. So, it\u2019s a very different use profile. It\u2019s also why we\u2019ve said just tying it back to some of the other comments, when you look at some of these cloud subscriptions, when you include these, these will be lower price products, and that\u2019s what kind of dampens the ARPS growth. So, just trying to tie that together, but these are really new users that haven\u2019t been available whereas before I talked about those three pools of users who can come and use the desktop or the new cloud-based design products.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","One thought is that I would assume that the geographies, the products that are going through the model transition would show the steepest revenue decline. I\u2019m just trying to get your analysis into what to make of the fact that Asia Pac decreased faster than EMEA and Americas. That would seem to suggest that if you didn\u2019t know a whole lot that that\u2019s the region that\u2019s going through the model transition, but clearly that has historically not been the case with model transition. So, I\u2019m trying to get your view on that. And also from a product perspective, it would seem that PSEB is going through the sharpest decline trends. Therefore, the model transition is more prevalent there, but again that would not make sense. I\u2019m trying to get some sense and your perspective as to what to make of the disparity in the growth rates of these geographic and product cuts.","Scott Herren","Kash, I think you are thinking about it in the right way, but let me put a little bit of a different distinction on it. The places where the year-on-year growth is less impacted by the model transition are the places where they were earlier to adopt the new model. So, the compare point a year ago already had a reasonable mix or a growing mix of new model subs built into it. That was not the case in APAC. APAC has been the slowest to adopt the new models. So, the compare point for our APAC revenues for the quarter compares back to a quarter that had very little new model mix inside there. So, it\u2019s more impacted in terms of the year-on-year growth rate.","Carl Bass","Yes. One of the encouraging signs we saw this quarter was the proportion in APAC of new model subscriptions for the suites. So, there are portions of Asia that are moving; it\u2019s not uniform. But, we were very surprised and pleasantly so to see such a large percentage, and it exceeded the other geos in terms of new model subscriptions. So, we\u2019re seeing some traction there. Also, a lot of it, just so you understand it and maybe can reconcile it as some of you who are doing things like channel checks, one of the biggest factors affecting the uptick is actually the sentiment of the reseller. Resellers have a huge impact in what they present to your customers. Our best resellers are all on-board with the new models; some of the ones that are staying behind are influencing it. And sometimes that carries over into geographic distinctions that are actually big enough to be called out.","David Gennarelli","Right, but as Carl said, we did see an encouraging uptick. And despite the fact that APAC had the biggest year-on-year impact from the transition, we saw a really encouraging uptick toward the end of the quarter in the new model subs there.","Scott Herren","To your point on PSEB, Kash, what you are seeing there is just the continuation of what we\u2019ve seen all along is suites, because so what\u2019s in PSEB, it\u2019s dominated by AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT and those products are included in the suite. So as the suites continue to grow and gain traction, fewer people are buying just the standalone version. So, a lot of what\u2019s happening in that PSEB segment is simply mix of customers, getting AutoCAD and getting LT, but getting it inside their suite instead.","Carl Bass","And I think as you see the Collections roll out, you\u2019ll see the same phenomena; it\u2019s going to continue because it\u2019s down the same lines.","Kash Rangan","And also philosophically, when are we going to see the clear distinction in the product roadmap between the licenses and the desktop versions, that somebody that is inclined to stay on maintenance actually says, you know what, I\u2019m not going to pay maintenance; I\u2019m just going to jump over to the subscription. When is the product road map going to be clearly delineated into two separate points?","Carl Bass","I think as soon as you start seeing the collections, it will become clear. I think that will begin to have an impact in Q3. Collections are one of the vehicles to move our customers from maintenance to product subscription; it is more valuable; it is more valuable; it is way more flexible than anything they\u2019ve had; it gives them broader access to a wider set of products. That will be one of the tools that we use to encourage our customers to look and consider the new offerings.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Wong from Citi.","Kenneth Wong","Carl, I wanted to touch a little bit on what you just mentioned about collections. Is that something you feel that you guys have circled up with some of your larger customers and partners in terms of talking about the value of collections and you get a better sense that that\u2019s a product that could potentially pivot them over to buying kind of a higher value pull from you guys?","Carl Bass","So Ken, you sound a little bit like you are under water. I\u2019m not sure I was able to -- were you able to? Scott understands you much more clearly\u2026","Scott Herren","The sound quality wasn\u2019t great, Ken. But, I think I got your question on collections. It is the case where we have as Carl said in the opening commentary, we haven\u2019t formally rolled this out worldwide but as we do think of it is as sort of the follow-on to suites, as the next iteration of what suites look like. It will be greatly simplified; the pricing model will be greatly simplified. It will bring along with it substantial additional value in terms of the number of products that are included. It also will begin to form the on ramp from desktop execution software to cloud software. We\u2019ll incorporate a lot of our cloud properties inside there to make it something that\u2019s not a separate buying decision to go out and have our customers test out and try out the cloud product. So, we\u2019d look at it as not just the next step in adding value and driving our customers to see the higher value of the new subscription models, but also as an on-ramp to the cloud.","Kenneth Wong","Got it.","Carl Bass","The other thing I\u2019d add, because we\u2019ve been slightly oblique about this is one of the other things to remember is our ability to consolidate the product portfolio, shrink the product portfolio. This is the first step towards doing it. So, people have asked about the product portfolio. Collections are the vehicles that allow us to simplify the product portfolio, focus on the important ones, trim the parts of it that make less sense and have much more discipline around the R&D expense. So, we are really excited about concentrating the offerings for the different industries with only these three collections.","Kenneth Wong","And then, in terms of the channel, I mean clearly you guys are getting more volume there. How should we think the contribution from the channel trends over time; does that get closer to the 80% that you guys\u2026","David Gennarelli","I\u2019m sorry, Ken. Can you repeat the question? We are having trouble picking you up here. You are coming through very softly, like...","Kenneth Wong","Sure. Just simply, does the channel contribution trend closer to your 80% as the processing forward\u2026","Carl Bass","This time, you were even softer.","David Gennarelli","Operator, we\u2019re going to have to go to the next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Xiaoming [ph] for Brent Thill. Can you hear me okay?","David Gennarelli","Yes, we can.","Unidentified Analyst","So, just two questions, one, with the Q2 revenue outlook being a little bit lower than consensus but the year the same. Should we think of that -- I mean would it be that just you are seeing the Street just miss-modeling the seasonality or was there any change in your expected path or as you go through the end of perpetual and suites for the rest of the year, what would be the best way to think about that?","Scott Herren","I recognize that the guide we gave for the quarter is not where consensus was but, of course, we hadn\u2019t guided Q2 before. And what we\u2019re seeing in our guidance is in sync with what our expectations were. So, it\u2019s not a question of a change in seasonality pattern versus what had been expected previously. If you just look at coming to the end of sale of suites during Q2, we talked about earlier, we are expecting really a bit of a muted buy ahead versus what we saw on individual products. On the standalone products, remember we sized that at the end of Q4 there was only about a 10% increase in volume that came through. Suites to begin with are a much lower volume product than standalone products are. We are also seeing and have seen a really steady increase in the uptake of customers already buying the new model on suites. So, not waiting for it to hit end of sale; there has been a lot of interest in suites customers buying the new model. So, you add those two together, we are expecting a small amount of buy ahead activity in Q2 on suites but not a huge amount. If it\u2019s bigger than we think, will be toward the high end of the range and if it\u2019s less than we think, which would be a good thing because those are customers we don\u2019t have to convert off of perpetual in the future, the customer we think will be in the low end of the range.","Carl Bass","One of the things that I\u2019d just outline two things about it, one is just general; we\u2019re seeing greater support amongst customers and our partners in the new model. So, that is running ahead of plan. But it was interesting, like I said, I was just with our largest North American resellers or many of our largest North American resellers and just going around the room, there\u2019s some good betting going on about how much buy ahead there would be of suites at the end of the quarter. Like we said, the best we can say about this is we\u2019ve never experienced this before; it\u2019s different; and this is really our best estimate of what\u2019s going to go on. The more important news for us is that whatever happens, we\u2019re done with it at the end of this quarter. And so whether we\u2019re at the low end of the range and we\u2019re happy or it\u2019s the high end of the range, it doesn\u2019t matter because we move on to a world that we\u2019ve been waiting for, I am talking about for awhile and which we\u2019re just really selling only -- we\u2019re only selling new model and that greatly simplifies so much stuff. So, I will be thrilled when we\u2019re here three months from now.","Unidentified Analyst","Just one more question on the new collections and I guess we\u2019ll get details pretty soon. But, what\u2019s the philosophy around setting the pricing for those versus the old suites or the individual product subscription or desktop subscription? And maybe also think of in terms of LTV for those versus the other choices? And that\u2019s it from me.","Carl Bass","Over the next couple weeks, we\u2019ll be rolling out the prices and what\u2019s included in the collections. Probably best to do it then and look at it holistically; the information\u2019s not far behind, and so you\u2019ll all get to see it soon. We just felt like we wanted to share it because it seemed like if we\u2019re announcing it in 10 days, it was best to give you guys a preview. But probably best digest it with full collection of information.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments.","David Gennarelli","That concludes our call today. This quarter, we\u2019ll be at several conferences.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mr. Dave Gennarelli, Investor Relations at Autodesk. Sir, you may begin.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter fiscal 2019. On the line today is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company such as our guidance for the second quarter and full-year fiscal 2019, our long-term financial model guidance, our cash flow expectations, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, including assumptions around ASC 606, our maintenance to subscription transition, ARPS, customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or reviewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today\u2019s call, but we will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today\u2019s press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison under ASC 606.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Dave. Q1 was a good start to our fiscal 2019, with continued solid execution leading to strong growth in key metrics, such as ARR and ARPS. We also realized strong growth in billings, revenue, total deferred revenue and better than expected EPS resulting from lower spend in the quarter. Overall, these results keep us confident in achieving the financial targets we\u2019ve laid out this year and beyond.","There are several key areas that I want to highlight. Total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 22% under the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, and 25% on an apples-to-apples basis under ASC 605. Annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS, continued to operate its upward trajectory, both year-over-year and sequentially. Recurring revenue increased to 95% of total revenue.","We continue to see rapid migration of maintenance customers to subscription with the maintenance-to-subscription program, or M2S, and customers continue to engage with our solutions for reimagining construction and manufacturing.","First, let\u2019s dig into ARR a little bit more. As we\u2019ve been highlighting since we started the transition, the Autodesk machine has been geared towards driving ARR and we continue to see great results. Subscription plan ARR more than doubled, driven by growth in all subscription plan types, but led by product subscription.","We continue to drive impressive growth in product subscription ARR on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. The strength in total ARR was once again broad-based with all three major geographies showing strong growth led by APAC.","Last quarter and at our recent Investor Day, we started breaking out results of our core business, which represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription and EBA subscription. While our cloud business represents all the results generated by standalone cloud offerings, it\u2019s not surprising that core ARR grew in line with total ARR, as our core business drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth.","Our cloud ARR performed up to expectations and cloud billings remain strong, growing nearly 50%. I also want to provide you with a little more insight into our cloud business, because our pure cloud ARR and cloud subscription totals don\u2019t tell the entire story of the success we\u2019re having.","Our cloud products have become an integral selling point for our EBA customers and usage within our EBA customer base has really taken off. For example, in Q1, just over half of the monthly active users for BIM 360 were in EBA accounts. This really validates our relevancy at the top of the general contractor market, which is where we focused initially.","That success is a strong foundation to build on and we\u2019re now leveraging it in the mid-market contractors. For example, Miron Construction, an U.S.-based construction company is deploying some of the most advanced technology available in the construction industry. They use the new BIM 360 project delivery platform to process a change to their building project that added up to 70 design documents and the potential to add almost 1 million in project costs.","The 70 documents needed review by everyone in the project, which would have taken hundreds of hours to resolve to manual processes with their old digital document management software. But Miron resolve the issue in just a fraction of that time with BIM 360. The project manager also found several additional issues, which never would have been caught with their old document management tool. Now that\u2019s real value delivered on real projects.","Beyond that, as I said at our Investor Day, we expect in five years, Autodesk will have moved the building information model across the entire construction process from start to finish. BIM will become the record of everything it is happening from design to pre-fabrication to on-sites assembly into the final handover of the building to its owner. BIM will become the single source of truth across the full spectrum of design and make processes.","On the manufacturing side, our cloud-based Fusion 360 is also enabling customers to bring design and make closer. Generative design is now available in the ultimate version of Fusion 360 and uses AI-based algorithms to simultaneously generate multiple valid solutions based on real-world manufacturing constraints and product performance requirements, such as strength, weight, materials and more.","Some of you may have noticed that earlier this month, we announced a project with TM using our generative design technology to lightweight their vehicles and reimagine a small, but important vehicle component. The software produced more than 150 valid design options based on parameters the engineers set, which is required connection points, strength and mass.","They zeroed in on a new design, that is 40% lighter and 20% stronger than the original assembly. It also demonstrated another major benefit of generative design part consolidation. The new design consolidates an assembly of eight different components into one 3D printed part. That\u2019s the kind of game changing technology that really gets customers excited about the future of making things and Autodesk is clearly leading the way.","Finally, I want to quickly comment on our net subscription adds and remind you of some of the key factors we discussed last quarter. First, the M2S driven up-sell the collections is resulting in a consolidation of subscriptions in many of our accounts. They had a higher total account value.","Second, cloud subscriptions will continue to consolidate as the new packaging for BIM 360 works its way through the market. These factors are as expected and will continue to impact net subscription ads for the next couple of quarters. However, we continue to expect strong ARR growth resulting from the higher ARPS.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for a few more details on subscription, ARPS and other financial metrics.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. I\u2019ll start with a closer look at subscriptions. Subscription plan subs grew by 307,000 in Q1, with growth coming in all three categories, cloud, enterprise, and product subs. As Andrew noted, net subscription additions continue to be impacted by product consolidation from the adoption of collections and the product consolidation associated with our recently launched simplified BIM 360 offerings.","Collection and subscription additions increased over 30% sequentially and now make up a quarter of the base of products subs. The adoption of collection is happening through the regular run rate of new business through the renewal process, the legacy promo and the maintenance of subscription program. Again, the good news is that many of these customers are increasing their total spend with Autodesk, contributing to solid increases in ARPS and ARR.","So we continue to execute well on our core strategy of driving up-sell to industry collections. Each quarter, the vast majority of the new subscription plan subs are added through traditional means. However, we continue to make progress in converting legacy users into subscribers.","In Q1, the legacy promo added another 24,000 products subs and over 30% of those were collections. And we\u2019re still finding that the average age of the licenses that occurred in with the promo are seven years behind the curve release indicating there\u2019s still a very long tail of legacy customers to convert. There continues to be over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using an old perpetual license without a maintenance plan.","Over time, we expect to convert a large portion of these users through promotions like this, through compelling new product introductions and through traditional means as the product becomes increasingly outdated through time.","Core subscriptions grew between 12% and 13% in Q1, slightly below our recent history, but was inline with our expectations. Subscription consolidations are creating a near-term headwind. But as Andrew stated earlier, core ARR still grew 25%. A consistent attribute of the transition is the new customers continue to make up a meaningful portion of product subscription additions and represented 25% of the mix for the quarter.","These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan, subs was the expected decline in maintenance plan subs, primarily related to the M2S program. The M2S program continues to progress faster than expected, especially in the Americas.","In Q1, customers migrated 154,000 maintenance subs to product subs that brings the total M2S conversions to $0.5 million since we started the program middle of last year. The conversion rate remains strong with approximately one-third of our maintenance renewal opportunities during Q1 migrating to product subscription. Of those that migrate, over 30% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection.","We\u2019re now entering year two of the M2S program and we expect this to be the biggest year for M2S migrations. Effective earlier this month, for all maintenance contracts up for renewal, the price to move to subscription increases 5% and maintenance plan prices increased 10% if they choose to stay on maintenance. It\u2019s easier to see that it makes more economic sense for our customers to migrate and product subscription provides them the greatest value with increased flexibility, support, continuous updates and access to our cloud products.","The renewal rate for product subscription experienced a small increase sequentially and we expect it to continue to rise as the product mix improves. The renewal rate for maintenance was flat sequentially.","Now let\u2019s talk a little bit more about annualized revenue per subscription, or ARPS. ARPS continue to inflect up in Q1 for many of the reasons we\u2019ve been calling out, including the growing renewal base at a higher net price to Autodesk, the increase in digital direct sales, the price increase from the M2S program and less discounting and promotional activity.","Looking at an apples-to-apples comparison on ASC 605 basis, total ARPS grew 7% year-on-year and 3% sequentially to $569. While core ARPS grew a 11% year-on-year and 3% sequentially to $624. We expect total ARPS to continue to inflect up for all the reasons we laid out at Investor Day, as we progress through the transition.","Our e-store continues to play a bigger part of the digital direct business and grew nearly 90%, while achieving record revenue in the quarter. In addition, our e-store generated over 20% of the product subs in Q1, and our direct business to enterprise increased by over 30%.","So looking at our total business mix, total direct grew a 11% and was 29% of the Q1 mix. The growth in total direct was partially offset by some of the divestitures announced last November as part of the restructuring.","Now let\u2019s talk about billings. Since we moved to a point in the transition, where we are comparing back to a prior year that is also subscription-only sales. Billings growth has become a relevant metric again. As we noted in our last earnings call, when we reintroduced guidance for billings.","To be clear, we now defined billings as reported revenue plus the change in deferred revenue. Using that definition, billings for Q1 decreased year-over-year under ASC 606, primarily due to the write-off of previously deferred revenue, but increased 12% when comparing more apples-to-apples on a 605 basis. The impact from the adoption of ASC 606 is greatest in Q1, and we\u2019ll see diminishing impact as we move through the rest of the year. And note the deferred revenue impacts due to the adoption of 606 do not impact cash flows.","Moving to spend management. Our total non-GAAP spend came in at $531 million for the quarter, leading to better than expected profitability. Driving the lower spend result was our continued focus on cost management and the hiring ramp associated with filling the new roles we created as a result of the recent restructuring. We do expect to see hiring increase as we go forward. Our intend for fiscal 2019 remains to keep non-GAAP spend flat at constant currency relative to our fiscal 2018 budget at about $2.2 billion.","Looking at the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue grew 21% as reported and 24% under ASC 605. Unbilled deferred revenue increased to $412 million. I want to note that the adoption of ASC 606 also required a change to the definition of unbilled deferred revenue to include certain early renewals. We\u2019re not breaking out the two components, but the overwhelming majority of unbilled deferred revenue still relates to the move to annual billings with our large EBA customers.","Q1 operating cash flow was slightly negative expected. As we move through the year, we expect operating cash flow to turn back positive and remain there. With the significant price appreciation, our stock since the earnings report, we did not trigger the opportunistic buying within our stock repurchase program. In Q1, we bought back roughly 200,000 shares at an average price of $113.31. As always, we remain committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.","And lastly, before we get to the business outlook, we\u2019re pleased to have reached another milestone in the transition with the return to non-GAAP profitability. It\u2019s important to note that with this milestone, about 3 million shares are added back into the non-GAAP diluted share count, and this has already factored into our guidance for the quarter and the year. It\u2019s important to note that non-GAAP earnings per share under ASC 605 and Absent ASC 340, which is what requires the capitalization of commissions, would have been $0.16, a significant uptick in earnings as we continue along the transition.","Now I\u2019ll turn the discussion to our outlook and I\u2019ll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains mostly unchanged from the last few quarters with two markets performing relatively well and emerging markets showing improvement although we are watching the emerging markets closely.","As you know, we launched a significant restructuring last November, which was really a rebalancing of our investment areas. This touched our entire global organization, especially around changes we made with our sales team and the move to increase our direct touch business. Overall, we\u2019re really product of the results we achieved in Q1, and are confident that we\u2019ll see the benefit from the changes we\u2019ve made as we move through the year.","As we look at our outlook for Q2, we expect to see sequential increases in most metrics, including billings, ARR, ARPS, revenue, spend, profitability and subscription additions. The better than expected profitability in Q1 was primarily related to not meeting our hiring projections during the quarter. We expect the hiring rev to increase in Q2, and as such, expect our sequential spend to increase more than usual.","Also note that, we\u2019re now required to capitalize commission cost and amortize them back into our operating expense versus expensing them as incurred, which we did previously. This will have the effect of leveling off our commission costs and will change our historical spend patterns throughout the year.","We remain confident in our previous guidance for fiscal 2019. But want to note that we provided full-year guidance for billings under ASC 606, which we have not provided earlier. The initial impact of the adoption of ASC 606 reduced previously deferred revenue on the balance sheet and consequently reduces calculated billings. This update is not driven by a change in our underlying business and you can see there is no change to our 605 billing guidance. And again, it has no impact on cash flow or subscriptions.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hey, thanks, guys, for taking my question and congrats on a good start for the year. Really want to focus in on ARPS, because that upsided again this quarter versus what the Street was looking for. When I\u2019m really zone in on things, it looks like that core number that you mentioned really drove that more than anything.","Why don\u2019t you just help us through sort of the flow of the year, because obviously, there are lots of moving parts, and Scott, I know you just said just think about ARPS subsequently. But as you think about Q2, Q3, Q4, what are the puts and takes to keep driving that ARPS up here, because obviously, some it\u2019s mixed, some of these promotions, et cetera, maybe kind of walk us through that? And then I just have a quick follow-up?","Andrew Anagnost","Sure, Phil. The first thing \u2013 if you remember the factors that I talked about that will drive ARPS from back in our Investor Day, all those come and play and actually increasingly so throughout the year. So the first is grow renewal base, which has a higher net to us, right? We talked about \u2013 there\u2019s a lesser channel margin and renewals and there is on net new sales. Now the renewal base gets bigger, that equates to us as a higher ARPS. We\u2019ll sell more direct.","And frankly, a lot of the changes that we put in place as a result of the rebalancing, the restructuring that we announced back at the beginning of Q4 are increasing our direct touch across the sales force. So as direct goes up, we get a higher yield out of our direct sales.","The next step function in the pricing on M2S comes into play more and more as the year goes on, right? As we sell those conversions, they go into deferred revenue and they accrete out through the year. So I think it\u2019s a little bit of a dampened effect, it doesn\u2019t happen as sharply as it did in the past. And just ongoing less promotional activity and you\u2019ve seen us have slightly less promotional activity, those are the trends. And so we do expect to see sequential increase in ARPS certainly next quarter and ARPS end the year at a higher point than it ends next quarter.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Awesome. And then follow-up to Andrew on your comments there about them and penetrating into the construction market. We\u2019ve seen over the past 12 to 18 months here and as recently just think about a month ago some consolidation in the construction management software market. How do you think about Autodesk positioning in there? Where are their natural adjacencies versus things that you\u2019d actually just partner up with people for.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So, we\u2019ve said over and over again, we intend to go deep on the entire process. We do believe just like what\u2019s happened in manufacturing where the model has become the record of the entire process. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen in the construction space as well. So we intend to touch every piece of that process.","We\u2019ll do some of that organically with internal development. We\u2019ll do some of that inorganically. But we intend to touch just about every part of that process. We\u2019ll probably stayed clear of the ERP right side of the business. But every other part of it from preconstruction all the way to field operations. We\u2019re going to be involved. We really are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. How are you?","Andrew Anagnost","Hey, Saket, good. How are you?","Saket Kalia","Good, good. Hey, first, maybe for you, Andrew, and thanks for reminding us about the collections impact on that net ad number. Typically, we would see a seasonal uptick from the EBAs we sold in Q4 that get turned on in Q1. So just to confirm, did we see that bump, but maybe that\u2019s perhaps getting hidden by some of the collection impact and the flushing out of the BIM 360 team item that you\u2019ve spoken? And relatedly, when do you think we see the impacts of those perhaps normalize, if that makes sense?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. So Saket, let me try to break \u2013 address the question a little bit and then I\u2019m going to let Scott dig in on the EBA subs a little bit, too. I\u2019m going to just go a little high-level here. So first off, the number of \u2013 the net ads we saw is what we expected to see, right? So we\u2019re seeing what we expect to see and I want to peel it back a little bit and then I\u2019m going to let Scott comment a little bit more.","So when you peel it back, right, we broke out core and cloud on purpose. And what you see is a very significant decline in what\u2019s happening with the cloud subscriptions. And that\u2019s to be expected that\u2019s exactly what we were telegraphing to you and exactly how we modified some of the things.","The other thing that you also see is in the core side, you\u2019re seeing an ongoing continual growth of the core net ads, right? But there is a difference in how the EBAs kind of rolled in this year into the core and I\u2019m going to let Scott comment on that real quick.","Scott Herren","Yes, Saket, and just to be super clear, I think you know this. We still added cloud subs, net added cloud subs during the quarter. We just aren\u2019t adding with the same way we did a year ago.","On the EBA business, if you remember back in Q3, we had a really strong Q3 of last year in EBAs. So what normally happens is, we sell the majority of our EBAs during Q4 and then we count those monthly active users nine days later and we get a big slug of additional EBA subs in Q1.","Last year, we actually had a strong Q3 in addition to a strong Q4. So we saw \u2013 we\u2019ve seen some of the lead back from the EBA sales already coming in, into Q4 and then slightly lesser amount as the quarter-to-quarter impact going from Q4 to Q1.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Got it, that makes sense. Maybe for my follow-up for you Scott. Just to the costs out of equation, really nice decrease in the cost of goods sold driving one of the higher gross margins that I think we\u2019ve seen. The question is, is this coming from sort of the right-sizing of the cost structure that we\u2019ve done last year, of course, I\u2019m sure part of it\u2019s related to no more perpetual sales. And how sustainable, I guess, are these levels? Just a little more color on that, that nice cost of goods sold that will be helpful?","Scott Herren","Yes, yes thanks for that question. And you\u2019re right, it is a nice trend on gross margins. There\u2019s a couple of things driving that. One is, as we\u2019ve gone through and become more focused in certain areas and we went through several divestments and that has \u2013 that\u2019s accreted some benefit into our cost of goods sold.","The second is, we have also been really active with the channel taking a lot of what previously was consulting business that we had done and having \u2013 giving the intellectual property, giving the best practices for the channel and having BIM deliver a lot of that. They can do it at a higher margin frankly, that they can make on product mark up. For us, that\u2019s a lower-margin business.","So we pushed a lot of the consulting business outside of the big EBAs, where the customers really want us in there to our channel partners. It\u2019s a win for them and it\u2019s a win for us. And that few I think has contributed to a lot of that improving gross margin and reduced COGS.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Yes, and I wanted to follow-up a little bit on Saket\u2019s question about the collections versus the suites that you would have sold. Is there any sense to give us or any way to give us a sense of the type of \u2013 we still get a lot of questions about what that \u2013 how that might be impacting the actual sub number in the quarter? And I know it might be hard. But if there\u2019s anyway to think about maybe the average number of products, the collections people are using versus, say, before if there is anyway to kind of have a rule of thumb? I know it wouldn\u2019t be perfect.","And then I want to \u2013 just touch on one other thing, which is in relation to piracy, which I know you guys have always kind of been focused on and trying to cut back on. But I was wondering if there was anything regarding piracy in the quarter \u2013 piracy reduction in the quarter that, that might have helped? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Right. So I\u2019ll start. There\u2019s no real magic rule of thumb on the collections consolidation. Last quarter, we tried to give you a really nice example that kind of showed you the extreme case of what can happen in terms of the consolidation and not that what \u2013 when we talked about the engineering service company in Canada and gave you that example. So I encourage you to go back and look at that example, because that is a common scenario, it does happen. But I don\u2019t have a rule of thumb for you with that respect.","Now on your second question, but one thing I will say is, we expect the effect of consolidation to continue in kind of a consistent manner as we move forward through the next few quarters, all right?","Scott Herren","Yes, Heather, if I could just add to that. You\u2019re familiar with that example, it was 42 \u2013 it was a company that had 42 individual products on maintenance, consolidated at the point they moved from maintenance-to-subscription consolidated down to 20 and, in fact, 19 collections in one AutoCAD subscription and in the process of \u2013 so their sub count went from 42 to 20 and the process of that their ARR went up more than 10%, right?","So it\u2019s one of the reasons why I think focusing less on subs. The subs are not relevant by any stretch. But focusing less on the sub count and more on the outcome, which is the growth of ARR is going to make sense for this quarter and then actually as we as we look ahead.","Andrew Anagnost","Just not to drive this home. Remember, the result we saw as far as the result we expected and we\u2019re not changing our outlook for the year. So we\u2019re seeing what we expect given all the factors we see that \u2013 in the business and the things that watch. So we\u2019re actually feeling pretty good about the outcome right now.","Now with regard to your question about piracy, I sometimes feel like everybody expects like some quarter I\u2019m going to declare 50,000 net subscriber ads for piracy in the score. You might be waiting a long time to hear that declaration. This move with regard to how we address non-paying users in our market. It\u2019s an ongoing process basically keeping the run rate at a relatively nice clip quarter-after-quarter after quarter well beyond even the FY 2020 goals. That\u2019s what some of the companies that have engaged in this like Adobe and Microsoft has seen it\u2019s been an ongoing return to the business.","So we have done some new things this quarter. We rolled out the in-product messaging, the pirate in AutoCAD and we\u2019re going to roll that out worldwide as time progresses. We\u2019ve also let up some things in our sales force with new lead regeneration and new team. But there\u2019s no like headline around how piracy gets added into our business. It\u2019s going to be one of these thing that actually maintains the business as we move forward. And like I said many times before, pirates don\u2019t declare themselves at the door. So it\u2019s very difficult to complement the stuff.","Heather Bellini","I appreciate it. Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Heather.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, first for you and then follow-up for Scott. So the question is, as your business has evolved over the last number of years, both in terms of technology and model and channel and so forth and externally two for that matter. How are you thinking differently if at all about the leading indicators of the business? In other words, for a long time, we were told that LT was perhaps the broadest indicator of the business if we go back far enough, let\u2019s say, a decade, even indications that civil of all things was an indicator for the business or [indiscernible] see.","So in that respect maybe you could talk about how you are thinking about leading indicators? And then the follow-up at the Analyst Meeting, Steve talked about a couple of changes you\u2019re making with respect to the channel moving an account-based approach that you are taking from EBAs into the mid-market. And then similarly, this year you\u2019re going from paying for actions for like activation and onboarding to next year you\u2019re going to go to more pain for outcomes usage and adoption. So maybe you could update us on the progress you\u2019re making in terms of those evolutions vis-\u00e0-vis the channel?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. So Jay I\u2019ll start with the first question. We are absolutely starting to look at leading indicators differently. I think in the past it would have been easy to pin a particular product as a leading indicator. I think the way we\u2019re kind of framing this as we look forward, it\u2019s really this idea of the low-end of our business, the VSB business, the chunk that comes in from what we call very small businesses. That is the indicator moving forward that we will watch as a leading indicator in terms of economic activity. Classically, that space bought LT a lot.","Now because of the subscription transition, you\u2019re actually starting to see a mix in that base around what they actually buy, because the upfront costs are lower. So instead of pinning it to a particular product what we\u2019re doing more and more is we\u2019re looking at that VSB segment and tracking its behavior. It just so happens that that segment is more likely to buy direct from us in the East or in any other segment.","So I would actually say in terms of leading indicators although we haven\u2019t actually institutionalized all this yet. We have more knowledge and more access to some of these leading indicators as we move fully to the subscription transition. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it moving forward, Jay.","Scott Herren","And Jay on the second part of your question around the changes that Steve talked about at Investor Day, but I would say, it\u2019s still really early days. I think that, if you peel back the strategy behind that, it is about driving more direct touch. First of all, with the mid-market account base. So field-based account level assigned salespeople below the named account here that we already have, that will be settled with the channel by the way that.","So I have direct touch with outside channel partners involved. We are increasing the levels for we\u2019ve got in our inside sales, which are going to as a direct touch play. And they talked about the formation of a new group called customer success. And the customer success team is all about driving adoption internally also through the channel and we\u2019ve built incentives and our channel partners incentive program around driving adoption, the first-half of this year we\u2019ll get more refined at next year.","So the customer success team and the channel incentives are around adoption as opposed to just making sure that they get the sale done. So a lot of \u2013 I expect to see a lot of uptick in both our \u2013 the engagement, the direct customer engagement that we have. And I think we\u2019ll see some of the benefits of that really begin to come into play in the second-half of this year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Jay.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg. Your line is now open.","Gal Munda","Hey, thanks for taking my question. The first one is just on the \u2013 I heard about some of the changes that have been rolled out in terms of the U.S. sales, especially when we\u2019re talking about the discounting philosophy in terms of the channel. Can you talk a bit more about that? And do you think that, that had any impact on in terms of how the net new ads played out in the quarter maybe in terms of how the channel is prepared for that? And could that take maybe a quarter or two for them to get onboard with it?","Andrew Anagnost","So first off, I just want to make sure I clarify what you\u2019re asking about, Gal. We do some margin changes in the U.S. specifically related to AutoCAD LT and AutoCAD that had absolutely no impact on the volume in the U.S. markets whatsoever. It certainly is accretive to our total realization of the business, because of the new idea pushes more business to the e-store and actually allows us to make more on LT had absolutely no impact on volume at all. And these changes are going to be captivating through Europe and APAC this quarter and into the next quarter. And we don\u2019t \u2013 we simply do not expect any impact on volumes.","Gal Munda","So that should impact \u2013 so that should actually be beneficial to that price realization?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, we expect the outcome here to be beneficial in terms of price realization.","Scott Herren","On the LT piece. And frankly, part of the goal there too is to focus channel and selling the higher-value products, right? I think one of the places the channel can add the most value is moving upstream either to the \u2013 one AutoCAD or up in the collections.","Gal Munda","Okay, perfect. And can we just talk a bit about the cloud and ARPS and how maybe just the comment on the churn on the core churn on the cloud what you talk, you obviously don\u2019t disclose that directly. But just in terms of the trends now if you\u2019re being slightly on one side basically saying, you\u2019re being slightly more cautious about the pricing, I\u2019m not trying to support that. On the other side, we\u2019re still seeing ARPS trending down in cloud. So how can we reconcile those data points maybe if you can just help us understand that would be very helpful?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so there\u2019s kind of two effects. So there\u2019s actually three effects here in many respect. So the first effect is, as we told you previously, we\u2019ve rotated away from some of these really low-end down-market type ARPS that I mean application that we were selling BIM 360 team application. They\u2019ve rolled up into the consolidated suite. Those continue to churn out of the run rate. And that\u2019s fully expected. We actually expect that we\u2019re not we\u2019re not chasing those, okay. The other thing is, in terms of the new pass we sell lots of user packs. So, a company might set by a 1,000-user pack into their project space that that number of users obviously starts to go over the ARPS over time.","However, it\u2019s really good for the business, because basically what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re buying future capacity. So, they\u2019re buying and expanding into our bucket with what they\u2019re purchasing. In another respect too, especially on the ARR side. The ARR side for cloud right now doesn\u2019t actually reflect a full ARR impact of say BIM 360 right now, because so much of it is contained within the EBAs that\u2019s one of the reasons why I made that point about 50% of the monthly active use coming from EBA customers for BIM 360.","That ARR sits in the enterprise ARR and not in the cloud ARR and that has \u2013 that also has an impact on how these numbers roll out. I think one of the things that you did in terms of looking at this in the short-term. Remember the core is going to drive the big ARR outcomes over the next 18 to 24 months. So, we want to pay a little bit attention, more attention to that. And these trends that we\u2019re talking about would settle up. Scott you want to add anything.","Scott Herren","Nothing so.","Gal Munda","Perfect. Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Gal.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen. Your line is now open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay thank you very much. Scott, ARR were certainly strong as you point to but it was a little surprising that he made it into plan ARPS declined by $24 sequentially. And I just want to clarify a comment from your prepared remarks, would you say that the decline there was entirely due to the linearity of the M2S sign of activity?","Scott Herren","Yes, it\u2019s not entirely them Gregg, but it is largely based on not just the linearity just based on M2S. There is a 605 to 606 impact in maintenance as well. So, as we implemented 606 at the beginning of this quarter we wrote off a fair amount of previously deferred revenue. Some of that hit the maintenance line and of course that then becomes headwind on ARPS.","Gregg Moskowitz","Got it. And then Andrew you hear that example I believe of Myron construction and that was helpful, but when you look out at the construction vertical. When do you expect that your enhanced focus on the mid-market will begin to really show up in the numbers?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, well I think what you\u2019ll start to see is, we start to penetrate the mid-market you\u2019re seeing more and more of these pack start to get sold. And I think that\u2019s the pack absolutely target the mid market. So, I don\u2019t I\u2019m not going to give you a specific timeline in terms of when you\u2019ll start to see more robust growth in the mid-markets, but what I can say is our focus has been the top of the pyramid for almost the entire existence of BIM 360. And it\u2019s only now that we\u2019re starting to move deeper into the mid-market and these early successes, frankly driven by some of the successes we\u2019ve had up market are indicative of what I expect you\u2019ll see over the next few quarters as we start to penetrate the mid-market more and more.","Gregg Moskowitz","Great. Thank you.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Gregg.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","Thanks for taking the question. Could you give us a sense for the blended maintenance price increase you realized in a quarter and then some of the moving pieces we should consider around maintenance ARR for the remainder of the year?","Scott Herren","Yes, it\u2019s hard to do that on a blended level Ken, I mean you can see the ARPS and you can calculate the ARPS, and we do provide you the details to be able to sort out the 605 impact, as well as the M2S impacts. So, you can see it in aggregate. I\u2019d say on an apples-to- apples same maintenance before to say maintenance after it\u2019s really just the 5% price increase up until the beginning of this quarter that was put in place as part of the M2S program. And as you know beginning of this quarter that maintenance price went up apples-to-apples 10%. So, it\u2019s \u2013 you the blending shows up in the ARPS. And I think when you dig through the prepared remarks you\u2019ll see enough detail to be able to peel out the effects of both 606 and M2S.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And could you talk about the uptake you saw in multi-year product subscriptions in the quarter. And your expectations for the remainder of the year?","Scott Herren","Yes, we\u2019re not doing anything right now Ken to incent multi-year product subs as it\u2019s back to part of the presentation that I gave at Investor Day. Now, we are seeing some multi-year activity in that. We really haven\u2019t done anything to incentivize it. So it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s kind of turning a lot of that double-digit rate that have been. I do expect to see that pick up later this year and into next year, but we\u2019re not \u2013 at this point, we\u2019re not doing anything to really encourage that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","Thanks. I\u2019ll change it up from a model building question to a product question. Look, we talked to some of your customers and they agreed that this kind of generative design stuff is a big improvement over like what used to be called the topological optimization. So basically, the question is, should we think of this generative functionality as an incremental to ARPS, increment to customer counts, reduce churn, all three, or \u2013 and then I would assume that it would take probably a year or two before we kind of get any kind of measurable ramp in financials, just that would be helpful? Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Well, Richard, that is definitely not a boring question. So look, I don\u2019t want to dilute the part of the answer. But the \u2013 almost all of the above are true in some respects.","Richard Davis","Okay.","Andrew Anagnost","So, for instance, some of what you\u2019re seeing with our Fusion Ultimate roll out of the generative capability is included in the ultimate subscription, but buried inside the ultimate subscription is a allocation of consumption that\u2019s built into subscription. So there\u2019s an amount of consumption that is available to the user.","Once that consumption is burned down if like, for instance, if they were a massive generative user and they just kept generating designs over and over again. They\u2019re going to have to reload that consumption outside of their normal subscription. That kind of blending that, that you saw in Fusion Ultimate, that\u2019s the way you\u2019re going to see some of these things roll out into our business.","There will be some level access to generative capabilities, because remember the \u2013 this is a \u2013 this is an AI driven supercomputing type application delivered to the customer, because we can do it with a low price of compute from the cloud.","So we\u2019re going to blend some of it in. So it will be accretive in subscriptions in terms of the fact that it just redefines us in the market and it makes us more competitive. And you can see we\u2019re already seeing some of the impacts of that, the positive impact, and then you\u2019ll see also people will be buying more consumption in the future if they buy more outcomes from the generative results. So it\u2019s kind of all three, but I hope that gives you a little bit more color on why it\u2019s sort of all three.","Richard Davis","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Hopefully, that would help.","Richard Davis","That was great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. The first question on the ARR side, under ASC 606, you posted 22% ARR growth, target is 29% at the midpoint. So to achieve that it seems ARPS for the next three quarters will have to ramp significantly now, of course, I\u2019m comparing 605 with 606, because last year we have only 605 numbers. So ARPS is 5% year-over-year in Q1, it seems like they will have to ramp to like low teens by the end of the year. So maybe could you talk about factors that it could lead to the ramp in AutoCAD.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Monika, first of all, I think the way you need to think about the growth in Q1 is really back \u2013 to make it apples-to-apples back to the 605, which is \u2013 which was 25% in Q1, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 honestly, it\u2019s a great result. Looking ahead, it\u2019s not ARPS, that\u2019s going to grow, right? We\u2019ve talked about what the subscription count looks like. We\u2019ve got \u2013 there\u2019s some improving ARPS for all the reasons that we\u2019ve talked about, but we also have sub count going up. But it\u2019s the combination of both of those that drives the ARR growth out through the end of the year.","So separate the one-time effect, and by the way, the effect of 606 is greatest in Q1. If you noticed, that\u2019s why in the prepared remarks, we try to give you both sets of numbers, so you can trend it out. But it was almost the 40 \u2013 a little bit more than a $40 million hit to ARPS just driven by the implementation of 606 in Q1. That diminishes out through the year. So there\u2019s a little bit of a \u2013 of an exaggerated effect in Q1 just driven by the one-time write-down of the deferred revenue caused by 606.","Monika Garg","Got it. Thanks, helpful. And then just strong growth in all the geographies, but revenue growth was kind of lowest in Americas compared with other geo is 13% in Americas there greater than 20% in all other geographies. Maybe could you kind of walk through the reasons? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Well, so Americas saw double-digit growth. So we saw a very strong number in the Americas. So I don\u2019t really look at it as weaker growth. I think, one of the things that you need to understand about the Americas is, they\u2019re way ahead on the M2S program relative to other geographies. Other geographies are just starting to ramp up on the M2S program and in some respects, we\u2019re even behind in a subscription transition. So, Americas is where it should be at this point in the cycle. And I think it was a really great result for the Americas. You want to add anything, Scott?","Scott Herren","No, I think you said it right. The only other small thing I would point to is, Americas has been one of the toughest compare point year-on-year. They have the strongest Q1 last year. So that\u2019s a little bit of a factor, but 11% growth even with 606 and 13% growth on an apples-to-apples basis is pretty good growth.","Monika Garg","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Zane Chrane","Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question. It seems like the subscription transition in the business small change is solidly on track. But I want to dive a little bit more into the second pillar of your five-year strategy via the company\u2019s efforts to their own internal digital transformation. Could you give us an update on how that\u2019s going? And you talked about AVA the Autodesk Virtual Assistance at your Analyst Day and highlighted that. Aside from that example, could you maybe give a couple of other examples of initiatives that you\u2019re working on as part of that second pillar?","And then lastly, it seems like there\u2019s probably a multi-year efforts. I\u2019m wondering how we should think about the timing in which we would start to see maybe cost reduction or operating leverage or incremental revenue opportunities created by this internal digitization effort? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Okay. So let me give you some color on some of the things we\u2019re working on with regard to digitization. So first off, we\u2019ve actually rolled out the AVAs capabilities in other areas of support to our customers. So we continue to evolve that capability simply to make it easier. The satisfaction levels and capability are pretty high, because it just solves the problem very quickly. AVA is very good at some of these things.","The other area we\u2019re \u2013 that we\u2019re looking at is, what we like to call the administrator or CAD manager persona. I think administrator is probably a better word. This is the person that has to actually manage all the assets somebody owns from Autodesk and make sure the right user gets the right access to the right kind of capabilities.","What we\u2019re doing is, we\u2019re doing a set of ongoing capability dumps, very much targeted at this particular buyer and our customers are going to find it fairly liberating capability as it matures over the next few quarters, because it just allow them to understand what they\u2019re using, who\u2019s using what and actually respond more quickly and self-service ways to, hey, add a seat, do some of these things.","So you\u2019ll start to see incremental kind of direct-to-customer engagement when some of these capability matures. In the second-half of the year, we\u2019ll actually start doing some major cut overs as we start removing all of our orders that come into system into our new back-office, which actually is what powered our e-store, which has a much more robot, simple, seamless, manageable experience than what they get through our current partner system.","So the partner orders are going to start coming through that same system as we move into the end of this year and into the beginning of next year. All these things are actually pretty big, heavy-lifting projects, but they make a big difference in terms of what the customer is able to do on their own, including our ability to recommend things to them.","The other thing we\u2019re doing on the digital back-end is, we\u2019re providing simpler front ends and more intelligence to our inside sales teams. So our inside sales teams are now able to see more about what\u2019s going on with the customer and actually take actions quicker in terms of satisfying the customer in the moment. That\u2019s already starting to pay real dividends to the company in terms of renewal activities, in terms of our ability to up-sell and cross-sell an account and actually in terms of our ability to help people move from maintenance-to-subscription when they call in and work with some of our insight teams.","We\u2019re seeing those benefits right now. Those are going to continue to ramp up throughout the year. But you also see more benefits next year with customers simply up-sell and cross-sell themselves, because we\u2019re going to start recommending things to them over their account management tool. So that gives you a little bit insight into some of those things and some of the potential upside benefits that we\u2019re going to start to see from there.","Zane Chrane","And it\u2019s perfect that\u2019s really helpful. And just really quickly, I wanted to verify that it is the correct assumption that we should only expect ARR rather than subs and ARPS starting in fiscal 2020, is that correct?","Andrew Anagnost","Well, we haven\u2019t formalized that, Zane, but that\u2019s certainly where I think we need to get through. I think there has been a outside focus externally on subs. What we\u2019re really trying to drive is, of course, ARR and cash flow. And the way you get there, I\u2019m not saying subs are relevant, they\u2019re not. Subs are important, we\u2019ll obviously continue to track that.","But I think like we\u2019ve seen others who have gone through this transition get to a point where focusing just on the subs count as opposed to focusing on the outcome and the result is distracting and I think we are probably pressing that point as well, and so it\u2019s entirely possible that when we get the next year we will stop talking about subs externally, perhaps just the once a year update at Investor Day as opposed to the focus we put on in each of our calls.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. You line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Shankar on for Kash. Just on the legacy users you\u2019ve mentioned that some of them upgraded to collections. Can you comment on what they were using before and have you kind of tracked the usage trends as they upgrade to collection, like what do they use after they upgrade to collections?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Shankar, what we are a seeing is a pretty significant uptake as we talked about more than 30% that are moving from a single product to collections. Once they make that shift, of course they have access to anything that is in the collection. So, what they are actually using is much more dependent on the persona, on the person and on market they are on. I am not sure there is good rule of thump for you to go by on that. I think the underlying theme though that is driving that is we\u2019ve put a lot of focus on making those collections simple to consume, easier to select which one they want, easier to sell, and frankly a price point that is attractive both for us and driving up our ARPS before our customers and getting greater value, and we are seeing great success with that.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then just a question on the BIM side, can you comment on the competitions which you seeing, especially from Pro 4 and can I compare, the strategy you have is to provide the end-to-end solution, but from a customer perspective is what your competition providing is that sufficient or do they kind of, in a wait and see mode on what you are doing and when they expect to get on to your platform. Just want to understand on that front?","Scott Herren","By the way Pro 4 is a great competitor. I think they have a great product and I think they have shown early success in the mid-market. We compete with them all the time in the high-end of the market. We\u2019re much more successful there and I expect that to continue. Long term it is not so much who the competitors are in the ecosystem. I want to take this back to what is actually going to happen over the next five years.","The big driver here is the move of the BIM data through the entire process. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. What you\u2019ve seen over time in the manufacturing space is, the companies that we\u2019re providing access to the models ultimately owned the end-to-end process in terms of the optimization in the software to digitize that process. This is going to happen as well in the construction space. The long-term trend is the building information model, is the communication vehicle that passes through the various stage of the construction process.","We\u2019re very much focused on that long-term outcome and the reason you\u2019re starting to see us consolidate our position more and more in the larger accounts and start to move mid-market is people are actually trying to use our tools to do the now problem. But they see that we are also focused on the then problem, the future problem, and that\u2019s really more of a dynamic we\u2019re paying attention to. We have some great competitors in this space. Love competing with them. They make us all better, but the long game swings in our favor.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Thanks. Hi guys. I was just curious. How much of the maintenance to subscription conversions are taking place through direct sales versus the e-store versus the channel?","Andrew Anagnost","Well Sterling, the short answer is, I don\u2019t know. Well it is not available on the e-store at this point. I think we\u2019re just enabling that either this quarter or next. So, it\u2019s all happening either direct or through the channel, but I don\u2019t actually have that split in my fingertips.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then just quick follow-up. I wasn\u2019t clear you mentioned the promotional activity a couple of times. How should we think about the impact, go back a couple of quarters, talked about the renewals from that early promotional activity and what it did to the net additions. What was the impact this quarter from that phenomena?","Andrew Anagnost","Well most of those early promos, if you are a member were multi-year. Right. So, the \u2013 if you\u2019re talking about the legacy promos that we ran, is that what you are referring to, where we went after legacy customers with a discounted price if they turned in an old perpetual license?","Sterling Auty","Well not only that but I think there is the cloud promos as well in terms of where you are bundling in some of the cloud seats.","Andrew Anagnost","Got it. So, let\u2019s take them in two cases because it is two different things. On the legacy promos, for the first two years that we ran those promos, ran them twice a year for the first two years and in each case the discount was tied to, A, the customer forfeiting their perpetual license, and buying a sub; B, for those first few years it was a multi-year buy. They paid for three years upfront. So, none of them have come up for renewal at this point, but the last two times we ran we did give them the option of a single year and we haven\u2019t seen any of those come up for renewal at this point.","On the cloud side, it is a different answer, right? This was the shift that we talked about back in November when we were announcing our Q3 of last year results and we really moved away from very deep promotions as I called it seeding promotions where we really pushed a lot of low cost cloud subs out into the market with the goal of seeing, which ones that would land and with the understanding that many of them would not be put into use and if they were put into use they wouldn\u2019t be renewed that headwind we still deal with, right. We did that, we ran through those seeding programs. We continued with that seeding program strategy in both Q1 and Q2 of last year.","So, that\u2019s a headwind that we\u2019re feeling right now as many of those come due and if they didn\u2019t they weren\u2019t being adopted, they\u2019re not being used. So, that\u2019s part of why you see the cloud we\u2019re still adding net subs to our cloud business. But you see those cloud net adds coming down.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matthew Hedberg","Hey, thank guys. Thanks for the question. I guess as a follow-up to the question on collections a couple questions ago here, you are clearly having success there providing a lot of value. And I guess I\u2019m wondering can you help us think about customer satisfaction when they move to a collection. And I guess in the context of thinking about maintaining renewal rates on some of these collections come up for renewal and likely price points move higher. Is it function of continuing to provide additional value, I\u2019m sure you want to just need kind of your high-level thoughts there?","Andrew Anagnost","And so first of let me correct a misstatement you made that the price points don\u2019t go up. When they move to collections as part of M2S they\u2019re actually capturing a highly advantaged price. But they\u2019re actually paying more at that moment of move, all right. So, let\u2019s be very clear here. When the renewal comes up, they\u2019re paying the same price that they paid when they move to M2S, super important. There\u2019s no price increase clip that they\u2019re going to see.","Now, if you\u2019re talking about at the end of the M2S program when they \u2013 their three-year period runs out and they do see that price increase Well one that\u2019s a couple years out. There\u2019s a couple of things that we\u2019re doing to ensure satisfaction. First off, our experience in suites shows that if a customer uses two application they\u2019re highly satisfied with what they get from these aggregated applications. It\u2019s really just to two applications that drive satisfaction. We\u2019ve actually stood up a whole new team inside our sales organization that the customers success organization and its mission is to help customers extract value from some of these higher end offerings that we\u2019ve deployed into the market.","So, they\u2019re spending a lot of energy helping customers understand what they own, how they can use the products together. And what return they get from using the products together. So, I think we\u2019ve got a real focus on this and history says from our suites experience that these are very, very sticky offerings. Do you want to add something?","Scott Herren","No, the only other point I\u2019d make on collections and customer sat as we do see the highest renewal rates of all of our product subs on the collections.","Matthew Hedberg","That\u2019s super helpful and that that\u2019s exactly what I was going to trying to get at, not necessarily these initial price increases, but not more so upon looking two to three years up, but I think that\u2019s a great way to think about it. And I think it\u2019s a super helpful\u2026","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, they\u2019re very sticky. The suites were very sticky, the collections were very sticky that has been something we\u2019ve seen consistently.","Matthew Hedberg","Okay. Thanks, well done guys. Thanks.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s Q&A session. And I\u2019d like to return the call to Mr. Dave Gennarelli for any closing remarks.","David Gennarelli","That does conclude our call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Abhey Lamba, VP of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Abhey Lamba","Thanks, operator , and good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2019. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast.

I am excited to share with you our impressive close to fiscal 2019 and the strong momentum we experienced closing the year. Consistent with the prior two quarters, we experienced strong personal performance across all geographic regions and in all product categories. ","In fiscal 2019, we achieved multiple milestones putting us in an excellent position to deliver on our fiscal 2020 targets and advance the company to the next chapter of growth. Here are some of the key accomplishments we achieved this year. Recurring revenue was 95% of total revenues for the full year and has reached a steady state. Our total revenues of nearly $2.6 billion were the highest ever in the company's history.","Our total subscription plan subs are now greater than total maintenance subs were at the peak of the prior model. We returned to positive free cash flow and earnings, we significantly expanded our operating margin and we strengthened our construction portfolio and now have an unrivaled breadth of construction solutions. Beyond that, I couldn't be prouder of the Autodesk team that delivered these results. They worked hard and they deserve all the credit and it\u2019s my honor to represent them.","Now before I dig deeper into our successes in the quarter let me take a step out and revisit the five key priorities I laid out for the company at the beginning of last year. Our top priority entering fiscal 2019 was the continued execution of the business model transition. We now have less than 20% of our revenues coming from maintenance agreements and I'm happy to report that we were effectively finished with the model transition and look forward to executing on our growth strategy.","We continue to invest in digitizing the company to provide our customers with a better experience as they grew through their own digital transformations, which is a recurring theme we hear from all of them. We have a focus on driving the building information model to the design and make process in AEC and during the year we highlighted a number of customer wins that are using BIM to manage their design and make processes in the AEC industry. We look forward to executing on that theme further in fiscal 2020 as BIM momentum remains strong.","We are continuing to invest in automating the process of design to manufacturing and we are seeing early signs of the conversions of construction and manufacturing processes. Looking at our Q4 performance we built upon the broad based strength over last couple of quarters by achieving 34% growth in annualized recurring revenue or ARR, which remains the most important metric for us. We are becoming a more strategic partner for all of our customers, but in particular for our larger customers, a fast reflected in the strong growth of our enterprise business.","Within product categories we continue to see greater adoption of industry collections in our BIM 360 solutions. In line with our expectations our free cash flow has accelerated in a meaningful way as our billings topped $1 billion for the first time in the fourth quarter. Scott will walk you through more of the financials, but I want to spend a little bit more time talking about our progress in various areas.","Expertise in our products remained in high demand and is growing rapidly, according to indeed hiring lab AutoCAD expertise is featured among the top 10 fastest growing skills and technology job searches. In addition according to Upwork\u2019s latest quarterly index Revit expertise is featured among the top 15 hardest skills for freelancers in the U.S. job market.","These are important indicators of the ongoing opportunity we have to grow our subscription base and to turn more and more of our users into subscribers. During the year, we strengthened the foundation of our construction business with both organic and inorganic investments. In addition to investing in our BIM 360 portfolio we purchased assemble systems to bolster our preconstruction capabilities, plan grid for document centric workloads and field execution and building connected for bidding and risk management. This year our focus is on integrating these businesses to deliver even greater value to our customers.","The broaden product portfolio will help us expand our presence with general contracts, sub-contractors and building owners. The feedback from our customers regarding these acquisitions has been overwhelmingly positive and they\u2019re excited about the expansion of our portfolio. For instance, Clayco a leading construction design firm based in Chicago has been an Autodesk customer for many years. As use of BIM 360, Assemble, PlanGrid and Building connective they have fully embraced the digitization of construction.","They rely on the breadth of our portfolio deliver value to their customers by automating their design and make activities throughout the preconstruction and construction processes. We look forward to strengthening our relationship with Clayco by investing in solutions that expand their workloads. Additionally, we see opportunities to expand our relationships with other leading companies in the space.","Beyond that BIM adoption remains one of the key drivers of investments in the infrastructure space. Mandates for using BIM drove another seven figured enterprise agreement with a large European infrastructure provider during the quarter. We doubled our contract with the customer as they look to expand the adoption of BIM for building and managing their infrastructure projects. Our unique portfolio design tools is allowing them to expand from products like AutoCAD and Inventor into Revit the world\u2019s leading BIM design tool. BIM 360 for site execution and other advanced analysis tools.","We look further to strengthening our partnership with them and many other organizations that are looking to rely on advanced technologies to drive efficiencies. On the manufacturing side generative design and our investments in Fusion continue to attract global manufacturing leaders to partner with us. During the quarter, we signed an enterprise agreement with Hyundai Motor Group who plans to leverage our technologies to create innovative designs. Hyundai is very interested in utilizing our capabilities in general design and we look forward to partnering with them to drive innovation in the automotive space.","In summary, I am extremely pleased with our fiscal 2019 performance and I'm excited about the future. We are entering fiscal 2020 with strong momentum in every geographic region and across all product categories. This sets us up well to achieve our target of $1.35 billion of free cash flow this year. We also expect to see acceleration in our construction business this year and beyond. When combined with continued execution in the quarter this will drive strong ARR growth into the future and help us reach our FY2023 goals.","Now, I'll turn it over to Scott for more details on the financials. ","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. Before digging into the numbers, I would echo Andrew\u2019s excitement entering fiscal 2020 as we are experiencing great momentum in our business driven by strong execution. Record billings of just over $1 billion in the quarter, coupled with better than expected cash collections drove free cash flow of $294 million. For the year, we ended up generating free cash flow of $310 million this kind of powerful leverage and the model drives our confidence in achieving our fiscal 2020 cash flow target.","Before discussing more detailed financial metrics for the quarter, let me highlight the impact of the fourth quarter acquisitions on our results. The acquisitions contributed $27 million to ARR, $7 millions to total revenue and $43 million to billings for the quarter. Recall that we calculate billings by adding the change in deferred revenue from the balance sheet to our reported revenues. The acquisition contributed $36 million to deferred revenue on the balance sheet, and $61 million to unbilled deferred for a combined contribution of $97 billion to total deferred revenue.","The acquisitions also increased our total expenses by $12 million, resulting in a negative impact of $5 million to our operating income or 85 basis points to our non-GAAP margin for the quarter. The acquisitions negatively impacted our non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03. Lastly, they contributed 127,000 subscriptions that are included within our recorded cloud and total subs numbers.","Please refer to the earnings slide deck on our website for more information on the contribution from acquisitions and our adjusted results for the quarter. And I'll discuss the remaining financial metrics excluding acquisitions as our fourth quarter 2019 guidance did not include their contributions.","Our Q4 ARR growth of 33% benefited from a 17% increase in total ARPS and 13% increase in subscriptions. Our strong performance across all product lines and geographic regions drove the results for the quarter. There was approximately 1 percentage point of benefits to the ARR growth related to upfront revenue recognition of some products such as VRED [ph] and Vault that do not incorporate substantial cloud services and are recognized up front.","Before I go into more details about our subs and ARPS, let me reiterate that this is the last time will be disclosing subs and ARPS on a quarterly basis. Going forward we will use events like our annual Investor Day to report on these metrics that will help you build your long-term models.","Looking at subscriptions, we grew total subscriptions by 13% to $4.2 million. In the quarter our subscription plan subs grew by 291,000, organically, led by growth in product subscriptions. We added 51,000 cloud subs driven by the continued adoption of them BIM 360 solutions. For core subscriptions or net additions of 74,000 were driven by strong adoption of our industry collections, which continue to grow as a percentage of net new products subs sold. Industry collections now represents approximately 28% of our total subscription install base.","Moving to the maintenance to subscription program or M2S. We continue to make solid progress. In Q4 our 110,000, customers migrated from maintenance to product subscriptions. We now converted nearly 800,000 maintenance customers to subscriptions since the inception of the program. ","Similar to the last few quarters, the conversion rate remains strong, with approximately one third of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions. Of those that migrated upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remain within the historical range of 25% to 35%. We expect the number of M2S interest migrations to moderate in fiscal 2020 as we have less than 800,000 maintenance subs remaining.","Maintenance renewal rates experienced the modest decline versus a year ago, which is as expected. Product subscription renewal rates ticked up year-over-year. Overall, we continue to experience very high renewal rates for M2S related subs and industry collections continue to command higher renewal rates. We expect the renewal rate for product subs to keep increasing as the product mix shifts towards higher value products.","Now, let's talk a little bit more about annualized revenue subscription ARPS. Total ARPS posted another quarter of strong growth as it continues to benefit from the same drivers we discussed at last year's Investor Day and that have manifested in the previous few quarters. ","These drivers include continued growth of the renewal base, which comes at a higher price to Autodesk, the increase in digital sales also at a higher net price to Autodesk, the product mix shifts industry collections, the maintenance price increase for those customers who don't take advantage of the M2S program, unless discounting and promotional activity. Contributions from our direct business raised by 2 points sequentially to 30%.","Our eStore which is like a bigger part of our digital sales grew by more than 50% in fiscal 2019. For the past 6 quarters, our eStore has generated over 20% of the new product subscriptions. Q4 also marked the 9th consecutive quarter of more than 30% growth in our enterprise business, demonstrating greater adoption within the largest customers. In fact, our EBAs posted over 60% revenue growth in the quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet, total deferred revenue grew 13%, which also includes the unbilled amount. Unbilled deferred revenue increased by $80 million sequentially to $530 million due to strong EBA performance. Our long-term deferred revenue post in sequential growth for the first time in the second quarter, driven by multi-year subscriptions, which we expect to normalize back toward historical norms during fiscal 2020 and beyond. ","While our stock repurchases slowed down in Q4 as we are conserving cash for the acquisitions. We used $293 million in fiscal year 2019 to repurchase 2.2 million shares at an average price of $130.15. We remain committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding overtime.","Now, I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. And I'll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains unchanged for the last few quarters and we continue to monitor the potential macroeconomic impact from Brexit and the various trade and tariff disputes. There have been some foreign exchange volatility, but our hedging program has succeeded in smoothing out the bigger swings. ","We are reiterating our fiscal 2020 free cash flow outlook of approximately $1.35 billion. Our across the board strength and momentum exiting fiscal 2019 will help us drive ARR growth in the range of 27% to 29%. On an organic basis, we expect our total non-GAAP expenses to grow by only 2%, while the acquisitions will drive another 7 points of growth. ","In line with our initial plans, we expect billings growth to accelerate to about 50% due to continued normalization of our multi-year billings, flow through from unbilled deferred, strengthen our renewals, new subscription growth and acquisitions.","Recall that our fiscal 2019 billings were negatively impacted due to the adoption of ASC 606 accounting standard, which combined with the recent acquisitions is offering a little over 10 percentage point tailwind to our billings growth in fiscal 2020. Looking at the quarterization of free cash flow for fiscal 2020 given normal seasonality and strength of payment collections and large deals signed in the fourth quarter, we expect about three-fourths of our free cash flow to be generated in the second half of the year. Lastly, the non-GAAP tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be 18% or a point lower than fiscal 2019. ","Looking at our guidance for the first quarter, our strength in the fourth quarter presents a tough sequential compare, given normal software seasonality, other revenue in Q1 is expected to be about half as much as we experienced in Q4. Normalizing for the upfront revenue recognition in the fourth quarter subscriptions and contributions from recent acquisitions our expected sequential change for the first quarter revenue growth is in line with our historical trends. Slide deck on our website has more details on modeling assumptions for the fiscal first quarter and full year 2020.","Before we start the Q&A part of the call, let me summarize by highlighting that fiscal 2019 was a year of milestones for us. We exiting the year with strong momentum in our free cash flow that drove our revenue growth plus free cash flow margin to 37% for the year. ","Going forward, we continue to focus on driving our free cash flows driven by ARR growth and margin expansion. I could not be prouder of the accomplishments of the Autodesk team and I want to acknowledge our fantastic employees, customers and partners around the world. We look forward to seeing most of you on our Analyst Day on March 28th where we'll discuss our plans in more details. ","Operator, we\u2019d now like to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Thanks guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close of the year. Andrew just wanted to focus in on the ton of business obviously Scott mentioned that your view of the economic conditions were still positive unchanged for the last couple of quarters. If you do drill down into the industries AEC manufacturing what's the feedback that you're hearing from customers about their spending intention, anything that you want to call out there? And then just one follow-up for Scott on that.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. All right, Phil thanks. Look like we said we're seeing strength across all the geographies and all the industries everyone's growing well, and everyone is signaling an intention to keep buying. So right now we don't see signs of a slowdown in anyone's purchasing activity. And we probably told you previously many times that we watch the AutoCAD and LT revenue streams fairly carefully to see if we see any signs those grew 36% year-over-year. So they're still robust and strong. So right now all the industries we look in Phil they're all showing signs of a continued growth. So nothing slowing down right now.","Scott Herren","Yes, Phil from a revenue standpoint AEC growth was 35% for the quarter, that\u2019s quite sequentially. So AEC has been strong for us all year continue to be strong manufacturing growth actually picked up from 20% in Q3 to 29% in the quarter we just closed. So we're seeing, if anything we're seeing in staying hard and get stronger.","Philip Winslow","Got you. And then Scott follow-up on your comments on ARPS just wonder if you could help us just kind of frame this coming fiscal year obviously you had a lot of positives in fiscal","2019 maintenance pricing M2S collections. How are you thinking about just ARPS this coming year and maybe kind of walk us through the puts and takes this year compared to fiscal 2019.","Scott Herren","Yes, so I think we'll continue to see the same trends that we\u2019ve seen in ARPS. The long-term drivers of our ARPS growth are still in place. That's the shift -- that continued shift to industry collections obviously drives on our subs we gave you some stats in the opening commentary that the industry collections are now 28% of our total product subscription base which is huge.","So that's driving ARPS subs I think that trend continues. We'll see higher net from a continuing growth in the renewal base and renewals come to us at higher net price. We\u2019ll see the continued shift to direct sales, which also comes to us at a higher price. And then smaller pricing changes and less discounting. So some of the core trends that we saw driving it and we talked about it last Investor Day and we saw it driving it this year. Those things will continue in the fiscal 2020.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just to shift gears to construction and start with you Andrew. Realizing it's still early for PlanGrid, can you just talk about how you're thinking about pricing strategies here down the road. I know that we've talked about the benefits of the per user model. But if I think about other packages like EBAs, which have been so successful as of late and think about potential with PlanGrid., I'm curious how you're thinking about PlanGrid pricing strategy with what you've learned with some of the innovations with Autodesk pricing strategy down the road?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Saket that's a really good question. I mean, I think you probably know that PlanGrid current pricing strategy is basically packets that have unlimited project access, unlimited number of sheets that are being accessed. So they have a nail gun, dozer and clean kind of purchase level. We have named user models. We also have a project based model and then we have the pay per use EBA model.","One of the things that's important to recognize about the construction ecosystem is projects involve multiple people participating on trying to create an outcome. And generally speaking, what people want to do is get as many people into the project using the software as possible. And they want to do it in a predictable and economical way. So you've seen lots of models being played within the space. ","One is the project based model where people charge you as a percent of the project value and every project they add, they keep charging you more. We found that model to be very problematic as you get deeper and deeper into your customers\u2019 business because the customers basically start to push back and this idea of paying more and more based on the number of projects you're putting into the ecosystem.","Named user bundles are attractive because you can essentially, pay charge discounted pricing for thousands of users at once. You'll probably see that showing up in the PlanGrid model moving forward. And you mentioned lastly, the notion of paper used pricing. So imagine being able to sign up for a project and just pay for what you use as you go along through the project. You'll probably see us start to experiment with those things as we move out in the later years. At the very least PlanGrid over a period of time, we'll start integrating with our EBA model. And our EBA customers will be able to do pay per use models.","So looking forward, start to imagine the plan grid models lining up with some of the models we already have and start seeing us looking at more kind of paper use type models as we move into bigger and bigger project ecosystems.","Saket Kalia","Got it, that's really helpful. And maybe on that same topic for you, Scott. Can you just remind us how the billings work for PlanGrid and BuildingConnected? And similarly how that could change over time just as those businesses become more integrated with Autodesk?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, initially with PlanGrid and BuildingConnected we're leaving the sales teams intact so we can maintain the momentum in each of those businesses. So they will flow and they will be consolidated obviously with our total results, but they'll flow in through their own sales teams. I expect to see -- for the full year I expect to see those billings come driving somewhere around the mid-single digits of our year-on-year billings growth.","So, it's a notable amount of billings growth for the year. The one exception to that is we will have the PlanGrid sales also incorporated to our named accounting, the people that sell on to our largest customers sell the EBAs. They'll also be selling PlanGrid. So a little bit it coming from our own sales team the remainder will continue to come through the sales teams that are there. And we are investing by the way to grow those sales teams post-acquisition.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini ","Great, thank you so much for taking the question. I had two just related to collections and then on the construction side. You guys have obviously seen a pretty steady mix shift over to collections skews and I'm just wondering if you could share a little bit with us, what's driving those conversions? And specifically, are you doing anything to help and sent that with maybe special promotions around collections? ","And is there any change in terms of the mix I think you used to say it would be expected it to be 30% of the mix? Any update on that would be helpful. And then, I had a follow up on the construction side, which obviously now you've got a more robust offering. I'm just wondering what you're seeing if anything different from a competitive standpoint. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","All right, Heather. So I'll start make a comment on the collections thing and I'll let Scott weigh in as well and then we can come back to the construction point. So real quick, what's happening with collections is kind of what we expected as customers are looking at their options they're looking at upgrading from maintenance to subscription, they're looking at how they move their new suites into new types of mixes. ","They're just looking at the collections and saying, hey, what this is a better way for me to consolidate my offering. My typical user uses this application and this application. I'm just going to true up on collections.","We saw a similar phenomenon with suites. We're just seeing it accelerated in at a somewhat larger scale with collections. And we expect that to continue as we move forward, which is a good thing. One, it simplifies our relationship with the customer. It increases the value of the account on an account by account basis. And it gets more of our technology on our users' desktop. So it's all goodness from our perspective. Scott do you want to add something?","Scott Herren ","The only thing Heather to the question of what's driving that? Why is it going faster than suites? So we've talked in the past about a lot of work that was done to simplify from suites that were several different suites and each had three different versions a good, better, best version down to three. And I think that simplicity has made it not only easier to sell and more efficient for our sales team and our channel partners, it has made it easier to buy on the buy side. So I think that's the biggest driver behind it.","There's always an occasional promo, there's nothing we've done explicit to try to drive this much faster. I would say at the point of conversion, as Andrew just talked about, when you convert from maintenance to product subscription, that is a very attractive price point. At that point to go from individual products over to collections. That's why we're seeing that upgrade hitting that next 25% to 30% of those eligible or actually taking advantage of it and go into a collection from a single call.","Andrew Anagnost","Heather you actually hit on something, back in the suites days we did lots of cross selling promotions around suites. We've done very few if any, around collections, which is a really big difference between that program and what we're doing now. And I think it talks to the maturity of the model and its connection with subscriptions.","Now on your construction comments with regards to competitive dynamics, we\u2019ve kind of surged into these acquisitions, really pleased with what we're seeing, we feel like we've consolidated I think pretty broad and exceptional solution. And it's right on track with some of our long term strategic objectives. ","So when we go and talk to customers right now the conversation isn\u2019t really about competitors it\u2019s about okay what\u2019s going to happen with the PlanGrid roadmap, what\u2019s going to happen with the BIM 360 roadmap, how are you going to get the building information more entrenched into my processes.","So our conversations with customers are excitement about what we\u2019re doing, not about what our competitors are doing, which is a really great conversation to have. And I just want to remind you a couple of things so that you kind of get a good sense for what we\u2019re doing here with regards to both PlanGrid and BuildingConnected we acquired these companies and we did not changed their run rate with regard to R&D we didn\u2019t change the run rate at all. In fact, we\u2019ve layered more R&D investment into PlanGrid and into BIM 360. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re accelerating the roadmaps of both of those products with much more targeting.","So PlanGrid is going to focus a lot more on site execution and the things associated with that execution. BIM 360 is going to focus a lot more on project management and project flow these are two incredibly sharp teams that are just going to kill it with what we\u2019ve been able to do with the acceleration we\u2019re layering in. That\u2019s why you\u2019re seeing things like construction IQ coming out right now, which we\u2019re really excited about because it\u2019s completely differentiated in the market.","That\u2019s using data that only we have to aggregated layer machine learning on and actually provide predictive outcomes of what could possibly happen in a construction project moving forward. Nobody has that kind of stuff. So you\u2019re seeing a surge ahead of the competition, not lose any momentum at all. This is a big area for us and we\u2019re taking it really seriously and we\u2019re investing more.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Andrew for the six quarters as you\u2019ve been highlighting your own internal digital infrastructure is there somebody for you to characterize or quantify or if otherwise describe how that infrastructure particularly in terms of transactional and license activation capabilities has evolved. I mean it\u2019s clear that your intuitive license volume is already well above where it was before the model transition you\u2019ve got some pretty ambitious plans for multiplying the size of the eStore. So in terms of what\u2019s occurred and what still has to occur could you talk about that infrastructure? And then a follow up.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so Jay, this is actually something really exciting I can comment with regarding to infrastructure. It doesn\u2019t get a lot of news, but what\u2019s happening now is that every new purchase of a single user license that happens out there in the market whether it happens from a partner or directly to us is going into a completely new backend that is serial number three. ","So all of our customers that buy these single user licenses that used to manage large spreadsheet for serial numbers that is all gone. So they are actually buying licenses that are completely identity based and that is a powerful lubricant to how our customers manage and use Autodesk software. ","Now at the same time the existing licenses they have that are sitting on the old model serial number base are being progressively migrated over to the new system. So by the end of the year every single user license is going to be sitting on this new system and serial numbers are gone from our single user business.","Now if you know anything about how people manage our software, this is a non-value added activity that sucks lots of time in dollars away from managing a relationship with Autodesk that is getting removed. And that is a direct results of the investment we\u2019ve made in the digital infrastructure. You\u2019re going to see similar moves as we look at how we do multi user licensing in the future that\u2019s something I\u2019ll save for another day.","Now the other thing that we\u2019re able to do and you\u2019re going to see it coming out more and more is usage analysis and it\u2019s not just for our EBAs, but we\u2019re actually going to be projecting usage behavior back to our customers so they can see who\u2019s using what and to what degree the software is getting utilized.","Now that will allow them to better control their relationship with Autodesk, it will allow us to better understand what they\u2019re using and what we can recommend to them next. So this year is a big year for lighting up infrastructure changes that we\u2019ve been investing in over the last 18 months and customers are going to see real benefits Jay these are not trivial changes in the way they manage their relationship with Autodesk. So we\u2019re actually pretty excited about it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, thank you for that. The follow-up is as you know we track pretty closely your headcount your open regs and where you\u2019re investing in sales and R&D and so forth you have quite a number of very interesting sounding senior management positions which you are looking fill and maybe you could talk about the thinking behind some of those. ","For instance a Head of Building Design Strategy, a Chief Data Architect, Head of Brand Strategy, Brand Activation, a Head of Self-Service Transactions, multiple things that sounds pretty interesting and maybe just put that in the context of where you're going this year and beyond.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So look, we are dead serious about having every aspect of Autodesk be completely digital. End-to-end from the customer\u2019s first touch to when they get the product, to when they use the product and when we provide layered automations on top of them. We manage and deal with mountains of data from our customers. ","So for instance, what you heard about the chief architect role there that\u2019s all about making sure that the infrastructure we're building behind the scenes takes that data from cradle to grave so it adds value to the customer in every single touch point. And does it in such a way that it's highly trusted, high integrity, the data is used in the service to the customer, not in the service of anyone else.","So those roles, what you're seeing is basically how we're translating the maturity of our investment into new types of automation activity. And we're just looking at, hey, we need this talent set, we need this talent set, in order to layer on this automation. So we're hiring to our roadmap is what we're doing.","And you're going to see more of that and frankly we're getting really interesting people coming on board that are interested in some of these positions. So very astute observation and yes, you are correct that pre-stages other types of automation and activities that are yet to come from us, which we believe are kind of game changing in our industry.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Your line is now open.","Gal Munda ","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The first one I just have Scott for you maybe on the cost side. The guidance for the next fiscal year is kind of a high-single digit growth in terms of the cost base. Is that something we should be thinking more sustainable going forward considering the fact we've had a few years kind of flattish cost base or is that something that's more of a one-off?","Scott Herren ","Yes, Gal it's a great question. If you fill back the guidance was 9% total spend growth for the year. And if you fill that back, it's about two points organic. So maintaining kind of the cost discipline that we've had. But of course you layer on what Andrew just talked about in the -- not just the organic growth, but also the investments we will make in those businesses. That's another 7 points of spin growth overall.","I think that's probably not a bad range to think. As you look further than beyond fiscal 2021 to 2021 through 2023 that's probably not a high-single digits is probably not a bad rates think about going forward. It all depends on how -- what opportunities are out there and what's going to drive the long-term top line growth for the company.","Gal Munda ","That makes sense. Thank you so much. And then, if I just kind of shift gears towards manufacturing a bit, kind of, construction has been getting a lot of the highlight recently, but in terms of the manufacturing, can you give us any color on the adoption of Fusion 360 when you look at some of the competitors they\u2019re still growing pretty healthy in that space? ","Is that -- how is the business growth? Maybe if you look throughout 2018 in calendar terms compared to what you've seen maybe the years before, because the product is kind of more mature now is in -- had several iterations. How do you feel about it?","Andrew Anagnost","So, Gal let me tell it to you -- this is Andrew let me say just a couple of things well nobody's growing at 29% in the manufacturing segment right now, right. That kind of growth is sure taking besides us. All right, so, we -- and by the way, the reason you're seeing that growth is we talked a lot about year-over-year compare that people were questioning for a while because we were retiring some manufacturing products. So we were actually taking revenue out of the system as we retire and consolidate some products.","Mostly consolidating some of those products into the Fusion stack and into the Fusion platform, so now what you're seeing is the compares that actually show it was sitting underneath all of that. And you're seeing robust growth in our manufacturing segments.","What you're also probably seeing if you're looking around in various forms of it, Fusion is really on fire. It's really in terms of user growth, probably the fastest growing platform in the industry right now. And we're happy with where it's at right now. What you're seeing is this exploration of what we've integrated into the platform with generative design, people are poking into this and using it in ways that frankly, we didn't really foresee and I'll give you some examples.","There's traditional hardline manufacturers that are using the generative capability inside of Fusion to kind of explore a series of design options that would traditionally kind of have been 3d printed natively and then what they're doing is saying wow, this is a better than I ever had, and they turned it into enrollment. So they're actually using the capability inside of Fusion to explore design space they never explore it before. And they're doing it with constraints in their manufacturing methods and other things and then turning it into solutions that they can use right now with traditional methods they have. Really unique workflows, really unique things.","Stay tuned, I think we've been very clear with you and construction was the first priority. We've established a strong construction portfolio, we\u2019re happy with what we've got there. In terms of major acquisitions we\u2019re done. But as you look over the next 12 to 18 months, watch this space, you're going to see it start making the kinds of organic and inorganic moves in the manufacturing space that just accelerate the leadership position we already feel like we have.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent, thanks so much, and congrats on great results, guys. I've got one for Andrew and a follow-up for Scott. So firstly, something that came up in our conversations with partners this quarter was some confusion about the go to market strategy with PlanGrid. Can you just remind us of your strategy for integrating it into the broader construction portfolio, whether we should expect PlanGrid to continue being sold standalone or perhaps bundled with build or ultimately integrating it with the BIM 360 platform longer term?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So, for the foreseeable future, you're going to see PlanGrid continue to be sold standalone. We do -- we are rolling out a program where if a partner find the deal, they get a commission on the deal, they get a finder's fee essentially for being participating in the deal, but PlanGrid is going to continue to sell directly. We are also looking at ways to appropriately create offerings that combined capabilities from BIM 360 and PlanGrid where customers might be confused about which solution is best and stay tuned, you'll see some of that.","But for the most part, we're letting this solution run and continue on its own. Remember, PlanGrid reached into a part of the construction ecosystem that we weren't spending a lot of time on either were our partners frankly, okay. So we're actually deeper into the construction chain than we were before and we're letting them continue to go into that chain, renew their deals and actually find new deals and that will continue. But we're definitely going to make sure that our partner if they find something we want them to tell us about it. We want to make sure they make some money of it.","Brad Zelnick","Great. And just for Scott, cloud subscriptions by my math grew about 35% organically. Can you maybe rank what are the different drivers there? And I think organic cloud ARPS was up only about 4% year-on-year was that in line with your expectations? And can you remind us of the levers that drive confidence in ARPS growth? Thanks.","Scott Herren ","Sure. On the cloud side the biggest drivers of the -- organically of the cloud subs continue to be BIM 360 is number one and driving the biggest chunk of that growth Fusion 360 would be second and then there's a handful of smaller products beyond that Shotgun is in there, AutoCAD 360 is in there. But those two drive the majority of the cloud subs adds.","The ARPS growth is in line with our expectations for the BIM 360 product set and on BIM 360 we also made a price change on it recently. Quarter and half ago we made a price change on Fusion 360. So you'll begin to see that price increase start to float its way through into the cloud ARPS as well. So I feel pretty good about where we are in the cloud side and you can see the inorganic contribution in the slide deck that we posted you could see it there was also a positive to the cloud ARPS for the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Thanks, hi guys. I guess, I missed it but I'm going to ask the question anyway what is PlanGrid and the other acquisition actually going to contribute in terms of this fiscal year\u2019s guidance because I didn't see it anywhere.","Scott Herren ","Yeah. So we didn't spend a lot of time breaking that out we said that point of acquisition with PlanGrid that it would drive, we expected it to drive about $100 million in ARR this year. And that's consistent with what's built into the guidance that we gave, I broke out the spend it was between the two of them, they drove 7 points of spend growth year-on-year. So you can do the math of what that looks like. That's probably about as much as we've done.","The other thing as you're doing your own calculations and I saw in some of the previous notes people trying to do the calculation. The other thing just to bear in mind is that the swing in interest the foreground interest on the cash spent and the added interest expense for the $500 million short-term loan agreement, we picked up. ","So all-in-all it\u2019s a slight headwind on EPS for fiscal 2018, it\u2019s slight headwind for us on free cash flow for fiscal 2020, but we feel good about being able to contain it.","Sterling Auty","Excellent. And then just one quick follow up, Scott, just as we think about the cash flow guide, I think multi-year agreements were going to be a decent contributor to that. What's been your experience remind us when you put the multi-year back into place? What's your experience and what does it need to do to hit that 1.35?","Scott Herren ","Yes, it is one of the contributors. There are several things obviously that drive the cash flow growth year-on-year from -- well we posted $310 million of free cash flow this year, but remember that included about $130 million of one-time cash outflows tied to the restructuring that we announced a year ago and the exit tax and moving our European hub out of Munich [ph] into Dublin.","So the three candidates actually understand reflects $130 million of one-time payment that won't repeat themselves in the fiscal 2020. There mainly the growth is the two things we talked about is net income and you can back into the net income increase year-on-year from the guidance points we gave you, but net income grow strongly driven by top line growth.","And then billings growth, and it will grow for all the reasons we've talked about in ARPS, an element of it is multi-year, which is what you're touching on. We reintroduced the 10% discount for three year paid up front multi-year products subs. We hadn't previously offered any discount on that, although we did still have some multi-year sales of it. There was no discount. We reintroduced that in Q4. And if you noticed, I know it's a busy night for you guys.","But if you look at our balance sheet, you'll see our long-term deferred actually grew for the first time in seven quarters as we saw pretty good uptake. People buying that three year product subscription deal. So we expect to see that continue to grow next year and get back into the range that its historically been. And think from a -- in terms of what long-term will represent of our total deferred revenue, we think it gets back into that 20% to 21% range that we talked about at Investor Day last year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Zane Chrane","Hi, thanks for fitting me in, congrats on a great quarter gentlemen. I was speaking with developers in one of the new skyscrapers in New York. And they were telling me how adopting Revit recently they're expecting that to generate a 3x return on the multimillion dollar contract they signed with you guys. That wasn't so much surprising so much as the fact that it sounded like a fairly recent decision. It made me wonder how penetrated do you think your customer base is in terms of Revit adoption for those customers that may potentially use it or could benefit from it?","Andrew Anagnost","I think, Zane you're actually hitting on something that's important to discuss. People think that Revit is already like fully matured and penetrating the market, it\u2019s actually still very much the early kind of majority type market for Revit adoption. We are actually seeing massive growth in Revit usage, Revit adoption. That's why I highlighted the increasing visibility of Revit skills is one of the skills that\u2019s important moving forward into the years. Revit has got a long way to go in terms of growth. And it really is the new engine of how architecture and building design is going to be done. And it's not even begun, its journey very much into the infrastructure space.","So look for Revit to keep going and going and going and watch how the skills referenced on Revit climbs up that list from where it is today well into the top 10. That's just to be expected, especially in Europe where Revit adoption is taking off from the very early stages. It was much more mature in the U.S.","Zane Chrane","That's helpful. And as far as the adoption, do you think that it will be driven more by the adoption of collections or do you see a lot of enterprise customers buying it standalone?","Andrew Anagnost","Our enterprise customers almost all buy it through EBAs. So they get access through the EBAs. It doesn't hurt that the collections have Revit insight so the users can immediately start moving projects to Revit. But frankly, the big driving force for Revit has a little to do with how we package our software. There's a couple of things that are driving it. One the return, you heard from those customers in New York. They basically see a fairly significant return. Owners in particular see a significant return and are more and more starting to mandate BIM for particular projects.","Governments are doing it, owners developers are doing it, people are just starting to expect BIM to be part of the process because they're seeing the ROI. That is more of a secular driver in terms of where things are going, this kind of digitization of the whole design to construction process, then how we package our software and sell it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Matt Swanson","Hi, this actually Matt Swanson, on from Matt, thanks for taking my question. Just one for me. In our survey work this quarter we had a reseller bring up a large deal that came from previously pirated software. I know before at one point you had mentioned 4 million pirates in mature markets. Could you just remind us what this opportunity is just kind of how you go about identifying and pursuing it?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So just to put it all in scale, right? We have 18 million users of our products worldwide, there's 404 million subscribers. So can you can kind of see there's a big delta between users and subscribers right now. Now, the way we look at this, especially in mature markets is we look at people, who are using the software and maybe have a few illegal copies or few illegal serial numbers inside their environment and we go and we have conversations with them.","For the most part, when you hear about big deals like that, that was somebody that was probably really stretching the limits of what was legal with regards to our software. Long-term what you're going to see with this whole entire process. ","And like I said, I've said this over and over again on calls, there's no big surge that's going to happen at any one point as a matter of fact, if we tried to create a big surge, I actually think what we do is create a big backlash. All right. What's you're going to see is a gradual kind of continuing add and penetration to that 18 million user base as we add more capability in the products to help us understand. who's using the licenses validly who isn't. ","And also as user start to realize that it's better to be part of the legal ecosystem than it is to be part of the invalid ecosystem. So just continue to see that momentum overtime. Don't expect big spikes, deals like what you just described, are not the norm. So I want to make sure that we're clear on that. But as we -- especially as we move into fiscal 2021 and 2022, where we're getting further and further down from our last perpetual release, and we move more and more in pure named user licensing as a company you're just going to see more and more of these people coming into the paid ecosystem.","Scott Herren ","And Matt, we have our Investor Day at the end of March, actually a month from today March 28 here in San Francisco. This is what obviously one of the topics that we\u2019ll update everyone on. And give you a sense not just for the numbers, but more importantly the things we're doing the changes we're making in both process and in the product to go after chasing that opportunity.","Matt Swanson","All right. Thanks for the time guys.","Scott Herren ","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. ","Hamza Fodderwala","Hi, this is Hamza Fodderwala for Keith Weiss. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on an earlier question asked about the integration between PlanGrid and the core BIM 360 product. What's the timeline for that? And is there any risk of customers perhaps being more cautious on purchasing BIM in advance of that integration since there have been a lot of changes with that product in recent years mostly positive, but just wondering if you're seeing any of that?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so one of the areas were we're paying attention to Keith -- was Keith right. No it was actually Tom. Okay. And one of the areas we\u2019re paying attention to Tom is moving very quickly and making it clear where the focus areas of those two products are. We've already kind of internally established that. PlanGrid is absolutely focused on site execution, and all the things that make site execution just awesome. And they are incredibly talented at, as Tracy [ph] likes to say, beautiful, simple software that helps people be more productive, and we're doubling down on that for them.","So all of the additional R&D investment we\u2019ve put in there is all going to accelerate their site execution roadmap. And customers are going to start to see that very quickly and start to understand, okay, so the site execution stuff that I saw in BIM 360 I am going to see more of it in PlanGrid and I'm going to see these things kind of expand out. What we've done on the BIM 360 side is we've been very focused with that team of aligning them around project management and project management capabilities.","And there have been gaps that our customers have been asking for, for quite a while around project management and project flow capabilities. And they're going to see an acceleration of those capabilities inside of BIM 360. ","So we move very, very quickly based on our own analysis, pre-acquisition and some of our post-acquisition moves to be very clear with the R&D organizations where they should run and how fast they should run in those areas. Customers will start to see that and we're already starting to communicate some of this to our customers. And I think they're starting to understand it as being not only the right thing to do, but intuitively makes sense.","Hamza Fodderwala","Got it, that's helpful. And a follow-up question perhaps for you, Scott. It looks like ARR growth is pretty strong, sustained in the low-30%, but the sub add were a bit below that of the original guidance, at least on an organic basis. Is that just the continued migration to collections or is there any other factors behind that?","Scott Herren","No, it is, as we've said in the past, we've focused much more on driving top line growth and driving ARR than we have on driving the individual component of that. I feel really good about the continued strength in collections, not just at the point of migration from maintenance over to product subs, which is continuing to stay strong. But also on new sales, we see industry collections at this point at 28% of our total products subscription install base. It's a -- it's run faster than we expected to get to that point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the percentage of your existing customer base that you're targeting for construction related sales in fiscal 2020. And then, what if any level of cross selling success you're factoring into the fiscal 2020 guidance?","Andrew Anagnost","Well, I -- Ken the one thing I\u2019d says anybody who works in the AEC space is a target for our construction portfolio. When you look at our strategy, our strategy is to connect the end to end flow from the early design process all the way through down to site execution and essentially get the building information model and the data that's attached to it moving through that entire process.","So basically, our entire AEC ecosystem is a target for some part of this construction staff be it BIM 360 design all the way through to PlanGrid and all the way through the BuildingConnected on the bidding side. So we see a fairly open field with regards to who we\u2019re targeting.","Now, what was the second part of your question, I just wanted to -- since you were saying\u2026","Ken Talanian","What you\u2019re factoring into the fiscal 2020 guidance? ","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So, Scott, why don\u2019t you to take that. ","Scott Herren ","Yes, Ken what we all talked about is we expect ARR to be in that 100 million range and that is what's factored into the guidance for fiscal 2020. I think what I'd add though to the first part of your question of who are we targeting, one of the things that we're excited about when we got PlanGrid was not just the technology which is beautiful, simple, easy to use, which is what's required in that site execution phase. They also have a strong base and a part of the ecosystem, the construction ecosystem that we didn't have a lot of touch points to which was the subcontractors and the trades.","So it\u2019s not just selling to our existing customer set in construction which we obviously will continue to do. We also got a nice beachhead with PlanGrid into a part of the construction ecosystem we didn't previously touch. And BuildingConnected by the way brings that same thing, if you look at what BuildingConnected does, it connects general contractors to trades into the subcontractors into the people below them. So it's actually a nice expansion of the people that we can target with our construction solutions.","Ken Talanian","Great. And if I can follow up quickly, could you give us a sense of how to think about the adoption rate of construction software in the event that we see an economic slowdown? Are you having the kind of high level conversations that suggests that this is a top priority, regardless of sort of the backdrop\u2026","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so excellent point, Ken. So look, what I'll do is I'll tell you about what happened in the last downturn. And I'll tell you about the sense of urgency that construction customers have around digitization. So in the last downturn construction, IT spend, continue to increase even though that downturn hit construction incredibly hard. And the reason for that is very simple, the most digital vendor or the most digital contractor won, because they were able to more accurately predict what their total costs were going to be able to do. They were able to get their bids in tighter, they were able to basically manage their costs better. So digitization wins.","The whole ecosystem and construction understands this right now. It's an imperative across almost all of our customers at this point. They're all looking to figure out how they can digitize their workflows, how they can extract more efficiency, how they can get more accuracy, reduce project risk, manage the timelines, reduce safety risks, that continues to be a highly visible aspect of this.","So we anticipate that even in a downturn construction IT spend is going to go up. And we're super excited about things like what we're doing with construction IQ, where we're actually using some of the data that we collect from our customers to provide predictive outcomes, which is going to become more and more valuable. So digitization wins, all of our customers know that and we anticipate the spend can continue even to a downturn.","Operator","Thank you.

Fiscal 2015 was the first year of our business model transition, and we are really pleased with the results. In addition to the strong financial performance, we are particularly pleased with the rollout, and acceptance of our new cloud-based products like Fusion 360, BIM 360 and PLM 360. As the world looks to cloud and mobile products to get the jobs done, we are being rewarded with thousands of news customers.","Our fourth quarter results continue to show strength across industries, geographies and products. Key metrics like billings, subscriptions and deferred revenue showed strong year-on-year growth. Cash flow from operations for the quarter was a record. And we increased our recurring revenue base by adding a 100,000 net new subscriptions in Q4, bringing our full year to 385,000 net new subscriptions. Subscriptions process through the Autodesk eStore, increased more than 150% and we experienced strong sequential growth from non-maintenance subscriptions. All in all, it was terrific quarter and a strong close to the year.","From a geographic perspective, strength was again broad based in Q4, anchoring this strength was large deal activities, which are transactions with a deal value greater than $1 million. Q4 was a record for large deals, with a number of transactions increasing more than 50% and the total deal value increasing more than 40% over the fourth quarter last year. That's another sign that we are becoming a more strategic partner to our largest customers. Many of these large deals were flexible enterprise licenses or EBAs, which create a recurring revenue stream and are recognized ratably. These EBAs drive deeper account penetration in which parts of the enterprise that we just weren't getting to previously. And these large deals also tend to includes buying decisions across the supply chain.","As customers look to align their design software, for increased efficiency and compatibility with their suppliers. Fourth quarter license revenue would have been approximately $40 million higher without the impact of flexible enterprise license agreements. For the year, we transitioned close to $90 million in the enterprise license revenue to these recurring revenue streams. From an industry perspective, our strong Q4 results in AEC, can be attributed through the continued adoption of BIM in the building and infrastructure industries. We experienced strong growth in AEC suites, as well as our cloud and mobile products. These new technologies support access to in-field and real-time information. Our manufacturing team delivered strong growth in Q4 driven by large deals, strengthened our product design suite and the addition of Delcam. We are really encouraged by what we are seeing with our cloud-based products like Fusion 360 and PLM 360.","For the first time in a long time, we are seeing fundamental changes in the competitive environment in manufacturing. The way products are being designed and built is changing, and customers are looking for tools to support these changes. Our cloud-based products Fusion 360 and PLM 360 are leading the market. Fusion 360 is a complete product development system that allows distributed teams to work together on a project from concept through manufacturing. Bringing together design simulation, visualization and fabrication tools into one product, is key for our products bringing better products to market faster. In terms of collaboration, the closest analogy for Fusion are gain up for software development or Google Docs for office documents. The range of customers and the work they're producing is really inspiring. We estimate that 90% of our Fusion accounts are new to Autodesk. So it's another way that we're expanding our user base.","PLM 360 is also bringing new users to Autodesk and expanding our presence within existing accounts. We added over 50 new PLM logos in FY 2015 and many of these customers have already come back to us to expand their usage. While some of our PLM accounts are enterprise customers, the vast majority are S&P, which is a large Greenfield opportunity. We were the first cloud-based PLM solution to the market over two years ago and we've built a sizable technology lead, which now includes cloud-based data management.","In Q4, we continued to see an increase in upgrade activity as legacy customers took the last opportunity to upgrade and a high percentage of the upgrades attach maintenance subscription.","This is all good news, as the end of life for upgrades resulted in converting tens of thousands of customers so the latest version of our products and bringing them with us into the future and we still have a huge opportunity to convert nearly 3 million customers to subscription offerings.","Now, I'd like to talk more about our model transition. At the heart of this transition is the dramatic shift in the software industry, total subscription and a technology platform shift to the cloud. Our customers are already seeing the benefits of the shift to the cloud and turn-based offerings with many of their other software applications, such as CRM or HR apps, and they are embracing the change. Our subscription offerings provide a simplified product management and deployment experience.","They also make it easier to introduce new tools and technologies into the workflow with lower upfront costs. This is changing how our customers use our products to solve design challenges in ways that just weren't previously possible.","We exited FY 2015 with even more conviction in our transition. In many ways FY 2015 was the set up for the next couple of years in which we will move a larger portion of our business to subscription and recurring revenue.","Earlier this month we announced that we would stop selling new perpetual offerings for most of the standalone products such as AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT on February 1 next year. After which they will be available only through desktop subscriptions. We expect that this may lead some customers to buy new perpetual licenses before the change, while others will willingly choose the more flexible subscription offerings that provide increased functionality and new benefits.","Throughout the course of the year, we'll be working with our customers and channel partners to help them make the choice that's best for them because of 100% of desktop and cloud subscription revenues deferred are recognized ratably. This will naturally puts downward pressure on traditional income statement metrics like revenue, operating margin, and EPS, through the transition. This pressure will increase the remaining perpetual license offerings have discontinued next year. At that point, nearly all revenue will come from ratably recognized offerings, including maintenance, desktop and cloud subscriptions and EBAs.","Also keep in mind, there will continue to be pressure on gross margin as we invest in our cloud infrastructure and our sales of cloud services ramps up. On the flip side, the model transition will positively impact deferred revenue and subscription additions, which we expect will continue to have healthy growth rates.","The traditional income statement metrics will start to rebound at the anniversary of the quarter in which we discontinue perpetual offerings. From there we would expect a material rebound in financial performance. Those considerations are factored into our guidance for FY 2016, which calls for 3% to 5% growth in both billings and revenue.","Our FY 2016 guidance also reflects six points of currency headwinds for billings and four points of currency headwinds for revenue. In other words, our guidance for billings growth at constant currency would be 9% to 11%, and our guidance for revenue growth at constant currency would be 7% to 9%. Healthy growth rates over strong performance in FY 2015.","To wrap things up, we're really pleased with the direction of the business. This past year shaped up to be much stronger than our initial view, and we remain confident in our long-term business model transition. Goals of 12% billing, CAGR 20% more customer value, 50% more subscriptions and 30% operating margins. We look forward to building on these early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription based model over the coming years.","Lastly, I want to thank our employees and partners for their outstanding efforts and contributions over the past year. It was a great team effort.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. And our first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color about how we're looking for this sort of transition from perpetual to subscription to unfold? You give us a very impressive subscriber guidance for FY16. Could you give us a little bit of understanding, namely, how you're going to try to incent customers to act \u2013 whether you're going to be trying to push them more towards subscribers or desktop subscriptions in the near term? Or is it going to \u2013 or is the pricing going to be equivalent between perpetual and professional desktop subscription?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Keith, thanks. Two things in the way that we're thinking about moving customers more towards desktop subscription. We would like them to move there, one is certainly as you \u2013 it suggests through price, the other way to do it is, we will make sure that the offerings on desktop subscription have more value for the customers than the other. We will put things in those products that are not available in the traditional way. Having said that I think even last quarter I said the same thing. A customer who is happy buying perpetual licenses and subscriptions, we will \u2013 we're going to continue to allow them to do it and move at their own pace, but what we're going to try to do is incent them do it rather than beat them with the stick to do it.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. What would be some of those incentives, outside of pricing?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As an example, some of the other cloud connected services.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So you will have access to them in one product, but not in the other, would be an example of something like that.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So a desktop subscription would have it, but the maintenance -","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Traditional one would not.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And we can do this differentially, how we're applying this consumption based models around things like cloud credits, so we can vary how many they have, we can vary what services they have access to. There were actually a fair number of knobs and dials in there. We're a little bit \u2013 kid of little bit at this point to say exactly what they are, partially because we don't fully understand, we want to understand our customers reactions to the incentives as put them in place.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. I'd just like to ask about AutoCAD LT. I know that you were thinking of transitioning the pricing there from licensing to subscription. Just wondering where we are with that. And if there is a transition to subscription, is that having an impact on the revenue growth in that product group?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We've started making desktop subscriptions available, customers are definitely taking advantage of it. LT is one of the places where it's a natural for a certain class of customers particularly those who are price sensitive for upfront \u2013 upfront they have to pay. And yes, every customer we try to move to desktop subscription affects revenue in the short-term.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. And my other question was just around the EBA business. How did the amount of business you did in the fourth quarter compare to the amount you had done in the third quarter?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Substantially higher. Almost half of it was done in the fourth quarter.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sequentially Steve it was more than double quarter-on-quarter. The number of transactions greater than a $1 million. So it was strong growth.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'd just say in general, I mean, we have been \u2013 I can't say it's strong, how great the EBA business has been, just in general, the investment we made in working with our large customers. This came about a number of years ago, where we recognized that we really build an incredibly strong portfolio of products and even some of our best customers didn't know about it.","And in many ways some of our more traditional channels were not in a position of convincing the largest companies in the world of what we actually had. And so we made a fairly large investment in selling direct or selling in conjunction with our best partners and it has made a huge difference and I think as we outlined at our Analyst Day, we still think there's a lot more there.","So we still think this is a big source of growth over the next few years and each quarter keeps improving it.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Please go ahead.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Carl, on manufacturing, it was surprisingly strong, versus what some of your competitors have said. I'm curious what you're seeing, in terms of share gains versus your peers. Combined with execution, what would you say that you're seeing there? And I had a quick follow-up for Scott.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Brent. I think there are two aspects. So one, on the little bit more bearish, I think I fall into the same category of some of our competitors around the worldwide economy. I mean, in that way, I mean there is a little bit of noise in the emerging economies, I think for manufacturing, the place that probably gives all of us the most concerned is Japan, that despite all their efforts, they just can't seem to jumpstart the economy. So, there is a little bit of macroeconomic concern on the much more bullish side.","I think there are two things going on right now. I think we've had solid execution. As I said in the previous answer to Steve, I think we have great offerings for our customers that we built over a long period of time. The second thing that's adding to this is what we are doing on the cloud. A number of our competitors have just chosen at this point not to do anything substantial there. And I think this will change over time, I don't think this is an advantage that we will have forever, but we invested heavily in PLM 360, we just brought the part of PLM that most people think of this PLM, really data management or document management to the cloud, which greatly expands the opportunity there.","What we are doing in the Fusion 360 is really kind of reinventing how CAD will be used in the future. So, and I think people are recognizing it. The reason why I led in about our estimate of 90% new users is both in PLM and in Fusion, those are all share gains. Every one of those is not a new CAD or PLM customer. They've been using previous things and as we've surveyed what they're using, they're coming from the very traditional legacy products. And so, we're really pleased with that. And so, that's certainly helping our growth.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up for Scott on operating margins, 13% to 15% guided. It seems fairly conservative, assuming that you still want to hit your 30% ramp. Maybe if you could just walk through that progression and what you think is going to be the big impact this year on margins, given your size. I think everyone was hoping for a little bit more.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, Brent. If you look at our Q4 results, you see Op margins that are in the just below 13% range. So, but we are looking for improvement year-on-year. And I think there's a couple of things that are driving that. One is obviously, top line growth, albeit muted by some of the FX impacts. The second is, we are \u2013 I think the team has done a really nice job of looking to rebalance and reprioritize everywhere they can, so that as we make some of these required investments to make the business model transitioned, whether it's investments we have to make in the sales team or inside the R&D teams or back-office systems and cloud infrastructure, we're doing a lot of that by rebalancing internally. So, you see kind of the implied spend growth for fiscal 2016, despite of the lower than the spend growth that you saw on fiscal 2015, and those are the things that are contributing to the Op margin for next year.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I think just in general, as you think about the transition Brent, the more successful we are at transitioning quickly, it's just arithmetic that revenue and EPS, and margin get affected by it. And I think we've looked at this quite closely and we decided that, on balance the best thing we can possibly do is move as quickly as we can, mostly modulated by our customers' needs. So, that's really what's been driving. And so, we want to move quickly and to the extent that we're more successful at it, it has an arithmetic impact. On the other hand, every one of those dollars that you see on the booking side, is money in the bank that comes back to the operating margin and EPS.","Brent John Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Understand. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I have two quick questions. One, Carl, I was wondering if you could share with us, I know you've had some initiatives underway where you were trying to reduce your churn rate in Q4 and focus on trying to drive higher renewal rates. I was wondering if you could share with us some of the success you might have seen from some of the initiatives you've been put in place.","And then the second question just follows up on what Brent was asking. If we look beyond this year, at analyst day, you talked about how you thought you could keep OpEx growth sub 5%, as you look out. And that last year was a [year in] investment, and it seems like this year you're getting some investment. Obviously, we get the model transitions. But is there, can you give us some clarity as how you see the company growing OpEx as you look out beyond this year? What's required, in terms of investments? Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. I think both Scott and I, can jump in on both of these. I mean, bunch of positive stuff about making sure that more customers attached and renewed. And this one was in the \u2013 this was in a camp of simple execution. We just started paying attention to it and measuring it and putting people, giving it to people, as a day job, working with \u2013 closely with our partners and we did \u2013 we've done much better.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, and the results \u2013 Heather, on the renewal rates, we obviously don't close that, but I'll tell you the results year-on-year, both in the Q4 and for the full year, attached rate and renewal rate are both up materially year-on-year. But I think some of the disciplined and some of the increased focus that we put in place is a clearly paying dividends and as we see people making final purchases on upgrades and I think the same phenomenon will continue on final purchases on perpetual license, you see a very high attached rate, that also will bring along with it a high renewal rate.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. On the OpEx spend, I mean what we see is slightly higher than 5% growth in OpEx for this year, but that's kind of the area where we've been looking over the next three years, that kind of growth rate. Some of it is coming back from last year. We've built a hole, in some of the compensation programs, that really filled back in. The other thing is, again, as we've decided \u2013 as we've seen such success and wanted to accelerate the transition. There are two things that are consuming some of that is building out the cloud infrastructure to support that in terms of the stuff that supports actual customers and the other is the back office infrastructure, which needs to change fairly dramatically in order to support a very new business model.","And so, those are the places to really think of it. A lot of the rest, looks like cost of living and then Scott already mentioned. We're doing a lot to move expenses from one part to the other. It's opaque from your point of view, but there is a lot of movement of expenses from one place to the other.","Heather Anne Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks, good evening. Carl, I'd like to ask about the composition of your subscriber ads, that is to say, the sources of those numbers. Back at the analyst meeting, you talked about 2.9 million active users who were not, however, paying maintenance or subscription. It looks to us like the largest piece of that \u2013 or at least as large \u2013 is the BLP piece is what you've called upgraded but not attached. And that works out to at least 1.3 million. And what do you think the conversion rate could be of that very large base of non-subscribers, as part of your guidance for this year?","And then secondly, with respect to the constant currency billings growth for FY16, that's a couple of points better than we had assumed. And yet, you've got at least a 10 point headwind for billings growth from the absence of upgrades, given that you seemingly had record upgrades in FY15. So perhaps, you could rank the sources of billings growth from the other components. For example, perpetuals, rentals, EFLAs. How are you thinking about the build to the billings growth from the various sources?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, two things about it, Jay. So, on the first one, I think your model might me more detailed than ours. I'm not sure if I could actually tell you exactly where are you, I'm being slightly facetious here, but some of the customers actually kind of putting a tag on them and realize which bucket they're coming from, it's a little bit hard, because of the way, they may have been a customer and then re-enter with a new one or the way they've switched. So, it's a little bit harder to tag precisely than you might imagine. When you get to looking forward, there was a big question mark that I tried to outline in kind of the prepared remarks was, we're not quite sure we did a number of experiments, but there are really two possible behaviors going forward as we get rid of perpetual licenses.","Some of our customers will definitely choose to hoard those licenses, if you will, they like the way they buy it now, they'd like to buy more of those, and others will see the advantages with the new model and move to flexible licensing. That's one of the big variables out there. We modeled primarily on the overall number. The number of people that will get new licenses, and most of the variability in our modeling is around how much is in the first pile versus how many people are in that second pile.","And as we see the year play out and as we move into the first quarter and second quarter, we will be able to give you a little bit clearer guidance on what we're seeing, but, right now, we're shooting a little bit in the dark to know in which group they exactly fall into.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Jay, this is Scott. The only thing I would add to that is what we saw with the end of life of upgrades this year's very high attach rate on maintenance. And if so, of course, we'll get that tail through next year in the revenue stream; on the billing side, I think, we expect to see that same kind of high attach rate to the customers that decide to buy perpetual and hoard, right.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, I think there is besides though, the mix of which way they buy, I think we'll also see a very high acceptance.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I think, if you look really the gates we've setup is that, in the end, regardless of the way they buy, they end up as a subscriber.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome, Jay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Philip Winslow, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and outlook. I want to focus in on vertical by industry because, Carl, I know you talked a lot about \u2013 you can't talk about by geography, just geographies or industries. When you think about what led to the improving growth that you guys have seen, does any vertical by geo stand out to you that has gotten better versus what you saw in the past? As you all contemplate the billings guidance for this year, how did you incorporate some of those changes versus, let's say, what verticals by geo were running at previously?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll give you my impression, Scott feel free to jump in. I've started out when the U.S. was strong and I mean, U.S. Re was strong all through the year, and that made a big difference. I think there have been some nervousness around Northern Europe and Central Europe, that did pretty well. And for much of the year, many parts of Asia did well, like I said, the places that are on my radar right now in terms of the ones I'm more worried about, are Japan and obviously Russia. Russia business has been reduced dramatically, and I worry on an ongoing basis, and in Japan despite all the economic stimulus and government action, they seem somewhat enabled to jump start more growth. And both of those are important markets for us. So, that's the part I worry about.","I think if you look more broadly, I think there is two things going on in different industries. I think the adoption of BIM in Asia, is still a big thing. It's not nearly fully adopted. I might even guess that it's half. There is still a lot of way to go. We're seeing lot more government initiatives, we're seeing lot more projects, beginning to adopt it. And so we're still in the middle of a very strong technology transition, within the AEC industry, that's actually many ways getting broader as it reaches out to construction companies, when we talked about through mobile technologies, it gets there delivering real time information in the field.","On the manufacturing side, I think there is \u2013 as has been historically true, lots of pressure on manufacturers. They're looking for better ways to develop products, they're looking for new answers. Many of our traditional competitors have kind of turned their back on medium potatoes if you will of the industry, of giving people CAD software that actually gets their job done and making better software. And they've gotten interested in other parts and other ways of serving customers. And we've been happy to fill-in that void. And I think that's going to continue.","The second thing is particularly the companies that are under a lot of pressure in terms of product innovation and reducing their time to market. They're really looking for new technology. They are looking how to figure out, how to manage distributed teams, building products, much more willing to kind of break the norms, look at cloud and mobile technology for both PLM and for CAD. And I think we're clearly the leader there, we've been out there with both of our CAD and PLM products for two years and that's making a huge difference.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Phil, the only thing I'd add is. Carl touched on lot of the bright spots, geographically. U.S. was bright, Germany was bright, across Northern Europe was bright. I think the other one that not quite at the same scale, but it was particularly strong in terms of growth there was China in Q4.","So, you see the overall APAC growth rate and it's definitely weighted down by what's happening in Japan. I think what might be a little bit easier to point out is the places that things didn't go well, and Japan was one of those, Russia was one of those, and on a much smaller scale Brazil was one of those, but we had a little bit of tough quarter.","Philip Alan Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Great, guys. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Carl, what percentage of your business goes through the online store today? And what might that look like once we get through this transition? And maybe as a follow-up to that, how does the channel feel about this move to the online store, over time?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, right now, it's relatively small. The online store is a negligible for \u2013 I mean, and it's \u2013 the placement has any \u2013 it's in the U.S., is certainly the largest proportion of that. The other thing that we have talked about for a long time, we've always used the, eStore as a way to base the prices. So everything there is at list price. And then, we don't control end user of pricing, but that is the one place where we do. So people tend to look at our eStore. They get reference prices from there, but more often the smaller customers transact in one or two ways with our more traditional partners or with some of the larger volume partners, I think, CDW or Dell, or Amazon. So it's much more a price reference.","Now, I think as you go through this transition, I think there can be some change there on some of the things, and in particular I actually think this is going to be a win-win for us and our partners, the places where I'm most interested in seeing business go through the eStore for the transactions that are not cost effective for our partners. And I don't want to see our partners wasting their time on things where they don't make money. And if we can provide electronic ways to do that that's great.","Second thing, I'd say is we're starting to see electronic outlooks popup through our partners and distributors. And it's clearly the way some of our customers want to buy. So, I think there will be a greater variety of choices out there, but for all of us it's driving greater efficiency in the business.","Matt Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome, Matt.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Please go ahead.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Carl, I have my own opinions, but I was curious what your thoughts are. A lot of your competitors are not aggressively switching to cloud. You guys are. Look, I mean, I think you're on the right side of history. Are you seeing any, I mean, you see it in the numbers, but how do you think about, would people just go, Oh, man, I don't want to do this cloud stuff. It's CB radio with more typing, or whatever? And would you lose people in that? Is there any risk of that, or how do you triangulate around that? Thanks.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. That's a funny question, Richard. But it's a serious question. So, let me answer it this way. There are certainly customers now who don't see the cloud is the inevitability that I see it. And for them we continue to offer desktop products, there is the intermediate ground of desktop connected products. So, you can continue to work like you did behind the firewall relatively isolated. You can also work in ways that allow you take advantage of cloud services. So, you get some, but maybe not all of the benefits. So you can kind of modulate your behavior, according to your tolerance.","On the other hand, it's \u2013 I guess I've been around long enough and watched enough of these transitions to recognize kind of the inevitability. And, I was around when people said CAD will never be done on a PC, it has to be done on the mainframe, I was there when it said, you can never design a car on a PC, it had to be done on a workstation. Every car in the world today is designed on a PC. And in the same way, every bit of enterprise software is moving to the cloud. You've already seen it, it happened with ERP, and HR, and CRM. So you look at what's going on and it's very hard to imagine a world in which all of your IT is cloud-based except somehow some part of product development. It makes very little sense, and particularly I think there is a better reason other than just kind of this inevitability argument, that I think is important.","If you think of the challenges that most companies are wrestling with, they build these products in large distributed teams. Many of them will tell you whether this is the supply chain and manufacturing or the companies that come together in construction, that the biggest problem is in communication and coordination. So in some ways, there is nothing particularly rationale about having a behind the firewall solution for a constellation of companies and people that need to work together, that what you really want is the IT structure to mirror the structure \u2013 the economic structure of the people participating and I think the cloud serves that. I've outlined this before, but if you just wanted to go, get down to press tax with the cloud through our customers, there is two big things thus far. It gives them the ability to do large, on-demand computing for their most difficult engineering problems, and whether that's analysis, simulation or visualization, that is an important part.","The second one is a less computing intensive task, but really critical to what they do every day, which is this coordination, and collaboration. And the cloud is a central coordination point, and as you watch many of the other companies in the different parts of the industry, gain these advantages, it all comes about by having the centralized coordinating point. So, three years or four years ago, when we started on this journey, I think it was a lot more suspect. I think, as the days go by, you get more and more convinced that we're \u2013 we're certainly on the right side of the history on this one.","Richard Hugh Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it. Thanks.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I was wondering, I think you pushed back the actual elimination of the upgrade price by 30 days, if I'm not mistaken.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Any sense of what that actually did to the subscriber count in the quarter, meaning, obviously, that spilled it over into the first quarter. But any way to quantify that?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. That's really hard for us to tell. All we saw was that there was a huge rush at the end. And, because of that, we wanted any of our customers who wanted to take advantage of it. We did and we just gave a little bit of an outlet to it, so that \u2013 they had a little bit more time, for whatever reason, they were enable the process fee orders in that timeframe. So, but it's hard for us. I mean we will see the spike and at the end of quarter we'll know much more about it, but it's really hard for us to predict right now what it is.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, in terms of the transition, you mentioned a year from when you eliminate perpetual, you'll start to see the rebound. What I'm curious about is, what do you anticipate being the end of the transition? In other words, is it three years until you go through the customer base and get back to the point where the income statement would be \"normalized\"?","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Sterling. This is Scott. I think the \u2013 thinking through the elimination of perpetual which we've already announced for a standalone products, we saw a perpetual license out there for suites and haven't made an announcement there yet, but have said the 12 months to 24 months from the time that was announced that the all perpetual new license sales would end. At that point you anniversary the date of the last sales of perpetual license and that's when some of the traditional methods that are in the P&L like reported revenues, and then down the stream into op margin and EPS will also begin to get back to a steady state. So I like exactly what Carl said in the opening commentary, at the point that we anniversary the quarter where there's no more perpetual license sales is where we start to hit a more steady state again.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The only thing I'd remind everyone because we've had lots of questions on this, is during that period it doesn't have to be blind faith. I mean as we've shown is billings and subscriptions both matter and they will be going \u2013 we've talked about how they will rise substantially and you can track that. And...","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Deferred revenue.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And deferred revenue certainly. As you watch those other metrics and in some ways what we're saying is the metrics change, really, around just the calculations involved, but you can \u2013 they are almost perfect proxies for the health of the business. So, I think you can look at that. When we come out of it, I think it maybe in a different \u2013 maybe different place, again we'll go back to revenue and op margin, EPS being more normalized. But they're still maybe more interest in billings and subs and deferred revenue, just because of the model transition. So, if anything I think at the end, there will be more metrics that give an indication of the health of the business, but through the transition there is plenty to look at to gauge our progress.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No, that's certainly the case. And we saw that with Cadence Design and Aspen Technology and Ariba and a number of others that have gone through this. But one of the questions that always comes up, and we're seeing this more recently with Aspen technology, that's finishing their transition, is where you come out. So when you eliminate perpetual, you're going to have the inevitable dip in that first year. That second year, your revenue, probably, doesn't make it back to where it was previously because the layering effect, I wouldn't imagine, unless there's going to be something different here. So that's why I'm asking when do you get at least back to where you started before the elimination of perpetual, maybe use that as the gauge?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's really, Sterling, a question of the rate and pace that our customers move from traditional licensing over to desktop \u2013 our desktop subscription license or to cloud. And we are working that process beginning this year to try and move people as quickly as we can over to the some of the newer subscription and ratable revenue model styles. But the rate and pace that they adopt that will really dictate what the shape of the curve is when it's finished.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Unlike you saw this year, I'm really pleased with the results, but we were imperfect in our projection of what would happen this year. We didn't truly understand it at the beginning and it turned out to be very good and when we certainly course corrected along the way and I expect through the next year or two we will be doing the same as we gauge the behavior of our customers and partners, relative to the offerings we're putting out there.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, super, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in, here. First, maybe for Scott, in terms of license revenue this year, you've obviously got a headwind from the discontinuation of the upgrade program, perhaps some headwind from proactive customers ahead of your perpetual license deadline, and then, maybe a little bit of tailwind from perpetual license hoarding. So a lot of moving parts. How should we think about where license revenue ultimately ends up this year, with all those different moving parts?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Saket we're not going to obviously provide guidance at that level of granularity, but I will tell you that what's going to drive the growth of perpetual this year is the announcement around end of life on standalone products. So if you look at the prepared remarks the document with all the 17 pages worth of data, one of the statistics in there is 37% of our revenues are suite base, right. So you can begin to, then, peel back to what is standalone product-based. And then on the license side, it's probably a little bit higher than that 37% number. So think of that chunk of our license revenues and that customer set, having a last opportunity to buy perpetual license. That's what's going to drive the license line. On the subscription line it's the same trend that we saw this year, it's high attach rate on the upgrade sales that will continue through the year and turn into maintenance revenues. Also high attach rate we expect on perpetual license sales, as we hit that end of life toward the end of the year. So, those things will drive the subscription line.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Got it. And then, for my follow-up, you said that perpetual will, effectively, be gone in the next, in roughly 24 months. Have you thought about, or, rather, how have you thought about the behavior of your customers that are buying perpetual license for suites, in terms of your guidance? Do you think they pause for a potentially similar change, maybe seeing the writing on the wall, or how have you thought about that for 2016?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think there's, I mean, I think, there are a handful of customers who are following this very closely. I think many customers actually contemplate these things on an as needed basis. We certainly, due to some degree, follow this much more closely than most of our customers.","I think the customers who're paying really close attention can, we've more than telegraphed. We've explicitly said what the plan has been, and we've talked about it for at least a year. So, I think they understand it. Unlike I said before, I think there are two behaviors that will drive, some people will decide to buy ahead of the announcement, and others will decide to move to a more flexible offering. And as we go through this year, we'll be able to figure out what's there. I think the other thing we're able to do is, I think we're able to kind of turn the dials to adjust what we've \u2013 what we'd like to see.","Saket Kalia - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Carl, following up on Sterling's question about these model transitions, as he said, we've seen them a few times. And one of the things that we have looked at has been free cash flow in lieu of EPS. As we think about this model transition, would free cash flow be likely to bottom next year? And when might we start to see that inflection and turnaround in free cash flow, knowing that's going to come, probably, ahead of the changes in the more traditional revenue and EPS metrics.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Brendan, we're not going to obviously forecast fiscal 2017 at this point. I would tell you though the free cash flow and the operating cash flows will follow closely along with the billings as opposed to anything in the \u2013 reported revenues in the P&L.","Brendan John Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much. Carl, you mentioned that you saw a strong consequential growth from non-maintenance subscriptions, which I think is a little different than what you've called out before. Can you elaborate what you saw on that front? Was that strength really from the EBAs, or was there a change as well with regards to desktop subscription and your cloud?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In both.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It is both.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Both things strongly grew. And, like I said, I think desktop, desktop subscriptions will have a more consistently increasing profile, whereas I think EBAs will still be subject to that seasonality. But I think both will be \u2013 we'll continue on an upward trend, but what I was referencing, both of those substantially grew.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Terrific. And then, just a follow-up to Brent's question earlier. Just wondering if you're still comfortable with reaching 30% operating margins by FY18. It would seem pretty difficult to get there if you only end up doing 13% to 15% this year.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. One of the things I would just say is that, as you work your models, it's very different when you're at 13% or 15%. Because your expenses and revenue aren't aligned, when it comes about because of the way we account for it, in some ways you are putting money in the bank. And so, the growth rate that you can see in EPS or operating margin is dramatically different than happens under normalized conditions. In some ways, the dollar you put away today that you don't recognize comes back even though to some extent, most of the expense of that has already been \u2013 we've already spent that money. So, I think we've spent a lot of time looking at this and what you get as you come out of this is dramatic increases, unlike increases we've seen in any other year and that speaks to the how well we will do in that year. What we're really doing is we're just putting money in the cookie jar right now. And so, I think if you look at it through that lens \u2013 kind of simplistic corner store mentality lens, you kind of get it, the only reason it's not dropping to the bottom line now is through the accounting rules, not due to the fundamental economics of the business.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Please go ahead.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. I'm wondering there's a lot of moving parts in the subscriber numbers. And I'm wondering when you think you'll be in the position, or what are you looking for to take place before you're going to start to give us some more visibility into the composition of the subscribers that you have and that you add every quarter?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Walter. The subscriptions numbers are still overwhelmingly driven by maintenance subscriptions. And so, while we're seeing strong growth in both cloud and desktop, certainly strong growth year-on-year but sequentially very strong growth in those numbers, they're still small and so we're still overwhelmingly driven by maintenance subscriptions as the other two become material, and we think there is a benefit in breaking that out, of course we'll do so.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then, Scott, I guess related to that, we've noticed on your website, you're doing a pretty significant discount for the desktop subscription on an annual basis. And should we start thinking about the desktop subscription pricing and the maintenance pricing coming together and, ultimately, the offerings also coming together? To some degree that, once somebody is on them they have the same value. I guess you've talked about providing maybe some more value on the desktop side. But should we start to think about those two coming together in terms of.","Richard Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","No, I wouldn't think about it that way, as we talked about before, we've said in the first year, we can provide incentives for folks to get there. There is nothing that says we need to do that in subsequent years. And I'd really think of the economics of each of these customers differently. The other customers have paid a large upfront amount and to some degree deserve to pay less per year, whereas the ones who get this lower upfront cost can pay more over time. But I think in terms of getting people into the system, we will definitely continue to experiment with different price points and see what the results of that are. That's one other things that we've talked about. But if I read through the lines, and what you're saying I would not model these two things as identical, I think that would be a large mistake.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. The other lever there, Walt, of course is to use value, to attract customers to the cloud and desktop offerings based on the value that they provide and differentiate the value of those offerings versus maintenance.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, understood.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kasthuri Gopalan Rangan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thank you very much. Can you give us a quick update on the folks that have installed licenses but are not on maintenance? I think there was an emphasis on getting as many of them as possible on subscription be it maintenance or pure subscription. And I believe that program also had a finite time period. Can you give us an update on how that is coming along?","And also, with respect to the variability of customers falling under either a subscription, the different kinds, how confident are you in your targets? Because the targets seem to be fairly firm in FY18 of a certain level of billings and operating margin implying a certain level of earnings. It feels like there is a fair amount of variability between the two buckets. Just wanted to get your comments on that because that was said about a year back, but obviously things have come together in a different way. Just wanted to get your feel for that. Thank you.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So what I would say in the short-term, I think looking at the short-term of moving the millions of people who are non-subscribers on. I think this will be an ongoing thing. I don't think there is any short-term phenomena there. I think there will be incentives. We will continue to be incentives. The places that we encourage them to move will change as a programs change. But many of the 3 million customers are happy loyal customers and what we're trying to do is change the commercial arrangement between us. And we will continue to do that by making a variety of offerings.","So there is nothing like that ended or expired. There is still a lot of options in terms of how we go and addressing ways to get those customers into the new model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Koenig of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, gentlemen, for taking my question. You know, you spoke a little bit about the experiments you've run and how the different types of new flexible offerings might play out. I'm curious to get a little bit more color, perhaps, on subscribe to Autodesk, given that's more of a, maybe it could be seen as a replacement for the suites, a little bit more holistic approach to using a broad range of Autodesk products. Is that more impactful next year, as those licenses for other products besides the standalone products get curtailed, or does that have traction this year? How important is that in the next, say, 12 months to 18 months...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Steve, I think you hit the nail on the head, I think it's a really important point. Yeah, what we're seeing is subscribe to Autodesk, which is a flexible licensing program for everyone from our smallest to our midsize customers, the people who aren't involved in like those EBAs. Those are mostly replacements, in our mind, for suites. Certainly some people have single products, will also find that attractive, it also starts to deal with some of the network licensing things even on our single products. There is a network licensing component, many of our customers even on the LT deploy these in groups and subscribe to Autodesk begins to address that as well. We hadn't announced detailed plans, but just to answer your question more pointedly, it will have the bigger impact of following year than it will this year.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot, Carl. That's all I got.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.

I have two exciting things to share with you today. First, we closed another fantastic quarter with strong performance across all key metrics. Second, we are expanding our capabilities in the construction space by acquiring PlanGrid to complement our construction portfolio as well as to enhance our reach within the industry.","Looking first at our Q3 performance. We built upon the strength of our Q2 results by posting accelerated growth driven by strength across all product families in major geographies. We generated 33% growth in total annualized recurring revenue or ARR with both product and cloud offerings delivering great performance. There are several key areas that I want to highlight on the call today.","We had record growth in total ARR and total ARPS. In fact, this is the highest growth quarter for both since we started our business model transition over four years ago. We experienced strong growth in our enterprise business during the quarter which speaks of the strategic importance of our products and a healthy demand environment.","We hit a milestone of four million total subscriptions. The maintenance-to-subscription program continues to perform well and we\u2019re seeing an increase in the adoption of collections. BIM 360 delivered broad based strength driving cloud ARR growth in the quarter, and we are enhancing our construction offering with the acquisition of PlanGrid.","First let\u2019s look at ARR, which is the best proxy for measuring progress in our business model transition and the overall health of our business. The strength in ARR was a result of accelerated growth in all geographic regions and across all product families. All geographic regions posted revenue growth of atleast 25%.","Subscription plan ARR has more than doubled on a year-over-year basis for seven out of the last eight quarters. Growth in ARR was driven by strength across all subscription plan types and once again product subscription led the group while EBAs also accelerated meaningfully.","ARR for our core business which represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription and our EBA sales also grew at 33%, inline with total ARR, as our core business drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth.","Now as you know, I have made construction one of the company\u2019s critical near term priorities and that\u2019s why I\u2019m incredibly excited to talk about the acquisition of PlanGrid which expands our expertise, presence, scale and reach in the construction space.","You have heard me say many times that the construction industry was a key focus area for us in becoming a design and make company. It\u2019s hungry to deploy more technology and were ready with compelling solutions.","At PlanGrid, Tracy Young, Ralph Gootee and the rest of the management team has built a leading construction tech company and we look forward to welcoming them back to the Autodesk family.","PlanGrid has built an innovative mobile SaaS solution that\u2019s focused on document centric work flows for field execution and project management. This is an excellent complement to our focus on model centric work flows through Revit and BIM 360.","On the field side of construction management, PlanGrid enables those working on the sites to making firm decisions with real time information. PlanGrid Solutions also empower project managers to ensure jobs are delivered within scope and on budget. The company currently serves 12,000 customers and as approximately 120,000 paid users. Its products have been used on over one million construction projects.","PlanGrid\u2019s quality and value are reflected by the many large customers it serves. Like LPR Construction, Devcon, Granite, Nvidia and Target. And we intend to capitalize on its strength to further advance the state of the art and construction technology and better meet the needs of our customers.","The combination creates a more comprehensive cloud based construction platform for general contractors and will expand our relationships with subcontractors and building owners. Overtime, we will integrate workflows between PlanGrid software and our BIM 360 construction management platform for a seamless exchange of 2D and 3D projects information.","Additionally, we will be able to leverage our global reach to accelerate adoption of PlanGrid Solutions. There are many GCs who have deployed both solutions; for example, DPR Construction is a commercial GC using Autodesk BIM 360 and PlanGrid software.","Atul Khanzode, DPR\u2019s CTO said, and I quote, \u201cOne of the biggest challenges in the construction industry is data flow, how you get the most current and accurate information to the right people at the right time. We\u2019re excited about this acquisition because it will improve the way information can be shared on project and that leads to greater productivity and predictability.","Using BIM 360 has made our project planning better. We\u2019re able to reliably plan, forecast and measure project tasks that will support lean construction practices and reduce waste. And we\u2019re using PlanGrid to help everyone in the fields build off the most current data set\u201d.","We\u2019re tremendously excited about joining forces with PlanGrid and I believe this will further position us for success as we move further into the 10 billion construction opportunity. Scott will cover financial details of the transaction in a few minutes, but I would like to turn our attention back to Q3 performance, particularly, I\u2019d like to highlight the performance of our BIM 360 portfolio.","We had a strong showing for the entire offering, which helped us posted 36% growth in cloud ARR in the quarter. Customers are deploying all modules of the BIM 360 platform, and I am excited to share that large customers like AECOM, Arcadis, Swinerton, and Layton have already started adopting our new platform, and we look forward to more customers doing the same.","A great example of the convergence of design and make was a significantly expanded deal we signed with Daiwa House industries, one of the largest construction companies in Japan. They sell prefabricated homes in the region and are working to expand globally. Their processes are a clear example of how manufacturing and construction are converging. They utilize a wide range of our product portfolio from AutoCAD and Revit to BIM 360 and Inventor.","Our new EBA with them is one of the largest we have signed and it increases the account value by 16 fold. We now have three of the largest five general contractors in Japan on EBAs and we are not done. These transactions also highlight the progress we have made in Japan as a region where we saw broad based strength across all customer types.","On the manufacturing side, our growth rate for the products family accelerated to 20% from 10% in the second quarter. During the quarter, we transitioned a major customer, Ford to an EBA. It is yet another example of how our relationship has expanded with our large enterprise customers where we\u2019ve evolved from a vendor to a collaborative thought leader.","We are partnering with Ford to help them explore new workflows utilizing our most advanced software functionality, such as general design and fusion and our flexible token based EBAs. This will allow them to benefit from the breadth of our product portfolio. We expect a fourth [Indiscernible] increase in subscriptions as a result of our new EBA contract.","In summary, I am extremely pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made with the transition and I believe we\u2019re positioning the company to expand our technology leadership in the construction space.","Many of you attended Autodesk University last week and I think you could feel the buzz and excitement in the air around both our core offerings and our cloud technologies like BIM 360 and Fusion. We are making terrific progress while remaining committed to our FY 2020 goals.","In particular, I am also excited to see that we crossed the 30% mark for the sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin. We look forward to nearly doubling that in the next few years.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for more details on the financials. Scott?","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. Digging deeper into the numbers for the third quarter, I\u2019ll start with a few more details on our strong ARR performance. ARR benefited from a 17% increase in ARPS, a 14% increase in subscriptions, and 30% growth in billings for the quarter.","Looking at subscriptions, we added 143,000 subs in the quarter and hit a milestone in total subscriptions as we crossed the 4 million mark, which is nearly twice the number of maintenance seats we had at the peak of the previous business model.","Subscription plan subs grew by 252,000 led by product subscriptions. Core sub ads once again increased by 3% sequentially and we also added 53,000 cloud subs which is a nice step up from the 31,000 we added in Q2, and 18,000 in Q1. Strength in cloud was led by broad based adoption of the BIM 360 family.","Moving to the maintenance for subscription program, we continue to make solid progress. In Q3, the customers migrated to 71,000 maintenance subs to products sub subscriptions, while the number of them to our subscriptions was down sequentially, the conversion rate remains strong with approximately one third of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions.","Of those that migrated, once again, over 30% of eligible subscriptions upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection. We expect the number of M2S subs to increase in Q4 as our maintenance renewal opportunity is higher.","The renewal rates for both maintenance and product subscriptions picked up slightly from Q2 and were in line with our planning assumptions. Helping to bolster renewal rates for product subscriptions are the M2S related subs, which have as expected very high renewal rates, because the program was designed to be sticky.","We expect the renewal rates for product subscriptions to continue to increase as the product mix shifts toward higher value products. Now let\u2019s talk a little more about annualized revenue per subscription or AARPs.","Total AARPs posted another quarter of strong growth, as it continued to benefit from the same drivers we discussed at Investor Day and that we saw in Q2. These drivers include the growth of the renewal base, the ongoing strength of industry collections, and various pricing adjustments we made earlier in the year and are now having a greater influence on AARP\u2019s.","The pricing adjustments included the price increase associated with the M2S program, lower channel discount on AutoCAD LT and an increase for multi-user subscriptions. Long term ARPS drivers will continue to be the growing renewal base which comes at a higher net price to Autodesk, the increase in digital sales also at a higher net price to Autodesk.","The product mix shift to Industry Collections, the maintenance price increase for those customers who don\u2019t take advantage of the M2S program and less discounting and promotional activity. We expect total ARPS to continue to increase for all the reasons I have just discussed as we progressed through the transition and well beyond fiscal 2020.","Our eStore which is like a bigger part of our digital sales grew over 65% year-on-year. For the past five quarters, our eStore has generated over 20% of the product subscriptions. Q3 also marked the eight consecutive quarter of greater than 30% growth in our EBAs. In fact, our EBAs posted over 50% growth in the quarter, highlighting strong execution as well as adoption and expansion of EBA contracts.","What\u2019s interesting is that while the growth of our total direct business accelerated even from the record levels in Q2, our indirect business expanded even faster. We continue to believe that over time the mix of direct business will outpace the growth of indirect, leading to a more even spilt between direct and indirect revenue.","Moving to spend management, our total non-GAAP was up 5% and was slightly higher than expected as we\u2019ve done a nice job following the open positions created by last year\u2019s resource rebalancing, . However, if we normalize for ASC 340 and foreign exchange rates, the year-over-year growth in total spend would have been less than 2%.","The sequential increase in spend was related to the continued hiring ramp that we\u2019ve been calling up for the past few quarters as we near the completion of the resource rebalancing, call costs are higher year-on-year and due to the impact of ASC 340 which requires us to capitalize sales commissions. Normalizing for ASC 340, the growth in total spend would have been less than 4%.","Looking at the balance sheet, total deferred revenue grew 17%, unbilled deferred revenue increased by $45 million sequentially to $451 million due to a strong EBA performance. We expect unbilled deferred revenue to increase meaningfully next quarter with seasonally strong enterprise transactions.","While we continue to experience and expect a decrease in long term deferred, our short term deferred revenue grew by 14% due to a strong billings in the quarter. Looking at cash flow, we generated $39 million in operating cash flow as we benefited from the growth in billings and strong cash collections.","We expect our cash flow to accelerate in the fourth quarter. We use $103 million in the quarter to buyback roughly 800,000 shares at an average price of $131.42. Year-to-date we have repurchased 2.1 million shares for $270 million, an average price of $129.86. We continue to be committed to managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.","Before I turn to the outlook, let me run through some details about our acquisition of PlanGrid. As announced this afternoon, we are paying $875 million net of acquired cash. We will finance the deal with cash on hand and a short term pre payable loan. The transaction is expected to close during our fiscal Q4. Since we cannot be sure of the exact timing, we have not included any impact in our guidance. That said, we would expect it to contribute slightly to revenue growth and be modestly negative for profitability and cash flows for the quarter.","For fiscal 2020, we expect PlanGrid to contribute approximately 100 million in ARR that create a slight headwind for our profitability. The transaction and associated financing costs will have some dilutive effect on our cash flow, but we believe we can achieve our goal of 1.35 billion in free cash flow for the year. There are more details about the company and our rationale behind the acquisition and a slide deck on our Investor Relations website.","Now let\u2019s turn to the discussion of our outlook. I\u2019ll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains mostly unchanged from the last few quarters, but we\u2019re monitoring the potential macroeconomic impacts from various trade and tariff disputes. There\u2019s been some foreign exchange volatility, but our hedging program has succeeded in smoothing out the bigger swings.","As we look at our outlook for Q4, we expect to see continued sequential increases in most metrics, including ARR, ARPS, Billings, Revenue, Spend and Earnings. We are raising our outlook on all of those key metrics for the year.","We expect our hiring ramp to continue as we finish the rebalancing of resources to the most strategic projects, and as such we expect our spend to increase slightly sequentially. However, the sequential uptick in total operating expense in the fourth quarter will be lower than previous years due to the adoption of ASC 340 that requires capitalization of commissions, which historically has been very heavy during Q4.","Given our full year expenses are moving up modestly, our operating margin for the year will be higher by one percentage point versus our previous target. Also our new margin forecast for the year represents nearly 17 points of improvement over last year, and we expect a sizable uptick in cash flow in Q4.","Regarding subscriptions, I\u2019ll reiterate the next quarter will be the last time we will report on subs and our ARPS on a quarterly basis. After that we will use events like our annual Investor Day to report on important metrics that will help you build your long term models.","For fiscal year 2019, we continue to expect subscription additions to end up at the low end of our guidance range, primarily related to the success we\u2019re having with the adoption of industry collections and the consolidation we\u2019re experiencing with the M2S program.","Before we start the Q&A part of this call, I want to summarize by highlighting the great progress we have made on driving the sum of our revenue growth plus free cash flow margin, which is a key metric for driving shareholder value under the rule of 40 framework.","We ended the quarter with the sum of both metrics at 32% [ph], a level we have not seen for four years. And as Andrew said, we plan to nearly double this metric in the next few years.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays Capital. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","Hi, guys. It\u2019s Saket from Barclays. Thanks for taking my questions here. First, maybe for you Andrew on PlanGrid, nice additions to the construction portfolio. I guess, longer term as you think about the construction software market, how important is it going to be that Autodesk has both the underlying BIM data as well as the PlanGrid capabilities versus others in the space that maybe don\u2019t have that underlying BIM data.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, that\u2019s an excellent question, Saket. So let me kind of give you a sense for where we are right now. Right now, a lot of the projects out there in the construction ecosystem are very document centric and that\u2019s where PlanGrid plays a very very strong role. But there\u2019s a growing percentage of projects that are very BIM centric. And these projects start with a \u2013 with BIM data and move BIM data for the entire process. But you\u2019ll see us over time be able to do is capture the BIM centric projects, the documents the centric projects and bring the two together.","PlanGrid really understands there\u2019s a document centric and sheet-centric workflow and they really have the hearts and minds of the end user in that space. We really understand the BIM data. And if those two things come together over time, and over a five year period or more, where more and more projects are BIM based, it is obviously going to allow us to cover almost 100% of the project ecosystem.","Saket Kalia","Got it. That\u2019s super helpful. Maybe staying on PlanGrid would you Andrew, can you just talk a little bit about the pricing model and maybe how it compares to others in the industry? I know you talked about general contractors and subcontractors and we\u2019ve heard others in the industry that perhaps based pricing on seat versus total value of a particular construction project. So can you talk a little bit about PlanGrid\u2019s pricing model?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so PlanGrid like us right now is predominantly a named user model. Now as you probably know we have experience in all the model types here. We have named user model, we have a pay-per-use consumptive model, and we have project based model. And what we found over time is that the models that are tending to be the predominant play are going to be named user and consumptive or pay per use. The project based models, they help in the short term, they allow you to kind of land an account and they provide short term growth, but long term, the customers basically just push back on this whole percent of turnover model. It\u2019s not an attractive model to the customers. So we absolutely see the pendulum swinging towards named user and pay-for-use and that PlanGrid is well aligned with that.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Andrew Anagnost","Thank you, Saket.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Hi, guys thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. As you mentioned this is probably the strongest quarter that I can think of, of having both a net add growth as well as \u2013 as well as a pretty impressive ARPS increase. What do you think about sort of what\u2019s driving that even in the context of higher cloud subs, typically higher -- lower ARPS?","Kind of walk us through sort of where we are and sort of the ARPS lifecycle, obviously you\u2019ve given your guidance for next year that implies increased versus what you guided to this year, but kind of help us through, like what are the drivers that were there this year, which one of those you\u2019ll continue into 2020, and then just have one follow up to that?","Scott Herren","Yes Phil, this is Scott. I think on the subs, you touched on we had another good quarter of sub ads for core and cloud had a \u2013 we\u2019re accelerating the sub ads with cloud business, so really driven by BIM 360. 53,000 cloud sub ads for the quarter, so that\u2019s on the subs front.","On the ARPS front, we\u2019re continuing to see the trend that we saw initially that we talked about in the Investor Day back in March and that we saw in Q2. So there\u2019s some effect from the change in channel discounts for AutoCAD LT that rolled out at the beginning of the year. We\u2019re seeing that a slight adjustment to our multi-year, our multi user product pricing at the beginning of this year, that\u2019s coming through as well. But more importantly, we\u2019re seeing a bigger renewal base, which you know comes at a higher net price to us. You\u2019re seeing an increase in direct sales at e-store. It\u2019s one of the stats I gave on the opening commentary was that e-store grew 65% this quarter, so that drives higher ARPS and the move to collections continues to be strong collections, are a notable percent of our total base both of new and of conversions on M2S and less discounting over time.","So all those factors drove ARPS last quarter, and again this quarter, and almost all those will continue out not just into fiscal 2020 but out in the fiscal 2023 as well.","Philip Winslow","Great. Awesome, and then follow up for Andrew on PlanGrid. And first off, congratulations on that deal, really reinforcing your leadership position defining construction lifecycle management as a market here. What do you think about PlanGrid and sort of the idea of construction lifecycle management? Where do you kind of put the dividing line between sort of where Autodesk is going to play versus call it traditional sort of more financials applications, what do you think about budgeting etcetera, kind of getting under the financial side of construction? Is that where you kind of separate how deep Autodesk wants to go in construction? Or is it eventually somebody that says, hey look, we\u2019re going to be a player in the entire lifecycle?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Phil I think you are absolutely touching on something that\u2019s important here. If you look at the way this evolved in the manufacturing space, what happened was, there was a rise of what were called product lifecycle management systems. And they basically handled the entire data flow from the design phase all the way through the delivery of the products in the manufacturing floor, but ERP systems continued to fill the void in terms of the whole financial planning and budgeting aspects and some of the financial aspects.","That\u2019s the way we see this unfolding in the future. We\u2019re not going to go into the ERP space of construction. We\u2019re going to stay on the whole lifecycle from design all the way through to site execution and we think that\u2019s well aligned with our vision of how construction is going to industrialize over the next 10 years.","So don\u2019t look, don\u2019t see us getting into construction financials and budget management and those kind of things in the future.","Philip Winslow","This basic idea is just sort of like PLM evolved from of the design software players becoming the leaders in PLM similar idea with you guys here, your design and the construction lifecycle management, but financials being a separate area. Is that a fair\u2026.","Andrew Anagnost","Absolutely. I see it playing out exactly the same way. And there is really \u2013 there\u2019s really no reason right now to not see it playing out the exact same way.","Philip Winslow","Great guys. Thanks a lot.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Andrew, let me start with you on this big dose of vitamin C that you\u2019re buying with PlanGrid, could you talk about two things, one, how do you foresee the integration into the portfolio, and then maybe talk about the technology roadmap here, and also what connection do you see if any of this acquisition to the manufacturing side of the portfolio?","In other words, as we heard last week at AU there\u2019s the growing connection with manufacturing to ADC and construction? Does this have any bearing on that? And could this also lay the groundwork or does this imply a future construction collection? Then a follow up.","Andrew Anagnost","All right. So let me let me start. There\u2019s actually three questions Jay. So I\u2019ll answer all of them, okay. All right so first off, let\u2019s talk about the product integration strategy. So let\u2019s kind of just pause and talk about what is each product family good at? All right PlanGrid has built an excellent SaaS Mobile native platform for documents centric workflows and sheet-centric workflows and project management layers. They capture issues, change orders and things in these document centric workflows.","They have done an absolutely exceptional job and you can tell by how far they\u2019ve reached down into the construction ecosystem and the products beloved [ph] by the end users. So they\u2019ve really nailed this -- this notion of document centric flow. You can see on the BIM 360 side, we have always been very BIM centric. We\u2019ve focused on how do you get BIM data deeper into the construction process. How do you explode it, so that it can be useful to more teams. So I think what you\u2019re going to see us doing with this portfolio integration especially over the next year and a half or so, is we\u2019re going to pull their document, their documents centric view up into BIM 360 and they\u2019re going to pull our model centric view down into their application. So basically you\u2019re going to see as close the loop between the document flows that go on and PlanGrid and the BIM data flows that go on in BIM 360.","And you\u2019ll see each team kind of double down on what its best at. So you\u2019ll see the BIM 360 team start to continue to move further upstream and its efforts on preconstruction and the PlanGrid team continue to execute more deeply on the document base closing and gaining insights from those flows.","Now in terms of the manufacturing integration, I think one of the things you\u2019re probably aware of, is as manufacturing industrializes more and more, what we classically call building product manufacturers are going to show up more and more in the construction world. They\u2019re going to be delivering products into the construction space. They\u2019re probably going to be one of the larger pre fabricators out there in terms of what we think.","These are companies right now that, that build things like adopting systems, air conditioning systems, curtain walls, prefabricated building, modular buildings, they are going to get more and more important. And as such, they will be a trade quote in the workflow and they\u2019ll likely be consuming some of these applications too as the owners propagate their construction flows into these applications.","So you\u2019ll absolutely see an overlap between what we classically call our product data management applications and these construction lifecycle applications. Now your last point on a construction collection, I wouldn\u2019t look for anything like that soon. The collections are primarily been targeted at the desktop products and integrating cloud based capabilities with a desktop product. We think we have the appropriate layer of overlap there. Right now, we\u2019re just going to keep rolling these products out separately and satisfy the needs of individual products projects in the construction ecosystem one at a time.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Quick follow up on M2S, could you talk about, this one for Scott. Any material differences you\u2019re seeing in adoption or conversion by deal [ph] for example within Europe, are you seeing any notable differences there or Asia or here in terms of rates of adoption of M2S?","Scott Herren","Yes, Jay, we are. So let me start by stating the conversion rate on M2S was unchanged this quarter. It\u2019s still staying at about a third maintenance agreement that came up for renewal that converted. So even though the number in absolute terms is smaller, just means that the number that came up for renewal is small, so no change in conversion rate. There is a difference for geo as you just pointed out. It\u2019s less so at the country level, it\u2019s more of what we typically see as new technologies roll out, where North America seems to be the earliest adopters followed by Continental Europe and then some of the emerging markets in Europe and then APAC comes in at the -- after Europe though. So that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing in our Maintenance to Subscription. We\u2019re furthest along in the U.S. , we\u2019re about where the US was within the last two or three quarters in Europe at this point and APAC is behind.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you. I do have follow-up on collections. You guys mentioned that there were notable percentage of your total base. I\u2019m just wondering if -- you said, I guess total base on M2S, I\u2019m just wondering are collections tracking faster than you thought and then what do you think it is now that\u2019s driving adoption for existing customers to look at collections when you had suite [ph] in the past what\u2019s caused then people to get more interested in them? And the other, I guess just real quick one would be your eStore progress, is that progressing faster than where you thought you would be right now? Thank you. Thank.","Scott Herren","Yeah, Heather, I\u2019ll start on the eStore. It\u2019s progressing right along with what our expectations are. We gave this data where 65% year-on-year during the third quarter that we disclosed. eStore continues to drive 20% or so of all of our products subs. So eStore is progressing nicely. I think there\u2019s more ground to cover there but the eStore is progressing nicely.","On the collections, they have moved faster than we had initially planned. And I think it\u2019s all upside. It\u2019s definitely good news. We spent, I think you\u2019ve heard me say this, an enormous amount of time and Andrew both in his current role, but also in his prior role, spent an enormous amount of time ensuring that we put the right content in those collections that we simplified it. We went from seven suites, which each had a good, better, best versions of 21 suites down to just three collections. So it\u2019s easier to sell, it\u2019s easier to buy and easier to pay and consume. But we also spend lot of time getting the product mix inside those collections right.","It\u2019s moved faster both for new customers and certainly it\u2019s moved fast on people converting from maintenance over to product subscription and stepping up at that point of collection. It\u2019s been a quite an upside.","Andrew Anagnost","And Heather, one of the things that\u2019s very different about the collections from the suite day is the integration with multi-platform in the cloud is a pretty significant delta from what we had in the suite day. So for instance, the AutoCADs you get in the box with a collection have a mobile version, they have a web version and also they\u2019re all integrated with a common data platform in the cloud so people can share their data. So it\u2019s a very different offering than what we had during the suite days.","Heather Bellini","Great. Thank you so much.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Heather.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Gal Munda","Hey, thanks for taking my question. The first one I have is about PlanGird. Can you talk a bit about the growth profile of the business and the way you expect maybe the contributions of sales to come into FY 2020? When you look at that, how does that contribute to kind of your target for FY 2023? That\u2019s my first question. Thanks.","Scott Herren","Yes. I\u2019ll start and then let Andrew chime in. They are running on a $60 million to $70 million revenue run rate right now and growing about 50% year-on-year. So that\u2019s what underpins one of the comments that I gave in the opening script and we expected to contribute around 100 million in ARR next year. There\u2019s likely to be some small haircut, deferred revenue haircut has we work through all the purchase accounting, but that\u2019s \u2013 that will drive a small amount of upside in ARR for fiscal 2020 and actually between that the small amount of headwind on profitability, small amount of financing cost will be a little bit of headwind on cash flows. We think we can contain that and still achieve for fiscal 2020, the $1.35 billion in free cash flow we put out there. Andrew, you want to talk about longer term.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So now, if we look out at the FY 2023 targets, Gal, remember one of the things we said very explicitly when we talked about this target was that the cloud and specifically construction was one of the things that was required to hit those targets. So what you\u2019re seeing us do right now is executing on the strategy that allows us to hit those numbers we put out there for FY 2023. So organic and inorganic tactics are actually how we\u2019re getting those numbers we\u2019ve put out there and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to -- that\u2019s how we are going to succeed in construction.","Gal Munda","Perfect. And just if I talk -- if I think about the customer overlap and the way you guys and they go to the market today, first, maybe, if you think about the U.S., that\u2019s where they\u2019re mainly based in, how much is the -- how much customer overlap there is? And in the past, you talked a bit about the stages of adoption in BIM. You start with the project and expand into division, maybe go companywide, entitywide, where is PlanGrid as compared to BIM 360 today? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So here\u2019s what\u2019s really exciting about this. We do have quite a bit of customer overlap, not a lot. They go deeper down into the system than we do. But what we don\u2019t have is project overlap, right. And what happens in the construction space is technology is sold on a project-by-project basis. So for instance, in accounts where we do overlap BIM 360 is on a completely different project and PlanGrid is used on another project.","So what you see is, PlanGrid is built to go-to-market machine, it\u2019s very good at selling on a project-by-project basis. We\u2019ve got a lot of success with BIM 360 selling to the IT departments in the large GC and the mid-sized GCs. So, there is a really great complement between their project-centric go-to-market approach and our IT or top of the market go-to-market approach. So you can see it\u2019s actually coming at some of our companies in different ways.","The other growth synergy we\u2019re obviously going to see is taking the PlanGrid technology international, into EMEA and into APAC. So, yes, there is an overlap but the overlap is by account, not by projects. We do not share any projects.","Gal Munda","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. You mentioned in the prepared remarks talking about the outlook and your commentary on macro is that it hasn\u2019t changed, but ahead of the G20 and a lot of concerns over trade discussions, et cetera, kind of what are you hearing specifically from customers in EMEA and APAC and what are your thoughts here going into next quarter from a macro perspective?","Scott Herren","Yes. Sterling, we are not seeing any impact on macro at this point, it\u2019s something that obviously I think everyone is looking very closely for. We\u2019ve been watching since the beginning of the year, frankly, to see if there\u2019s any effect in the UK or across the northern Europe from Brexit. We\u2019re not seeing that, we\u2019re not seeing it in demand. We\u2019re not seeing it in pipeline build. We\u2019ve also been watching very carefully with the trading tariff situation, the way it\u2019s escalated over the last couple of months, we\u2019re not seeing any impact there. There is the anecdotal here and there, we\u2019re not seeing any impact on demand and we\u2019re not seeing any impact on pipeline build at this point. So, to this point the demand environment still remains robust and from what we can see it will continue that way through the end of the year.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. I just came off of Autodesk University, and I spend a lot of time with construction and manufacturing customers and yes sure some of them are seeing increases in the material costs, but they are all seeing increases in material costs. So really it\u2019s not affecting their ability to execute on projects relative to their competition. So they\u2019re still investing in technology from our side because they are all seeing the same kind of small impact in their material costs, but it\u2019s not translating into any kind of impact on our business because the people have to get their job done.","Sterling Auty","That makes sense. And then my follow-up on PlanGrid, as you look at that space given the number of competitors that are in it, can you help us by comparing and contrasting what you think PlanGrid\u2019s, particular strengths were versus the other competitors in that space?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, you\u2019e right, it is a very competitive space, Sterling. There is lots of competition in this space. What we look at \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of important things. One, PlanGrid built an excellent SaaS native application, that\u2019s where our focus is on the BIM 360 portfolio. Everything started SaaS native, they\u2019ve got an excellent set of technologies that are well tuned in mobile workflows, so they started with a stack that\u2019s highly scalable, highly SaaS-focused, highly mobile-centric and that\u2019s super important moving forward because that\u2019s the paradigm that you have to go with. You don\u2019t want to have to retool some underlying architecture to be more SaaS or mobile friendly. So that was number one, right?","Number two is, they are covering a set of project requirements that we don\u2019t necessarily cover as well with BIM 360. So they have that really robust document-centric flow, we have that really robust BIM-centric flow. Another thing that\u2019s super important, they\u2019re right down the street. All right, they\u2019re right here in San Francisco, it allows us to tap more robustly into the San Francisco talent pool, it\u2019s highly synergistic with our location strategy, so we\u2019re able to build up a stronger construction presence here in San Francisco. ","And then finally there is big synergy with their business models. The business models are nicely aligned. As we discussed earlier when Saket asked, there is pluses and minuses to the various business models out there and we felt very strongly that the named user in pay-per-use models are the winning models and project-based models hit a brick wall. So it was really important for us to look at all these things out there in terms of execution. That what lead us in this direction. They really got the right application in the right space at the right time.","That\u2019s what let us in this direction. They\u2019ve really got the right application in the right space the right time.","Sterling Auty","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Matt Hedberg","Hey guys, thanks. I\u2019ll offer my congrats as well. Scott, can you help us how we should think through the impact of multi-year contracts to your -- you reiterate fiscal 2010 free cash flow targets, but is the plan to get back to more historical levels, is that primarily channel incentives to drive that behavior?","Scott Herren","Matt. It\u2019s a great question. You remember this is one thing that I talked about as we were laying out the road to the $1.35 billion free cash flow for fiscal 2020 when I walked though that back at our Investor Day. And it really is about seeing multi-year sales kind of revert to its historic mean. We artificially depressed multi-year sales, we launched the Maintenance to Subscription program because we shot up all multi-year maintenance, we had to given three years of visibility to price increases that we\u2019re going to happen there.","So I\u2019d say it\u2019s more returning to the norm that it has been, which if you recall, I said, is about 20% of our sales. And that is focused on product subscription getting to that multi-year point. What that will mean is long term deferred will get up to less than it has been historically but probably into that 15% to 20% range below where it had been historically closer to 30% of our total deferred revenue, so it really is just about reverting that and that\u2019s both a channel play and through our mid-market team.","Matt Hedberg","That\u2019s great. And then just maybe just a quick one. As we think forward to Q1, what\u2019s the right way to think about sort of like a cost of living price increase across the subscription portfolio of products? Is that kind of the right way to think about on an annual basis, just kind of like a cost of living increase?","Scott Herren","It is Matt. That\u2019s not a decision that we\u2019ve made or rolled out yet, but what we\u2019ve said is over the long term expect to see us have annual price increases that are in that low-single digit kind of cost of living range longer term. We haven\u2019t talked through or made the decisions on what kind of a price increase to look like beginning of next year.","Andrew Anagnost","Now as you know, we have published long-term price expectations for our M2S customers. So anyone who have taken the M2S offering has a 10-year visibility to how the cost of their subscription is going to trend over time, which is something we felt was really important to do for some of our best customers..","Matt Hedberg","Absolutely. Thanks again guys. Congrats.","Andrew Anagnost","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Brad Zelnick","Thanks so much and congrats as well on PlanGrid and on a great quarter. I wanted to ask about the strength in EBAs and as well if you can comment about where we are in the shift to annual billings for EBAs and on penetrating within the enterprise?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Brad, thanks for that question. The EBA business continues to grow strongly. So if you remember the stat we gave, and we have updated this at our midyear point that I would expect to see this updated on our Investor Day last year and we\u2019re about 45% penetrated through our base of EBA-eligible customers. So obviously we made little more progress on that. I expect to update that penetration rate when we come to the next investor day next March. What I\u2019d say is we\u2019ve seen great benefit, as do our customers see great benefit as they convert over to EBAs, usage goes up significantly at that renewal point because of the increased usage of that first renewal point we see anywhere from 40% to 45% higher renewal at the first renewal point because the usage goes up so much during that period.","So the EBA business continues to grow strongly. I think the statistic we gave earlier was that the enterprise business grew about 50%, during the quarter we just closed and it continues to be a focus area for us.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. If I could just follow-up on PlanGrid you\u2019d said that you expect it will be dilutive to fiscal 2020 cash flow, but yet good to see your maintaining your fiscal 2020 target, but I guess its fair to assume its going to be accretive to fiscal 2023, any way to quantify that?","Scott Herren","Yes, so it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to update those fiscal 2023 targets at this point. We haven\u2019t even closed the transaction yet. So I don\u2019t want to get into addressing fiscal 2023. It clearly is a part of the strategy we have laid out to get to our fiscal 2023 targets. In terms of fiscal 200, to back up to that piece they are bringing along a fairly robust revenue stream in addition, so it will be slightly dilutive to profitability in fiscal 2020 and slightly dilutive to free cash flows but we think we can contain it within our fiscal 2020 target of $1.35 billion of free cash flow.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Brad, one of the frequent questions I get when I am now talking to the investment communities, they ask us also, how are you going to get to those construction numbers in the fiscal 2023 target. Well, now you know, it\u2019s going to be a combination of organic and inorganic actions like what you just saw.","Brad Zelnick","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Tout of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Alex Tout","Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Just firstly, on the BIM side and kind of more the concept of BIM, are you seeing any more government or agency mandates coming through that might act as sort of general catalysts for the BIM market and your attack on the market first of all? And then on the manufacturing side, you mentioned the interesting Ford example and how this was at least driven in part by generative design. We\u2019ve also got concepts like digital twin and IIoT getting a lot of attention on the manufacturing side. But do you maybe see these initiatives in manufacturing as a little bit further out than the construction opportunity? Just your thoughts there on kind of how quickly those opportunities are developing relatively speaking. Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Right. So, Alex. Remind me what your first question was, because I got\u2026","Alex Tout","Sorry.","Andrew Anagnost","BIM mandate, Okay. Thank you. Yes. Because I got \u2013 I started taking those. All right. Let me talk about the BIM mandate. So we\u2019re absolutely seeing more momentum around governments and owners mandating BIM as part of their building process and as part of their specification process. We expect this to continue as time goes on. You remember what happened with the UK mandates and how that drove some pretty intense adoption of Revit in the UK markets and surrounding markets. You\u2019re going to see more and more of those. It\u2019s just part of what\u2019s going to happen.","We are very interested in seeing BIM based permitting processes, getting the government entities as well. That\u2019s going to be something that we\u2019d like to be part of helping people understand and do. Now, when it comes to the manufacturing opportunity, what you said there about it being somewhat further out, I think what you\u2019re seeing right now, especially with our execution is on the construction side, you\u2019ve got this perfect storm of technologies ready, the mobile platform as it is today and the cloud is absolutely 100% suited to what the construction industry needs. The customers are ready. They know they have to digitize and the products are ready. That\u2019s why you see this intense doubling down on the construction opportunity in the near term right now.","You look at manufacturing, tools like generatives and some of these other tools, IoT by the way we just see IoT as an input to generative, that\u2019s how you collect data and you use it to put information in. It\u2019s something we pioneered with the Hack Rod initiative a couple of years back. These initiatives are all very much in the exploratory stages of manufacturers, large and small. And what they\u2019re doing is they are sitting there going well. I know that these technologies, the cloud, high-performance computing in the cloud, connected workflows generative, all of these things are going to have a big impact on my business. I just don\u2019t know how I am going to deploy them yet. So you\u2019ll see those start to get much more traction over an 18 to 24-month horizon whereas construction is kind of a now opportunity.","Alex Tout","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your line is now open.","Richard Davis","Hey thanks. Maybe a longer-term question. You may or may not want to name names, but when we think about kind of how the growth, the unit growth will come as you kind of go through your transition, subscription in cloud, how should we think about the mix of you guys chipping away market share from your competition versus kind of acquiring because we\u2019ve talked about this before, acquiring pirate and\/or kind of getting people that are laggards to pay -- to become more sustainable but paying customers, is that 50-50, is it 60-40, or how you think about that?","Andrew Anagnost","All right. Richard, I can\u2019t give you a percentage, but here\u2019s the philosophical answer I\u2019ll give you. In the short term what you\u2019re going to see is piracy or what we call non-genuine users, piracy, non-genuine users and legacy users are going to be a more important driver, but in the long-term as you head out three to five years you\u2019re absolutely going to see us chipping away competitors in this space, especially in the manufacturing space.","The growth in Fusion is prefacing what\u2019s going on in terms of our ability to execute in that space. There\u2019s an absolute change in the manufacturing market and that change favors the cognitive, and we\u2019ve invested, we\u2019ve been patient. We work hard on that and its going to pay off in terms of share shift long term.","So the way I have you think about this is, the one to three-year horizon you\u2019re going to see a lot of these non-genuine users and legacy users coming in. When you look out two to three, to five-year horizon you\u2019re going to see some share shift coming into the mix.","Scott Herren","Yes. And what I\u2019ll add to that, Richard, is on the construction market, this is the -- we stated a $10 billion opportunity over time, but it\u2019s probably less than a million today. The last time we did our own survey. We thought it was around the $500 million market today. So I think a lot of its growth going ahead is not necessarily reclaiming nonpaying users, whether they are legacy or pirates or share gains frankly in that space and where we have to take it from someone else. I think, in the construction market, that\u2019s just an enormous amount of growth that\u2019s going to happen in that marketplace, so ahead of us we\u2019re really well positioned. But it\u2019s a big market and there\u2019s a lot of competitors in that space. I think there\u2019s an up market there for all of us to grow.","Richard Davis","Yes. I agree. That\u2019s good thought. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Stan Zlotsky","Hi, guys. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Just a quick clarification. When we think about the fiscal 2023 targets and the M&A, the inorganic I guess, contributions to get there beyond PlanGrid, should we be expecting similar type of transactions in the future? And then a quick follow-up on the cloud part of the business in the quarter?","Andrew Anagnost","So we\u2019ve always been acquisitive, all right. We\u2019ve been an acquisitive company. The last two years were an anomaly. What you\u2019re seeing is entering back into a period where we\u2019ll actually be acquisitive again. So we\u2019re going to make disciplined choices between inorganic and organic execution over the next five years in all of the new markets we\u2019re participating in. Construction being the first, manufacturing not being immune either, so I think you\u2019ll continue to see us doing appropriate organic and inorganic actions. And I can\u2019t remember -- what was your second question?","Stan Zlotsky","I didn\u2019t originally state it. The official -- the official question, so the 53,000 cloud subs that we just saw in the quarter was a nice uptick versus the trend that we saw in Q1 and Q2 and you specifically mentioned that it came from BIM 360. But maybe just digging into that one, what is it about BIM 360 that really drove such a strong result within the cloud, a portion of the product? Was it better renewal rates, maybe just help us to unpack that number a bit? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","There\u2019s two factors. One, and you might recall a year ago -- the infamous year ago, we had stopped doing promotions that were pushing kind of low-end BIM 360 products into our channel. We now have clean year-over-year compares from those days. So what you see is the year-over-year compares are more representative of where we\u2019re going with the business. The other piece that I think is really important to pay attention to is that you know that six or nine months ago we rolled out the new platform for BIM 360 that was integrating our field and planned functionality on a single platform. That platform is now starting to get adoption in some of our largest customers and what you\u2019re seeing is the pull through in the BIM 360 business as a result.","Stan Zlotsky","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Andrew Anagnost","You\u2019re very welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from of Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Zane Chrane","Great. Thanks for fitting me in and congrats on a great quarter guys. You had really strong growth in EMEA and APAC and that\u2019s really impressive given the fact that these regions tend to lag in cloud and subscription adoption versus North America. I\u2019m just wondering is the strong growth you\u2019re seeing in those regions being driven more by customers getting more comfortable with these types of deployment models, or is it -- is it more macro driven such that there\u2019s maybe a uptick in construction or manufacturing demand? Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. And it\u2019s a little bit different story between APAC and EMEA. I think in EMEA we are seeing better penetration. We\u2019re seeing better uptake, both of the new model types and of cloud across EMEA. I think in APAC what you see is more than the fast growth rate we\u2019re seeing there is more common on the year earlier quarter where as you recall, we\u2019ve struggled for a couple of years in Japan, made several changes there, changes in our market structure, changes in our own team, frankly to drive execution and we\u2019re really seeing Japan turnaround very nicely, and that\u2019s fueling a lot of the growth that we see in APAC. So it\u2019s a little bit, a little bit of a different story between the two.","Zane Chrane","That\u2019s great. And just a quick follow up, any difference in the macro outlook in those regions versus North America?","Andrew Anagnost","No, not at this time.","Zane Chrane","Got it. Right. Thanks very much guys.","Andrew Anagnost","Yup.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","Hi, thanks for taking the question. So first off, when you look at the construction opportunity, what if anything do you need to do to better address the building owner constituent who may not be as familiar with Autodesk as they are with say a traditional ERP vendor?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so we actually have a very quiet product that we have out there in the market already called BIM 360 Ops. And one of the big value propositions of BIM in general is that it leaves behind a 3D model that is a huge asset to the owner in terms of managing, maintaining and using their assets as time progresses. So we\u2019ve been experimenting in that space. What you\u2019re going to do is see us getting deeper penetration there from a couple of fronts frankly. Some of our lead customers are actually starting to become more owners because they see, they see opportunity for them in managing building spaces. There some of the customers that are using BIM 360 Ops now, BIM 360 Ops are in that category. So you\u2019ll see us getting more awareness in that space simply because some of our customers are starting to participate more in that part of the market.","Ken Talanian","Okay, great. And another question, could you give us a sense for some of the factors that drove your renewal rates up and what levers you might have going forward?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes Ken, we just, we continue to see \u2013 so let\u2019s say maintenance efforts from subscription -- line of products subscription. We continue to see maintenance rates hold off despite the move from maintenance to subscription, and gave you the stat that more than 30% of those eligible actually moved from an individual product to a collection, which means they probably have more maintenance subscriptions and fewer industry collections subscription. So despite that fact and despite the price increase, we continue to see maintenance renewal rates hold up nicely.","So that\u2019s a positive little surprise, we\u2019re not seeing faster migration frankly from maintenance over to product subscription. But at this point, the price difference between the two is still pretty nominal. That price gap will expand next year. Product subscription is just -- it\u2019s continued adoption and deep adoption and building that product subscription into your workflows such that it becomes an indispensable tool much like the products have been back in a perpetual license world. So, each of those are progressing, actually picking up modestly, but picking up quarter-on-quarter. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Abhey Lamba for closing remarks.","Abhey Lamba","Yes, thanks. This concludes the conference call.

Welcome to the Autodesk First Quarter Fiscal Year 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. David Gennarelli, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","David Gennarelli - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our first quarter of FY 2016. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors.","As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2016, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we used to estimate our guidance including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.

And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a solid start in fiscal 2016 with good progress on our business model transition. We're particularly pleased with the 95,000 subscription additions in the quarter. We continue to experience high growth rates for new model subscriptions such as term based desktop subscriptions, enterprise flexible license offerings and cloud based services. It's worth noting that these new model subscriptions accounted for approximately half of our subscription additions for the quarter. We achieved our Q1 financial results despite the backdrop of an uneven macro economy and currency headwinds. To put it into numbers, the strong dollar impacted Q1 billings by approximately $31 million and revenue by approximately $22 million and that after our hedging was applied.","It's also worth noting that for the first time in recent memory, we had very limited promotional activity in the quarter. This was intentional as we wanted to digest the activity that had led up to the end of sale for upgrades. We do have more promotional activity going on here in Q2 to spur demand and we implemented a small price adjustment in both euro and yen.","From a geographic perspective, our revenue results in EMEA and the Americas remain strong despite unevenness in certain areas. We also experienced growth in most of APAC, while Japan continued to be impacted by unfavorable economic conditions. From an industry perspective, our Q1 results were driven by strength in both our AEC and manufacturing business segments.","Taking a closer look at AEC, we're really pleased to see growth being delivered by our Building Design Suite and our Infrastructure Design Suite. It's great to see strength in these core products, but what gets us excited is the interest we're seeing in the new cloud-based products like BIM 360, which is being adopted in the construction field and InfraWorks 360, which is being adopted by infrastructure firms. InfraWorks is now being deployed in significant projects such as a hydro project in China and with a U.S. state DOT for its planning and design projects.","Our manufacturing team delivered a strong growth in Q1, driven by the contribution from Delcam. It's been a year since the Delcam acquisition and we are really pleased with the addition of the team and how that business has maintained its momentum, extending Autodesk much deeper into the manufacturing process with industry-leading CAM technology.","Delcam's focus is in the mold, tool and die sector as well as high-end production machining. Our HSM CAM business is focused on an integrated solution for the SMB market working with Inventor Fusion 360 and competitive products. Our HSM business closed hundreds of transactions and added hundreds of new customers in Q1.","Once again, we are encouraged by what we're seeing with our cloud-based manufacturing products like PLM 360 and Fusion 360. PLM 360 continues to expand our base by attracting customers that are new to Autodesk, as well as being adopted by our existing customers. We're also seeing a continued trend of existing PLM customers coming back to add on to their original deal. In Q1, we had a record quarter for total PLM 360 deals with many new companies buying, as well as many companies expanding their use of PLM 360.","There are a lot of exciting things happening with Fusion 360 recently and the buzz around the product is building. Fusion 360 is such a game-changer for both startups and established manufacturers that we wanted to make it simple to purchase and make it very accessible. So earlier this month, we simplified the pricing structure and made Fusion 360 subscriptions available-for-sale on Amazon.com.","It's clear that the way products are being designed and built is changing and customers are looking for tools to support these changes. Our cloud-based products like BIM 360, PLM 360, and Fusion 360 are leading the market.","Just as we have changed the engineering and PLM markets with cloud-based products, we're doing the same with the Internet of Things. Across all the industries we serve, there is great interest in this technology. In the near-term, we can monitor buildings and factories to optimize operating conditions such as energy use, safety, and preventative maintenance.","Today's industrial products, commercial buildings and urban infrastructure have sensors built into them. The world of the future includes capturing and analyzing data from these sensors, incorporating the learnings into the next generation of products and designing new products that respond to real-time to changing conditions. The Internet of Things has the potential to substantively change design from creating static, inert, discrete things to creating dynamic networks of interacting things, environments and media. We think we are in a fantastic position to lead this market.","Now, let's talk more about our business transition. I think what is getting lost on some people is that we're not just changing our business model, we are transforming our business and the products that our customers use. The cloud is enabling our customers to think differently about how they approach design, simulation, production, and collaboration and doing so in ways that were not previously possible. We're also expanding our presence into new markets and adding new customers to our sizeable base.","It's worth repeating that our business model transition will not be perfectly linear and that the amount of business that we transition, the number of subscription additions and the mix of subscription additions will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Earlier this year, we announced that we would stop selling new perpetual offerings from most of the standalone products at the end of our fiscal year, which is January 31 of calendar 2016. We will also discontinue selling new perpetual licenses for suites some time in fiscal 2017.","At that point, nearly all revenue will come from ratably recognized offerings including desktop and cloud subscriptions, EBAs and maintenance. This will naturally put downward pressure on reported revenue in FY 2017 as perpetual license offerings are discontinued. From there, we would expect a material rebound in the income statement the following year. Of course, the model transition will positively impact deferred revenue and subscription additions, which we expect will continue to have healthy year-on-year growth rates during the transition years.","The unevenness of the current macro environment has reduced near-term visibility somewhat. When coupled with the persistent FX headwinds, it calls for a little bit more caution in our outlook. Our original assumption was that FY 2016 would be more backend loaded than usual given the deadline for end of sale for new perpetual individual product offerings. We continue to believe that's how the year will shape up and likely a little softer in the middle quarters.","Our forecast for FY 2016 now assumes seven points of currency headwinds for billings and five points of currency headwinds for revenue after applying our hedge, which equates to over $160 million of billings and over $100 million in revenue. That's a lot of money.","To wrap things up, we're pleased with the start of FY 2016 and the pace of our business transition. We remain confident in our long-term business model transition goals of 12% billings CAGR, 20% more customer value, 50% more subscriptions and 30% operating margins. We look forward to building on these early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription based model over the coming years.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you very much and I apologize for any background noise. Just first question, wondering how much of a benefit to Q1 billings is there any way to size this, Carl, it just came from the upgrade extension that existed through early March?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Not a huge amount. We saw a little bit of pull-through at the beginning of the quarter, from the end of the previous quarter. So I think in \u2013 but it was not substantial.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then we've obviously spoken with some of your customers and partners, but I'm curious what you are hearing anecdotally just in terms of feedback from them with regards to the recently announced perpetual licensing changes?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, what we've seen \u2013 I mean there is \u2013 the changes just went in effect very recently. So I don't think it's reached the end customer to any significant degree. The partners are first starting to get ready for it. Like we said, we had almost no promotions in Q1. We wanted to digest what went on at the end of last year and get people ready for this three quarter March to the \u2013 ending license sales. So, I think it will take probably another month or two until we really see what the reaction from customers are. But generally speaking, they've been favorable and most of the results point that way.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, yeah...","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do you have anything to add, Scott?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Gregg, one of the things that is encouraging on that front is if you look at the 95,000 subscription adds we had in Q1, about half of them came from the new model types. So, there is \u2013 we are building pretty good acceptance in the early days at least on the new model types.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon. Just a question on the guidance and I want to make sure we understand this correctly. You left your constant currency guidance for the full year unchanged, but you talked about this unevenness and I know you've changed your as reported guide due to FX. But beyond the FX, is there something that's making you more nervous as you look at the economy, you talk about this unevenness and I think everyone in Japan has had issues.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","But, what \u2013 you did leave your constant currency unchanged. So I'm just curious that is there some inconsistent statements that you're making in terms of how you're thinking about \u2013 is it looks \u2013 as it relates to the...?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me put things on both sides of the ledger. Generally, I feel good is, as Scott just said, about the transition to the new model and most parts of the world seem to be doing well. And in that way, our plans are unchanged. If you wanted me to rank, you know, my first budget, number one on my first budget would be FX; number two would be Japan; and number three would be Russia. And I don't think the list really goes longer than that. Those are the things, I think, FX has been more of a headwind than we anticipated on Japan and Japan can continue to be weak. Russia, we've already cut our business in such a substantial way that its impact is going to taper off. But if I wanted \u2013 anyhow if I wanted to prioritize for you, Brent, that's probably the best that I could do.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. But your statement just in not changing your constant currency, just the sense of you're not seeing a lot of this have a major impact is just this is \u2013 it sounds like it's more FX related?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There is a lot of FX. I am \u2013 I'd be not completely candid if I say I am not worried about Japan. Right now, Japan is one of our biggest markets. You're seeing \u2013 as you mentioned, others have had trouble there. I think it can continue. Generally speaking, when Q1 is weak for Japan, it's a weak year for Japan. So, I have some nervousness around Japan. But as I said somewhat tongue in cheek, it's a lot of money, having a couple hundred million dollars is a lot of money for us just to go in FX. And so I usually feel better about both our hedging policy as well as kind of the buffer we have built in with the rates and this time I had less confidence in that.","Brent J. Thill - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. One of the things that we're all trying to figure out here, as you go through the business model transition is the push and pulls between whether people are going to be hoarding perpetual licenses upfront or whether you're going to be able to convince guys to go to desktop subscription more fully or more wholesomely upfront as we go through this transition. Any indications you could give us, it's been in the market for a couple of months now. Any indications you could give us on how you think that's going to break, which direction it's going to break?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, Keith, we've been trying to be totally transparent as we don't actually \u2013 we have a number of models and we have a number of knobs and levers to move during the year, as we see it. I think you'll see first break this quarter and we'll have a little bit of understanding of that. And then we can adjust some things as we go through the rest of the year. But it's not as obvious \u2013 I was obviously encouraged that people \u2013 many higher subscription numbers in Q1. So we'll just have to see how that plays out, but that was at least a positive sign.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Keith, the other thing that besides what Carl just mentioned about the half of our net adds coming from new model in Q1, when we look at the promotional activity that we've got queued up for Q2 and through the end of the year, there is a couple of different trust behind that. One is going to the installed base and offering a way for them to \u2013 if they're ready to move to subscription offer away for them to get there on a multi-year basis with a slight discount. And the other is really going directly after the LT base in Europe and there are LT customers to the extent that they are willing to or want to buy another perpetual license and will buy a multi-year, they can get a scaled up discount on that depending on how many years of maintenance they decide to buy upfront. So, you'll see us doing more from a promotional standpoint that help drive that shift.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And let me just try and \u2013 Keith, let me just try to give you a little bit of color on promotions, because certainly if I read some of your notes, the extrapolations were somewhat imperfect. And so the first thing what was clear, over the last few years, we have centralized much more of our promotional activity around the world. So it used to be that this was a more decentralized activity done by sales leaders in the geographies. And at any point, we could have literally dozens of promotions going on. Over the last few years, those have been centralized. So that's just the first thing. So that we have a really good handle what they are.","Second one is there were almost no promotions in the first quarter. It's the lowest level of promotional activity I have ever seen certainly in my tenure. And the third thing is that when you have picked up from talking to customers or resellers, any pricing changes, those have not been promotional activities driven by us. As you know, we don't control end user pricing and we obviously have an impact on it. But those were things initiated by some of our partners. And so \u2013 and then I just conclude the color commentary on promotions by saying, now we have a pretty robust promotional program going through Q2, Q3 and Q4 and so you should start picking up signs of that in your channel checks.","Keith E. Weiss - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And if I could perhaps sneak one last one in. So we're on this sort of the beginning a business model transition, which isn't just pricing model, it's about how you guys are taking product to market something that you guys think is going to add a lot of value to the business over the next two years to three years. And I would argue is probably not terribly well understood by investors and probably not fully reflect into the stock. If that's the case, why aren't you guys buying back your stock more aggressively here?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Keith, when we look at our \u2013 that's obviously a question about capital allocation. So the first thing I would say is when you look at the $2 billion plus of cash we have in the balance sheet as you probably saw in the prepared remarks, 86% of that is offshore. But it hasn't really affected the way we think about allocating capital. So just to reiterate first and foremost it's to support the business during the transition, whether that's organic growth or that's M&A type growth.","Second, it's about managing the dilution of the equity plans and by the way, that includes not just our SKUs, but our employees stock purchase plan that everyone has the opportunity to participate in. And then it's beyond that, it's to reduce the outstanding share count. So that policy is still in place and that's still really where our head is as we look at the next couple of years.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we've just gone through capital planning review. And stay tuned, we're not ready to say anything at this point. But we've just gone through a fairly comprehensive review of looking at the next few years and what the capital requirements are. So, you'll see more in the coming months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Carl, I'd like to ask a couple of questions regarding what the steady state that the business might look like starting in fiscal 2018 in two respects, and you touched on it in part when you talked about your products and how they're being used differently. So, the first question is you already have a reasonably complex product line in terms of numbers of SKUs, numbers of configurations per suite and so forth. And the question is versus what the portfolio looks like today, do you think the portfolio in fiscal 2018 is somewhat more simplified or reduced, for example, when you come out with subscribe to Autodesk, do you think that even with various flavors of that, that you might in effect consolidate the product line or do you think that it just expands, you just introduced a new suite, for example. So what do you think the general direction of the scope of the portfolio looks like?","And then just a second question for Scott, also looking at what the steady state might look like? Would it be fair to say that in terms of the margin leverage you get, once you're on the other side of this transition that sales and marketing as a percent of revenue is where you get the most leverage perhaps several 100 basis points of reduction, sales and marketing, and that you might even have a flat to lower absolute spending of sales and marketing at some point?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So let me just start. What I would say is right now, we're probably at the height of complexity of our product portfolio, because we really have one foot in each world. As we move forward, what I think you will see for the more traditional desktop products is subscribe to Autodesk will tend to be the primary way our customers buy. And so there maybe underlying that offer individual products, but certainly, as you would see them through our financial statements, these will look like subscribe to Autodesk. As you know, subscribe to Autodesk is just the umbrella term we're using for bringing our flexible license offerings to the majority of our customers. And so there may be underneath it product names that you're familiar with today, but the method in which they buy will be more common there.","Secondly, I'd say, as we've looked at our cloud offerings, the one thing about many of our cloud offerings is they are not as distinct as desktop offerings, that the services that you offer in a web-based environment tend to blur together and all fall under a single subscription fee. With different kind of levels, but I think from the outside, it will be much more transparent, it will be much easier to discern what's going on. And the intention is for customers, it's much easier for them to choose. So a lot of the emphasis on the changing business model here is to allow customers to be much more flexible. We've talked about many times, how we see flexible license offerings is both being good for our business and really good for our customers. So that's the general direction. I think you're probably at the apex of product portfolio complexity, and certainly as you get to FY 2018, you'll see considerable simplification.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And, Jay, this is Scott. To your question on sales and marketing as a percent of revenue leverage, for sure we'll get a good deal of leverage as we get \u2013 kind of reestablish steady state in that fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 timeframe for a couple of reasons, one of which is just scale and sales and marketing is our highest spend as a percent of revenue. So, of course, that means it's going to get the greatest leverage as we scale. We'll also see channel mix shift out in time. Our reseller channel will continue to be the overwhelming majority of our sales, but we will see some mix shift and we're starting to see a little bit of that today and as we do, that will drive also leverage in sales and marketing. To the extent that it comes out in absolute terms, that's a little far out to be able to project at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brendan Barnicle from Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brendan J. Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks so much. And, Carl, thanks for reiterating that fiscal 2018 guidance. I wanted to drill down on maybe how we get there a little bit. It sounded like based on your comments that fiscal 2017, not this year, would be the low in terms of revs and EPS and if that's so, do you also expect that billings would remain positive in fiscal 2017 as we go through this transition or would those dip negative as you make the change?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's a chance it dips negative. A lot depends on the pace of change. So the question that was asked earlier, a huge amount depends on how quickly people move between the two models. We'll update you as we see it develop, but I don't think it's wrong to assume that it dips in FY 2017 and I think it is correct to say that FY 2017 is the low point. That will be the place where the customers are most compelled to do something and make a choice.","And let me just remind you, to the extent that we're most successful in transitioning customers to the new models, which is what we really want to do because the financial model at the other end of the rainbow is so promising, is that it will impact traditional income statement metrics. So it's a mixed bag for us, so while we root for it, it definitely brings down the traditional metrics that people look at.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And, Brendan, that same dynamic is in play this year, right, to the extent that it moves much more quickly to new models and away from perpetual sales, we will see that in the reported revenue results this year. We will continue to see the build in subscribers, we will continue to see the build in deferred revenues, but that same dynamic that we're talking about in fiscal 2017 is also in play for the remainder of this year.","Brendan J. Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Great, thanks. And, Scott, just following up quickly on the cash flow you mentioned in the prepared comments, the higher payout of variable employee comp. And just curious whether given that you didn't see as much this quarter if you had just more direct sales in Q4 and then whether direct sales met the expectations for Q1 or if that's just a seasonal pattern we should start modeling?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. What really impacted cash flow from ops in Q1 was really \u2013 was two things. So we talked about both of these when we talked about our income statement in Q4, but they both came out of cash in Q1. One was the variable comp plans. Fiscal 2015 for us which ended January 31 was a very good year and so we saw in our OpEx throughout the year, but in particular, in Q3 and Q4 of last year pretty elevated level of variable comp expense so all that got paid out in Q1. And so year-on-year, we spent \u2013 out of our cash, we spent about $60 million more in variable comp in Q1 of this year than we spent in variable comp in Q1 of last year.","The second, as we talked about \u2013 if you remember Q4 was a record quarter for us for cash flow from ops of $257 million. Within that we talked about the linearity of Q4 was such that we had a lot of those large EBAs close actually in December, it wasn't the end of our fiscal year, but it was the end of a lot of our customers fiscal year. So a lot of those big transactions actually got closed in December, got invoiced and collected still in Q4 as opposed to a normal linearity, which would have those much more at the end of the quarter and then collected in the following quarter and that contributed about a little more than $40 million to the OpEx impact year-on-year. So those two together drove Q1 cash flow from ops down a little bit more than $100 million on a year-on-year basis.","Brendan J. Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities","Great. Thanks for the clarity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Just like to go back and maybe touch a little bit on what Brent had talked about a little earlier about your talking about the year. Just wondering if your internal way that you had expected the year to play out has changed from when you started the year until now, do you now expect the seasonality quarterly of the way that revenue flows to be different?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Steve. This is Scott. I'll start and then let Carl add some commentary. It's really not significantly different that as we calculate the FX impact, it \u2013 there is rounding going on in there. We quote that in whole percentage points, but it has increased and has moved from what was 6% and 4% billings and revenue to 7% and 5%, but the reality is there is some rounding going on underneath the covers. So I think the shape of the year is the same shape that we expected. There is a little bit of uncertainty, as Carl talked about earlier, in some of our key markets, in particular, in Japan and then to some extent in Russia, and that's really what you see reflected.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean, same thing I said before in terms of concerns it's FX and then it's Japan and then it's Russia and the list ends there.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And I would \u2013 just in terms of 50% of the subscriptions coming from the new model, I wonder if we could get a little more granularity there and maybe just comment, are you seeing traction with desktop subscriptions?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, we are, Steve. We're seeing desktop \u2013 we've talked about it growing on a sequential basis at a pretty high clip. We're not actually breaking it out because it's still \u2013 despite the rapid growth, it's still not a material number. But it is continuing to grow actually and not experience seasonality at this point. We're still seeing very strong sequential growth coming out of desktop and cloud.","Steve M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you. I had a couple of questions. One, I just wanted to follow up on, I guess, that last one before I go to these other two about the product strength that you're seeing, you guys mentioned new products in particular. I'm just wondering you just gave us some color on desktop subscription, but can you give us some other information about or any more granularity on where you're seeing growth in other new products? And then, I've got a couple of follow-ups.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So \u2013 okay. Sure, Heather. First one I would say is the enterprise licensing, the EBAs continue to do really well. They're still a little bit more seasonal than other parts of our business. They coincide with customer or our end of year. But enterprise licenses continue to grow. I expect them to continue to this year and next. And then, we're having tremendous amount of success on the cloud-based products. So, PLM 360 \u2013 I'd call that's some color with the CAM products, PLM 360, Fusion 360, all doing really well. In some ways, if you think about it, it's been crazy that's it's taken this long for cloud software to make it to the world of engineering and as it's becoming a mainstream deployment in IT shops, people are realizing that the world of design and engineering and manufacturing is going to move there as well. And so we're benefiting from being in a leadership position in all of those.","I think backing it up too would be the desktop subscriptions continue to do nicely and we'll be able to give you a little bit more color on the desktop subscriptions as the promotions start in Q2 and the deadlines approach in Q4, we'll watch that go. And I think just generally last thing in our kinds of great coloring of the macro economies, most of the world is doing pretty well. And we saw that in a lot of the construction numbers and a lot of the manufacturing numbers that absent a couple of specific countries, generally speaking, the economies of the world are doing pretty well.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Heather, the one bit of color I'd add to Carl's comments on desktop that I should have mentioned earlier is it's early days, but what we are seeing is within our desktop subscription growth, the largest component of it is LT and I think what's encouraging about that is an LT customer traditionally would buy perpetual license. So we had a much lower attach rate of maintenance. And so seeing that cohort that that set of our customers now shifting over to our subscription model is pretty encouraging for the future.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then I just had a question \u2013 two more actually, but there's a lot of people wondering if you could give some color between the difference between how you guys calculate billings and then the billings we all see on your financial statements, because those are the only ones we have to look at. So if you can talk a little bit about that and then also when you guys gave your billing's CAGR, is it based on your definition of billings or is it going to be the billings we see on your financial statements, because that's the other thing we're getting pinged on a lot? And then I just had one follow-up after that.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Yeah, the way we do billings is it's outlined actually in our prepared comments, but it's actually what's invoice minus the partner incentives. So our contras come out of that. I think the one thing that maybe driving some confusion...","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But why aren't those in the financial \u2013 but why aren't those in your Qs and Ks?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Net billings are reported on the face of our quarterly earnings. I'd have to go back and look at the Q and see if we put that in there or not. It's not \u2013 there is no magic to it though. It's what's invoice but minus the contras.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But yes \u2013 yeah but then \u2013 and then when you guys give your billings growth target, I mean I'm just passing on the questions that are hitting my inbox?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, yeah.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What are you guys \u2013 what's the goal based on? Is it based on what you just defined that net billings number?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. When we talk about billings...","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","...we talk about net billings.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, I guess, the question for you, Carl, you've been asked a lot over the last year or so about buybacks and I heard your comments that said, you just finished a comprehensive review and that you would be back to us. Is that, I guess, when we hear you saying that, is that something like you guys know this isn't something that you should be contemplating, I'm just trying to get a sense of, we've known for years, that you guys have used your buyback to offset dilution from stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, but is the board at least going through the analysis to determine where you are in the transition, how much better it would be for shareholders if you were to take the dilution out now. How much of that is being factored in because while we appreciate saving cash for a rainy day and understanding that a lot of it's offshore. And I think even during the depths of the credit crisis, you guys didn't burn any cash. So, how do we think about how the board is going about the comprehensive review?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So first, let's start by being honest. You don't appreciate saving cash for a rainy day. And those \u2013 the people hidden in your inbox appreciate it either are very few. But more seriously as \u2013 I mean you'll hear from us in the next month or so that what our plans are. So, we'll certainly do in Q2, we'll talk about it and we do \u2013 and I mean I was very serious, it was comprehensive. We went through \u2013 this is a point of inflection and so it required a different analysis than we've done before. And so, stay tuned.","Heather A. Bellini - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thanks so much.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. One of the questions that I get the most is how might the range of outcome look for 2017, and when might those ranges start to narrow here? And I guess I'm wondering, how should we think about cash margins versus operating margin? Should cash margins be a bigger focus for investors during this transition versus your 30% operating margin targets?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Matt, I think both are important. Obviously, we are continuing to generate cash. I don't think you see a significantly different trend, though, between our cash margins and our op margins. So as we go into fiscal 2017 and as Carl talked about, some of the traditional income statement metrics particularly around reported revenue will be under pressure in fiscal 2017, that's going to put pressure right down the face of the income statement. I think the better way to track our progress through the transition is going to be looking at things like the growth of deferred revenue, and the growth of the subscriber base, which really get at the underlying business dynamics that then set up for the way the model looks as we come back out of the transition.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's great. And then, Carl, I wanted to ask about IoT, it seems to me that you've talked about a little bit more in your prepared remarks than I can remember historically. Can you give us a little bit of sense for how you might play in that market and should we expect maybe further investments be it M&A to further boost that opportunity for you guys?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, I mean this is probably the first time we've really talked about it and it's one of the areas where our customers are really interested in it. I was doing the prepared remarks last night when I came upon this tweet and it made me pause about including it, because the tweet was something like IoT is like teenage sex, everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone else claims they are doing it. And so, it did give me a little bit of pause, but let me just tell you that we do know what we're doing and it has become a huge focus for our customers in all of our industries. IoT has been often associated with just purely manufacturing, but it's also in the building space and I would say this is both for vertical and horizontal construction, a big deal. Sensors have been built into every building, they are being put in every infrastructure project from electrical infrastructure to sewage infrastructure, to dams, roads, bridges are all having it.","And the important thing for us is figuring out how do you help customers not only collect that data and analyze that data, but how does that feed back into better products that they build in turn for their customers. Also many of our customers are contemplating transitions of their own, but you've certainly seen things along the lines, from large industrial companies like GE talking about essentially jet engines as a service as opposed to selling jet engines and railroads as a service, and so it's a huge interest. What we saw in the market was that there was a real lack of contemporary modern tools to do it. There is a lot of old tools that have been around for a long time. And so we will do the usual thing to answer your question directly, which is we're doing some in-house development that we started from scratch and we will be opportunistic about finding M&A opportunities. But I wouldn't take those remarks specifically anything significant about a big acquisition, any acquisitions we will do will be in the style that we're most accustomed to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Philip Winslow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Most questions have already been asked. But just want to dig into the linearity question and then, Carl, back to your comments about being more backend loaded and a little softer in the middle. Perhaps you could help us sort of kind of as given an analogy here to sort of how you expect the end of sale of point product licenses at the end of this fiscal year to impact the second half maybe versus how the end of upgrade sales impacted that \u2013 the second half or just last fiscal year, what did we learn from the end of upgrades and how you're thinking about that implying it to the end of point product sales and then in terms of the guidance, that'd be great?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I think \u2013 yeah, I think it's a great question. I think the best indication we have about the trajectory, the slow growth, the activity is what happened last year. It's a really good indication of how our customers respond to changes that need to be made. The very \u2013 so that much I look at is being very similar to last year. The place where there is probably a little bit of difference is just we don't know what they will do as a result of it. So how many will move to desktop subscription versus the hoarding extra licenses. So there is a little bit of difference in what they'll do, but the level of activity we've been modeling is pretty close to a mirror of what happened the year before and in checking with historical patterns, it's pretty similar to things we've done with other kinds of transitions where there was really an end of sale demarcated in the future.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So is it fair to summarize that hey, we're coming off of a lot of one-time demand the last couple of quarters, we're now halfway through the trough and then there is this ramp-up for the now or never purchase the second half of this year. I mean, is that a fair way to describe it, a U-shape?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. A little bit of subtlety that's in there is because of that the way the incentives work for our partners and our customers is the biggest discount starts earlier in the year. So, what we've noticed that if we have the biggest financial incentive at the end of the year, that combined with a compelling deadline makes for a very non-linear year. So instead we did the opposite just like we did last year is the financial incentives are greatest in Q2 and ramp down to Q4. So we tried to just balance those two forces out as much as possible to get a little bit more linearity.","Philip A. Winslow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thanks, guys.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Phil, the other nuance there compared to upgrades, is what Carl said earlier, in the case of upgrades it was buy the upgrade now or don't. In this case, it's buy perpetual license now or go ahead and make the shift over to desktop or cloud. So there is a little bit of unknown. We always felt the shape of the year was going to be backend loaded and that's exactly how we're seeing it play out. We've put in place promos to try to drive more of that demand earlier in the year and I still think it will be fairly backend loaded.","The other point just to make sure that everyone still has on the radar screen is we're really talking about end of sale at the end of this year just for the individual products. We haven't yet announced the end of sale point on suites although we have said it will be sometime within our fiscal 2017 that's still out there for part of fiscal 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Pritchard from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. Two questions just to follow up to the prepared remarks. One is you commented in there that LT (46:13) and I'm wondering is that just a revenue business model transition impact, or did you actually see some fundamental underlying unit based (46:20) weakness during the (46:21) quarter?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Walt, can you repeat the question? For some reason you are breaking up, we're having trouble hearing you.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'm sorry. All right, let's see is this any better?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, that's better.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, that's better.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. All right. So, the question was on LTs, you had in the prepared remarks that LT was weak during the quarter. And I'm wondering if that was a business model transition source of weakness or if there was something going on that was more demand related or otherwise?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think LT as we've always said is very promotion related. With that \u2013 it's the most price-sensitive amongst our customers. And so I tie it almost completely to lack of promotions in the quarter.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And then just another follow-up on the prepared remarks, you had in there that manufacturing, I think, it grew \u2013 I don't remember exactly the numbers, but it was a little weaker than we thought it would be on a constant currency basis, and obviously some of the things like PMI manufacturing data on the macro side haven't been as strong. I'm wondering if you attribute that relative weakness to the macro or if \u2013 I'm just curious how you think about your market share there and if you are holding share in that market?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, I think I feel relatively good about manufacturing. Japan is obviously one of the areas impacting us. So generally feel good about where we are. If I was to break it down a little further to the question of share, I think we're holding serve or better in all of the traditional products. The place where we really gaining ground, although it's not reflected so much in the financials is in all the cloud-based products. As we talk about the cloud-based IoT product and cloud-based PLM product and cloud-based design and engineering product like Fusion, that's dramatically different than what our competitors are doing and that's a place where we're seeing real traction.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, gentlemen. If I can do a housekeeping and then one follow-up. On the housekeeping, a financial question here. Scott, can you just explain to us the operating margin being down in guidance, is that all currency or is there a bit of macro or something else in there?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it's \u2013 the op margin coming down from previous guide of 13% to 15%, to 12% to 14% really just reflects the change that we've guided on the top-line.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. So it's really...","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sorry, we are getting a lot of feedback. I don't know if you heard the same thing. We got a significant echo there.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sorry, I didn't hear that, but can you hear me okay now?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. We can.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. So the operating margin being down, guidance is really all related to that top-line reduction, which was currency?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's right.","Steve R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I wanted to ask you guys as well. It seems in some aspects, the transition is perhaps a year or at least some measure of time behind what you might have originally anticipated when you planned out your transition and first communicated it, not so much in terms of the subscriber additions, but in terms perhaps of the optics on the headline results and on the margin adjustments. Is this a correct perception or not and if so, any color around that or why might that be?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I...","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Go ahead.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is exactly \u2013 I mean we've been marching pretty much to the same plan all along. There have probably been small alterations as we phase out when the promotions are and when the end of sale of certain products are. But certainly in big terms, it's virtually identical to what we laid out the very first time at Investor Day about the transition that we saw. So there hasn't been any major disruptions one way or another.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. My sentiment, Steve, is we're continuing to move as quickly as we can actually through the transition. And so I don't \u2013 certainly it's not a sense that we're behind. I think if anything, when you look at the subscriber adds, we're perhaps a bit ahead of where we might have been at this point when we first talked about going through this transition.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Thank you. It's actually Darren Jue on for Sterling. Carl, you mentioned that you made a small price adjustment in some of the euro and yen denominated markets. I'm just wondering if you could maybe elaborate more on what you did, and I mean presumably, you've raised prices, and perhaps you could talk a little bit about what the early reaction has been from customers.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Scott, you want to...","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The adjustment we made, Darren, was really as we looked at the way the currencies had moved, and of course, we price in local currency in every market, just trying to attain some level of equilibrium around our pricing across markets. So, there is not a significant arbitrage opportunity to buy licenses in one market versus the other. So, the adjustment \u2013 and we only adjusted the yen and euro, which they are the two most significant non-U.S. dollar denominated price points that we have, and the adjustment was in the 5% to 7% range. So, it's not an enormous amount. From an absorption standpoint in the market, there has been absolutely no noise on that.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And I wonder if you could tell us of the 95,000 subs that you added in the quarter, how many of them came via the Shotgun acquisition? And also if you could give us a sense for how many came through the Autodesk website?","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, the Shotgun was steady state. So if you remember in Q4, we talked about the 17,000 subscription add driven by Shotgun, that was an acquisition that we had done previously. And it was the first time that we got their subscriber count to a level of accuracy and conformed it to the way we count subscribers. So, we added that as a one-time. So the ongoing adds from Shotgun will just be the ongoing adds that are driven by the business. And it didn't stand out as a significant number. I'd say the one thing we did see in the subscriber count in Q1 is if you think of our EBAs, so the big, large $1 million plus transactions that we do, those are token-based. It takes a little bit of time to get the infrastructure set up behind those to begin reporting out the monthly average users which is what gets added to the subscriber base. So part of what we saw in Q1 was a little bit of a catch-up from the large number of EBAs we had done in Q3 and Q4 of last year. That infrastructure was set up and we got 90 days worth of monthly average users rolling in. There was a little bit of a net add from that, but that's probably the only thing I would point to as a bit of an anomaly in the Q1 adds.","Darren R. Jue - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, guys, thanks for fitting me in. Carl, you mentioned earlier in your remarks around cloud how customer seem to be migrating to those solutions a little bit more so than they have in the past, and I'm just curious what level of evangelizing are you guys having to do with the customer base in terms of trying to explain the benefits and help them along versus how much this is really customer saying, yeah, this is the direction we really want to go and you're not having a hold to hand as much?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, good question. I would divide it, I would say, we're not having to do much in the evangelism category that the customers who are aware in transitioning in other parts of their business to the cloud are receptive to it. They have been waiting for answers in the construction or in the engineering space. The place where we're spending more time is on just general awareness. So marketing dollars to make them know that we have a solution that is that. So we probably spent more time and money on awareness rather than the overall benefits. Having said that, I think you've probably seen us do the adoption of cloud technologies like all the others. There is still recalcitrant part of the audience that's sitting going I'll never do it and they have their arms folding across the chest and they say that will never happen. But with each passing day, it becomes less and less.","And as I've gotten older and seen enough of these transitions, I just know that we can \u2013 to be a little crude, we can just wait people out. This is an inevitable transition as mainframes to workstations or workstations to PCs was. And most of the reasons for not moving are not very substantial. I think there is a handful of places that are wrestling with this question. You see it in terms of government organizations, places in the defense industry. But it was interesting, we spent a long time in the CTO of the company with folks from DARPA the other day and then kind of marveling at what's possible with what's going on in the cloud, and then say we had difficultly, it was good to be \u2013 for them to use it. And then we went on this interesting conversation that said the bad guys have no problem using the cloud. They are using the cloud already and they're going to continue to use the cloud. And so, I don't think the operational plan should be for you to figure out how not to use it. You need to do something different. And so I think both businesses and governments will figure out a way because the benefits are so substantial.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And maybe just one quick follow-up on you've talked in the past about operationally and systems, some of the changes that you need to make internally as more of your business goes direct and transactions through the website and that sort of thing. You talked about the tokens on the EBAs. How do you feel like you guys are set up as you're starting to really ramp this transition in earnest throughout this year and into next year?","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So I would say just to be clear on the question, it's not only important for business that we do direct. It's also for our business through partners. The thing that's really changed is the number of transactions and the frequency in which people transact. This was a system that was built for perpetual licenses and upgrades and that's what we've been transitioned. So I feel like we're finally carrying \u2013 there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We're certainly servicing the business today and I feel like we're on track to be ahead of when the most massive movement of our customers comes, but we are building infrastructure as we go.","Matthew L. Williams - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","(58:07).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Kasthuri G. Rangan - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, thank you very much. Carl, just \u2013 I appreciate the enthusiasm for the model transition. Looking back over the last few quarters, maybe there is some other factors at work, the number of subs added, we've seen 121,000, 100,000 and this quarter was 95,000. I would probably expect the numbers to be moving in the other direction.","Also, the billings growth rate although clearly pretty solid this quarter, we've seen 27%, 25%, 20% going down to 8%. So if we take a step back, can you help us understand the context of what seems to be deceleration on the face that was reported, but I'm sure that there is another side to the story just what I really wanted to hear. And finally also the guidance, you guys have done really well on beating the sub number and taking up the guidance. I noticed that we didn't do it this time, we did it last time. Just wanted to get your thought process on that. Thank you so much and that's it from me.","Carl Bass - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. Yeah, sure, Kash. Well, I would say the 95,000 we exceeded our expectations. Like we said, it was not going to be linear. Given what we saw in terms of promotional activity and that the impending end of sale is 12 months off, this was above what our expectations were. So, the other thing I would say is and I mean we've tried to be as clear as possible is that these things are not going to be perfectly linear. And we've tried to present as much information as we can when we think it gets on a solid footing and when it is understandable and we'll continue to do that. And we said, we'll start breaking down more numbers as we go forward. But everything about what we saw in the subscription part of the business was at or above where we had planned the year. So I feel good about that. We have now \u2013 as we enter the second quarter with interesting new dynamics with the promotional activity and the end-of-sale getting closer and in three months, we'll have another conversation about where we are at that point.","R. Scott Herren - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And, Kash, to the numbers that you quoted, when we talked about 121,000 net adds in Q3, bear in mind that there was a one-time add for Delcam, 25,000 built into that number. And then we \u2013 as we talked earlier, in the 100,000 that we added in Q4, there were 17,000 one-time. So, we had some one-time inorganic hits as those acquisitions got their subscriber count up to a level where we were comfortable reporting them and adding them to our base, which was inception to date for those companies as a one-time add and then the ongoing growth is just whatever the ongoing growth of those businesses are. So, there was a little bit of a \u2013 actually a fairly notable tailwind in both Q3 and Q4 in those subscriber add numbers. I think the 95,000 adds we just posted for the quarter, we disclosed, certainly was ahead of our expectations and is something we feel pretty good about.","Operator","Thank you.

Sir, please begin.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for third quarter of fiscal 2016. Also on the line is Carl Bass, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO. Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors.","As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2016, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we used to estimate our guidance, including currency headwinds, our transition to new business models, our market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment, based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.

And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. At our Investor Day in late September we laid out vision and core [ph] for our business model transition. Overall, this quarter was in line with the plan we outlined.","The performance of traditional P&L metrics like revenue, operating margin and EPS, most of which were ahead of our expectations, were driven by slightly more perpetual license sales than expected. Metrics like billings and total subscription additions were below our expectations. We'll be in this hybrid model for the next few quarters.","As a reminder, we'll stop selling new perpetual licenses for individual products on February 1st and most of the rest of the products including suites on August 1st of next year. At that point, metrics like subscription additions and ARR will begin to being more predictable.","Most importantly, we are pleased with the total unit volume of licenses sold in the quarter, which was in line with historical ranges and we're on track to add approximately 600,000 or more units for the fiscal year. This number is critically important for two reasons.","First, it is the best indicator of the health of the business while customers have two different ways to buy our products. Secondly, it drives new subscription additions starting in Q3 when perpetual licenses are no longer offered. We were also pleased with the continued growth of our desktop subscription sales and growth in new model ARR.","From an operational perspective, we continue to make critical investments. Infrastructure for the business model transition and our cloud platform and services remain the top priorities. At the same time, we've been focused on managing our overall spend and creating increased efficiencies throughout the organization which led to only 1% growth in total spend for the quarter. This is part of a much larger plan to ratchet down expense as we move through the transition.","One particular cost saving action we have taken recently is our decision to exit the hardware business at the end of this quarter for our creative finishing products within our Media & Entertainment group. This is a small portion of our overall business, but comes with substantially lower margins. It's really a win-win as customers have been asking for hardware freedom, channel partners have wanted to sell it and it will benefit our margins over time.","Another area where we expect to achieve cost savings and margin benefits is with our eStore. We just launched our new North American eStore this month after years of it being hosted by a third party. The new site creates a better customer experience and reduces the cost of these online transactions. This is important because we believe we can meaningfully increase the volume of business we do online.","And finally, during Q3, we opportunistically took advantage of the low stock price to increase our stock buyback. We purchased 3.2 million shares at an average cost of $46.33, bringing our total buyback to 6.9 million shares year-to-date.","Now let me spend a little time on subscriptions. Once again, subscription additions were led by new model types which increased over 130% and represented over half of the subscription additions. Desktop subscriptions led the new model type additions. The volume of desktop subscriptions coming through our channel partners continued to increase. In Q3 channel volume of desktop subscriptions was over 60% of total desktop subs. That's up 44% in the third quarter last year, so it's clear that our channel partners are actively engaged with us through this transition and are making desktop subscriptions an important part of their business mix.","Looking ahead, we remain focused on driving new business as well as converting the sizable base of non-subscribers to subscribers.","Recall that in the second quarter we discontinued selling perpetual license of LT in Australia and New Zealand and the results were positive. We took out a step further in Q3 when we discontinued selling perpetual licenses of LT and the rest of Asia-Pacific with the exception of Japan. Once again, we experienced an increase in the unit volume of LT. It's another data point that gives us confidence going into the next few quarters.","Attached and renewal rates for maintenance subscription remain strong. Last year's highly successful upgrade program made comparisons for new maintenance subscriptions challenging.","Total ARR increased 18% in constant currency with maintenance ARR growing 9% and new model ARR more than doubling year-on-year at constant currency. Total recurring revenue increased to 56% of revenue compared to 48% in the third quarter last year.","Taking a closer look at our industry segments, let's start with AEC. We continue to win new business in AEC. One of the most prestigious architectural companies in the world just decided to standardize on Revit, the world's leading BIM software. This particular firm has been using competitive products for the past 20 years. We are encouraged by the continued adoption of our cloud-based AEC tool.","BIM 360, our cloud-based software for construction management continues to grow rapidly. We recently signed an agreement with one of the top international contractors where BIM 360 won out over competitive on-premise software.","BIM 360 is being established as the primary construction field reporting and management tool for this firm's construction and business units. A360 collaboration for Revit also experienced strong sequential growth in subscribers.","Now, turning to our manufacturing business. We continue to gain grounds in all sectors, but particularly in automotive, aerospace and industrial machinery. Inventor, Alias and Fred continue to be very strong performers.","Fusion 360, the first cloud-based 3D CAD system experienced strong growth in adoption and usage. We clearly have the pole position in terms of bringing engineering software to the cloud.","We're particularly encouraged by the use of Fusion in large companies switching from latency systems such as SolidWorks. We're very encouraged by strong adoption in enterprise accounts even in industries that have been more cautious about use of cloud based product design software. This comprehensive functionality built into a cloud-based platform has proven to be very compelling for companies looking for their next generation product development software.","The strength of our simulation portfolio was evidenced this quarter by competitive wins at several high profile enterprise accounts that have long been strongholds for the competition. But these customers are focused on simulation early in the design process and close alignment in design tools has proven to be a unique value driver. Our move to the cloud has proven to be a differentiated competitive advantage especially with our SMB customers.","We had another solid quarter with PLM 360. Speed and scale for deployment gives us competitive differentiation versus legacy on premise solutions. Both new logos and total PLM deals increased 50% in the quarter and we continue to have a steady stream of existing PLM customers come back to expand their original contracts. Going forward, we're excited about scaling this business, starting with its strong pipeline going into Q4.","Now, turning back to our model transition. I want to revisit the main themes we spoke about at our Investor Day last quarter. We're now a little over two months away from a major milestone in our transition, the end of sale of perpetual license offerings for individual products. We're targeting a 20% compound annual growth rate in subscriptions and a 24% compound annual growth rate of ARR from the end of this fiscal year to the end of fiscal year 2020.","As we indicated, the model hinges on growth in subscriptions. So it's helpful to talk about what we expect to be the four primary drivers of subscriptions.","First, starting in the third quarter of next year virtually every license that we sell will be a subscription as the end of sale all new perpetual licenses. As you may recall from our disclosures a few years ago, the typical run rate of licensed unit volume has ranged from 500,000 to nearly 800,000 per year.","On top of typical run rate of licenses, we are seeing a multiplier as customers move from perpetual to subscription. This multiplier ranges anywhere from a 10% to 30% uplift in units. These tend to be companies that were previously sharing licenses among their users, and the subscription price point makes sense for them to purchase additional seats.","Second is converting a minimum of 30% of the 2.8 million users out there who are active but not on subscription. The third piece is capturing a larger share of casual filers. And finally, the TAM expansion of cloud based products and services which brings in new users.","The 20% subs CAGR will drive the 24% ARR CAGR. We also talked about a 3% CAGR in annualized revenue per subscription. That number is heavily influenced by the mix of subscriptions. LT and cloud subs have a lower ARPS relative to our other offerings and will depress total ARPS but are great for total ARR growth.","I also want to be clear that these CAGRs anchor on the end of FY 2016 and we expect some bumpiness over the next three quarters as we end the sale of new perpetual licenses. This does not change our conviction in our assumptions or the end state of this transition one bit. In fact, the early proof points around subscription adoption have been very encouraging.","I alluded to this at the beginning of the call and I'll reiterate here. Our business model transition will not be perfectly linear and the amount of business that we will transition, the number of subscription additions and the mix of subscription additions will fluctuate.","The fourth quarter is always the biggest quarter of the year for us. Gauging the level of activity around customers buying the last perpetual licenses for individual products is particularly difficult to project. As such, we've taken a more conservative view and reduced our billings and subscriptions outlook for the remainder of the year. This is partially related to our Q3 results and partially related to our revised Q4 outlook. We're also factoring in about a $10 million reduction in billings related to exiting the Creative Finishing hardware business.","Global economic conditions remain uneven with strong headwinds continuing in most emerging markets. FX headwinds remain persistent but they haven't gotten much worse than the first three quarters of the year.","To wrap things up, we're really excited to being one step further along and maintain our strong conviction in the model transition. We're heading down a path that will provide our customers with greater flexibility and a better user experience while creating a more predictable, recurring and profit profitable business for Autodesk in the years to come.","Operator, we're now ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first is from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Stan Zlotsky","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Thank you for taking my question. Wanted to kick it off with the long-term model. So you're saying that nothing has changed, but we are essentially taking down subscriber targets for this year, so we're lowering the starting point. So does that implicitly say that you are saying that the growth rate in subs will be unchanged, but the end point will be different?","Carl Bass","Hi, Stan. It's actually a really small amount; we're taking it down, if you project it out over years. This is just a timing adjustment from where we started. The important thing to look at here is to remember that what we talk about here in those numbers is net subscriber adds. So the number of subscriptions we added was in keeping with exactly what we wanted and that was different.","And as I expect, there will be a bunch of questions. I'll go into this more deeply. But to answer your question directly, the net down and for a number of reasons, but in general we were right on track and that's why we I gave the unit numbers the licenses, so you could gauge it. If you put this on to the total days the number really makes no difference in the model as you project it out any number of years.","Stan Zlotsky","Okay. And then, my follow-up\u2026","Carl Bass","Remember, we're talking about tens of thousands versus millions.","Stan Zlotsky","Got it. So does that mean that you saw slightly higher churn in the quarter than you were expecting? And that's it from me. Thank you.","Carl Bass","Yeah. So, yes. I didn't even get to the next questioner before we got more questions about it, so we might as well just walk through it. So the first thing is, let's just remember that the 80,000 is net adds. The unit volume was nearly twice that in terms of subscriptions. There are two things that go to it. One is a maintenance base that is now very big, approximately 2.1 million subscribers, and a renewal rate that's less than 100%.","So any small change there or any change in timing or any change in buying behaviour even at a small amount changes the reading at this moment in time when we measure it. And the other thing is the attach rates are less than the renewal rate. As we've disclosed over the years. So a little less influential but it does come from a little bit from the tax rate and a little bit from churn in the maintenance phase on the existing model.","Stan Zlotsky","Thank you, guys.","Carl Bass","Well, let me just finish on the other part of it is if you don't do the net of it, subscription adds were just where we anticipated they would be.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Might as well stay on the subscription kind of line of questioning here, Carl.","So the reduction for the year, I guess that 3.10 to 3.30 versus the 3.75 to 4.25, maybe you can walk us through where the lion share of that reduction is coming from. Is that coming from your point that lower attach and renew rate that maybe you expected in the maintenance base or is the new model base maybe a little bit less than what you expected as you wrap up the year?","Carl Bass","It's about 50\/50. I mean, at least this quarter it was. Once again I try to highlight it in my remarks. I can tell you exactly what happened in Q3 and in that case it's 50\/50. If you look going forward, because of the difficulty in projecting our customer behaviour precisely about whether they'll choose to stock up on perpetual licenses or move to desktop subscription, it's a little bit harder to project. We just thought we'd be a little bit more cautious and conservative, particularly with the mix.","And so I want to draw two pictures. We're more cautious about the net adds. We gave you the other facts and figures to show really that the unit volume is steady and that the demand is high. And so I don't want to confuse those two issues. But I can tell you Q3 really 50\/50, Q4 and going into next year, a little bit harder to be precise about.","Scott Herren","Yes, Saket. If all you're trying to bridge is the midpoint of the previous guidance for the full year to the midpoint of the current guidance for the full year, what I'd say is a big chunk of that is where we see ourselves coming out of Q3. So if you just add the numbers up this year, we've added about 236,000 net subs. When you peel back how that compared to where we thought we'd be at this point the bigger driver of the delta is what you said. It's on the maintenance side versus on the new model side. The new model growth has been good. We continue to see it looking strong, particularly year-on-year. But it continues to grow strongly sequentially as well.","When you look at Q4, I think what Carl said is spot on. What we're trying to do is take a somewhat conservative view of what we think the net adds will be. There's a significant opportunity as we hit the first milestone or the next milestone in our business model transition and end of sale perpetual licenses for individual products and trying to gauge what that does in terms of driving additional demand relative to a very large maintenance base.","If you go back several years, Q4 has always been our biggest quarter for perpetual license sales, which means it's also our biggest quarter for renewals and there's an enormous maintenance renewal amount that gets done during the quarter. And it's balancing those two off, that's what's led us to where we are.","Saket Kalia","Got it, got it. And then the follow-up, maybe if we shift over to the kind of -- to the creative finishing part of the business. Carl, I think you said roughly a $10 million impact, I think in the fourth quarter on billings. So is it fair to think about that as maybe a $40 million a year kind of revenue run rate? And what's the sort of gross margin on that, that you're now going to be sort of offloading?","Carl Bass","Yes Saket, that's right. So, to be clear, what we did in Creative Finishing, to this point we sold that product on hardware. So its software license and then we built it \u2013 we actually packaged it on the hardware and shipped it out.","What we did in Q4 or at the end of Q3 is, based on really feedback from partners and customers that wanted the flexibility to use their own hardware is converted Creative Finishing software to a software only offering.","So what that pulled out of our revenue stream is the hardware that was effectively a pass-through. We bought it, packaged the software on and passed it through. So, as you would imagine, it's pretty low margin business.","Now, Q4 is the biggest quarter for that as well, so I wouldn't take the 10 million that we see the impact in Q4 of this year and just multiply it by four. But it's somewhere between $25 million to $40 million, is what would come out, low margin business but all hardware only.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Very helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.","Carl Bass","Thanks. Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Shakeel Alam","Hi. This is Shakeel Alam in for Heather Bellini. Just one question on maintenance and what you're seeing there. So you added 32,000 maintenance subscribers but ARR stayed flat. Is that what you're expecting? And so could you comment on the attach rate you're seeing on maintenance versus prior quarters and from next quarter with license ending, are you expecting a strong maintenance ARR uptick while this is the last chance to buy standalone licenses?","Carl Bass","You asked a lot of questions, Shakeel. So let me jump in and if I missed one remind me. The first question of 33,000 net new maintenance adds for the quarter but billings being effectively flat sequentially. I think the thing you've got to bear in mind is 33,000 on the base of about 2.1 million. So the overall growth -- the growth of the overall base which of course is what drives that is not nearly as big as 33,000 would sound.","On the attach rates, what we are seeing though is we continue to see attach rates growing. Now, not -- it still is below the overall renewal rate for maintenance but the attach rates growing, it's growing on LT which is still a step function below the other products. But it's growing on the other products as well and renewals continue to be strong through the quarter. So we're not seeing any significant change there.","Shakeel Alam","And then for 4Q are you expecting an uptick in maintenance ARR?","Carl Bass","Yes you know, the hard part about calling that is calling the number of customers during Q4 that actually take advantage of the last chance to buy perpetual license. To the extent that that's a big number, but a lot of people look at this and say hey, I want to buy my perpetual license while I can with the attach rates we're having that will drive a significant uptick in maintenance ARR.","To the extent that we continue to see what we're beginning to see is a lot of customers saying okay, I've now gotten comfortable with desktop subscription, we see it growing at substantial rates year-on-year, but growing sequentially as well. And if more people say I'm ready for -- I'm ready to make that shift, that would again drive desktop subscriptions but only when they actually need it. There's no end of sale on desktop subs.","So better news for us long-term, the more people that accept the shift over to desktop subs, but there's no compelling event in Q4 for that set of customers. So it's really trying to predict the mix of people that want to take advantage versus the mix of people who say no, I'm ready to make the shift.","Shakeel Alam","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Bergstrom","Yeah, hi it's Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. Could you talk a little bit about bringing the eStore in-house? How does that enable you to increase the volume of the business you do online? Thanks.","Carl Bass","Yes. I think there are two different dynamics going on. I think customers, particularly small customers, are choosing to buy more and more online as they get more comfortable with it. The factor that we get to influence is the experience. Outsourcing it has its limitations in terms of the experience you're giving customers and buying and maintaining their things online. We felt like we'd grown that business to a point where we needed to control it ourselves.","Second important thing about it is we felt like we were paying too much money for the service to do that and so we wanted to bring it in so we could lower the cost per transactions and improve the experience.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Carl, you had an activist investor actually file recently. I'm curious if you had any conversations with them and what's going to be your approach? Will you be open to discussions and the suggestions they might have to improve shareholder value?","Carl Bass","Yes. I probably found out about the filing the same way you did. I happened to be at Japan at the time. And somebody sent me a news article. When I saw you that, part of the filing was that, Sachem I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing it correctly, Sachem had filed. I reached out. I spoke with Scott. We didn't say anything of substance, but we agreed to get together. Just as I've done with many investors. We continue to be open to talk to all of our investors, whether they file or not.","Sterling Auty","Got it. And then, back -- Scott, I hate to do this to you, but back to maintenance. I guess I wasn't clear. Sounded like you said that attach rates are continuing to improve and renewal rates are steady. But I thought in an earlier comment that when we look at the change in the net subscription expectations for the year that the maintenance was definitely a 50% of the component. So I guess I'm still missing which component is coming in less than what you expected. Is it the churn or is it the attach?","Scott Herren","No, it's actually neither. In order to attach a maintenance agreement you need a new licensed sale. And so when we looked at new licensed sales for the year this year, as we were laying out the plan, it's a little bit like doing a channel check, where you look at a small sample size and try and extrapolate to the rest of the world.","And so what we had based that, what our expectations on the end of sale of perpetual and what that would do in terms of driving new license sales, is we based it on some of the tests that we had done and we based it on the experience we had with the end of sale of upgrades.","And what we've seen is attach rates continue to be strong and strengthening and renewal rates have stayed strong for maintenance. But the number of people who are buying that last perpetual license are less than we expected when we set up the plan for the year.","Sterling Auty","Got it. That makes sense. And maybe just to put a finer point on that, do you think that's macro or do you think it\u2019s still understanding the model transition or some other factor?","Carl Bass","I think there's two things going on. I think macro is relatively steady. We have not seen a dramatic change. I know this will come up so we might as well just cover it now. The Americas, U.S. in particular, continues to be relatively strong, as does Central and Northern Europe. We see weakness in Brazil and Russia and the Middle East. China I actually feel is slightly stronger than I think generally people are giving the credit for. And Japan is weaker than I think anybody would want. And you know, I think that's the round-up of what the macro looks like.","So in general, I think macro is not a huge factor. It's neither particularly positive, nor particularly negative. FX continues to be negative, as it is for everybody. And looks like it might continue for a while. But that's kind of the round-up of what I would see about macro. I don't think the competitive situation has changed very much in the mainstream businesses. There's different dynamics in some of our cloud businesses. We're kind of leading the way, but other than that, not a huge amount of change.","Sterling Auty","Okay. Thank you guys.","Carl Bass","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question's from Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open.","Brent Thill","Hey, Carl. Just on the channel, many of the channel partners we speak with, it seems like there's a divergence. The larger ones get it. They want to be on board. They understand the power of it. The smaller ones are still struggling, which you would expect, given this.","But I guess, just, do you feel like you've got the channel guys now really ready to go, they're on board? Can you just give us a sense of how that education process is going at a high level?","And there is a follow-up too on the deal you mentioned, nice to see a 20 year competitive switch. Are you -- what drove that in terms of their decision making? Do you see other deals like that in the queue that are ready because of either an architectural limitation or -- just give us a little more color would be helpful.","Carl Bass","Okay. So first channel partners and then the switch. So if you look at channel partners, let's just back up for a second and maybe have a little discourse on channel partners and checking with channel partners. The first thing, just to remind everybody, is if you look at it broadly 30% of our business -- 20% to 30% is the very top tier, less than a tenth of a percent of our customers. And at the so-called bottom of the pyramid, people going through lower cost channels like the eStore, that's 20% to 30% of our business.","When you get to the middle part of our business, that is our traditional good partners, one of the things also is that business is geographically aligned like the rest of our revenue with about 25% in the U.S. and 75% outside.","It's one of the reasons just on a kind of an aside why often the channel checks don't correlate as well. That if you're only starting with 40% of the business or 50% of the business and you talk to a sampling of 25%, you're sampling 12.5% of the people that you would like to. Overall, we have more than 2,000 channel partners. So use that as a backdrop to this.","I would totally agree with what you're saying, Brent. I think the larger partners understand the transition better, have moved more quickly, have prepared their business, as you would expect, but I wouldn't say it's uniform. There are also smaller partners who are some of our best partners who have understood this, who have always had really healthy businesses that provide great services. But if I look by and large, I think your characterization is correct.","If you look at it from the business point of view, we gave you all kinds of metrics during my remarks about why the channel partners are selling it. If anything, I would say our channel partners; the traditional channel partners are more enthusiastic than desktop subscription than we originally planned. We knew from the beginning that this is a tough transition for cash flow sensitive businesses.","We've tried to do our best to ease it. We gave plenty of warning. When others were urging us to make the transition happen faster, we thought this was the prudent thing to do and not only getting a company with our kind of balance sheet through it, but most importantly getting those 2,000 channel partners through it.","Having said that, I don't think every channel partner will make it through in an identical form. There will probably be some consolidation out there. There will be some change in business, slightly more than the natural churn that we see there. But I would just generally say channel partners get it. They've gotten on. It reminds me a little bit when we first brought out subscription, and as I listen to the names who have asked questions so far, many of you were there when we did that.","And our channel partners thought subscription, if you had listened to them in the moment, was the end of their business. I think almost everyone you ask today they would say it is the best part of their business. And so I think in the same way we have been very considerate and deliberate in how we move not only our business but an important part of moving their business as well.","The second thing was, yeah, it was really gratifying. This was a very prestigious firm. You know, what has happened around the world where we have -- we have a strong market position in architecture, engineering and construction software. But people don't realize there are many competitive products. There are strong local products. There are many reasons why people choose other things.","We have been working on the periphery with this firm for a while. The thing that put them over the edge is really how prevalent building information modeling and particularly as Revit as the tool of choice is for building information modeling.","And let me just digress [ph] for a second. People don't realize this about our business sometimes, but while we were in a very complex technology business technology adoption doesn't happen overnight. For those who may have forgotten, we bought Revit back in 2002, I believe. So we're 14 years later and we still think there's lots of market penetration.","If you were to look at a graph of the revenue, the first five years would not have impressed you. So, I mean, it's really gratifying to see how long this is and that at this point in time we are winning the business of some of the best and most creative firms in the world.","I expect that trend to continue and as you've seen, it's not only in the architectural space but in the construction space, we continue to gain market share and we think it's an important part of what we're doing investing in our cloud-based businesses where really the future of this industry is.","Brent Thill","Thanks, Carl.","Carl Bass","You're welcome, Brent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Philip Winslow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Philip Winslow","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Carl, I know you touched from a geographic perspective on macro. But when you look at the industry verticals that you guys service, commercial, construction, civil, different parts of manufacturing, and obviously the media side. But when you look by vertical, I mean is there any sort of tone change across those vertical industries? Who hasn't changed? Who maybe is changing? And just sort of how you're kind of contemplating that or thinking about this over the next few quarters here, what you're keeping your eyes on.","Carl Bass","Yeah. It\u2019s surprising little change in the business environment around those, I don't see dramatic changes. I think there's a lot of picking and complaining about interest rates even though I think it's fully baked into the market and for the of most part people doing things like development projects or capital improvements and manufacturing have figured this in for a while. Maybe it's gotten slightly more certain.","But surprisingly in our end markets we're not seeing huge amounts of change either geographically or by industry. It's kind of steady as she goes. Certainly sitting here in San Francisco, I have a little bit of concern about kind of bubble valuations in down round IPOs.","But that may be a much more local phenomenon. And I wouldn't extrapolate from there that feels to me like a bad channel check. So, I would just say business is pretty steady as she goes. We're monitoring it. I think the other end indicator for me was the demand that we talked about in the total unit volume, kind of indicates to me the same thing. So no big change. Scott?","Scott Herren","Yeah. So, I was going to say the same thing. When you look at the underlying demand, in other words the units that we sold during the quarter, it's right in line with what our expectations were and where it's been historically. And then, if you slice it the other way, by industry vertical and I think we've got this \u2013 I'm sure we've got this in the prepared remarks. The revenue growth rates in AEC were around 4%, but in manufacturing it was the same, about 3% or 4%. So we're not really seeing any bifurcation by vertical at this point.","Philip Winslow","Got it. And then, actually just a quick follow-up for Scott. Carl mentioned, as he did back at the Analyst Day a couple years ago, the 500,000 to 800,000 license units, wondering if you can give us a sense for sort of just what last year was or maybe this past couple years if you have that, just so we can kind of get a sense for -- because that 500 to 800 range is pretty wide, sort of what the most recent cadence was like?","Carl Bass","Sure. Last year would have been toward the higher end of that because we had a pretty successful upgrade set of sales last year. So it's a bit of an anomaly. Definitely it would have been the high end of that range. So if you go back before that, and really before we in earnest got into the business model transition, it was right around the midpoint of that range, between 500 and 800. And that's what we're seeing again this year, in terms of net demand, in other words, net sales in the market, right about the midpoint.","Philip Winslow","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Philip.","Operator","And your next question is from Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, thank you very much. Carl, I\u2019m wondering if you could just give us a little color on the sort of activity meaning perpetual and subscription that you saw this quarter in Asia-Pac, ex-Japan, and A&Z, how did that change as the quarter progressed and its deadline for buying perpetual license approached?","Carl Bass","Yeah, Gregg, we saw what you'd expect to see. So to be clear, we didn't end of sale all perpetual licenses in APAC this quarter ex-Japan. It was only LT only the low end, so very similar to what we had done in Australia, New Zealand in the prior quarter. We saw an increase in the volume of LT sales as we approached that end of sale. So it was right in line with our expectations.","And the one thing I'd say we're seeing with these end of sales is they are definitely more backend loaded in the quarter than our traditional run rate. So it makes a little bit more challenging in forecasting.","I used to talk about or almost brag about, you could look at the first three weeks and it was a statistical phenomenon to predict week 13. These promotions -- and I expect them to continue through the next three quarters possibly four, are just a little bit harder because we really are creating these events and it's just human nature not to act until the last moment.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. That makes sense. And then just for Scott, so Carl made a comment that you're looking to ratchet down expense as you move you through the transition, exiting the hardware business for Creative Finishing being an example of that. Are you still expecting a spending increase of 5% to 6% per year going forward or has your view on that changed to some degree? Thanks.","Scott Herren","Yeah, Greg, so I'll start and then actually let Carl jump in on this too. If you look at the quarter we just announced the total spend growth was 1%. If you looked at just OpEx, because COGS is obviously going up as we build out the cloud infrastructure. We just narrowed in from total spend to OpEx. The quarter we just announced was flat in OpEx year-on-year and so -- and if you look at the guidance we've given for Q4, and back into the spend growth that that would equate to it's in that same 1% to 2% range in Q4. So we have really put a lot of focus into effectively managing down spend and becoming more efficient across the board. Carl, you want to?","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean, I'd say two things. One is the plan is to continue to ratchet it down going into next year. There's a little bit of the effect of currency. But on a constant currency basis I'd say it would be coming down into the range we mentioned.","The other thing was it was definitely a change from Investor Day. And truthfully, we've been speaking a lot over the last six months with many of our long-term constructive investors and they totally understand and certainly believe in the model transition and the strength of the franchise, but there was definitely a hankering for greater cost control. So we listened carefully, and you saw.","And so we put plans into place earlier. We did something in Q3, doing the same kind of thing in Q4. Some things take a little longer to put in play and it's a combination of ongoing operating expenses and then structural things like we do for the either the eStore, which, again ironically, sometimes take an investment in order to do that.","So that one in particular is an investment in our IT infrastructure to do it, in the long run it pans out, but some of the fluctuation you see in costs are due to things like that that have a benefit over a longer time horizon. But we're continuing to make some of those changes.","Let's just back up on the expense question a little bit to look at \u2013 there are really two things that we're doing in parallel right now. And in each of those cases we're running dual models. So on the business model we really had business systems from front to back end that are for the old traditional model.","We have been building out a complete set of front-end and back-end to service new customers in new ways. And on the technology side, while most of our revenue is on traditional Windows-based machines with installed software, by far the fastest growing and certainly the future of the company is on cloud computing and we've been building out, not only infrastructure, but products and services for that, and we strongly believe in the future there.","The reason why we have confidence to not only do it during the transition but beyond is that some of those costs will obviously go away. They are necessary now, but they become redundant over time. So we took strong action to do it and we'll be doing more and talking about it more. But for now that's probably enough.","Gregg Moskowitz","Very helpful. Thank you.","Carl Bass","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is open.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks so much. Carl, you know you should never let us know that you're not going to tell us enough. So I mean, I have to ask more about this expense piece. So I was still modeling, I think a lot of people were still kind of that 5% that you guys had been talking about. So as we think about more of a 1% to 2%, where should we be looking for that leverage to come from?","Carl Bass","As we talked about before, we think there are couple areas. But, in general I would look across the board and I would look at -- but if you peel that back, what you would see is some of the investments we made -- e-store is like a perfect example of where those were expenses that were in there, now that we're rolling it out we will see the benefit of it in lower cost structure for people transact that way. We've done it in North America. We'll continue to do it in other geos over time and lower the cost structure there.","So as these places where we made investments for the health of the future of the business come to fruition we'll start doing it. So in some ways looking at it by function, I know that's a convenient way for you, it's easier, in some ways it's chunkier because a lot of it is around initiatives whether it's creative finishing hardware, what we're doing there. But the bulk of it will come from redundant stuff we're doing as we're able to move more activity to the new models in both the business transition and the technology transition and invest less in the traditional things. And that's all I have to say on this subject, Brendan.","Brendan Barnicle","Well, thanks for helping us out.","Carl Bass","Okay.","Brendan Barnicle","At the Analyst Day you pointed out the -- I think it was like 40% of desktop subscribers were new to Autodesk. And I was wondering if you had any stats on kind of those net new customers that you've been picking up in the model transition.","Scott Herren","No, Brendan, we're not seeing any significant change in that yet. The one update that I would give and Carl actually had it referenced at least in his opening commentary, if you remember in that same set of slides that Steve Blum went through, he talked about percentage of our total desktop sales that are being driven by the channel and we showed what that trend had looked like over the last six quarters. And we did see that, and it kind of gets at the question earlier that Phil had about what we're seeing in the channel or Brent asked about the channel.","We are seeing that continue to grow. So if you remember that slide we said at the end of Q2, 58% of our desktop subscription sales came through the channel and the quarter we just closed that was up about 2 to 3 more points. So it's the majority of our desktop sales now that are coming through channel partners and it's continuing to increase.","Brendan Barnicle","And are those channel partners generally bringing you net new Autodesk customers?","Scott Herren","It's a mix of both.","Brendan Barnicle","I thought maybe, kind of, its being your installed base.","Scott Herren","It also varies by product. Right? So -- you remember, we also went through for some of the cloud products, Fusion in particular, the statistic of new customers that that have product -- of all the customers they brought in, what percent are through. I'm I think it was north of 85% on Fusion. So it's less whether it's coming from the channel or is it just desktop.","And it's more -- these products actually getting to increasing the TAM that Amar talked about and really getting to a new customer set. And there hasn't been any change from all the data that we just showed you about six weeks ago, but we are continuing to see a very positive trend of new customers coming in.","Carl Bass","Yes. I think we spent a lot of time on things like subscriptions, but let me just take a moment here and go through where these new customers are because I think sometimes we lose track that the health of the business is going to be about news new customers.","And when you look at most of our cloud-based offerings, the first thing I'd say is that we're way ahead of the competition and the customers are coming along quickly. We might have been ahead of the customers slightly, but not for very long.","And so when you look at things like BIM 360, these are either brand new customers to Autodesk or new parts of the company that had no use for our other kinds of tools. If you look at things like PLM 360, almost entirely these are new customers to Autodesk.","Our new Internet of Things, the IoT product, is almost all new customers to Autodesk. And as Scott referenced and we\u2019ve talked about repeatedly, Fusion is clearly one where we're winning market share from existing competitors. Those are all places that are bringing in new customers and I expect that trend to accelerate as we continue to kind of gain ground and the world moves towards more cloud based tools.","Brendan Barnicle","Carl, I totally agree, that's where we want to Focus. I'm wondering if there's any way we could get some sort of quarterly metric around that, just to reinforce that point, because I thought it was such a compelling one at the Analyst Day and certainly one we\u2019d love to continue to hear more about.","Carl Bass","Brendan, I never should have gotten into that speech, should I. Yeah. Let us get back and figure out how we can best convey what we're doing. I think both, there\u2019re two things, tell me if this would be helpful, is the number of units and something about the percentage of new customers.","Brendan Barnicle","That would be -- I think that would be very valuable, yeah.","Carl Bass","Okay. Thanks.","Brendan Barnicle","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. Good evening. Carl, I'd like to ask a question that gets to both the cost structure of the company and the saleability of the products. At the Analyst Meeting you mentioned that one of your opportunities is dealing with the complexity of the portfolio.","And so the question I'd like to ask is how are you thinking or planning around simplifying the portfolio, given the large number of SKUs that you have particularly in terms of suites, just as a matter of improving sales efficiency and cost versus on the other hand your need to maintain some kind of segmentation of the product line, particularly for the different verticals?","Carl Bass","Yeah, so this can -- it's a place where we've been spending a lot of time thinking and planning for it because you're absolutely right, complexity and particularly unintended complexity drives cost. And this is a huge opportunity for us to simplify and reduce the cost. It also makes for a better experience for our customers.","And we think we can make our customers get more value and pay us more. And we've talked about this a lot with our enterprise customers. When we've given them a more flexible licensing mechanism, they use more software.","They paid us more per year. And I would say at least anecdotally they're happier about it because they really understand where the use is. And I think in the last two Investor Days we\u2019ve talked about that dynamic. The biggest thing in my mind we can do is extend that flexibility that we now have really only sold directly by us to our largest customers to the bulk of our customers in the part that's serviced by our traditional channel partners. And so we really want our mid-tier customers, the smaller, medium businesses to get that same kind of flexibility.","You're absolutely, right, Jay, we need to make sure, handing all of our products is not particularly helpful, but also breaking it down into 10,000 SKUs is not helpful either. And so we're looking at kind of the minimal set that we need so they can pay an appropriate price and get a set of tools that they might need.","In addition, what we're going to do is that, is layer in cloud services so that they can really pay on demand for the things they may or may not need. But it's really about that flexibility which is where we feel the way to simplify it and to make it a better experience for them and to make it more lucrative for us.","Scott Herren","And to the second part of your question there, if you're getting at are we still going to have a differentiation between AEC and manufacturing and M&E, that's clearly part of the thinking. Andrew was getting a little bit of this in his presentation at Investor Day of how do we simplify that, but continue to have something that is targeted and it makes sense for our user base in the various verticals. So we'll continue to maintain that at some level, but greatly simply the way we did it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","So sooner or later, and hopefully sooner, you'll deploy what would be in effect a Creative cloud like sign-on for the SMB market with what you've been calling anyway today subscribe to Autodesk. You have to come up with a better name in that. But is that a fiscal 2017 objective still?","Carl Bass","So, first of all, Jay, we appreciate the suggestions that you've published. And we've rejected them all, first of all.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Carl Bass","But -- yeah, stick to your day job. But, so yes, it's an important thing for us to offer and we will be offering it. Whether it stays that name or not, stay tuned. But yeah, it really is that flexible offering. And remember, it's not only just simplifying and the cost structure, we also \u2013 and this is slightly more complicated, but the question has come up so what do you do about the 2.1 million users and do they move to desktop subscription.","And I'll reiterate here there's 2.1 million customers have historically been our best customers. They still are our best customers today. We think the way to move them over, so that they get more value and pay more, is to move them to flexible license offerings at their discretion. And so we have a number of knobs and dials to do that.","But what we really believe is the essence of it is having a more compelling offering and everything we've been shown to date is some combination of access to more desktop products and access to the cloud services is the thing that is compelling. So you'll hear more about it. We'll introduce it. At this point, I feel like we have enough moving parts in the model that we don't need to introduce a lot more, but you will hear more about it during the year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Lastly if I may, in the future of Autodesk land, once the model gets steady state and so forth, what do you think would the role of your rebate promotions, PLOs and so forth will be? Do you think you'll have to employ those kinds of levers as often as you've done in the past under the old model?","Carl Bass","So I have a point of view. It is not widely shared by my executive management team. Yeah, I feel like promotions are important for one reason, and that is to create a compelling event for people to choose to buy. For the most part, us as well as our competitors, we sell on the value of the offerings, the quality of the offerings, the suitability of the offerings, the completeness of the offerings is what makes people buy it. When they buy is influenced by everybody likes a deal.","That if you look around the world, the number of companies who never sell with a discount is tiny in the technology business it might be nonexistent with the exception of Apple. So I see this being a way to control the timing but of course in the -- you want to minimize this as much as possible and only do it so you can create compelling events. We have a disciplined approach to promotions. They're centrally controlled. We're trying to influence behaviour. We're trying to influence behaviour not only of our customers but of our partners.","And so I think it is one of the tools we have. I would be reluctant to give it up. So you need to use it judiciously. There's an art to using it. And I think the more dogmatic point of view in which there's never a promotion and you only sell at list price doesn't fit reality and I think it takes one of the valuable tools out of your hand.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, thank you.","Carl Bass","You're welcome, Jay.","Operator","Thank you.

We had a terrific quarter, and we reached a very important milestone with the end of selling perpetual licenses. Our Q2 results mark another solid quarter of execution and progress on our two big initiatives; increasing lifetime customer value; and secondly, driving increased adoption of our cloud-based solutions. I'll share more details on our Q2 results and then update you on what we've been doing around creating long-term shareholder value before getting into the current quarter and our outlook for the rest of the year. Starting with subscription numbers, we added 109,000 net new subscriptions in the quarter. We're really happy with the growth of new model subscription additions, which more than doubled year-over-year to 125,000. It was a strong quarter for product subscriptions, which drove the vast majority of the new model sub additions and it\u2019s a clear sign of the progress on the transition with our customers and partners. Keep in mind that we didn't have any big promotions going on like we did in Q1.","Product subscriptions had strong sequential growth and dramatic year-over-year growth of over three times. Product subscriptions come to us from a number of sources. We're really pleased to see that one of the primary sources continues to be net new customers, which accounted for approximately one-third of product subscription additions in Q2. It's impossible to get perfect clarity on these new customers, but it's likely that a portion of these people were previously pirating software and now have a much more affordable option with our subscription. Still others have been using alternative design tool and can now get access to better software. Looking at the other new model subscription types, our token-based EBAs experienced good year-over-year growth, but added fewer than we did in our seasonally high Q1.","And once again, we had a record quarter for cloud subscription additions. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 are leading the way, and we continue to have success with our other cloud products such as Shotgun and Fusion Lifecycle, formerly known as PLM 360. We continue to build on our leadership in the cloud and our cloud services play an increasingly important role in our transition. Maintenance is our other primary subscription bucket. The renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions increased significantly year-over-year and remain near historic highs. Keep in mind that as we go forward, we'll start to experience larger decreases in maintenance subscriptions since we are no longer selling perpetual licenses. We'll also be incentivizing customers on maintenance to switch to a product subscription. As we've outlined in the past, by the end of next fiscal year, we expect to have more customers on our new model subscriptions than maintenance subscriptions.","We are adamant about supporting our maintenance customers, and at some point in the future, these programs will converge into a single subscription offering. As we've indicated before, growth in subscriptions will drive growth in ARR. The strong growth in new model subscriptions in Q2 fueled an 86% year-on-year constant currency increase in new model ARR. Total ARR growth was 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Total recurring revenue was 67% of our total reported revenues. That's a big jump compared to 55% in Q2 last year and a slight decrease from last quarter due to the surge in perpetual suite sales. With just a few exceptions, we're now in a subscription-only model, so you can expect another jump in the percentage of recurring revenue starting in Q3.","Our Q2 revenue results were well ahead of expectations and were influenced primarily by a larger-than-expected surge in last opportunity buying of perpetual licenses for suites. Recall that in Q4, we had 10% increase in unit volume related to the end of sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. Our analysis of Q2 suggests that just under 20% of our unit volume was related to end-of-sale activity for suites. This was bigger than expected, and I'd like to give you some insights on what we saw. It was only over the last two weeks of the quarter that we started to experience a surge in demand for suites perpetual licenses, almost entirely driven by the channel. What was really interesting is that at the same time we experienced the uptick in perpetual license sales, we also saw the acceleration of product subscription sales. The unique aspect of this activity relative to what we experienced in Q4 is that roughly half of the volume for suites came from customers crossgrading from an individual product.","This is neutral to the subscription count since the customer has to be on maintenance in order to crossgrade, but it's absolutely positive for in-period revenue and ultimately ARR, since the customer will be paying more annually for their maintenance plan. Overall, the increase in volume related to the end of perpetual suites was greater than we anticipated, but we are very pleased with how product subscriptions performed in the quarter and the overall net result is positive for Autodesk. Our total unit volume in the second quarter increased compared to Q2 last year and was in line with our expectations even when normalizing for the increased activity related to the end of sale for suites. It's not surprising that the end of sale for suites drove a sequential uptick in license revenue. What might be surprising is that we're not seeing faster growth in our as-reported subscription revenue line. There are two things that are inhibiting that growth. The first is FX, which is causing about a 4 point headwind. The second is the accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue.","While our new model subscriptions are deferred and recognized ratably over their contract length, a sizable portion of both our product subscription and our EBAs are recognized as license revenue. In fact, roughly 80% of product subscription and roughly 55% of EBAs get recorded as license revenue. Cloud is the only new model subscription type that gets 100% recorded as subscription revenue. If all the new model subscriptions were recognized 100% as subscription revenue, that line would show 10% year-over-year growth as reported and 14% growth adjusted for currency. We are currently working towards providing a clearer breakout of our reporting so that our total subscription revenue can be seen directly in our reporting disclosures.","Now let me get into a few more details of our Q2 results. By now it should be very clear that our channel partners are fully engaged with our subscription model. 68% of new model subscription additions came through our channel partners compared to just 47% in Q2 last year and 63% last quarter. The volume of subscriptions coming through our eStore also continues to gain momentum and nearly doubled from Q2 last year. Total direct revenue was 25% in the second quarter despite most of the surge from the end of sale of suites coming through the channel. That's up from 20% in Q2 last year. On the expense side, our total spend decreased by almost 4% as we continue to diligently control our spending. We are continuing to make structural changes that allow us to spend less yet focus on our key initiatives. While we are being very disciplined about our spending, we are doing it without compromising the long-term health of the company. ","We also increased our stock buyback in Q2 to $170 million in light of the dip in the stock caused by the temporary panic around the Brexit vote. Overall, we were very pleased with the Q2 results. All of the trends we saw reinforced our confidence that the transition is working for our customers, our partners and Autodesk. That's a good segue into what I've touched on in the last couple of earnings calls about what we're doing to create long-term value for our shareholders. We continue to get many questions in this area, so I'm happy to talk about it. If you've been around the tech industry as long as I have, you've no doubt seen the carnage of once great technology companies that ultimately failed to innovate and keep their competitive advantage. Autodesk has been the leader in the world of design and engineering software for over 30 years and what we're doing with this transition is positioning Autodesk to lead the next generation of this kind of software.","Our transition happens on two fronts. We're currently in the midst of a business model and pricing transition, where our customers are moving to term-based subscriptions. This will lead to a highly predictable model over time and a significant increase in the value our customers get from our products. The best indicator for this is the rapid growth we're experiencing in new model subscriptions and new model ARR. In support of this model change, we are simplifying our entire go-to-market strategy and reducing our cost structure while we increase our ability to more effectively serve our customers. The second front of our transition is how we are building platforms to exploit the cloud and dramatically expand the size of our market opportunities. We're well ahead of our traditional competitors on this front, and we're investing to secure the future of Autodesk. These mobile and cloud technologies are opening up significant opportunities in the areas of construction and manufacturing that are completely new to Autodesk. These new platforms are for a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the competitive landscape. Our cloud-based products continue to gain momentum and are already the undisputed leaders in their respective categories.","So this is how I'd summarize how we're building long-term shareholder value in three simple bullets; one, we're increasing the lifetime value of every customer; two, we're changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go-to-market strategies; and three, we're building the best cloud and mobile-based products and services in the industry, which significantly expands our total available market as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud. Now let's take a look at what's going on here in the current quarter, Q3. Our newly introduced Collections are a great example of increasing lifetime customer value. On August 1, we launched Collections, which is our next generation of suites with the addition of our cloud services. Suites was tremendously successful for Autodesk, but with Collections, we're significantly reducing complexity by offering just 3 Collections, one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and one for M&E, making them easier to sell and consume. We're offering single-user and multi-user access and choices of different term lengths to fit their needs. The value of our customers is tremendous and well exceeds the premium suite. We've priced Collections so that the average customer value to Autodesk will increase as well. We're only 25 days into selling Collections, but we're very happy with the start.","Despite the strong performance of suites at the end of Q2, in their first few weeks we're seeing the same volume level for Collections that we experienced for suites in the same period a year ago. From a tactical standpoint, some of you have been asking about pricing and promotions. We are currently running another promotion aimed at our legacy customers. It's similar to the very successful promotion that we ran in Q1, but the discount is smaller. You can expect us to continue to work to convert these legacy customers with various promotions and incentives as we go forward. Like I've said before, running a business is different than running a spreadsheet. One area that we constantly evaluate is how we use pricing to drive subscriptions and ARR growth. Having said that, we wouldn't make significant decisions around packaging or pricing without first testing in certain markets. This is especially true when it comes to our flagship products like AutoCAD and LT. In early September, pricing changes will go into effect that will rationalize the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. We believe these moves will drive customers to the right product for their needs at higher billings and ARR for Autodesk.","Now turning to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Our view of the macroeconomic environment's impact on our business hasn't changed over the past several quarters. The global conditions have remained uneven with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environment. And as I indicated earlier, we don't see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. As always, it's impossible to say what the long-term impact might be, but we don't see any near-term risk. Our strong Q2 results likely pulled forward some demand from the second half of the year, but we're comfortable with bringing up the bottom end of our previous ranges for both revenue and EPS for FY '17. We're also lowering our spend projection for FY '17 based on the better-than-expected progress we've made on this front.","We remain confident in our long-term goals of growing our subscription base by a 20% CAGR through FY '20, which will drive a 24% CAGR in ARR. We also remain committed to keeping spend growth flat in FY '18. The lower spend projection also enhances our projected path to free cash flow of roughly $6 per share in FY '20 and $11 per share in FY '23.","So to wrap things up, we're very pleased with the consistent execution over the past few quarters. We're really excited to be another major step further along in the transition and now fully in the subscription-only model. We have a clear vision and plan for creating a more predictable, recurring and profitable business in the years to come. We are focused on driving higher lifetime value, simplifying our offerings and our go-to-market activities, and significantly increasing our market opportunity as we lead the next wave of design and engineering software to the cloud.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Carl, let me ask you first about the pricing that you plan to take next month. Could you give some specifics as to how you're thinking about what the changes might be? And is this part of what you referred to in the past as SRP realization as a concept for you to help improve pricing and margin? Secondly, with respect to the decay of classic maintenance over time, how are you thinking about the rate of that decline? When we look at one of your competitors BBC, which is moving mostly but not entirely to subscription, the state of rate of decline for their maintenance is low to mid-single digit. So would you anticipate going fully to subscription that your decay of maintenance might be so much faster than that?","Carl Bass","Yes. So let me start with the pricing and then Scott and I can kind of tag team the one about the maintenance decline. So starting with the pricing, what we wanted to do was, as I said, kind of rationalize the 3 different price points of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. Whenever possible, we would like customers to get the right product. More often than not, that is on AutoCAD vertical, particularly tailored to what they -- the discipline they're in. And on the other side, for the more casual users, LT is clearly the more appropriate product. And what we were trying to do is move the price points apart, get the appropriate separation. And what we saw, I kind of referred to in the remarks, in our testing is that we can, with the right pricing, move more LT customers to AutoCAD and AutoCAD customers to the vertical. And so this is a part of the overall pricing.","I wouldn't say it's particularly what I would refer to the SRP realization. It's just increasing total pricing, but it's part of a pricing optimization strategy. And let me take the first pass. Couple of things will contribute to the maintenance decline, as you said, classic maintenance. One is going to be the fall off from people who just choose not to renew for all of the usual reasons. The second one will be the conversion of the maintenance customers on to the subscription side. And on the first one, we talked a little bit about it and that we said that we expected the subscription base to be larger by the end of next year, and we gave you some hints or at least we gave you an algebra problem you can work on tonight, Jay. And then on the second one, we also talked a little bit about programmatic ways of doing that and over time how we will continue to encourage customers to move from classic maintenance to the new subscriptions. Scott, you want to add something?","Scott Herren","No, I think you said it right. It's the decay rate. We [indiscernible] vary within that pool of maintenance subscribers by the way between low-end LT customers that have a slightly lower renewal rate versus suites maintenance customers, which have a much higher renewal rate. So as that pool moves over, the maintenance pool will go continually down from this point, basically 1 minus our turn rate. And at that point, what you'll see is the mix will shift inside that pool. So if you think of maintenance revenue as a P-time SKU, think of the price, the average price inside there beginning to shift more toward suites customers out through time, but the overall decline being driven by the low-end LT customers. I think the other way to peg this, Jay, as you sit down and do your modeling, is what we've said -- and I think we showed you these curves back at Investor Day, that our expectation is by the end of next year, the number of maintenance subscribers and the maintenance ARR will be below the new model subscribers and new model ARR by the end of next year.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.","Saket Kalia","Maybe first to start off, I know ARR, maybe this is for you, Scott, but I know ARR is the better metric to look at. But for those of us that still look at billings, can you just give us a sense for how billings or maybe trending for those new model subscribers or new model billings versus maintenance billings because you obviously have a headwind from maintenance in that deferred revenue accounts? So any color on how new model billings are doing would be helpful?","Scott Herren","Yes, Saket. One of the reasons that I don't think billings are the best indicator of our progress of course is they are term specific. And if I sign a new customer, but they only sign up for 1 year, that's 1\/3 of the billings if I sign that same customer for 3 years. So I think it's a little bit less of an indicator than things like ARR, which are annualized than, of course, the overall subscription growth. But if you do quick math, deferred revenue changed by $3 million during the quarter, so our billings tracked pretty much to our reported revenues. And when you peel back billings at a high level, they track very much in line with what you see on subscription versus license.","Saket Kalia","Got it. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, Carl, I think you mentioned that you saw good crossgrade activity for maintenance to product subscriptions, which of course is a net neutral to the subs count. Can you just give us a sense for how many of those crossgrade you saw this quarter? And then more broadly, are you still seeing customers from product versions older than five years make that crossgrade?","Carl Bass","Yes, so let me go backwards. Well, so we didn't see customers from very far back because we didn't run any of the promotions. So the typical kind of legacy promotion where people had to be on subscription already. What I did mention is that in Q3, we were running a similar promotion to the one that we ran in Q1. So again, we'll talk about that 90 days from now and see how many of the legacy customers we can attract. We didn't break out the number on your other question of people who converted, but it was a substantial number. I'll leave it to Scott if he wants to give a number.","Scott Herren","Yes, the color I'd add to that is, if you think of the quarter that we just closed, we actually saw 2 end of sale surges kind of at the same time. There was -- the normal end of sale surge that -- like we saw in Q4, where it was the last chance for our customer who wanted to buy a Suite perpetual license and there are some buy ahead activity, some pull ahead of future demand for that set of customers. And by the way, we predicted that, I think, pretty accurately versus what the results were. The piece that also happened was, of course, when we saw your last perpetual license, you also saw your last crossgrade.","And we saw a lot of the same behavior that we saw at the end of -- if you remember when we stop selling upgrades in our fiscal '15, so more than a year ago, we saw a big spike in demand for people who were already using our product, but decided they wanted to upgrade to a more full functioned product. They're willing to pay more for it. We saw some of that same upgrade-like behavior happen within our crossgrades. And I think that's the piece that surprised us a bit and it's a positive for ARR. It's a neutral for subscribers because you had to be on maintenance to be eligible for the crossgrade, but it's a positive for ARR and it's a positive for total revenue going forward. So that's the way I would think about the surge we saw at the end of this quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard Davis","So it sounds like -- I mean, you're getting good growth as you kind of pointing out, reduced piracy and also kind of changed vendors. The question that I hear, when you hear from people thinking about changing vendors is a big hurdle is just kind of the data migration and things like that. Has there been any -- have you guys done anything technologically to make that less painful? Because if I have a model set and a different vendor, I'm terrified that if I move it over to you guys, it will incinerate me or something like that. So that's really kind of -- help me understand how you can make that less fearful for these folks trying to...","Carl Bass","Yes. Despite the advice of our legal counsel, I can guarantee you it will incinerate you, Richard. Let me just divide the markets and talk about the dynamics slightly differently. In the AEC market, which is more project based, it comes up for a building or a roadway or a bridge. There is more willingness -- there is slightly more willingness to shift with new projects as new teams come together. I think the place where you hear even greater reluctance is in manufacturing. And there we did -- we've done a number of things that we've rolled out across our product portfolio that allow customers to work in new software and access the data that they created over the last couple of decades. So they can work with the native data. They don't -- obviously, as always, we can translate it and convert it. But even more importantly, we now let customers leave their data in the native data format and work on it whether they're doing modeling or visualization or simulation.","So that's been, over the last two years, a pretty big breakthrough in giving people a much smoother ramp to go from one of the legacy products to a new one. And at a certain point, one of the other things that has to happen in motivating people to move to something is the new stuff has to be that much better. If you think about it, particularly manufacturing, many of the products that people are using are more than 20 years old. And we would like to think in the industry that we can do better than having 20-year-old products be state of the art. So part of it is making the new products and the new product experiences much more compelling. The other is to reassure people about being able to migrate their data or to use all their data and access it for as long as they need to.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Shateel Alam","This is Shateel Alam in for Heather. First one is on expenses. So your expenses were down 4% this quarter and you lowered guidance for the year. Can you talk about some of the actions you've taken that are driving this spend to be lower than you're expecting? In the past, you talked about discontinuing some noncore products in trade of hardware. Just wondering if we could see more of that. Are you done with that type of product streamlining?","Carl Bass","The two biggest places have clearly been on consolidation of the product portfolio, and the second place is in, I just say, overall in our go-to-market activities. As it refers to the product portfolio, I mean, we're on a multi-year transition to a much more streamlined portfolio, including making the end of life of certain products. But also, as you look at collections as a big simplification from suites, all across the board, we're trying to simplify the portfolio, make it easy on customers, make it easy on our partners. And so you'll continue to see the folding in of certain functionality into the products that we keep going forward, the elimination of some of the older and less important ones. And we're constantly pruning for the things that work and don't work. So I would not, at all, expect to see -- or said more positively, I would expect to see that same kind of proactive management of the portfolio for the next couple of years.","Shateel Alam","Got it, that's helpful. And then for my follow-up, new model subs, the additions of 125 was higher than we're expecting. Can you just give some color on the mix that was traditional, desktop and EBA versus new cloud offerings? And are we starting to see new cloud subs become a higher portion of the adds now?","Scott Herren","Yes, Shateel. This is Scott. We had a record, I think, Carl mentioned this actually in the opening commentary. We had a record quarter for cloud sub adds, so it continues to move along nicely. But that new model space will continue -- did this quarter and will continue into the future to be dominated by product subscriptions, so term licenses. In fact, for the first time, we had more inventory of product subscriptions within the new model type than of enterprise coming out of the EBAs. So think of it as being dominated by product subscriptions, EBAs would be next, cloud would be next.","Shateel Alam","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay. Thank you very much and good afternoon. Carl, if you look at Asia Pac, customers there have historically moved more slowly to adapt to our subscriptions. In the Q1, however, you did reference, I think, an uptick in new model subscriptions towards the end of that period. Can you give us an update on what you saw out of Asia in Q2?","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean, I will continue to say that parts of Asia are slower to adopt the new model. We've had some pockets of success with some of our traditional partners in some of the electronic channels that have been more positive, but overall, slightly slower adoption with a handful of countries. And as you do the analysis, it's a little bit hard to dissect exactly what's going on since up until now, the preference of the channel partners kind of shown through and that they were able to exert certain forces on the customers. Moving forward, that goes away so, hopefully, everyone will be aligned. It's a great relief to make it to August 1 and get into just the new model. And I suspect going forward, we'll see more normalization. But given that there were two choices, Asia Pac certainly lagged a little bit.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, that's helpful. And then just for Scott, based on where you are at this point in the year, you're calling for about 250,000 or so net subscribers in the second half, at least, at the midpoint of the range. And I know you don't guide quarterly, of course, but maybe you can just share with the group your high-level thoughts around net adds for Q3 as compared with Q4 as you see it today. Thanks.","Scott Herren","Yes, sure, Gregg. We always have a seasonal pattern of demand. If you think of where the subs will come into the second half of the year, there will be more than 100% of what we add will be new model, right. Maintenance will be on a continual slow, but on a steady decline. So all of the new adds will come from new model types. New model types tend to have the same seasonality as a lot of our, previously, our perpetual license did. So heavier in Q4 than in Q3 would be normal demand pattern. We also see Q4 typically heavy on EBA sales, although as you see in the last couple of years, we sell a lot of them in Q4, the EBAs will pick up those subs in Q1. So think of this as being driven -- the Q3 versus Q4 driven by our normal seasonality pattern first. And then secondarily, we do think was were some demand pulled forward from some of the end of sale of suites at the very end of Q2 that probably makes Q3 from a sub adds standpoint a little bit more challenging than what we'd normally expect with normal seasonality.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup.","Ken Wong","Great. Thanks for taking my question. My first question for you, Carl, with collections now, it's been out in the market for about a month. How should we think about kind of the customers you're attracting here? Is it customers that are using a few products moving up to collections? Or are you seeing your traditional suite customers kind of recognize the incremental value with this comprehensive bundle, and those are ones that are primarily moving towards collections?","Carl Bass","Yes, Ken, it's probably just a little too early to know for sure. And it's almost like give us the two more months. In this first month, we have certainly seen some of the suites customers move over. Some of the buying at the end of the quarter was anticipation of being able to move from suites to collections. So there's certainly some of that in there, but we'll be able to do a little bit better breakdown of the customers when we get a little bit more traction there. It's just a little bit premature.","Ken Wong","Got it. And then earlier in your prepared remarks, you mentioned at some point convert to a single subscription offering. Is this just consistent with what you guys have said in the past where just kind of a natural bleed off of maintenance and then you eventually just be all kind of new model subs? Or is there something more specific that you guys are looking to do to try to converge that process sooner?","Carl Bass","Two things. I think we're being more direct in a general sense, but it's probably, at this point, we don't want to give more details. But what we do know and we have talked about the complexity and the expense that comes with multiple models. And so we'll continue to look at ways to just simplify all of the offerings and merge the programs into one as it makes sense. But I think we were, at least, hinting at more proactive behavior on our part.","Scott Herren","Yes, Ken, the only color I would add to that is you've seen us do some of this already, first, with suites and now with collections. You see us bundling together to kind of ease the ramp from -- you see us bundling the Windows-based, whether it's perpetual license or product subscriptions, with cloud to kind of ease that on-ramp. And I think you'll see us continue to do more of that to make it easier to consume, to give customers a choice within what they ought to execute, whichever product type that they like. That was one of the guiding tenants with the way we design collections, and I think you'll just see that continue.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley","Hi. Most of my questions have been asked, but let me ask about Japan. Just maybe color on what is going on there. And is there, trend-wise, any hope or any color on that would be great.","Carl Bass","I'd say flat line. It is what it is. It hasn't gotten better and it hasn't gotten worse. Scott, would you want to...","Scott Herren","I think, that's right. I think, the year-on-year impacts in Japan are probably more pronounced than elsewhere because they were slower last year to adopt a new model type, so the falling off a cliff of going from perpetual license to new model types is more pronounced in Japan than it is elsewhere. I think that's part of what we're seeing. Part of it is just the continuation of the trend that we've seen where it's been a tough economy in Japan, and we feel some of that. And I think it's -- so no change is what I'd say, Steve. But I think part of what we're feeling from a year-on-year standpoint is just the difference in the adoption model.","Steve Ashley","And then in terms of the promotions you're running, you've been great about calling out the fact that you are running a fairly aggressive promotion less discounting than we saw in the first quarter. But in terms of digital marketing and how much wood you're putting behind the arrow, is there any difference in how visible you will be with this promotion versus the one you ran in the first quarter?","Carl Bass","Yes, Steve. What I said, last time, we thought the promotion was generous, but not well known by all of our customers. And after having run it in that one quarter, we thought we could turn the two knobs and turn down the discounting and turn up the awareness. And as we said a quarter ago, we were extremely pleased and surprised by the results at how far back into a legacy user base we could reach. And that was with, I'd say, minimal awareness. And so we would like to promote that more heavily going forward, and we thought we could accomplish both goals of greater SRP realization and a good response by just turning up the awareness. So you should see a little bit more of it. And as we indicated in the opening commentary, you can see more of it going forward.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. Given the fact that suites were a bigger part of sort of what was going on in this quarter, you talked a lot about a lot more new model subscription types coming from suites. I would have expected the ARPS number, the pricing side of the equation start to improve. But by my math, it's still down sequentially a little bit both on maintenance and new model subs. One -- as a two-part question, one, why has that continued to decline? And two, when should we expect that to turn back up and start being one of the drivers of ARR growth?","Scott Herren","Yes, Keith. We talked about this I think last quarter as well. Part of what's going on there is just the math. When you do the ARPS calculation, you're taking a quarter average ARR and dividing it by a quarter end sub count, right? So if you go back and say quarter average ARR divided by quarter average sub count, you'll get a different answer on that. But I think overriding longer term, you do need to expect for some period of time that to continue to come down. And it will come down simply driven by mix. We've talked about ARPS being very mix sensitive. It will continue to be mix sensitive. And as we get further out and layer on more quarters of selling suites and collections in our higher-priced products only in the new model way, you'll begin to see that ARPS rebound. But short term, we'll continue -- that pool will be more heavily dominated by the lower-priced LT and AutoCAD, things that have been out there only as product subs for the last six months. That's the way you ought to think about it. Very mix sensitive.","Carl Bass","And to be a little bit more quantitative about it, I would look out about three quarters before we probably saw the inflection.","Keith Weiss","Okay. And that's just because -- that's what I was going to how long it will take for the demand on the suite side of the equation or now the collection side of the equation to really ramp up and sort of normalize that mix? It felt like once you end perpetual for suites and all the new buying for those high-end products becomes new model, that should start sort of inflecting that number upwards?","Scott Herren","Yes, you've got to layer in multiple quarters of that ARR, Keith, before it gets -- it becomes as representative of the total new model ARR as the things that have already been out there for two or three quarters selling it only in a new model way. So that's the reason you see the lag. It starts now, but there'll be a lag effect before you get that entire pool properly representing what the new sales look like.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS.","Brent Thill","Thanks. Scott, the midpoint of the guide looks like there's a little sequential growth from Q3 to Q4. Can you just explain why that is?","Scott Herren","One of the benefits of the shift that we're taking is we have a lot more clarity on day one of a quarter of what the reported revenues are going to look like. So as we look at both what we already have in deferred revenue for Q3 and what's sitting in backlog, we've got very high coverage of the number that we forecast for Q3 and obviously, a higher degree of certainty on that. As we get closer to Q4, we'll be in that same position on Q4, and we can evaluate if it makes sense to go up at that point.","Brent Thill","Okay. And just a follow-up on the ARPS question. It was down 7%. I mean, should we continue to expect over the next couple of quarters that to be down mid-single digit? Is that kind of a good way to think of it? Or should we think on the higher end of this?","Scott Herren","Yes. Let me start, Carl, and you can add color. So think of ARPS at a minimum in the two line items, maintenance separate from new model. New model will have the trend that I just talked about, to Keith on the prior question, right? It will take a couple of quarters for that entire pool of new model ARR to be representative of the new sales that are going on. On the maintenance side, I think, you'll see the ARPS there rebound a little bit quicker. We will see -- we'll continue to see higher renewal rates on suites, and the suites will become a bigger part of the pool faster. So it may be a quarter out, it may be two quarters out, but I think you can expect to see ARPS rebound a little bit more quickly on the maintenance side than on the new model side.","Carl Bass","Yes, I would agree directionally with Scott, and I would say back to the mix, I think, as we gauge the success of legacy promotions and just the cloud services that will affect the mix as well. So we'll be able to give a little bit more clarity as we go there.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Thanks. Hi, guys. Given the perpetual sales of suites were higher than you expected in the quarter, is there a way to quantify the unit volume beyond the items you gave earlier? And specifically, what I'm looking for is, is there any chance that, that has an impact on your full year 475,000 to 525,000 subscription addition number because of that pull forward?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I mean, one is we raised the bottom of the range, which is our indication that we don't think it has any effect. We remain confident in that and I would say, increasingly confident about it. It was interesting to see, and as I tried to highlight in the remarks, as we saw the surge in the perpetual suites, what we also saw was the new model stuff also take off in the last couple of weeks. So we saw higher -- obviously, higher than anticipated volume. And I said when we give back out the extra buying of perpetual suites, it was the volume of activity that we would have expected for this quarter. It was -- it slightly exceeded our expectations. And then on top of that, we also had whatever pull forward. So I think you may see some shifting between quarters on the margin, but we're comfortable with the guidance for the rest of the year. And that's why we're willing to bring up the numbers.","Scott Herren","Yes, Sterling, I think that's kind of a little -- sorry, just on that last one, a little more context for you around the new model sub adds of 125,000 in the quarter. If you remember back in Q1, new model sub adds were 140,000, but buried in there were two things that didn't recur in Q2. One was the promo. We didn't run that legacy-focused promo in Q2. We will do that again, as Carl said, in Q3. The second is we had a big catchup of the EBAs that rolled in, in Q1 and were a little bit more than 25,000 of that 140,000 we had in Q1. If you net those two out, Q1, without those two, is in the, call it, 90,000 range. That grew to 125,000 new model sub adds in Q2. So I don't -- there's certainly the pull ahead, I don't think, signals any weakness in where we're headed of the new model side. ","The only thing to bear in mind is a part of the pull ahead that we saw, a significant part, was driven by crossgrades. And to be eligible for a crossgrade, you had to already be a customer with a maintenance agreement attached. So all of those -- all of that pull ahead business was really neutral to subs. They already have a sub and they have a sub now. So it's not a big piece of that pull ahead. Really doesn't affect the subs growth.","Sterling Auty","That makes sense. And then the follow-up. Carl, the comment you said that the subscription has accelerated the same time as the perpetual. Were you suggesting that you had customers that were buying both perpetual and subscriptions? Or do you think it was more coincidental to see both accelerating at the same time?","Carl Bass","I don't \u2013 now, I'm speaking a little out of school. We got to do a little bit more work on this. But I don't think it was customers buying both. That's just a little bit of an awkward purchase. I think it was the outreach from our channel partners\u2019 created demand. And when people decided to buy, then they made the choice. But more likely is they chose one or the other, not both at this point.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg from RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg","Sure. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Scott, I've got a modeling question. Now that you're done with the license option for software, how should we think of the trajectory of the run rate of that license line going forward? I think you do allocate some of the subscription sale to license. Is that correct?","Scott Herren","That is right, Matt. So if you look at that line, there's two components to it. One is perpetual license sales that get immediately recognized and of course, that piece goes to zero. The second is that line is actually a license and other, so there's some -- there's a grab bag of smaller items in there, some legacy products, little bit of consulting in there, so that piece, we've talked about that historically. If you go back a few quarters when we were selling perpetual licenses, that piece being about 10% of the total. That other piece will continue, the perpetual license piece goes to zero. The third piece is what you just said. Both the product subs and the EBAs, of course, when we sell it, it goes immediately into deferred revenue and gets recognized ratably. ","But as it comes out of deferred, a portion of it -- because if you think of a term license, the customer is buying two things. They're buying access to the license and they're buying maintenance. So a portion of that deferred revenue accretes back into the license line and a portion of it accretes back into the maintenance line. I know it's confusing. I would love to say that I'm changing that today. We are working on changing that so that it's much clearer for you to be able to see how subscription revenue comes back into a line called subscription. Maintenance is in the maintenance line. And then what's left in license and other really is mostly other at that point.","Carl Bass","Yes. As I said, it's roughly 80% of the product subscription and 55% of the EBAs get recorded as license revenue. So it's way more than, I think, many people have in their models. And we're doing everything we can to change it and try to clarify it so that it's much clearer in terms of what, I think, everyone would just affectionately refer to as subscription. So we'll try to make this as clear possible, but hopefully, with -- there's two pieces of data. It's a little bit easy for others to model what's going on.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Hey, guys. Sorry about that. Yeah. Thank you so much. Sorry about that. I wasn't sure if this question has been asked earlier, but I guess, more for Scott. What is your view on the new accounting standard that is being proposed by the FASB being reviewed by the SEC? I think they call it the ASC 606 that particularly applies to software companies that are trying to move into a more ratable model. How much of it does apply to Autodesk? How much of it does not apply to Autodesk? Just curious about your thoughts. Thank you. ","Scott Herren","Sure, Kash, it applies to everyone. It's not just Autodesk or non-Autodesk. It applies to everyone who's selling software. What we've been doing on that front, and I think we talked about this when you were in town a couple of months ago, we have been very actively engaged on this as we've done everything that we have to shift to a ratable revenue model, the last thing I want is to have that shift back based on the new rev rec guidelines. So our, I guess, he's now our controller has actually been a part of the AICPA task force that's working on clarifying the guidelines for FASB on how that will work. And if you think of a lot of our offerings, they're actually hybrid offerings. There's some term license in there, but there's a lot of cloud-based offering inside there. And so we are committed to continuing to maintain ratable revenue for our product sales for both the product subscription sales going forward -- obviously, cloud is pretty straightforward, and for EBAs. And we're staying very actively in touch with the group as those rules get clarified.","Kash Rangan","And one follow-up, if I could, for Carl, and I apologize if this question has already been answered. If yes, you don't need to. Any impact that you see from fiscal stimulus if the next presidential cycle brings that forth? Do you think there's any pent-up demand for infrastructure build-out globally and then particularly, in the United States that could help you guys? Thank you.","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, anything that's, first, a larger infrastructure spend will be good. I would say just generally speaking, if you look across industries right now, AEC seems strong in all the countries we talked about where the economies are good. Construction in the US is really strong. Northern and Central Europe is really healthy. I mean, if there's political changes, there's more infrastructure spend, that would all be to the good side. We're not counting on it. We've heard that promise before, so -- but it would certainly be to our advantage.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First on the ARR. The ARR growth here was close to 10% but your long-term target is 24% CAGR, right? So this quarter, yes, of course, perpetual is impacting it, but for the next quarter, as you're not filling anymore perpetual licenses, should the ARR growth start trending towards 24% CAGR you've talked about?","Scott Herren","It will, Monika. That's not intended to be every single year and every single quarter will be 24%, obviously. I know you know that. It's a CAGR over that time frame. You will see ARR growth rates accelerate in the second half of the year, partly, because you see the divergence in the ARR growth rates between maintenance on a slight decline and new model growing 86% year-on-year at constant currency as new model becomes a bigger piece of the total, that drives it up. But also, as we go forward, there will be a higher and higher mix of new model subs. And within that, the subscriptions growth that will continue to drive new model to a significantly higher level. So you will see that begin to accelerate in the second half and continue.","Monika Garg","Thanks. So on the follow-up side, if you look at the revenue on the platform solution PSEB segment, that has come down Q-over-Q and year-over-year. Is there any reclassification in that segment?","Scott Herren","There is. It's a continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters, actually, since we launched suites three years ago, three-plus years ago since we launched suites because what drives the vast majority of that PSEB segment is AutoCAD and LT. And of course, AutoCAD is included in almost all of our -- in fact, it might be in all of our suites that gets sold. And so what\u2019s happening is it's not that there's less AutoCAD going out into the world. What's happening instead is there's less of it being sold standalone and therefore, dropping into that PSEB segment and more of it being sold as a component in a suite and in the future, as a component in collections.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one more question today. Our final question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush.","Steve Koenig","Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. I apologize if this question has been asked. I just wanted to maybe understand probably a little bit your thinking behind collections and your design philosophy for it? And just my background for this question was, we were looking for an offering other than desktop subscription that might be a little bit more appropriate for the mid-market. Seeing some resistance in the mid-market to the subscriptions, more so than for AutoCAD and LTs being sold as DTS in the low end of the market. And yet collections, it looks very much like the desktop subscription. It's a larger bundle at a slightly higher price point. Maybe the question, besides your kind of your intent behind it is, what are the dividing line be in the market between your T-Flex and your EBAs versus Collections when it comes to consuming the suites in terms of kind of company side? Is that how we should think about it and what might that size be?","Carl Bass","Yes, so the first thing I would say is, so far, we gave a lot of proof points, hopefully, tonight. We haven't seen the resistance. And as a matter of fact, much of -- many of the new products and desktop subscriptions for both suites and collections is being sold through our channel partners, which serves the broadly speaking mid-market. So we think collections are a nice way to both simplify and get people the easy ramp to the new cloud services, so what they're familiar with plus the new stuff. Let me jump to the other side of it is our EBAs -- and as you mentioned, the technology behind it, the T-Flex, is really in the less than the top 1% of our accounts. ","So it has a lot of room to grow before these two things run into each other. And what I would add is I would expect to see more flexibility in our product offerings going forward. Collections is really just a first step in the door of what we're going to do in terms of making sure the customers have more flexibility. And that's regardless of how it will be sold. At the same time, we've documented and we've talked about how we really want to see our EBAs go out to a broader audience and how that will grow over time. So we think there's a lot of room between the two right now, and there's actually an opportunity to introduce other offerings that have that level of flexibility from T-Flex. But for example, it can easily be sold by our channel partners.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2014 Autodesk Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Dave Gennarelli, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investors. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter, long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, new business model introductions, new product and suite releases, market adoption and expected growth rates, cost management efforts, hiring plans, business execution, business prospect and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our plan to roll out rental license offerings, our transition to cloud and mobile computing, our educational vertical strategy, trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC.","Specifically, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2013, from 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2013, and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call but will not provide any further guidance or updates on our performance during the call -- quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start today's call with a discussion of our second quarter performance. Later, I'll talk about the exciting changes that are underway at Autodesk and how we believe our business model will evolve more quickly than some have anticipated.","Looking at the second quarter, total revenue came in above the middle of our range, with a backdrop of some challenges in our end markets. Similar to what other enterprise software and PLM companies have reported recently, we experienced a mixed demand environment despite more positive macroeconomic data that would suggest a stronger market.","On the positive side, our AEC business segment performed well, with strong growth in the Americas and APAC. Our suites continue to have strong performance, and Japan experienced strong growth on a constant currency basis. Conversely, variances in some of our end markets influenced our run rate products like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT this quarter.","On the product side, we continue to see steady customer adoption of our cloud and mobile solutions during the quarter. Our performance in EMEA remains mixed by country. While APAC revenue was down as reported, it posted decent growth on a constant currency basis led by strong growth in Japan and solid growth in China. Within the Americas, we experienced modest growth. Growth in emerging countries remains challenging. While recent economic forecasts indicate that growth in emerging countries may lag developed economies, it continues to be a focus area for improvement and future growth.","At the start of the fiscal year, we made a strategic decision to begin shifting our education business from selling to granting our software licenses in select regions and to key partners. This is an investment in the future for Autodesk. It will also benefit the industries we serve by having a greater number of design and engineering graduates fluent in Autodesk tools.","Today, tens of millions of students and educators are using our products. The net impact of the change in our education strategy is a drag of approximately 2 percentage points of revenue growth for the quarter, primarily coming out of the Americas, and we anticipate the -- about the same impact for our full year results. This impact was contemplated in our previous guidance.","Consistent with the past few quarters, our AEC segment delivered solid results. The green shoots of building and construction activity that we started to see a few quarters ago continue to grow. Aiding more growth in AEC is our leadership in BIM. We continue to add to our extensive portfolio of BIM solutions in both our AEC suites and BIM 360, our cloud offering.","Within our Manufacturing segment, we saw solid growth in suites. Last quarter, I mentioned the success we were having in the automotive industry. That success has continued in the second quarter as we knot significant wins with global manufacturers as well as key suppliers. We're seeing expanded adoption of our design, engineering, visualization and simulation products throughout the automotive industry.","Our arsenal of solutions for manufacturer is growing stronger as earlier [ph] this month, we added 2 new products to our simulation portfolio, one for composite design, one for composite analysis. The addition to these new products helps us reach new markets and assist our customers in developing the next generation of lighter, stronger, safer and more energy-efficient products. In total, our suites continues to grow faster than our overall business as customers realize the value and power of our suites.","Suites have grown to represent 34% of total revenue for the quarter, up from 23% just 3 years ago. Our AEC suites had a particularly strong quarter, and we're experiencing strong momentum of our AutoCAD design suites.","Turning to our cloud products. Fusion 360 made its official debut in the quarter. Fusion 360 is the world's first cloud-based software that combines industrial and mechanical design. Though it enables people to fuse stunning aesthetic design with great product engineering, it brings together capabilities typically found in separate mechanical, industrial and conceptual design tools into one easy-to-use cloud-based service. It has had hugely enthusiastic reception by customers and industry watchers, and we're very excited about its future.","More and more, engineers, architects and designers took advantage of our cloud-based services during the quarter. POM 360 continues to gain customers. A common occurrence is that customers come back to us shortly after the initial sale and order more seats, which is a great sign.","PLM 360 is going head-to-head with traditional PLM players and customers are selecting PLM 360 because it's not only solving their core PLM business issues but because it's cloud-based, it's easy to use and it's more flexible and scalable. We continue to see growth across all areas of the PLM business and the pipeline continues to grow.","Just yesterday, we introduced the newest addition to our BIM portfolio with Autodesk Point Layout for layout at construction sites. This product underscores our efforts to transform the construction industry using BIM from the earliest stages of design all the way through project delivery and building operations.","Many of you have shown a great deal of interest in our consumer business and how things are going there. Though only a few years old, we've made incredible progress to date. We finished the quarter with more than 136 million users and have surpassed 50 million monthly active users. These 50 million users have used our consumer products more than 220 million times in the last 30 days.","The sheer size and uniqueness of our creative platform is attracting brands from around the world to partner with us. While with challenges in some of our end markets have led us to lower our third quarter revenue forecasts, we're taking action to rekindle growth. At the same time, the investments we made in new products or cloud platform and new businesses such as simulation are seeds of future growth.","Now let's get into our business model evolution. It's clear that the software industry is changing in terms of the technology platform and the business model. Several years ago we made the decision to lead this change by delivering cloud-based distributed applications and services to the design and engineering market.","We've also worked hard to provide our customers with more flexible licensing models. I'm very pleased with what we've accomplished. Our cloud offerings are unmatched in the marketplace, and customer acceptance and feedback has been enthusiastic.","I mentioned last quarter that we would start rolling out more turn-based flexible license offerings to our customers. During the second quarter, we offered some of our products on a rental basis. With the introduction of these flexible plans, our customers now have access to high-quality solutions from Autodesk that may have been out of reach in the past due to upfront licensing costs.","The project-based nature of freelance work also means the software may only be needed temporarily for short-term staffing needs, and rental license offerings provide flexibility to pay only when it's needed. This foray of flexible license options is just the beginning. Later this year, you can expect to see more flexible offerings from us. These offerings will be designed to give our customers even more flexibility with how they utilize our products and will provide the company with new ways to address new market opportunities.","The addition of these ratable revenue streams and other business decisions will significantly increase the percentage of our ratable revenue, making for a more predictable business over time. We now believe this model transition will happen faster than previously expected. We're currently working through our plans for this business model's transition. At our investor day event on October 2, we will be better able to provide you with more details around our assumptions for the magnitude and timeline for changes related to this model transition.","In our 30-plus year history, this is not our first business model transition. We called that just 10 years ago, we added subscription maintenance to our revenue stream. That was a big change at the time, and there was no shortage of skeptics. Today, that's $1 billion business and represents over 40% of our revenue. Suffice it is to say that transition was a huge success.","Going forward, we will build on that success. Our customer base, portfolio of design and creation tools in our cloud and mobile offerings is unmatched. We're excited to move forward on this business model transition and give our customers even more flexibility with how they utilize our products. I want to thank our employees and partners who have created this opportunity and are driving these important changes in the industry.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert W Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I'd just like to go back to the business model transition. You called it out obviously here in your remarks, but also called it out in the press release. And you've been talking about changes relative to more flexible licensing. But is it also possible that part of the business model transition could include changes to the cost structure or other operational aspects to the business?","Carl Bass","Steve, the way I'd think about it is mostly in terms of the customer-facing choices, what the offerings are and how they're delivered. As a more marginal part of that, certainly, each one of those involves a difference in margin structure. For the most part, it hasn't been particularly material, and I don't see that as being either the driving force behind it or a big byproduct. The more important things that I think you really should look at is the offerings for customers and how we change them, as well as, as we talked about, the accounting impacts in terms of ratable revenue.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Perfect. And then your education business, the third quarter is the biggest seasonal quarter. You called out that the impact in this recent quarter was 2%, but in the full year will be 2%. But in that peak seasonal quarter, the next quarter, how much might the absence of educational revenue be impacting that period?","Carl Bass","I put it in line with the others. It's, again, marginally higher but not enough to matter. When you look at the buying patterns around the world, it kind of washes out. And so I would think it is 2%.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, on the model change, you mentioned that it was going to occur faster than some people on the outside of the company had anticipated, but is it happening faster than you might have thought, even just a few months ago? Over the course of the summer, the company suggested that this was indeed one of the bigger or biggest things that you need to figure out. But what changed in your thinking in terms of market conditions or anything else that perhaps induced a somewhat faster change? And related to that, you have a pretty complex product line, over 20 suites, for example. Some are more complicated than Adobe's when they began to make their change. So how do you think about the metrics or pricing criteria in terms of handling a fairly complex product line in terms of moving it towards more flexible terms in licensing?","Carl Bass","Yes. Thank you, Jay. By the way, I just have to say one thing. I'm so glad I have a name that's easier to pronounce than yours. That's a little bit of getting mangled every time. So here's what -- and it must have been much harder to fill out in those standardized tests. Here's what I -- here's what we've been thinking about this, is we -- as you know, we've talked about this for a while, and we started looking at some of the rental opportunities. We see those as being important to actually capture parts of the market that currently aren't paying us for the use of this software, people in peak demand situations, freelance work. So we got really interested in that. Then we started looking at our enterprise customers, and we've talked about some of the things with more flexible licensing for our enterprise customers, in which there are, in essence, true-ups at the end of the year based on usage as opposed to negotiations upfront. And we saw an opportunity, and we described at least 1 or 2 of these in detail, how we both increased the amount of money the customers pay and increased their satisfaction with the use of those products, a real win-win. And then we looked at the middle part of our market, the place where we sell suites and subscriptions, the mainstream part of our business through the majority of our channel partners. And we saw opportunities to deliver things more easily, more flexibly. And all those contributed to say we saw a way to move the business more quickly. One of the things that happened to us along the way is recognizing the difficulty of both running, but forecasting and communicating a mixed model business. And we really began to appreciate that many of the dynamics about this financial model were going to be at odds with each other. And so for everything that we're well on one who's going to take away from the other, and it was going to be difficult internally to win that way just provide the right incentives and stuff, as well as communicate it externally so people understood what was going on with the business. The other thing that happened is we've been running these probes or science experiments, and the results of what we've done have been very positive. The next thing -- the next part, I would say, because you brought up Adobe, we're in, with respect to the complexity of the product portfolio, the other thing that we saw is Adobe introduced a business model transition without much of a technology transition, but really just changed the way that people pay for it and do it rather successfully. And it became more clear to us that the customers were willing to accept, and some even wanted this new opportunity. Because we're starting in a different place than Adobe, we don't feel the need to force people to agree to go to these new license models in perpetual licenses. And so we saw just a really good opportunity to a way that was economically beneficial for us and a benefit for the customers. As regards to the portfolio complexity, I mean, while we have 20 or so suites, if you look, it's really 7 categories by 3 offerings in each of these. The price points are very similar and have been -- because it's a relatively recent offering, they've been rationalized and harmonized over time. And we -- I think we were going to be able to introduce pricing that makes a lot of sense and we can deal with it consistently across those products. When we get to the first week in October, we get together, we'll detail a lot more of this for you. But we, obviously in order to go out with this kind of message, we've been thinking a lot about it and have done extensive planning. And we think it makes sense.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Just a quick follow-up. Is it too soon to start talking about how indirect and direct -- but particularly indirect, works through this transition in light of the comp changes you made 1.5 years ago on -- aside from the fact you get 85% of your revenue from the channel.","Carl Bass","Yes. I see our channel partners, both the value-added resellers and the volume resellers can play -- continuing to play an important role. It's gotten interesting since I referenced it in my remarks about the business model change we went through about 10 years ago. Just to remind everyone, not only were people skeptical, many people read that to be something of the death of the channel or us stealing business from the channel. I mean, there were lots of conspiracy theories running around at the time. I continue to see partners playing an important role as we go forward. We're not anticipating a big change in the mix between channels. And I think partners will continue to play the same role they did -- they have. Our business, while in many ways, similar to Adobe, I think when it comes to channel mix, has always been somewhat different, particularly if you look a little bit under the covers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Carl, just wanted to touch base with you on you've mentioned moving the subscription maybe faster than some other people thought. I'm just wondering, as you move to the cloud, is there anything you could share with us in terms of kind of entry years, what do you think the mix of the business might be, what percentage of revenue you could be getting from that? And then the second part of the question is I know you're going to give us more detail on how you plan to roll this out in early October, but is this something where we might see you do it product line by product line instead of doing that big forced shift like auto plus [ph] , like Adobe just did?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I'll reiterate, we will give you more details in October. But if you look out a handful of years, I can easily imagine the vast majority of our revenue coming from ratable revenue streams just to try to draw an envelope around all of them, the vast majority, it's easy to imagine, and we'll detail how that will happen. As for our product lines or some of the other ways that we might do it by geo, I think it's unlikely; the cost and complexity in doing this one by one is really probably too difficult for us. And like I said, both internally to manage and externally to communicate. I think not only it'll be very confusing, certainly for the financial community, but also for our customers. Many of our customers, particularly the largest ones, buy products across our product lines. And so I think we need to be more consistent for that for all kinds of reasons. The changes we're contemplating and the plans we have in place enable us to do this across the product line.","Heather Bellini - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I just have one follow-up, if you don't mind. In regards to your guidance and knowing that you have a headwind related to the educational transition you're making, can you walk us through kind of the end market, why you're seeing seasonality be maybe a little bit worse than what people were expecting at the environment? From what we're hearing from other people, it seems to have stabilized and isn't necessarily getting worse. I mean, you're actually getting improving data points, macro data points, in places like the U.S. and EMEA in particular for the first time in a while. I'm just wondering kind of how you contrast that with the seasonality that you're looking for.","Carl Bass","Yes, no, good question. I tried to refer to that in my remarks. I said we are certainly seeing the same macroeconomic data that is definitely pointing to an improvement in many parts of the world, particularly in the building industry worldwide. We started -- we hinted at that last quarter, we saw more of it this quarter and we're actually really pleased with what we're seeing. We've also seen and we're taking a little caution from those some of the peer companies, particularly the technology industry, as well as some of our customers who have been a little bit more modest in their forecasts going forward. When there's an appearance of at least portions, if not a large part of the technology industry, being laggards coming in this recovery. So we're being a little bit cautious right now. We also understand there is the education thing we talked about. Currency has been a little bit of a headwind. And we're also anticipating that we might have a slight -- a relatively modest, but still I won't quantify it at this point, kind of slowdown as a result of announcing business model changes. People may pause a little bit. So what we're doing overall, we're just being a little bit more cautious about what's out there. But like I said, there are lots of signs [ph] that we saw were [ph] improving. Still, we saw lots of stuff we like in the construction industry, individual markets like our PLM markets, simulation markets, I feel good about. Question mark that remains for us is more the emerging economies and our run rate business.","Mark J. Hawkins","And I would just say, Heather, to build on Carl's point, it's when the economic data starts to translate into good news in the marketplace, when we definitely have seen this lag and I know you've seen it as well. It's been pretty consistent.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, I was wondering how the direct sales effort went this past quarter? I know last quarter, that was a disappointment. Did you see some improvement there, and any kind of change in deal sizes? I know that's typically where you see your larger deals.","Carl Bass","Yes, yes, we saw lots of improvement this quarter. I was very pleased with our major account. Q2 isn't a big major account thing, but compared to historicals, compared to the previous quarter, I actually felt very good about it. The 2 things that we saw and despite what others some on the phone have written about, what we saw this quarter was we saw generally good major account activity, good business through our value-added resellers and the softness was in isolated portions of the world and through some of the volume channels.","Mark J. Hawkins","I would also -- you'd asked for big deals in particular, Brendan. They are on a similar pace. We're not going to get into specifics, but it was on a similar pace to a year ago, slightly more.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. Mark, you've been consistently talking about this 30% margin goal. Should we put all that stuff on the side now that we're going to see these changes to the model going forward?","Mark J. Hawkins","This -- here's the way I would think about this, Brendan, is that we were -- we are committed to operate margin expansion. I think what's important for you to see is to have the full picture when we get together for the business model discussion, and in that context, that will provide helpful context. But the long-term notion of margin expansion, we're committed to.","Carl Bass","Yes, I would just reinforce Mark's point that from the point of view of profitability and a simplistic notion of revenue and costs, we're totally committed to increasing the profitability. As you look at some of the model changes, there really are accounting differences that will impact how we measure that. That's why we want to just try to provide the full context. As you imagine, if, for example, a particular revenue stream today is recognized upfront and moves to more ratable, it's going to affect the numbers but we will -- we believe and what we're asserting is it's better for the business. So you just have to get the complete context to get the numbers right. But our commitment to improving profitability has not changed.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, Carl, we talked about Adobe earlier. And one of the things that helped them with this transition was they tested it for a couple of years over on Australia. Would you look at just doing their own? Is that like in a specific geography as a way to test it or would that really not make much difference for you guys given the diversity of the products?","Carl Bass","I think it's -- I think the testing is an interesting idea, but if you look at the Adobe case specifically, they tested Australia, and I think that's good for making sure the mechanics of your business function well. As you can tell, they obviously engage end user demand as well as they would've liked to because they had to put in a pretty radical policy change in wanting to drive more adoption. So I think these kind of limited geographical tests at limited value, most of the things we've talked about, we've tried in one way or another. Certainly, what we're talking about in the enterprise space, we have been piloting it. And when you look at some of the things that we're talking about in the more run rate parts of our business, we -- like the rentals, we're also gaining the experience. So I feel pretty confident about what we're going to do there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Philip Winslow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First, in terms of just your October quarter guidance, I mean, how much are you baking in for just some of those headwinds you talked about from actual business fundamentals versus any of the accelerated change in the business model? Then also, Carl, just back to the business fundamentals. If that's sort of the primary reason, which does sound like for the guide down, which of the areas are you sort of most enthusiastic about when you look into the second half and which are the ones that are creating some of the caution?","Carl Bass","Sure. What I would really answer, and Mark can provide some color, I mean like you pointed out, the education is still going to be a drag. I'm still worrying about FX. It looks like it's changing right now, but then we just have to see how that plays out. When I look at our markets, I feel very good about the AEC market. That just continues to get stronger and that's really fairly broad-based, the only exceptions there are a couple of weak geographies, Southern Europe and some of the emerging economies. But generally about our main businesses, I feel pretty good. I'd like to see an improvement in our run rate businesses in order to feel fully enthusiastic. At this point, I think we have a question mark rather than a big deficit being created by the uncertainty of the business model change. The way we're rolling this out is rather than being a forced migration, this will be a choice for our customers. And we'll give you more details in October about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Suites continue to do very well. I believe, Carl, you mentioned they were 34% of revenue this quarter. Can you remind us again on the ASP uplift there and maybe how penetrated the actual installed base is?","Carl Bass","Good questions. I think that's a perfect one for Mark to answer.","Mark J. Hawkins","So the ASPs, I think we had talked about, Matt, before being on track for 20% uplift in the ASP in total. We've been tracking at or above that from an ASP standpoint for suites, so that's actually materialized. We're actually thrilled with the way suites have been going. The response from the customer has been very positive. So the ASP in particular, very much on track.","Carl Bass","Yes, the one other thing we saw that was a positive sign this time and I try to call out in the remarks is that the AutoCAD Design Suites, which we had said from the very beginning was the only part of the suite strategy that had been below our expectations, actually did relatively well. As I'm always willing to point out, one quarter doesn't make a trend. But where will we see -- we've seen some steady improvement in -- and I think it's sustainable, and I really like to see that because that really completes the picture around our suites.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg S. Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Carl, just getting back to the AutoCAD Design Suite and the strength that you called out. If I'm not mistaken, the pricing for that recently came down by, I think about 20% to 25%. And I was just wondering if the elasticity of demand was such that you saw a meaningful net revenue increase versus the prior quarter and also if you're considering doing anything similar with regard to some of the pricing on the other suites as well.","Carl Bass","Yes. So one of the things I would just say in general, let me just frame this question just in terms of pricing in elasticity. The place where we see the greatest elasticity is in our products that are AutoCAD LT or verticals that are built on AutoCAD. The least is with the other suites. So I don't imagine anything different. You may see one-off promotions or regional promotions, but our ASPs on suites have been holding pretty steady. I imagine that continuing through the end of the year. The place where we always get the biggest response to this kind of stimulus is in things related to AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, including those AutoCAD Design Suites. So I think you'll see us continue to turn the knobs and dials there. But I think the rest with pricing for the rest of the portfolio will remain notably stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Not to beat this transition horse dead here, but we did want to try to get to the bottom of this because you do have about 70% of your customers, by our estimate, I think the last time you disclosed, it's about 55%, which was 18 months ago on an annuity buying program already, which is effectively lower ongoing cost, sort of, an annuity type almost rental model. And I'm wondering, are we talking about the other 30% here and trying to move them to a new model? Or are we talking about taking that base that's already transitioned to, with you as you've alluded to over 10 years of moving them to a new economic model?","Carl Bass","Go ahead, Mark.","Mark J. Hawkins","Okay, so I think from a -- Walter, certainly, you got a lot of the math right. If you think about our subscription business today, we have 40% roughly, of our revenue comes in on a ratable basis already. I think as Carl talked about, some of the things that we've announced and are already in the marketplace will increase that ratability. We've talked about that percent going up over time. You can imagine rentals, and in fact, we're acquiring new customers. That, in fact, adding to that percent of recurring revenue. You can imagine us covering new platforms with the cloud, and that's all additive and that's going to be ratable revenue so you can imagine that going up. And then there's other decisions and stuff that we're not going to get into today, but we really look forward to having a discussion with you on October 2 about other things that we're going to do that are going to continue to step up. Carl talked about the enterprise where we have some ways to make our customers even happier and flexibility and to enhance our competitive position with great products, to be even more flexible with them but also to be able to generate more money. And so stay tuned. These are some of the things that are, altogether, going to add to ratability and then other decisions that we'll talk about later. Carl?","Carl Bass","No, I think that covers it.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. And then just maybe one follow-up for you, one related question here on the macro side. I mean you have -- I guess we've seen -- we've become accustomed to when the macro is reasonably healthy, Autodesk was showing high single-digit, maybe low double-digit growth. And when the macro was tough, you would see 20%, 30% declines. And we just haven't seen the period before where the company has been sort of flat. It's either been pretty good or tough. And I'm wondering, it does seem like the macro is better, it does seem like you're positioning the markets or at least reasonably good. And the question we're getting from clients is just why the disconnect between what appears to be an improving macro over where things were a year ago and still the flattish to even down revenue that you're reporting?","Carl Bass","Yes, think that's a great question. What I'd say right now is give us a quarter or 2 and we'll have better answers about what's going on. I think like I said, for a while, it had been different. Last year, we talked about some things that internally created problems. Up until last quarter, we really haven't seen the improving macro turn into more business in our largest segment, which is AEC. Manufacturing was kind of a hold and serve. For the first time, we're really starting to see that. Many of the metrics we track internally in our AEC industry for the first time started to hit double digits again. Let's wait 90 more days and we'll have the conversation about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I'm going to fully beat this dead horse here. Just to be clear, in not having a full year guide anymore, is that in relation to the business model changes, or is [ph] that just basically we've got to wait until October 2 to hear what is going to be going on and because there's going to be impact from that business model change on FY '14?","Carl Bass","Yes.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it.","Carl Bass","What I can say here is that the answer is yes.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","That works. I like definitive answers. And then in terms of in the current quarter, the one number that ticked down pretty significantly was this deferred revenue balance. You called out in the prepared remarks some of it due to long-term contracts. You also saw the short-term deferred revenue line down sequentially which is a little bit surprising, given more stuff that's going ratable. Can you help walk us through kind of what's going on there and how we should think about the deferred revenue billings metrics?","Mark J. Hawkins","Keith, glad to do so. First of all, as I think everyone knows, the deferred revenue, what's interesting about it is it's a little imbalanced. So it's a little different than a lot of indicators, it's a growing balance sheet going forward. It's actually up year-on-year, 7%. But it is down as exactly as you described, it's down 5% quarter-on-quarter. Now there's really, I would say, 2 things that are going on. If you dissect the deferred revenue, there's subs related to subscription and then there's licenses. And the license and other portion of it is exactly identical in terms of the sequential pattern that we had last year. The difference that's caused a little bit of downtick quarter-on-quarter has to do with subs, and there's one single reason for it. It has to do within Q1, we increased the price per sub renewal. And what that does is it creates, and has a modest increase as part of a broader plan that we've done, what it does is it has a little bit of a compelling event that pulls things in. And so on a sequential basis, you see a little bit of movement there. But it's really -- I think on a normalized basis, it's proceeding exactly as we would expect. It just so happens that Q1 price increase, full renewals in particular, created a little bit of that sequential dynamic. But exactly as we would have expected.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Is there any impact from the educational pricing change in there in that there's people who had -- I mean, I'm assuming there were some educational subscriptions if I'm not mistaken. Do those start to go away as you move from licensing to grants?","Mark J. Hawkins","I think that's pretty minor. The education side is not a big dynamic in this.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could squeeze one last one...","Mark J. Hawkins","By the way, some education [indiscernible] subscription, by the way.","Carl Bass","Yes, there is a bunch on subscription but...","Mark J. Hawkins","And some that aren't.","Carl Bass","Haven't quantified the exact amounts.","Mark J. Hawkins","Exactly.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Got it. And then if I could squeeze one last one on operating expenses. I believe this quarter, you were able to squeeze some further efficiencies out of the model versus what was in the guide from the kind of implied OpEx guidance, and OpEx was down sequentially again. From the 3Q guide, it seems like that's not implied in the guidance on a going-forward basis in terms of taking any further expenses out of the equation. How should we think about the flexibility or the leverage you have to pull further expense out of the business on a go-forward basis? Or should we think of this more as the baseline on a going-forward basis and mostly you'll be building up [ph] from here?","Carl Bass","I mean, I would think of this as the baseline, to give you the simplest answer, to add a little bit more nuance to it. We've demonstrated repeatedly that we were forced to take expense out. We certainly have the capability of doing that. Philosophically, we're on that right now. As we're interested in driving the technology change to the cloud and mobile devices and the business model changed. And I'd like to do that within a relatively tight envelope, so I'm not willing to do that at all costs. We've tried to be pretty cautious all through the year. It feels like we've had one foot or half a foot on the break the whole time, but I feel like we're accomplishing the things that we need to accomplish. And I'd hate to break that dynamic. I'd like to continue to move forward. I think the changes we're making and the products we're bringing to market put us in a leading position, and we want to make sure that we can capitalize on that. On the other hand, we don't want expenses to get out of whack.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I mean you talked about AutoCAD and LT kind of being saturated, where I kind of think as an area where you have a chance to kind of accelerate and grow I think kind of your efforts in simulation. So maybe if you have a second or 2 just to talk about kind of your opportunities and penetration so far, both on the disruptive pricing basis and even some of your cloud efforts on FEA and computational fluid dynamics kind of where that is now where you think it could be over the next quarter or 2, I guess even years.","Carl Bass","Yes. What I see right now is I think there are 2 areas in that realm, Richard, that make sense to see growth in because of the different approach we're taking both from the business model as well as the technology. One is simulation, one is PLM. Talked to you a lot about PLM. Just to give you a little bit of color, getting just a great response to PLM. There are days I wish we were only a PLM company because like in today's environment, we'd be worth billions of dollars for just our efforts in PLM. Our PLM business is doing well, it's being really well received. Most of our challenge in that part of the business is getting enough salespeople, enough consultants in place, having enough people to support our partners with the PLM business because it really is meeting the need of PLM customers and it offers all the attractiveness of what you see in many of the other cloud-based companies, Salesforce and NetSuite or Workday. So we really feel good about that. Simulation, we're having -- we have more of a mixed business there, both a desktop business as well as a cloud-based business. Really happy with the response to the cloud-based business. Desktop business is marching along. We obviously are really bullish about it. You saw the investment that we made in Composite Analysis. We think this is important in terms of material science and where our customers are going for designing their next generation of products. Across the board, I'd say the most successful product we have in simulation right now are our CFD products. I think our FEA is comparable. But there was -- the market for FEA, as you well know, is not the fastest growing part of the market. But our computational fluid dynamics are doing well, and I'm really pleased with people's willingness to adopt a new way of working. One of the things about the cloud is it just makes so much sense for simulation. And the response is good, and I just looked -- just before the call started, I was just looking and even this quarter and there were a bunch of product lines where I was seeing double-digit growth in simulation. So really, really pleased with what we're seeing there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you review for us, at this point, what products are actually on a rental pricing or in a cloud option that are available to customers?","Mark J. Hawkins","So there's a couple that are out there. You have the -- for example, the Inventor LT Suite and rental, you'd have the Revit LT Suite on rental. Those would be a couple examples.","Carl Bass","Yes.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And you had mentioned, I think on the last call, about looking at media and entertainment as an area to trial that as well. Did that happen?","Mark J. Hawkins","We did do some trials and 90-day offerings and things of that nature. So yes...","Carl Bass","And we're continuing with our rentals there. As regards to our rentals, we're just adding to it. That was one of the ones as opposed to pulling the switch all at once. We've been entering the market on a rolling basis and we're going to continue to do that. We think all of our products should be offered on rental basis, and so I can't say without exception. But in my mind, I don't see any products that won't be offered that way going forward.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","When you look at the model transition, especially from the thing that you're going to put on a cloud platform, how much of that investment in infrastructure is already done and what should we expect to happen in terms of additional investment?","Mark J. Hawkins","A couple of things here. One is that right now, we have been investing in building out a combination of some data centers, which is as one would expect, and that's in place. You can see that our CapEx has not hugely stepped up. It's still kind of in the envelope of around 3% of revenue. The other thing that I would say is that we also have first capacity that we use third parties that can help us with that, and that is also evident in some of the -- when people use that and we need that first capacity. So some of that is happening. There are other infrastructure and what I would say back office things that are underway and that are either -- have been constructed or to be constructed. So Sterling, it's kind of -- some of it's done and some of it's to go.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And last question, you mentioned AutoCAD LT as an area where the end market is suffering. I apologize if you answered it, but I wasn't clear, what is it in terms of what end markets or what geos are suffering around the AutoCAD LT business?","Carl Bass","I mean, we saw pretty consistently, none of the trends around LTE were particularly good this quarter. And what we've seen in the past is that because this is a product that responds to the demand generation activities, as well as promotional activities, we just need to increase what we're doing there. So the plans are already in place and being carried out. But there's nothing in that part of the business that I really want to celebrate this quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Many of mine have been answered, but maybe one for you, Mark. So just going back to the subscription deferred balance, and there's a lot of puts and takes on that in the quarter. You mentioned it's a pull forward in Q1. I think there's also FX impact. Could you just maybe take a step back and describe how, let's say, in the first half, subscription billings grew either relative to plan or if you have absolute numbers on an adjusted basis? That would be really helpful.","Mark J. Hawkins","You're looking at billings or are you looking at revenue?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Billings.","Mark J. Hawkins","So I think we talked about for the quarter the dynamics that are going on there. And so when we come down to the maintenance billings, we basically had a decline of about 20% and that would have been on a -- if you look at it from a year-on-year basis. And if you normalize again for the multiyear, keep in mind, Q2 of '13, you can go back and look at it, we drove the price change for the multiyear subscription. And for everybody that doesn't recall, it went -- there was a 3-year price, a 2-year price. We took the discounts for 3-year and 2-year and cut them in half. That created quite a compelling event. And if you normalize that, basically on a maintenance basis, we're basically -- we're in a good mode from that standpoint. That's just one of the attributes that I talked about from a normalization standpoint. So that would be on the maintenance billings.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So it's growing? It's growing, adjusting for the multiyear, foreign exchange and the Q1-to-Q2 kind of sequential impact? You would say that in aggregate, the subscription billings are growing year-over-year?","Mark J. Hawkins","In fact, it is. And the thing that I didn't even try to normalize for is don't forget, we talked about in Q4, we changed the price of upgrades. And that had an effect of pulling revenue in. We talked about that, of the $24 million that we strongly advertised and dialogued about. And that also has an impact on sub billings on a year-on-year basis. So actually, not even normalizing for that last point, I think we're just fine if you normalize for what's going on there on a maintenance basis.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. I guess I'm just trying to understand if the subscription billings, once you normalize all the items, is -- are tracking to your expectation or if there's anything that's materially different from your expectation. It sounds like it's tracking to your expectation.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, I think on the maintenance basis, it really is, if you normalize it, it's pretty clean.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then maybe just on the implied operating expense for the current quarter, fiscal Q3, at least in my math, it would look like it would be up a little bit sequentially. Are there any operating expenses -- I know the increase around the business model change, so marketing spend, ramping or any other one-time spend around some of the changes that are coming?","Carl Bass","So generally, the answer is no. To put a finer point on it, there has -- we've continued over the last year to 2 years, make increasing investments in delivering cloud-based products and moving expenses away from some of the more traditional activities. We've generally kept it out of your eyesight, but that continues to go on to a small degree. And we -- but there was nothing major that's going to change about that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, last quarter, you mentioned the transition at Adobe went through and that Autodesk wouldn't hit the approach trajectory at the same rate that Adobe did. I guess investors are concerned that maybe even this proposed plan would be a hybrid, which would include a lot of perpetual and subscription, therefore continuing this on choppy top line and bottom line approach. And I'm just curious if you could comment on your thoughts on that and is this a wholesale switch where perpetual goes away or is perpetual part of your model going forward?","Carl Bass","Brent, I think you have to look at 2 different parts. We'll try to give you much more clarity when we get to October. But I think you have to -- I mean, there are really 2 issues that are going on here. One is about flexible licensing, termed offerings, the way we go to market and how we deliver customers, deliver products to customers including web services, and all of that's increasing. The other one is more on the accounting side is really the ratability of that. So I think you see 2 different things going on. And we'll be able to give you a little bit more detail when we outline the plans for what we're doing. And I think [indiscernible] -- I think it will make a lot more sense. In some ways, I think all the comparisons to Adobe are fine. Adobe's a great company, I like the comparisons. But at certain points, when we diverge, we're starting with a point where we have 40% recovering revenue. We have a different product mix. We have a different customer base. And so given where our starting point is and the number of enterprise customers, I think we really have to lay out the different buckets for you and how they move -- how the offerings progress over time, as well as how we will account for those, and therefore, what the impact is to the more traditional metrics like revenue and operating margin, as well as I think it's incumbent upon us to start defining some new metrics that will give you more insight into how our business is going.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the decision to revoke guidance for the year is more based on the new transition rather than any deterioration of your pipeline or ability to forecast?","Carl Bass","Yes. I mean, the business is the business we've described and we described it quarter after quarter. I mean, just hypothetically, if we made a change in which we took a portion of revenue and because of the way we offer it to customers, we had to account for it ratably. If I -- if we would have to describe the revenue impact of that today without the context of what's going on, the tone in this conversation, I'm sure, would be completely different. Does that make sense? I'm not trying to be cryptic, but if we had to go from recognized upfront revenue to ratable revenue, it will have a significant impact on whatever quarter we introduce these policy changes. And if you didn't have a context to interpret it, it would make little sense to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with Wedbush Securities.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Maybe one easy one and one a little more enveloped question. The easy one is how did linearity go on your licenses in July compared to the, say, the first 2 months of the quarter?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, the linearity was actually just fine. In fact, it was slightly -- our total -- let me just speak to it, Steven, in a broader way. Our billing and revenue linearity was just fine and slightly more linear than it was a year ago, let's put it that way, for both billings and revenue in total.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. Just -- then I want to ask, do you expect the improvement in some of the manufacturing macro steps to help the manufacturing business? And then I do want to -- I want to ask a question as well, if I may, about your comments on the last call. You talked about -- I don't remember the exact words, but the idea was having some tactical revenue drivers in the back half of the year and how that would help you achieve some -- the guidance that was -- looked fairly back end loaded. I understand there's a model transition going on, but I'm wondering, are those sort of tactical revenue drivers still present?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, we're doing -- the things that we talked about to drive revenue are still in place. Most of the stuff you'll hear is incremental, it's about new kinds of offerings, it's about adding this flexibility. But all the things that we -- that were in place and that we talked about on the last call are actually -- almost all of them are in motion now. Some of the price promotions, some of the pricing changes, some of the stuff that we did within the sales organization, all of that, all in flight right now.","Mark J. Hawkins","Marketing-led initiatives for demand gen.","Carl Bass","Demand gen, many around some of the products. So yes, the 2 things are kind of independent with each other.","Steven R. Koenig - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just that other question, the improvement in the manufacturing. Any indicators that you've been seeing in the last few months, can that help you guys or -- I want to find out.","Carl Bass","Look. I always like it when PMI goes up. I always like it when the ABI goes up. I like even more with the GDP goes up. That's what we've seen. We've repeatedly said that good GDP numbers seem to be more correlated to our business than any individual one. But every time one [ph] of the particular industry does better, even though it's only good -- it's only going to be good for us. It's a combination when we do our forecasting. So for example, we try to give some hints last quarter, we saw an improving environment in the construction industry. We wouldn't want to stick our necks out very far about it, but it started to materialize. I'm hopeful that that's going to continue into the second half of the year and next year. I hope the same thing happens in manufacturing. Even this quarter, we did see some really good business in our Manufacturing suites. And the one thing that I also called out is really some really good work, in particular, segments where we focus like automotive. Historically, that hasn't been a strong suit for us, and we continue to do better and better in that industry. And so I'm really pleased with the progress we make in there.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the allotted time for questions. I'd like to turn it back over to management for closing remarks.","David Gennarelli","That concludes our call today. As I mentioned, we have our Investor Day in October 2.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","It is now my pleasure to hand the conference over to Mr. Dave Gennarelli, Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Dave Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal year 2018. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, our CEO; and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the Company such as our guidance for the first quarter and full-year fiscal 2019, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance including assumptions regarding ASC 606, and tax reform, our maintenance to subscription transition, our customer value, cost structure, and market opportunities and strategies, and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Dave.","Q4 was another milestone quarter for our subscription transition. Key to the quarter was the strong growth in both ARR and ARPS even as subscription additions fell below expectations. We finished the year with better than expected performance on many of the traditional financial metrics, such as revenue, deferred revenue, EPS and cash flow, all of which are becoming more relevant again as we pass the inflection point on our business model transition. Overall, these results bolster our belief in our ability to achieve our fiscal \u201820 goals around ARR and free cash flow.","There are several key outcomes of Q4 that I want to highlight. Total annualized recurring revenue or ARR grew 25% in subscription plan ARR more than doubled again. Both ARR and subscriptions for subscription plan are now greater than the ARR and subscription base for maintenance, which is a significant milestone and in line with our projections when we began the transition. Annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS inflected up in Q4, also in line with our projections. Recurring revenue has increased to 93% of total revenue, and we continue to the see faster than expected migration of maintenance customers and subscription with the maintenance-to-subscription program for M2S. Beyond that, we remain enthusiastic about our long-term market expansion initiatives in both manufacturing and construction, as we continue to introduce new technology that brings design and make closer and together, and drives the convergence of manufacturing and construction.","Now, I know you want to hear what\u2019s going on with sub adds, and I will get to that. But, let\u2019s first start by talking about ARR. The continued positive trends we\u2019re seeing in ARR are clear signals that the transition is working. I\u2019ll stress once again that ARR is the most important metric when evaluating the health of the business at this stage of the transition. The strength in total ARR was broad-based with all three major geographies growing ARR at 20% or more. Subscription plan ARR more than doubled, driven by growth in all subscription plan types but led by product subscription. We continue to drive tremendous growth in product subscription ARR on both the year-over-year and sequential basis.","Now, let\u2019s talk about subscription additions. To provide you more insight into the subscription dynamics, we need to break out core and cloud subscriptions. To be more explicit, the core business represents the combination of maintenance, product subscription and EBA subscriptions, while the cloud business represents all the results generated by standalone cloud offerings. When you break these two views out, our core business which drives the overwhelming majority of our revenue, ARR and billings growth is performing quite well.","Our cloud business performed up to our reset expectations for the quarter. We added 45,000 cloud subscriptions in Q4 which represented nearly 50% decrease against the tough compare to Q4 last year, when we ran a seeding program for a competent of BIM 360. However, from a billings perspective, cloud had biggest quarter ever, fueled by several large wins, including six week top ranked construction companies. We see continued momentum in terms of customers moving to higher value products, BIM 360 Docs and Field.","We remain very enthusiastic about the opportunity with our cloud products but keep in mind that the cloud is still a small contributor to our overall business. ARR for standalone cloud grew 23% in Q4 but contributed less than a $100 million of our total $2.05 billion in ARR. So, while cloud will not be a major driver of our FY20 performance, we remain confident, it will be a major component of our business in the years beyond FY20.","This brings us to the question, why did the net sub additions fall short for the quarter? The answer is that we experienced greater than expected subscription consolidation as customers are reducing their total subscriptions in favor of collections. We\u2019re seeing this reflected in the general adoption of collections with a mix of collections within the product subscription base more than doubled year-over-year, and now represents over 20% of the product subscription base. The good news is that most of these customers are increasing their total spend with Autodesk, contributing to solid increases in ARPS and ARR. So, our core strategy of driving upsell to industry collections is working better than we anticipated. We\u2019re also seeing the impact of collections up selling with both regular renewals and with customers participating in the M2S program. And the upsell effect related to M2S is happening across all geographies.","To give you an idea of how this works, I\u2019ll give you a real example of the Canadian engineering firm and their M2S transaction from Q4. They had 42 maintenance subscriptions up for renewals, 20 AutoCADs, 21 Navisworks and one Premium Suite. They migrated to 19 subscriptions of the AEC collection and one AutoCAD subscription, a net reduction of over half their seats. However, the account value for this customer increased by over 10%. This happens enough times and you get a depressive impact on our net sub adds, as a result of collections upsell, but a pronounced increase in overall ARR. So, that should help you understand what\u2019s happening. This is a positive outcome for ARR and ARPS, but it negatively impacts our net sub adds. Beyond that, we believe this issue will work itself out over the course of the year as most of our largest customers complete their maintenance to subscription migration.","Despite the impact from collections upsell, sub adds in our core business increased 14% year-over-year and accelerated from the prior three quarters, led by a record number of product subscription additions. Even when normalizing for M2S, the base of product subscriptions nearly doubled year-over-year, and EBA sub additions increased over 30% fueled by the strong Q3 EBA deal activity. The core business drove more than $1.9 billion of our total ARR in Q4, and grew more than 25%.","Another consistent attribute of the transition is that new customers continue to make up a meaningful portion of product subscription additions and represented close to 30% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth in emerging markets, converting unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternative design tool. We will go into much greater sub results and modeling details at our Investor Day in a few weeks. But there wasn\u2019t anything in these numbers that alters our conviction in our ability to drive ARR and cash flow.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott for a few more details on the M2S program, ARPS, and other financials. Scott?","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew.","Subscription plan subs grew by a record 371,000 during Q4 with growth in net subscriptions coming in all three categories, cloud, enterprise and product subscriptions. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plan subs, primarily related to the M2S program. M2S program continues to progress faster than expected, especially in the Americas. In Q4, customers migrated a 168,000 maintenance subs to product subs. Similar to last quarter, approximately one-third of our maintenance renewal opportunities during Q4 migrated to product subscription. Those [ph] who migrated over a third of eligible subscriptions, upgraded from an individual product to an industry collection, which is the highest upgrade rate we\u2019ve seen yet and relates to the collections upsell effect that Andrew just spoke about.","The renewal rate for maintenance customers held steady in Q4. However, remember that Q4 has the biggest pool of maintenance plan renewal opportunities, and consequently the decline in maintenance subs is always greatest in Q4. We\u2019re very pleased with the M2S program to-date and we\u2019ll continue to encourage maintenance customers to move sooner rather than later.","We expect fiscal \u201819 to be the biggest year for M2S migrations. It makes more economic sense for our customers as the cost of staying on maintenance will be higher than the cost to migrate. And product subscription provides them the greatest value with increased flexibility, support and access to our five products.","Now, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about annualized revenue per subscription or ARPS. This is the anticipated quarter where we saw ARPS inflect up for all the reasons we\u2019ve been calling out including improvements to the product mix and the geo mix and the base of our product subs, the price increase for the M2S program, less discounting and promotional activity and selling more direct to our customers through our e-store. Collections upsell is having a positive impact on ARPS.","Our total ARPS grew 5% year over year and 4% sequentially. Breaking it down, maintenance plan ARPS continues to grow as expected, driven by mix and the annual price increases we rolled out as part of the M2S program. Product subscription plan ARPS showed a 6% sequential growth. If we exclude the effect of M2S, the product subscription ARPS grew 8% sequentially, had its fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth and grew 20% year on year. That meaningful growth in ARPS was the largest component of our core business Further if we isolate on our core business which again is maintenance plus product subs plus EBA subs, core ARPS grew 10% year on year and 5% sequentially. These are the ARPS trends we\u2019ve been predicting since the start of the transition, and I know have been a source of question for many of you.","Looking at our business mix. Once again, total direct was 30% of the Q4 mix. One of the key investment areas for Autodesk has been our digital infrastructure with the goal of making it easier for our customers who choose to do business directly with Autodesk. Our e-store is a big part of that and we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019ve already grown that channel to nearly a $100 million in fiscal 2018 revenue. In addition, our e-store generated approximately 20% of the product sub sales in Q4 and close to 50% of LT subs in the Americas came through the e-store in Q4. That\u2019s tremendous progress in the short amount of time, and we expect to see this continue to grow.","The biggest component of our direct mix is still the business we do with large enterprise customers. Q4 is always our biggest quarter for large deal activity and we signed a record number of $1-million-plus deals in Q4, over 70 of them, including 14 contracts valued at $5 million or more. Most of these large deals were EBAs. And on average the contract value for EBA renewals increased over 40% compared to the original EBA contract value.","For those of you who might not be as familiar with the history of Autodesk, these large deals stats are quite remarkable, even compared to just 5 or 10 years ago. For our product innovation and forward thinking, Autodesk has evolved to become a trusted partner and thought leader with our customers. Many are now coming to us, seeking our guidance on how to prepare for the confluence of design and make, which is already happening in certain industries.","Moving to spend management. We continued to be able to execute well while keeping spend flat on a constant currency basis for both Q4 and fiscal 2018. The restructuring action we initiated last quarter is allowing us to reallocate our spend to increase investment in areas that drive long-term value while reducing spend and making targeted divestments in other areas. We also remained committed to keeping fiscal 2019 non-GAAP spend flat at a constant currency relative to our fiscal 2018 budget at about $2.2 billion.","Looking at the balance sheet, reported deferred revenue grew 9%. At the same time, unbilled deferred revenue increased by $178 million sequentially, bringing total unbilled deferred revenue to $326 million, as a reminder, this completes the first full-year of moving our enterprise customers to annual billing terms. If we consider total deferred revenue as reported deferred plus unbilled deferred which is a fair comparison for last year, deferred revenue grew more than 25%.","Since most of our enterprise customers are on three-year contracts, an entirely new group of enterprise customers will come up for renewal this year and next year. So, the amount of unbilled deferred revenue will continue to grow meaningfully.","Q4 cash flow was stronger than expected, driven by good billings linearity in the quarter. The strength of the Q4 cash flow allowed us to finish the year just in the black, [ph ]which is also better than expected.","When it comes to capital allocation, our stock repurchase program continues to be primary use of cash and we opportunistically accelerated that program in Q4, buying back roughly 2.4 million shares. At our last investor day, I indicated that we would use the majority of the $1.7 billion cash balance we had available at that time for stock repurchases. Since then, we spent over $900 million on share buybacks. In fact over the past few years, we\u2019ve reduced our absolute share count by close to 3% and we remain committed for managing dilution and reducing shares outstanding over time.","Before getting into our outlook, I want to touch on two high profile items that are impacting every company, tax reform and ASC 606. With the start of the new fiscal year, we\u2019ve adopted the new revenue accounting standard, ASC 606 and we will be applying the modified retrospective transition method. The new standard will not result in the change in timing at amount of the recognition of revenue for the majority of our product subscription offerings and enterprise agreements. In fiscal \u201819, the estimated impact will be a net reduction to revenue and EPS of approximately $40 million and $0.15, respectively compared to what would have been recognized under ASC 605 and a reduction of approximately $20 million in ARR.","We will be required to capitalize and amortize sales commissions under the new standard. While we do not expect a significant impact on reported expenses for the full year, the timing of when we recognize the deferred commissions by quarter will vary be compared to historic seasonality. 606 impacts are greatest in Q1 and then dampen as we move through the year and become nominal by fiscal \u201820 and of course none of the 606 impacts to the cash flow.","Regarding the impact from tax reform, saying it complex may be understatement. And clarifications from the IRS seem to come out daily. But we have enough information to provide the following.","All-in-all, U.S tax reform is good for Autodesk whereby the lower U.S tax rate and the ability to access foreign cash in the future will increase our profitability and help us manage capital more efficiently. We will utilize our deferred tax assets to offset the cash costs of the one-time transition tax. We\u2019re still analyzing the full impact of tax reform but we currently estimate our fiscal \u201819 non-GAAP effective tax rate at 19%. For fiscal \u201820 and beyond, we estimate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 17% and 18%.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the discussion to our outlook, and I\u2019ll start by saying that our view of the global economic conditions remains unchanged from the last few quarters with most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in the emerging markets. We\u2019re providing guidance this quarter under both ASC 605 for comparison to our historic financials and 606. I would expect the Street to model us using the 606 numbers.","We recognized as we introduced guidance for fiscal 2019, you will be able to fill in the blanks for several fiscal \u201820 metrics based on our stated fiscal \u201820 goals. As Andrew said at the top of the call, we are confident in our ability to achieve our important goals around ARR and free cash flow.","As we head into the growth phase of the model transition, we\u2019re bringing back annual guidance on billings, defined as reported revenues plus the change in deferred revenues, which should be helpful for modeling our cash flow. I\u2019ll note that while we expect billings to increase by approximately 26% at the midpoint for the full-year, billings growth in Q1 will be much more modest due to a tough compare against strong billings in Q1 last year. Another thing to keep in mind as we model out free cash flow is it there\u2019re couple of one-time impacts to fiscal \u201819 cash flow that total about $130 million. These pertaining to charges for the restructuring and the exit tax from moving our European operations center from Switzerland to Dublin, Ireland. These one-time items together with the strength of our Q4 cash flows will have an impact on the strength of cash flow for Q1, which is likely to be negative.","As we emerge from the inflection in our business model transition, cash flow ramps up quickly through fiscal \u201820. Significant part of the ramp is driven by the increase in billings, primarily from what will be a much larger renewal base of product subs and multi-year subscriptions returning to the historic levels we used to see with maintenance. In addition, in fiscal \u201820, we\u2019ll then have two years worth of unbilled deferred revenue flowing into billings, following our transition to annual billings for enterprise customers.","The underlying positive trends in our business give us confidence in accelerating ARR growth to approximately 30% for fiscal \u201819. This growth will be driven by fewer subscriptions and higher ARPS which reflects the trends we\u2019re seeing with both our cloud products and collections upsell. As such, we\u2019ve revised our outlook for subscription additions for the year.","As Andrew mentioned, our next Investor Day event is just about three weeks from today. We\u2019ll use that opportunity to do another deep dive on the model and provide more details on the recent numbers and the path ahead. We\u2019ll also go into greater on subs and ARPs model that get us to the fiscal \u201820 goals and we\u2019ll revisit our five-year model.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Scott. I\u2019ll reiterate what Scott just said and assure you that we are confident in our ability to accelerate ARR growth to achieve our fiscal \u201820 ARR and free cash flow goals. And we have a realistic plan in place to achieve those goals. Given the changes we\u2019ve seen at the end of this year, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that we\u2019ll be reducing the subs CAGR and increasing the ARPS CAGR, consistent with the move to fewer, higher value subs in both the core business and in our cloud business. The transition is on track and these model adjustments are happening for the right reasons. We\u2019ll go into all the details at our Investor Day on March 28th.","Now, if we look back at the year, we\u2019ve taken significant action to realign our investments and position Autodesk to meet our long-term goals. We are investing in building and expanding the digital infrastructure of the Company, increasing go to market and development spend for the construction opportunity and maintaining development of our core products. I\u2019ll finish by repeating these three strategic priorities that will drive long term success at Autodesk, completing the subscription transition, digitizing the Company, and reimagining manufacturing, construction and production. We have already made significant progress in addressing the tremendous new market opportunity in the construction market and we will continue to pursue that market aggressively.","In addition, some of you may have noticed that we are increasing our efforts in the manufacturing space as we just opened the new advanced manufacturing facility in Birmingham to highlight the work we\u2019re doing to move product design and manufacturing companies to a new hybrid, additive and subtractive future. You\u2019ll see more of that over the next couple of years and you\u2019ll also begin to see the first results of our efforts to re-imagine production.","To wrap things up, I want to thank our customers but especially recognize our employees and partners who\u2019ve worked so hard to make last year a success. We\u2019re excited to be now in the growth stage of the transition to see accelerated growth in ARR and to be another step further along the journey of our transition. We\u2019re confident in our long-term plans and ability to execute while providing our customers with greater ability, more compelling products and a better user experience.","Operator, we now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Philip Winslow","Thanks, guys for taking my question. Obviously, we\u2019ve been focused on ARPS since mid-2015. So, it\u2019s really exciting to see the inflection here in that number in Q4. So, congratulations on that. And my question is on ARPs. Obviously, you said you are going to give us more details in terms of just the framework for the long-term guidance at Analyst Day but wonder if you could talk about sort of \u201819 and \u201820, the puts and takes that you see because there are a lot of things going on. Obviously the price increase is on maintenance, less discounting on the M2S as well as just discounting overall. Just help us kind of frame out the puts and takes here of ARPS, as you think about it to 2020.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So, let me give you a little perspective on what\u2019s driving it. First, kind of let me frame the problem a little bit. One of the things I want to make sure you\u2019re seeing is the same thing that we saw. So, the core is doing incredibly well, sub base grew 14% year-over-year last year. We\u2019re going to see that number continue moving forward, at least at that level, which is line with historical levels. So, the core\u2019s doing really good. And when you look forward, you guys have probably noticed where we are with our guide. Most of that guide is due to our reset expectations in cloud. So, you\u2019re zeroing in on exactly the right thing right now on ARPS. So, what\u2019s driving the ARPs, specifically?","So, what we\u2019re seeing is an acceleration of some of the strategies that we already put in place and we talked about in the past. The first one is being the upsell of the collection. Like I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing an acceleration, more people are -- as they move from M2S are taking us up on the move to collections. More people in the run rate of our core business are moving to collections. You\u2019re going to see those phenomena play out into next year and beyond.","The other thing that\u2019s getting accelerated right now is our price realization efforts. And this comes from basically three components, one, better execution of the e-store, which by the way is very high -- price realization channel, our renewal base changes in terms of the channel costs to renew product subscriptions. We\u2019re making some changes there, we\u2019ve made some changes in the low end margins of our businesses, particularly around LTs. That is accelerating our price utilization and we\u2019re doing much better in terms of managing the promo discounts across the products. All of those things in fact that they are accelerating are going to drive up ARPS as move into next year or beyond.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Saket Kalia","First, maybe for you, Andrew, thanks a bunch for the example on the Canadian engineering firm to kind of show that net add and ARR dynamic. But just to make sure that we understand, the question is, are customers buying for fewer engineers? I guess, why is that a collection is able to handle fewer seats, if presumably seats are good proxy for employees? I guess, I think we all appreciate the ARR lift that you\u2019re getting but talk you through why you think about this -- I guess how you think about this dynamic, when you think about seat share within your customers, if that make sense?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Saket, I\u2019m really glad you asked this question. So, this is the dynamic of subscription versus users, and this is a anomaly of how we\u2019re counting our business. So, what you saw in that example is each user actually had two subscriptions. So, the number of users in this company did not change at all; it\u2019s just so happened that each user had a seat of AutoCAD and a seat of Navisworks Manage seating on their desktop. So, what happened is, is the customers said, well, I can now take this M2S offer, move all of those seats to collection, not only do they get AutoCAD, Navisworks Manage, but they get Revit as well, and that\u2019s what the customer did. So, the number of engineers sitting there exactly the same, the number of subscription sitting on each engineers desktop, one from two. Makes sense?","Saket Kalia","That does. That makes a lot of sense.","Andrew Anagnost","And we\u2019re seeing that broadly.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Maybe for my follow-up, just a little bit of an expansion of Phil\u2019s question. Could, either you or Scott, just maybe talk a little bit about the shape of M2S in fiscal \u201819? I guess, it feels like we saw a nice reaction to some of the pricing strategies here in fiscal \u201818. I believe the next action will build on that. Can you just maybe walk us through, how you\u2019re thinking about the maintenance base by the end of fiscal \u201819? And target back to ARPS, how should we think about the impact that that could have on ARPS?","Scott Herren","Yes. Saket, it\u2019s a great question. We are expecting to see an acceleration of people, maintenance subscribers that as they come up to the point of renewal, seeing them move to product subscription. It\u2019s already moved faster than we expected, as you know in fiscal \u201818, 110,000 migrations in Q3, 168,000 in Q4. Both of those numbers were higher than expected. As we look at next year, the economics change again. And the price to renew goes up 10%, the price to convert only goes up 5%. So, the economics actually swing in favor of conversation even more strongly. And of course, the product subs has higher value to our customers, in terms of access and ease of management. So, I think we will see it accelerate. What we haven\u2019t done is gone into trying to forecast each of the subcomponents to give you a sense of that. But, I think our expectation all along is that fiscal \u201819 was the biggest year for M2S conversions. And I think seeing how quickly it\u2019s already moved in fiscal \u201818, I think we will see that acceleration happen again in fiscal \u201819. In terms the effect or ARPS, I don\u2019t think it has a massive effect either way. The price to convert or the price to renewal is still relatively close, little bit more expensive to renew maintenance, but I don\u2019t think it will have a big -- I don\u2019t think that by itself will have a big effect. What is likely to have a bigger effect is people who at the point of migration from maintenance to subscription, the people that do -- like the example, we used in the opening commentary and actually move up from individual licenses up to the collection.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Sterling Auty","Based on the positive comments that you made around the number of users eligible to move to subscription that did and some of the other elements, is there a read through on churn? So, in other words has churn actually improved over the last couple of quarters?","Andrew Anagnost","So, in fact, Sterling, what we\u2019ve seen is there\u2019s absolutely no change in the churn rate of the maintenance base. So, the maintenance base quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year is holding solidly at the same kind of renewal rates we\u2019ve seen historically. What you just see is more people are deciding to take the maintenance to subscription offer and of those people even more and acceleration over the previous quarter are choosing to go to collections. But the actual renewal rate of that base has remained solidly intact on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year and even trend wise.","Scott Herren","And to your point, Sterling, that an aggregator renewal. We do it on seat counts today. So, what it implies is because you got consolidation going on, the remainder is actually seeing a bit of an uptick in renewal rate, because some of them are dropping off. And like the example we pointed to, are dropping off certain subscribers as they consolidate up to collections. So, I think it\u2019s -- we are very pleased with renewal rates we are seeing in aggregate.","Sterling Auty","And then follow-up on the EBAs, did you measure the subscriptions in arrears? I think that\u2019s an element that can cause the noise within the net subscriber count, if you will. Wonder if you can give us some insight into maybe some previous cohort. So, in EBA from three, four quarters ago, how does that number of subscriptions contribution into the total count fluctuate?","Andrew Anagnost","The biggest impact we see is on the first measurement of MAUs. So, a customer that buys an EBA, in every case has had a largest state of perpetual licenses that are on maintenance, and then convert those perpetual over to an EBA. So, the first effect you see is maintenance subs go down, enterprise subs go up. And then the first thing -- and because anyone in the company now has access to the license, we count MAUs, instead of people have access to it when they move to an EBA. After 90 days of measuring the MAU, that\u2019s what gets added to the subscriber count. And what we typically see a pretty significant uptick at that first read. Beyond that, we continue to see growth and it\u2019s that volume growth and usage that drives one of the stats that we talked about in the opening commentary, which is we\u2019ve had several renewals of EBAs in Q4. And on average, the renewal is 40% higher than the original EBA. That\u2019s driven by usage; that\u2019s not -- it\u2019s not as much price driven as it is by usage. So, big uptick on the first measurement and then slight upticks out through the remainder of the three years.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Zane Chrane with Bernstein Research. Your line is now open.","Zane Chrane","I was wondering how should we think about the timing and magnitude of the EBA billings cycle change to deferred revenue for fiscal \u201819 and \u201820. And then, the second question, what\u2019s been the feedback from customers on the new features and functionality with the new model subscription versus legacy licenses, is the features, new function that's driving the migration of license all users or is it more of a financial decision given the upfront cost.","Scott Herren","I'll take the front end of that and let Andrew talk about the value prop of moving to subs. This is the first year where we migrated the majority of -- the overall majority of our EBAs over to annual billings, so it\u2019s still a three year commitment but billed annually. So if you notice one of the staff that we're providing now is unbilled deferred. What that represents almost entirely represents is year two and year three of EBAs that we signed this year. A few other goals small cats and dogs in there, but almost all of that 326 is the second and third year of the EBAs we signed this year.","So you can tell half of that 326 will come out in fiscal '19, the other half will come out in fiscal '19. Fiscal '19 we'll sign another whole cohort of EBAs and in each case those will also be on annual billing so I expect to see that $326 million balance grow these year as we add two more years of unbilled deferred to the balance but only bill one year out of that 326. So the 326 will be something higher at the end of fiscal '19, I think it's pretty straightforward and we'll provide you those stats for you each quarter, it's pretty straightforward for you to set up a waterfall model then understand how that's going to accrete into future billings.","Andrew Anagnost","This is Andrew. With regards to the other question about what\u2019s driving their motion right now? If you're looking at a standalone product right now the financial incentive is probably the core thing that is driving the momentum in terms of maintenance to subscription moves because they're essentially seeing the same product with a cloud wrapper around it. We are getting a lot of feedback that the inclusion of some of the new cloud wrappers, we put in with the product around collaboration and sharing in conjunction with the support offering, we entangled with subscription is adding a lot of value. When you look at collections and the increase in people choosing collection, that's more than just the financials incentive.","The collections have actually been beefed up progressively for instance in the product design and manufacturing collection, we've added machining capabilities into the collection and people are noticing that and choosing the options. Same with the ADC collection, we've added some core capabilities that are making it more attractive for people to decide to take the collections option as they move. So it's kind of bifurcated in terms of standalone products and what we're seeing with collections. Everybody likes to support us.","I said everybody likes the support, the added support.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Michael Nemeroff","We've been talking with a lot of your channel partners throughout the quarter and there's obviously a shift occurring in the channel's of involvement in your new product sales. How, Andrew, how do you view the channel's role in new product sales over the next couple of years and what are you expecting from them?","Andrew Anagnost","So I think I've stated pretty emphatically over time that channel one is still an important part of our business, as we move out to steady state we expect our business to be 50-50 split between direct and indirect with everybody seeing a larger business, we'll have a larger direct business, they'll have a larger indirect business. So channel the strategic component of our execution moving forward. In the new businesses when it comes to booting up new business, a lot of the hard work has to be done by Autodesk first, channel partners, really, really want to get engaged in new businesses early on and we do engage them at various points in new business.","But it's better if we do some of the early market seeding and market development efforts and then start to migrate the business more over into the channel. We've been doing that with BIM 360 and some of the new application, but we kind to try to take a measured approach. One area where we really engaged partners in the future is the Forge platform and building out customization on the top of our cloud platform, that\u2019s an area where encouraging partners with step out and get engaged in really early because that allow them to stitch together our solutions for their customer and really driver this services business, which we think is not only important for us long-term with the fact that we\u2019re going missing new types of customer solutions build on Forge it's important for them.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heather Bellini","I was just wondering, Andrew. How do you feel about cloud as you look furthering out as being a TAM expander? There has been a lot of questions talking through kind of how you get here to $6 in free cash flow, and by the way I\u2019m assuming you guys didn\u2019t explicitly state that, but I guess people are asking about still your target. And then when you look at to your further target of fiscal 23, how important is cloud as TAM expander to get to that level and what do you see as being a driver for that to drive adoption?","Andrew Anagnost","First off let's be very clear, we\u2019re affirming the $6 and we\u2019re committed to that, so let me super clear on that one. So now when we look at the cloud, so let\u2019s be super clear on few facts. So first off in Q4, we added 45,000 cloud subscriptions in the quarter okay, a lot of people would love to have that number. So that\u2019s the net add, it\u2019s a net add, so it\u2019s a robust add, we have record billings, robust billings growth, the cloud is right where we expect it to be at this point. What we decided to do strategically and I think it was appropriate is, we deemphasize and moved away from the super low end cloud subscriptions we have. They came under the guise of BIM 360 team and Fusion 360 team, and moved much to our portfolio strategy around things like docks and field and higher value fusion offering.","That was a very deliberate choice and that\u2019s why you see some of these subscription guidance\u2019s that are being heavily impacted by the change in the way we\u2019re executing on cloud. But now as you look out forward, in terms of our business developments efforts in the cloud, we\u2019re exactly where we should be in the cycle as we move to FY 23. So one more facts just to comment on FY23 before I talk about the cloud is, the business model transformation, the move to subscription to core business doesn\u2019t just suddenly run out of steam, as moved to FY23. It provides a solid growing foundation that we build upon, but to get those FY23 targets, you\u2019re defiantly going to see us at a lot more cloud businesses as we get to Fy23. It's not necessary for FY23, it's absolutely plan of the FY23 plan and you\u2019re going to see us growth at those organically and in organically like we done with any new business in the past.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","First question Andrew, you touched on this is the role of eStore, I think you said about a 100 million for fiscal \u201918 and at some point you would expect it to be at least half of the direct business which would be quarter of the total business. So if I would say fiscal 22, 23, you are a 12 billion plus company, you are looking at potentially roughly $1 billion eStore business. So if that on totally, but could you talk about infrastructure scaling requirements or mixed expectations you have to get that kind of multiplier of your eStore business from fiscal '18? And then last question has to do with your product roadmap or product development execution. You did that very well starting 15 years ago with the maintenance program moving for annual release in that first engine flywheel to recurrent revenue. Given all the changes in the Company you talked about a year in terms of core products and changes in R&D to R&D management and all the rest. Could you talk about your execution plans for development not just in cloud for the next year or two to make sure that you keep that flywheel going for recurring revenue?","Andrew Anagnost","So, let me start with the infrastructure question, so you are right, we've been moving up close to a $1 billion eStore business as we move out into those outlying years, and infrastructure investment is required to make sure that we manage that base in the appropriate way, so I'll talk about this whole effort around digitizing, the Company is investing in digitizing the Company.","We already have the transactional infrastructure to get to that number, so we can take the order, we can manage the entitlement, but there's a whole wrapper of infrastructure around a $1 billion base, I mean just think how many subscribers has to be in the millions, and you want to take care of that phase, you want to engage with that phase, you want to have intelligence on that base. So that you can easily what's going on with those customers, that's the infrastructure we are building out, the inward facing infrastructure that allows us to understand that came to us electronically.","But also the infrastructure that faces the customer, that allows them to on their own without any intervention from an artist person, manage their relationship with Autodesk. So you will see the building of both of those pieces of infrastructure over time. Right now, obviously, we've already got the core transactional infrastructure to drive the results here. Now when we talk about the R&D case, so one of the things I did and I think you astutely noticed this is that we split the development efforts up into essentially what is the core business designing creation products in venture, AutoCad, Revit, Max, Maya, and the new business products essentially around the cloud, construction based products, the new kind of advanced manufacturing products.","One of the key things that's going on inside the design creation organization is splitting that flywheel on development with a rapid cadence of small incremental additions and upgrades to the product that keep the customer seeing progress. Now they're going to see progress not only in the product but for those people who manage large installations over the next 18 months or so, they're going to see progress on how easy it is to manage their installations with Autodesk. So over a 12 to 18 month period people are going to see a lot of functionality show up.","The experience we aspire to Jay, is kind of like what you\u2019re seeing with Office 365 right now, where these little kind of updates come in and it gives you a quick little dialogue -- here is a figure that I just -- we just updated for your Office experience, that's where we are heading, we are actually making very good progress in that direction, and that's how customers are going to be able to digest a continuous stream of upgrades without this kind of big thud that we used to do.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Ken Talanian","So I was wondering if you could give us a sense of what kind of uptake you've seen from non-subscribers during the year and then any plans to address that base going into fiscal 19?","Andrew Anagnost","Historically, the nonsubscribers are kind of absorbed into our run rate, we run promos, we've been running promos on a case about twice a year, so you saw that we did fairly successfully in the promos, I can't remember exactly the number of nonsubscribers we brought in through promos last year. We did two promos, one in Q1 and one in Q3. What we're doing this year as we move forward one of the non paying nonsubscriber side this is the year we're kind of instrumenting our license compliance efforts so we are actually putting out more intelligence and capability that actually tells the customer in the product that they're working with a non-compliant copy and maybe they might want to investigate how they got there and also allowing them to contact us quickly and buy.","If you look at what we did with the legacy wing, where we're doing the legacy base, the nonsubscribers that have fallen off maintenance and they're sitting on all perpetual licenses. We're actually rolling out a new set of promos at lower discount but actually has some insurance policies built into it where if the customer moves and falls off two years from now they can default back to the old perpetual release they had at the time they moved. They don't get the latest they just get their old way, so it's like an insurance policy to provide even more attraction to that base to come and move forward. We're going to see how that works as we move into this year. This past year I've got the number in front of me, we moved 50,000 users into our paying base from promotions like this. We actually expect this new promotion to do as well if not better than some of those past promotions.","Scott Herren","Yes and Ken, promotions are one way that we go after the legacy base, as you know in many cases they end up coming back to us as the product they're if they're not on maintenance, the product they're using ages out and as it gets older and older their ability to communicate with other partners around them whether they're manufacturing in part of the supply chain or it\u2019s in their contractor on ASC as their version becomes more and more down level their ability to exchange files becomes harder and harder you know file types change through time. So promos is one way kind of a financial lever to pull the other is they as since all of these are network type used products in other word they're used in conjunction with other companies they end up needing to get the latest release just to stay compliant.","Ken Talanian","Great, and I guess just a bigger picture question, could you rank order what factors might cause you to exceed your current ARR growth targets for fiscal '19.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, I mean that's a little bit of a loaded question. What I'd say, what we've seen so far is faster progression in ARPS growth than we have previously anticipated, a lot of it based on the factors that again Andrew talked about earlier. Some of it\u2019s coming from consolidation of subscriptions where people are moving up to the collections that are faster paced than we saw. The uptick of maintenance of subscription has been a bit of a catalyst for that, e-store has been bigger than we expected and we'll continue to drive that faster.","Our renewal base, remember when we sell a new product through the channel there's a higher margin for the channel partner that we saw a renewal through a partner. And as our renewal base grows out through time, the lower channel cost and effect accretes to us as well, that's also driving ARPs, so there's a whole set of things that are driving ARPS growth even faster than we had expected, I'd say that's probably been the bigger upside and you've seen subs in particular around cloud, subs are coming at slightly lower level but at a higher price point.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Keith Weiss","We've seen two horizontal row where the net subscriber to come in, sort of blow peoples expectation and you guys have taken the targets down. And if I\u2019m not mistaken there is two different explanations kind why have been last quarter is more about, sort of heavily promoted classification is not being in the going forward basis and this quarter is more about the difference between what our subscriber is and what our subscription is in, subscriptions more sufficient to come into one support, getting into one collection. How do we garner confidence that this is the last kind of take down in terms of our net subscriptions ads estimates on a going forward basis? Is there any kind of visibility you give us into sort of any, sort of excess that might be in that base on a going forward basis that you feel comfortable that this number is not coming down again?","Andrew Anagnost","First let me acknowledge your frustration then you might be having with the way that is played out over last two quarters, I just have to acknowledge that, I mean it doesn\u2019t help you with your modeling. It doesn\u2019t help you with some of your core effort. So I absolutely want to acknowledge. I wanted to go back to some fundamentals here, so we get kind level set and then I will answer your question specifically about the, so first off remember we broke out the core and we file deliberately, now so you can start seeing dynamic, the core grew 14% for the year, so the subs basin in the core grew 14% for the year, that\u2019s in line with historical behavior, we\u2019re going to see that same number of greater moving forward.","So the core shows some nice straight and stability. What we did see this quarter that was not anticipated the right was just acceleration in the collections activity associated not only with the run rate with M2S and it wasn\u2019t acceleration, it was off the trend of the previous two quarters in terms of how fast people are moving and yes, that did result in this consolidation resulting from up sale but for the right reason, we saw the appreciation of ARR associated with that. So when you look forward to what we\u2019ve done with the guide, I got to said earlier the vast majority of the most of that guide is due to our cloud reset expectations and the majority of that cloud reset is due to simply not driving these super low value cloud subscription.","When you look at the core our CAGR for FY20 is essentially unchanged for the core business, so what can garden your confidence here as we understand a lot more what\u2019s going on with the cloud, we\u2019re not prepared for more acceleration around consolidation as we seen it move forward, we know how to play out through FY19 and we\u2019re holding to the CAGR for the core business that we expect to have in F18, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. Do you want to add anything else Scott?","Scott Herren","Keith, the only other thing I'd say is even in those two quarters as you point out with subs something in, perhaps certainly lighter than everyone externally expected in Q3, lighter than our own expectations in Q4 in each quarter ARR perform nicely and they are really has been, we set our long about our top goal is to drive ARR and to drive cash flow out of that ARR, do you remember Q3, ARR grew 24%, so that\u2019s been before that actually able to seven consecutive quarter of increasing growth rate in ARR and again 25% in the quarter we disclose. So ARR continues to perform nicely even as subs have been little bit lower than our expectation in the last quarter.","Keith Weiss","I definitely understand the ARR is the key number you are looking at, but also want to have confidence in the components as it's building as ARR, sort of there's a trend line there going on in line with my model?","Andrew Anagnost","I get that. I totally get that.","Scott Herren","I want you go back to that core strength that we are talking about here because that's the important driver. The layer on top of that, the factors we are talking about around are ARPS appreciation, associated with up sell collections, that are price utilization and the reduced thermal activity and by the way don\u2019t underestimate how the acceleration of price utilization is going to affect the year moving forward. Those are things you want to pay attention to the core. That's why we are trying to help by breaking out the two.","Keith Weiss","And longer term I mean do you think there's any chance that you'd have a view on subscribers versus subscriptions?","Scott Herren","It's a conversation we have a lot, part of the investment, Andrew has talked about three big priorities that we are investing in, one of them is digitizing the Company, part of the effort there in digitizing the Company is to be able to count users as opposed to subscriptions. Historically we sold shrink wrap product that was -- that had license number with it. So you can track license numbers, but you can't always track on the one-to-one basis is who the actual user of that license, part of the investment that we are making in digitizing the Company will give us much better insight into account level metrics and within that usage metrics, so yes we may get to that point, we are not there today.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Monika Garg","So, I'd like to go back to the ops point, if you look at your fiscal 2019 guidance, you are guiding ARR to 30%, but your net sub adds go to about 14%, that means you are guiding ARPS growth of some mid 60ish percent, just to give walk within that end factors kind of how we achieve this kind of pricing increase?","Scott Herren","Monika, it sounds you are looking at the 605 guide, the midpoint of the guide to ARR, under 606 which is really what I'd like everyone to adjust their models to is 29%, but your math is still directionally right. And I think the ARPS growth drivers will be the components that we talked about is continuing up sell to industry collections and particularly as maintenance to subscription accelerates, what we are seeing is as people make that choice of those who are eligible to upgrade, more than a third are taking that which is -- so that's going to push more people to industry collections that obviously drives ARPS up.","These will continue to grow, the renewal business is a big part of the ARPS curve, and so significantly higher yield to Autodesk, when the channel partner itself are renewed versus selling a new product and so as renewals becomes a bigger part of our overall revenue, obviously the cost of selling through the channel comes down, that drives up our price realization and we have made some very specific changes on partner margins around the low end, specifically AutoCad LP and what those margins look like. So, you add those factors together along with kind of reduced promotional activity and discounting, that's what drives -- that's what going to drive ARPS growth rate, and if anything what we've seen is it moved up faster than we expected.","Monika Garg","Thanks Scott. Then this is a follow-up, your first Q revenue growth guidance is somewhere 14%, 14.5%, but your yearly guidance is somewhere 21%, 22%, which would mean steep kind of ramp acceleration in revenue growth towards second half. Maybe walk us through the factors that would lead to accelerate? Is it like ARPS growth is more second half weighted or any other reason effective?","Scott Herren","Yes, exactly what it is, and as you are -- if you recall, so it's ARPS growth mostly, we do see some growth in subs throughout the year but it's mostly ARPS growth but remember to the maintenance and subscription program that the annual change in price points on that come into effect in Q2, and so that also that not only affects Q2 but of course it -- when we saw that it drops into deferred revenue and comes back out of deferred revenue as the year goes on, so it has a lesser effect earlier in the year and a bigger effect later in the year.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question will come from the line of Steve Koning with Wedbush Securities, your line is now open.","Steve Koning","Thanks, hi guys, thanks for your explanations on the mechanics of how this is going. I want to ask one question on maintenance subs and then just a follow-up question on ARR and then converting billings growth. So on the maintenance subs, Scott, I think you said the expected decline in maintenance subs was primarily related to the M2S program so that kind of leads me to the question, if that was the primary factors, what are the secondary factors in the decline and maintenance subs?","Scott Herren","Yes, there's always a certain amount of non renewed, we don't have a 100% renewal rate Steve, so as the maintenance space is bigger in Q4 that drives the other piece of why you saw the decline in maintenance subs, so 168,000 of the 244 that maintenance came down. 168,000 migrated the remainder are some form of non-renewed. Remember the example we gave though, right. That customer, those were 42 licenses on maintenance that converted over to 20 subs, so some of that, some of that non-renewed is actually good news it's individual licenses that are converting up to collections.","Steve Koning","Got it, got it, okay thanks for that, and then on the follow-up, is there anything that could surprise you guys when it comes to eventually converting that ARR to billings growth and then I want tp sneak in maybe a related question if I could define it that way. Thinking about post fiscal '20, how should we think about how ARPS and free cash flow, how that trajectory flows after fiscal '20 should the ARPS grow peak in fiscal '20 then decelerate fairly gradually cause you're still layering on you know subscriptions faster than you're trading the base and so how should we think about that longer term trajectory as well?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay, that's quite a suite of questions there Steve. Let me take the billings one first, the -- I think the other thing to think about as we talk about as we talk about you know ARPS and how that's going grow and how that's going to drive billings out through fiscal '20, billings so the two big drivers of cash flow which I think is the source of your question are net income you have a good sense of that from the targets we've given and billings which drives deferred revenue growth. The only other effect besides the ARPS growth that will drive the billings side of that, that you need to bear in mind is we've always had a steady proportion of customers who buy multiyear, so if you go back to when, before we started the transition we were selling maintenance agreements, somewhere between 20 and 25% of our customers who bought a maintenance agreement bought a multiyear.","That's been pretty steady, of course when we launched the maintenance the subscription we cut that off, we cut off multiyear maintenance subs. What we've seen interestingly in product subs off a much smaller base of course is many of them are also buying in fact it's almost the exact same proportion of product subs customer are buying multiyear as well. So as you think about your billings model out through fiscal '20 remember that we've had a decline in physical '18 in billings driven by no multiyear maintenance. The same proportion of customers are also buying multiyear product subs as product subs becomes a bigger part of the base, that's going to drive billings as well.","The other factor to layer in, two other factors to layer in on that, the bleed back of unbilled deferred which we talked about earlier with Zane's question, make sure you\u2019re modeling that in, right. We have a year of unbilled deferred that\u2019s build up to 326 million that will build again in fiscal \u201919 and then by fiscal \u201920 we will have two years of unbilled differed leading back to the billing stream. So at that and then finally from just from a cash flow and optimum billing standpoint, the fiscal \u201919 has these two one-time events that total about a 130 million of cash outflow, partially driven by the cash payments for eh restructuring, partially the exit tax from moving our operational center in Europe from Switzerland to Dublin, Ireland.","Andrew Anagnost","And the only point I'll add that Steve just to reinforce what we said about the multiyear, the multiyear is not going to happen for no reason at all. As we enter into fiscal 20, we\u2019re absolutely entering the first group of customers, M2S customers, they're seeing their M2S period, and so they are going to lock in there price, that\u2019s been a historic behaviors, what happens is customers say okay, I don\u2019t want to see, I want some price stability out there so they will buy multiyear.","And the fact that we had this large trench of initial MTS customers, you will see that just naturally migrating the business in FY29. And then guys if you could answer the question I smock in there, that would be great, which is how should we think about the trajectory after fiscal 20 in terms of growth rate, as we layer on the subscription revenue and more of that, I tell you get more of a steady state, how should that progress.","Scott Herren","Steve I think it's there is no big change for the path that we had laid out in that, at our last investor day we call it to the better thing to do right in front of tackle the moving parts here. We have our investor three weeks from tomorrow here. And at that point, we will not give you a little more granularity on the path of fiscal 20, but we will also give you little more granularity on the five year plan, so that may be the best thing to do with hold off on that until March 28th.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this is all the time we have for questions today. So now I'd like to hand the conference back over to David Gennarelli, Investor Relations for any closing comments or remarks.","Dave Gennarelli","Thanks everybody and as Scott just mentioned, we have our Investor Day coming on up on March 28th here in our office in San Francisco. We'll also be at the Bernstein Conference on April 10th in Boston. We\u2019re going to follow that up with an NDR in Boston on April 11th and in New York on April 12th.

My name is Hope, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Fiscal Year 2013 Autodesk Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Gennarelli, you may begin your conference.","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2013. Joining me today are Carl Bass, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Hawkins, our Chief Financial Officer.","Today's conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted in our press release we have published our prepared remarks in our website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments, and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and future performance of the company, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2013, long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance, new products and suite releases and expected growth rates, expected cost savings from our restructuring and other cost management efforts, hiring plans, business execution, certain future strategic transactions, business prospects and financial results, our market opportunities and strategies, including our transition to cloud and mobile computing, trends in sales initiatives for our products and trends in various geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us, and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our form 10-K for the fiscal year 2012, our form 10-Q for the period ending April 30, 2012, and our periodic form 8-K filings, including the form 8-K filed with today's press release and prepared remarks. Those documents contain and identify important risks and other factors that may cause actual results to differ from those contained in our forward-looking statements.","Forward-looking statements made during the call are being made as of today. If this call is replayed or viewed after today, the information presented during the call may not contain current or accurate information. Autodesk disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. We will provide guidance on today's call but we'll not provide any -- further guidance or updates on our performance during the quarter unless we do so in a public forum.","During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of the GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release, prepared remarks and on the Investor Relations website. We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance and unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect execution issues stemming from our organizational realignment earlier this year, as well as continued unevenness in the economic environment. There are a few bright spots, but the reality is we missed our revenue targets on most fronts. Recall that last quarter, I spoke to you about a reorganization of our go-to-market activities. We organized our sales teams by industry to better serve our customers and drive future growth. We also made some adjustments to our channel programs, drawing on best practices from our various geographies. We can point to a mixed global economy for part of the explanation. But we did not execute as well as we would've liked on a number of fronts. It's clear that our reorganization and having people in different positions slowed us down in the quarter. With many employees taking on new roles, new customers, new managers and teams, the amount and level of change has been significant. And while the reorganization changes are important for the future, some degree of confusion and slower decision-making resulted, which affected the organization overall and our revenue results in particular.","As we track the progress of the quarter, the shortfall in revenue did not emerge until July, as our demand generation activities did not produce the anticipated effect. The organizational realignment, combined with an uneven economic environment, limited our ability to both identify the shortfall earlier and respond more quickly.","From a geographic perspective, the weakness we experienced in Southern Europe was not surprising. However, weakness in Central Europe was unforeseen. Although there was growth in the U.S., revenue growth in the Americas was well below what we've been experiencing over the past several quarters, due in large part to our results in Latin America. On the bright side, the Asia Pacific performed much better than the 2 other geographies. And in fact, the APAC had record revenues due to strong growth in Japan and China.","Similar to last year, results from BRIC countries were mixed as growth in China and Russia was partially offset by weakness in Brazil and India. From a divisional perspective, PSEB performed the best, driven by 12% growth of combined AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT revenues. I'm calling this is out because our AutoCAD business was hit the hardest during the big downturn a few years ago. So we're pleased to see the relative strength in this area.","I was also pleased to see early positive signs from several of our cloud initiatives. For example PLM 360 had a nice start in its first full quarter of availability. We signed a number of PLM deals with companies ranging from small business to well-known large enterprises, and our professional mobile apps continued to experience strong adoption during the quarter. For example, AutoCAD WS, which allows people to view and edit AutoCAD files via web browser or an iOS or Android device, has now been downloaded more than 9 million times.","From a higher level perspective, revenue from our direct sales business had good growth for the quarter, buoyed by activity from large deals in the U.S. Revenue growth was much lower in our indirect channel, which makes up about 85% of our revenue mix.","Now let me focus on our expenses. With the backdrop of an uneven macroeconomic environment and our focus on delivering on our operating margin improvement goals, Autodesk has been taking a prudent approach to spending for the fiscal year. These on-going cost management measures contributed to the delivery of non-GAAP EPS within our company's guidance range for the second quarter. In light of our second quarter performance and a reduced revenue outlook for the year, we are further reducing our spend by implementing cost-cutting measures in the second half of this fiscal year, such as restricting non-sales related travel and reducing our number of contractors.","The other news we announced today was the restructuring as we are accelerating our transition to cloud and mobile computing. This kind of action, especially one that impacts many of our employees, is always a difficult decision. The basis behind the restructuring is twofold. First and foremost, the restructuring centers on getting the right employee skills that will help make us successful and allow us to move faster in our transition to increase cloud and mobile computing. This action allows us to continue investing, recruiting and hiring people who can bring to Autodesk the skills and experience that are critical for achieving our mid- and long-term goals. As part of the ongoing platform shift, it's clear to us that design and engineering software will move to cloud and mobile platforms. Cloud and mobile has been a major investment area for Autodesk over the past couple of years, and this restructuring will accelerate our progress as we intend to further invest in employees with expertise and skill sets essential to this transition. Additional industry restructuring helps us reduce costs and streamline the organization as a continuation of the activities we began earlier this year.","On a combined basis, restructuring and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by planned investments, will result in a pretax spend in the second half of fiscal 2003 -- '13, ranging between a 2% decrease and a 2% increase compared to the second half of fiscal 2012.","As we look at our forecast for this fiscal year, we are adjusting our targets. We have lowered our revenue targets as we're working through these challenges as quickly as possible. People are now settling into their new roles and we have identified and addressed a number of areas for improvements to help us regain our momentum and improve our results. The restructuring and ongoing cost reductions allow us to both invest in our transition and maintain a healthy year-over-year operating margin expansion target of approximately 150 basis points.","Looking at the rest of this year and beyond, although the economic environment is tougher, our market opportunity and prospects remain strong and we remain committed to achieving our long-term growth targets by the end of fiscal 2015.","I'm sure you have many questions. So without further delay, let's open the call up. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I guess my first question and then the follow-up. But the first question is, how can you just call it the big issue of the macro was just sales productivity from people being [indiscernible] with new responsibilities versus other things such as competitive or some other factor?","Carl Bass","I mean I guess, Sterling, I think there\u2019re really 2 things that we're trying to parse is what was due to our own execution issues, sales realignment and all the rest, versus macroeconomic. I look at the competitive and I don't think that, that played almost any factor in this. Like I said, you look at the first quarter, you look at the first 2 months, we were on target. If you look at the shortfall, it really happened in 3 geographic areas, the vast majority of it comes in 3 areas that I don't think are particularly sensitive to competitive stuff. So I think the real tricky question is trying to ascertain how much is due to faults of our own making versus what's going on in the global economy.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up, I guess, would almost be in 2 parts. One, is there any trend as you move through August that gave you sense that productivity-wise things are getting more -- people are getting more comfortable? And the transition or the realignment restructuring you're announcing today, what does that entail? Is that also people moving into new jobs or is it just simply a headcount reduction?","Carl Bass","So for August and what we've seen, and we're relatively late in August relative to other years, we're on track for the guidance that we gave you obviously. And so really nothing about that. What I see is we have 3.5 more weeks under our belt in terms of people moving into their new positions, ironing out some of this. As we said, we\u2019ve really had 7.5 weeks or something like that. July when we start to see the weakness to digest and try to make accommodations to try to fix this. So we've been looking at it for a while. As it relates to the restructuring, there will be people who are moving out of jobs and they will, as we said, there will be people moving into jobs as we continually do. But it\u2019ll be nothing on the scale of what we did in the beginning of the year when there was a big kind of game of musical chairs amongst sales and marketing people within the organization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the lines of Walter Pritchard, Citigroup.","Kenneth Wong","This is Ken Wong for Walter. Just kind of building on what Sterling was asking there, just wondering, are you guys starting to see any of the trends that you guys saw during the last downturn in terms of things like attach or some of the early indicators that might suggest that you guys are in for a more bumpy road?","Carl Bass","What's interesting, and we called that one in particular, which was what we saw last time, what was the most striking was our AutoCAD and LT business. And that was the most resilient this quarter. So it was totally a contra-indicator from what we had seen in the last downturn. We haven't seen anything on the subscription front. So most of it doesn't look anything like it. Mark, you have...","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, I would say the -- actually the renewals, we were pleased to see actual sequential improvement there. It's been a good year-on-year improvement, modest. So back to the point that Carl is making, these are not the kind of size that we would see like we saw in other kind of economic circumstances.","Kenneth Wong","And like I said, what we're seeing -- I think it's important while in some ways, July was an unmitigated disaster because the first 2 months, we were right on target and certainly when we went to Analyst Day, we were feeling very comfortable with our guidance for the quarter. A lot happened and it particularly happened in 3 areas. And so it was geographically isolated. So it has a very different feel to it. And I think we went into kind of the postmortem of the quarter, thinking that it was more about macroeconomic weakness. And I think we emerged from our analysis saying that it was more from flaws in execution on our part.","Kenneth Wong","Got you. And then on the -- on your restructuring, I mean it sounds like it's more -- just you guys are trying to get the right people on the cloud. If things start to get worse, I mean does it -- it sounds like you guys probably have a little room to cut if the pare back cost to maintain profitability, if that's the case?","Carl Bass","Yes, we certainly created a bunch of headroom that allows us much more flexibility about cost going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle, Pacific Crest Security.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, I wanted to follow up, you'd said that execution was in the indirect channel and that's where you had changes in personnel. So what kind of changes in that -- in the indirect channel on your side would have created this sort of shortfall if it's something other than the macro?","Carl Bass","So by the way we have -- just -- let me just be clear, we had changes on both sides. And I would just say, relatively speaking, our direct activity was stronger than our indirect. It wasn't a blowout quarter by any means, but it was definitely stronger. What we did is, just to put it in the highest level terms, we went from a geographically organized sales force to one that was focused around the industry. So in some ways, maybe we underestimated because a lot of people still have the same job. So if you were a manufacturing salesperson for us in Central Europe, you still were after the change. But your chain of command had changed because you are now in the manufacturing organization as opposed to being in the European or Central European organization. So it was a big structural change at the top and it was all about organizing around our customer segments. That was really the big change. And it involved a fair amount of movement of personnel. It also probably impacted our ability to get quotas and targets out to our sales force, as well as probably our ability to measure the results as they came in.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And so how does that work? You've got 1 month left in the quarter and all of a sudden, that falls off. I mean the resellers, presumably are selling on their own. Is it that your guys weren't out monitoring that closely enough to see that folks were all of a sudden falling behind and trying to do things to pull that back in line?","Carl Bass","Yes -- I mean, I think we always work closely with our partners. I think there's a fair amount of promotional activity as well as added assist we give in deals. And as what I said, I think if we had more experience than people in place, we might have been able to pick up on the cue\u2019s sooner. But just to repeat myself, there was really 3 parts of the world where we -- and so just to be clear, this is Central Europe, Brazil and India. So lots of other places where we shouldn't paint the broad brush of something is broken there. It may not be optimal. It probably needs improvement. But the shortfall compared to our forecast happened in 3 places. And we had changes in leadership, changes in distribution in places, we had changes in partnership agreements. And so I think the -- almost if we had 3 months of the quarter, we would've been better off than finding out in the last month of the quarter. We would\u2019ve had more time to respond. But you're absolutely right that the resellers are out there doing business. But, for example, in one part of the world, a bunch of our resellers where our business was poor, if you were to speak to them, they would say they had good quarters. Their mix of services and software was decidedly different. And so they\u2019re walking away saying, \"I had a good quarter.\" It was a bad quarter for us. So I think we have to understand that while I think everything I've said is broadly applicable about the changes we need to make and how we're working on it, there were several isolated places that were the major contributors to the shortfall.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley, Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm actually just going to follow up right on Brendan's exact line of questioning and ask, were there changes to channel policy in terms of the resellers that impacted their performance? Not the oversight of the channel people by your people, but rather just changes in the channel that -- was there anything that disrupted their performance?","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean there were changes in -- some of the channel partner agreements that happen every year, there are always changes. In some parts of the world, they were probably a little bit larger this year than other years. And so that was a one. Regardless of the people involved in the administration of it, there were policy changes there. There were also some program changes and there were actually some offerings that were different. So pricing changes and what we put together in different suites and stuff like that. So there were a number of variables involved. And like I said, that's why as we started to dig into it and really dug into the 3 areas where we experienced the shortfall, we saw particular issues cropping up in each one of those that are certainly partially responsible for the problems.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And as you move to the cloud, is there anything you could tell us about time frame, milestones, what kind of phased implementation we can look for over time? Any color on that would be helpful.","Carl Bass","Yes, sure. I mean, well, we are believers that cloud and mobile and social are phenomena that are important technology platforms for design and engineering. And that our offerings in the future will be there. And we've been very clear about this for a long time. What I would say is the way we intend to offer it and the way we're rolling it out, which is already visible is, step one, is to combine our cloud-based offerings to existing products, generally in-suites with subscription. So it's a bundled offering that comes together, and we're offering cloud-based Web services that are complementary to the existing products that exist within the suite. We will roll out different pricing models, termed offerings and other ways for people to use them, as well as \u00e0-la-carte ways, so they can get access to more services. And what we hope to see is a switch in which now, the desktop products are the primary component of a suite and that packaged offering, and we think over time, it will move where the desktop component becomes less important or the Web services becomes more important. And so you'll see a change in licensing model, you'll see a change in how we go to market. And we will certainly see a change in the usage model amongst our customers. And then just to put it -- Steve, just to put a time frame on it, we've already introduced a bunch of Web-based services. There's more coming out this year. Beginning of the year, you'll see a lot more. We have a -- right now what I'd say is we have very strong individual offerings. There are things like the PLM 360 and the Autodesk 360, and we will continue to enhance them as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill, UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, you haven't implemented price increases for quite some time. I would've thought that the price increase gone into effect in August would have a bigger impact in the last quarter. Can you just give your sense of what you think the dynamic will be going forward? And I just want to be clear, on the indirect side, the deals that didn't come through, you saw visibility and I would assume it's just details that have been delayed versus lost?","Carl Bass","So as to the pricing increase actually stimulating demand. All I can say is I would have hoped so. It didn't. And so I lose all credibility, Brent, with actually predicting what the price increase will do going forward because historically, when we look announcing a price increase before a quarter generally stimulates demand. And we really didn't see that this time. We're not -- we saw it, but not to the degree that we would have expected. The other part of your question, Brent?","Mark  Hawkins","About indirect, anything that [indiscernible] Yes.","Carl Bass","Go ahead. Oh, the deals?","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just from the deals that just -- that didn't flip in the indirect side. I assume your visibility on those deals, those deals have not been competitively lost. They're still on the cue. It's just a question of the timing when they come in.","Carl Bass","Yes, and I talked to our head of sales yesterday. A bunch of deals that didn't come in have already come in this quarter. I don't want to be hypocritical here. I always make fun of companies when they announce that the missed and it was just lack of a deal or 2 because I think the real explanation is so are you taking up the next quarter to accommodate those deals? We're not doing that. So I wouldn't want to sit here and say it's a deal or 2. But I did check with our sales leaders. And we have seen the deals come in. And also, I think there was an earlier question, it might have been Sterling or Walter. But we haven't seen any real change in the competitive environment out there. So it's not like are -- not like the deals are being lost. But we certainly didn't bring in the number of deals that we needed to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the land of Gregg Moskowitz, Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Carl, you spoke about some of the weakness in some of the territories from a product standpoint that -- it did look like the uptake from manufacturing suites was practically low this quarter. Just curious if there was anything that stood out there.","Carl Bass","Other than it was terrible, no, nothing stood out. It was just a bad result. The only thing I can offer is that our manufacturing products are particularly strong in Europe and Central Europe and so it's disproportionately affected. That's probably the only good insight I can give you. And I will go back to what I've said repeatedly on these calls is, while the results are really disappointing, even when we have good results, I don't draw out too many conclusion from one data point and I wait to see another quarter before we go too far in any direction drawing conclusions about the offerings, the pricing, the promotions or the programs.","Gregg Moskowitz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just as a follow-up for Mark. You guys spoke and provided some good color around the incremental investments toward cloud and mobile. We're just wondering if there's any more insight you can give as to the net change and overall staffing levels as a function of the restructuring.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, sure, Ken -- Gregg. We reduced our heads or we're in the process of reducing our heads by about 520 people roughly speaking. And that is creating headroom, as Carl said, around investment. An investment in cloud and mobile, this is all about transformation and accelerating toward the strategy that we think is so important. I think you can expect in the period of the fiscal year that we plan to reinvest a good portion of that, perhaps as much as 250 people by the time we exit the fiscal year. And then as you look beyond that, we'll continue to invest into '14. And as I think Walter called out, it gives us a little headroom as we're working toward other -- that strategic investment. So hopefully, that helps you, Gregg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Hey, Carl, so one of the things I wonder about is as you kind of start trying to sell more sophisticated software, whether that's suites, whether that's rendering or simulation or PLM, is the channel -- do you feel the channel is sufficiently -- educated is not the right word, but trained? And so and would that possibly explain what happened in this quarter and as much as maybe it makes sense to circle back to these folks and say, \"Hey, look. Here's a better way to do it.\" Or something like that. I\u2019m just trying to figure that out.","Carl Bass","Yes -- Well, I appreciate any hypothesis that anybody has right now. But when we look at it, I think the suites are right down the sweet spot, so to speak, of what our resellers are very capable of selling. I think the performance over the last 2 years has demonstrated that. There is certainly an issue around things like simulation, about whether or not all of our resellers worldwide are capable of supporting things like that. I mean I think that's slightly different PLM, which we've mainly led with the direct sales force. I think those are slightly different. But I go back to 2 things. I think prior results say that our channel partners are quite capable of doing it. And then the second thing is I think the better insights you can get from this is look at a couple of geographic areas and try to ascertain, we don't think there's one explanation that deals with all 3, despite having dissected this upside down. But we do think in each 3 places, there are things that are going on that are worthy of note. But I wouldn't go as broad as the assertion that our partners are having trouble selling particular products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Perry for Heather. Just wanted to ask a follow-up question on product revenue. It looks like results for suites were impacted the most, growing only, I guess, 5% year-over-year. This was also due to a tough prior year comp. But is there any additional color you can provide here, like do the internal reorg play a role here at all or was it largely due to the channel?","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, I don't think there's a lot of additional color. To be honest with you, Perry, I think it was just again, as Carl said, we had 3 major areas of focus as we kind of deep dive into the -- some of the execution issues, suites were impacted in those 3 areas as well. There's no real silver bullet to pull out on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Mark, I'd like to follow-up on some of the maths surrounding the restructuring. You mentioned earlier that you are going to have an initial reduction of 520 heads. In the last large restructuring back in January of '09, you reduced by 750 heads and that targeted $130 million in savings. So using some proportionality here, would you be looking to save about $100 million in OpEx before you commence the reinvestment you talked about?","Mark  Hawkins","Jay, here's -- I get them. I understand the math that you're doing. I would actually point you a little bit different. The way you can actually map this out pretty straightforwardly is take a look at our half 1 growth rate, which is about 6% in spend. And take a look at the guidance, it's implying minus 2% to plus 2% growth rate in spend in half 2. If you look at the differential from going at a 6% run rate to between minus 2% and plus 2%, I think you can get the math number that gives you really good feel for the net effect of the reduction plus the investment. And that will map that out I think quite well for you, Jay.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. A follow-up question on maintenance, which came up earlier, and if you're seeing any change in your revenues from maintenance customers in the following way, in fiscal '12, you grew your average maintenance revenues for active license by a couple of percent but in Q1, you saw a 4% decline of maintenance revenues per licensee or per license. Are you seeing now in Q2, are you expecting for the remainder of the year any further deterioration in the revenues per license?","Mark  Hawkins","Jay, we don't guide on the license -- excuse me, the maintenance portion of this. I would say the maintenance growth rate going forward is really a function of the prior 4 quarters in many ways. Just the momentum we have, the attach rates, the renewal rate and such. But we don't actually guide in specificity there. So I can't really give you a lot more color there.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Credit Suisse.","Sitikantha Panigrahi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Siti Panigrahi for Phil Winslow. So my question is, could you compare verticals by geography, and which stood out from a strength or weakness perspective during the quarter versus what you have seen previously?","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, it's more -- it's probably more detail than we'd want to get into at this stage. I mean...","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean I think we gave a fair amount of color in the...","Mark  Hawkins","Prepared...","Carl Bass","Prepared remarks. If you look in there, you can kind of see by geo. And I think we've added some color about specific areas that might better help explain what specifically is going on. But we don't want to break down by division by geo.","Mark  Hawkins","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Let's see. First, I'll ask a couple of questions about the geos. You said that the U.S. business grew year-over-year. Was it up -- did it meet with your expectations overall?","Carl Bass","No, we're short of our expectations. But I said, the thing that -- well, let's be clear. What we talked about was the Americas. And that missed our expectations. It was primarily because of Latin America and in particular, Brazil, just to be as clear as possible.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Right, yes. I wanted to ask about each of those 3 weak areas, India, Brazil and Central Europe. Have each one of those -- and I think you said in isolation, each one represents kind of a different case, a weak case. But has each one got into some level of stability in terms of week-over-week visibility? Obviously, you're giving guidance and are you comfortable with that? But I'm curious if these -- currently, are these situations worsening or have they stabilized?","Mark  Hawkins","I would say that when we look at our linearity for the quarter thus far in, basically it looks on track at this stage of course. And there's no big deviations in these particular areas compared to what we would expect for the quarter.","Carl Bass","Yes, we're on track. And what I see the usual amount of moving parts, a little bit of strength in one part of the world, a little bit of weakness, but nothing dramatic. It seems very normal, if you will.","Operator","Your next question comes from the lines of Steve Koenig, Wedbush Securities.","Steve Koenig","One question and one follow up. Really for the first one, I'm looking for color here on the kind of the changes to your organization and your channel policies. And in particular, if I can, just kind of the things I'm wondering there, why did the personnel changes, that I believe happened in Q1, why did they affect you more in Q2 and not Q1? How much of the channel weakness stemmed from the changes to the rebate and registration program? And why didn't the promotional activity generate the leads you expected? And I do have one follow-up if you don't mind.","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean I'd say the best explanation that I have is that -- I mean business was kind of on track through Q1 and the beginning of Q2. And as we've said, 85% of our business goes through our channel partners. I think as we -- everybody kind of saw at least a hiccup in the economy, we were unable to respond as quickly. And I think a bunch of that comes from the people we had in place. I also think as always happens when we change channel programs, in effect, we're changing incentives. And I think some of the incentives got out of whack with some of our channel partners. And as they always do, they try to find a way to maximize their revenue based on that. And so we've already looked at that and we've addressed it. But I think we -- as I said in my remarks, we might have been better able to identify it and respond more quickly if we've had the same people on the ground.","Steve Koenig","I see, right. Okay. And then for the follow-up, just one anecdote that maybe you can help me put into context. We got some feedback then that when you extended your promotion into August, some customers were surprised when they went to take advantage of that. There were surprised to discover it because prices were up -- that net discount was 5% less than they expected. It wasn't as big as they thought it was going to be. And I\u2019m just wondering how well was the price increase communicated? Were there any failures there? And the promotion was not as effective this time. Can I assume that \u2013 August, is it starting out weaker than usual? I mean I assume just by looking at your guidance, that's probably the case.","Carl Bass","Yes. So I mean I'm not familiar -- I mean most of the things we're targeted to generate revenue in July, and the programs were there. They were -- I would say they were managed -- they were conceived, managed and executed by pretty much the same team that has done all of them. So to the extent that they did it well or not, I mean it was an experienced team. They've done this before. We have an evolving set of policies with our partners, we communicated, we're in close contact. So I don't have any insight that, that was part of the problem.","Mark  Hawkins","I agree.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan, Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I have, I think, 2 questions. One, you care to talk about this issue around the organizational changes impacting your ability to respond as being somewhat transient and of your own making. But it certainly does appear from your guidance that you're still modeling a low single-digit growth rate in the second half of this year, which certainly doesn't imply any improvement. In fact, the margin is slightly worse than that, which you saw in Q2. So I was just trying to understand, is that because the baseline run rate of revenue is just lower now? You're off this July kind of run rate and you're not making any assumptions around improvement? Or are there any other factors that have gone into your thinking on that?","Carl Bass","I mean I think there's dozens of factors, Ross. But I mean your observation is right. And I would say we are being, what I consider, appropriately cautious. We're not -- we're coming off a bad quarter. At this point, forecasting a big jump in growth rate seems inappropriate to me. We're conscious of at least a volatile global economy. I don't think it's worsening, but it's certainly volatile. I mean there are the other factors of FX headwinds and stuff like that. And until we've proven otherwise, I don't think we're going to champion kind of a double digit growth rate. And I'd like to prove it first.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, one, just follow-up on maintenance billings, I think they grew 7%. But I think there was a comment that most of that was driven by multiyear contracts. So I guess the question is now that we're anniversary-ing the introduction of the suites last year, why are we not seeing a pickup in the maintenance billings growth rate? Because I thought we were going to be getting that kicker on higher subscription or higher maintenance prices on the suites.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, let me speak to that, Ross. First of all, you're correct that in the billings, one of the playbook items that did work was our multiyear event when there was a price change, it was a compelling event. And that did drive billings. It didn't show up as revenue, but it did drive the billings in a reasonable way. And so that's one aspect. The second thing, that when you look at maintenance billings beyond that, I think the main driver for that has to do with attach rate and getting enough licenses that are out there so that the more license you'd sell, the more opportunity we have to drive maintenance billings. So I think it's more a function of license growth right now from that standpoint. I think for ASPs, over time as people do renew suites, we will see that the thing we talked about before.","Carl Bass","We're already seeing it. We were actually seeing it. It's just, unfortunately, been offset by fewer licenses.","Mark  Hawkins","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss, Morgan Stanley.","Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Melissa calling for Keith. And just in terms of guidance for the full year, what are your assumptions around growth in Europe? Are you assuming that the macro stays relatively stable to how it is today? And then also, lowering of the growth rate for FY '13, how much is that just from macro versus execution-related issues specific to Autodesk?","Mark  Hawkins","So a couple of things. One is we're not assuming any major changes to the economy in Europe, number one. Melissa, secondly, in terms of the, just the macro consideration, as was called out for sure, we're dealing with both the execution issue and the 3 areas that Carl called out, and then also we're mindful of a dynamic economic environment. So we're -- that is coming into our consideration. But I think it leads with the execution of the 3 main areas. It's consideration when we think about the guidance.","Melissa Gorham - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the PLM products, the commentary was that you're seeing pretty good traction. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on some of the enterprise pilots that you're doing right now? Is it mostly your existing manufacturing customers that you're targeting with that solution or are you seeing growth in the customer base? And if there's any like particular verticals that you're adopting, that would be helpful.","Carl Bass","Yes, sure. Well, I'd say what I'm most pleased about is that it's opening doors in competitive accounts. And that doesn't always mean that their brand-new customers to Autodesk because we do have a pretty broad footprint. But in terms of being their preferred supplier, we -- what I'm most pleased about, we're getting into places where we are not the preferred supplier. And that's very encouraging. In many places, it's being viewed as complementary to their existing PLM system. Some people are considering it as a future placement. But we have pretty extensive trials going on. And what I've been most pleased with is getting to those accounts. There are certainly some in our existing customer base, and I'd say more than particular verticals what we're seeing is just parts of -- we're seeing more similar kinds of problems. So things around new product introduction, things about quality, there are a number of areas in which customers across different segments are trying to solve similar problems and where this solution is particularly well-suited, some of the stuff in the supply chain. So there a handful of different areas that seem to be forming a stronger pattern than a particular vertical versus another.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg, RBC Capital Markets.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Carl, you -- obviously there's been others would come before you that have transitioned from a perpetual to more a faster cloud-based revenue stream. I'm wondering, are there any lessons learned from some of these other prior examples that you guys are implementing that may make the transition smoother?","Carl Bass","Yes, we have definitely studied them all. One's in software, one's outside software. We've looked at all kinds of transitions. Right now, most of what we're doing is -- I mean what we're talking a lot about in developing cloud and mobile applications, the major change that's in front of our customers is going from buying point products to buying suites. And most of that transition came from a perpetual license with upgrades to one with maintenance over the last 6 to 10 years. I think we've managed that fairly successfully. What we hope to do is gradually phase in new kinds of offering that are more annuity-based, more based on termed offerings. But we're not seeing any of that affect our revenues today. But I think it's an issue we'll deal with and we've extensively studied what others have done.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then a question for Mark. Obviously, the guidance for operating margins comes down for fiscal '13. Assuming all of the restructuring that's going on here, can we assume more of a normal year-on-year improvement of maybe closer to 200 basis points for fiscal '14?","Mark  Hawkins","Matt, first of all, we -- it's probably a little early to talk about FY '14 in terms of targets per se. But one of the things I can get to you, the spirit of your question, we are absolutely committed to our long term operating margin goal of 30%-plus. And so we are driving toward that, and you can see that certainly with the first year of our 5-year plan at 480 the second at 260 in this year even with a headroom -- headwind, you can see the approximately 150 basis points. So we're very serious about that. We're still driving toward the 30%-plus, and while whereby I'm not going to comment specifically about '14, I think the spirit of the question I think you get is we're very focused on the operating margin in addition to the growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy with Stifel Nicholas.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Mark, I was just going to follow on Matt's question there in terms of the change you're doing now in accelerating your investment on the cloud side and the mobile side. Does that maybe slow you down a little bit on that margin accretion?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, I think we tried to talk a little bit earlier about trying to give ourselves some room to invest in these critical areas that are absolutely right on point with our long-term strategy as a company. So no, I don't think that these slow us down. I think this whole movement, this whole action is difficult and delicate as it is, is to accelerate toward our strategy. So no, operating margin and growth are our strategic intent. And we plan to continue to make progress.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a follow-up, Carl, you haven't talked too much on the AEC side, particularly about BIM traction this quarter. Obviously, we're seeing ABI slowdown in the U.S. over the last 4 or 5 months now and obviously, you know what's going on in Europe. What are you seeing in the AEC vertical?","Carl Bass","I mean what we saw in results, it was not good. But the more color on it was -- I mean we -- when saw kind of the same thing, if anything, BIM is becoming more of a fabric of how people do construction projects. It's extending more to construction beyond architecture and engineering. What we did this quarter was we extended BIM. We released our BIM 360 product, as well as we did BIM for the field with an acquisition that we discussed. So it was bringing BIM out to the field, which was also good for construction. So I feel -- despite the results in the AEC vertical, I feel good about what's going on in the industry and the adoption of BIM. We're seeing more and more government-mandated BIM projects. So generally speaking, all the trends we've talked about in the last few quarters are continuing in the customer base.","Operator","Your next question as a follow up question from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to circle back to a question earlier. Mark, you mentioned that there's not a silver bullet in terms of the weakness in suite revenue. But it -- just wondering, given the 3 geos that you mentioned, the Brazil, India, Central Europe, are they particularly strong in terms of suite sales, meaning were they adopting suites at a faster rate than others so maybe there was some correlation?","Mark  Hawkins","Well, Sterling, I would say that certainly, if you look at areas like Central Europe, let's just take as an example, is an important area for suites in the achievement of our goals in suites. That would be a good example where there was a direct correlation. That would be one example.","Carl Bass","Yes, and generally speaking, what I'd say is heavily developed industrialized countries are the leading adopters of suites. And generally, the emerging economies are less so. Just a broad brush so in this case, one out of 3. But given the magnitude and importance of Central Europe, it far outweighs the others.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and then one follow-up. Specifically in software, when you make major changes to go to market and sales, it takes 3 quarters for things to settle out. If that's the case here, how far along in that transition are we? And the restructuring again, restructuring that you announced today, did that actually exacerbate things and make things a little bit worse before they get better and kind of restart that 3-quarter block or do you think the nature of the changes are different so maybe you're further along?","Mark  Hawkins","I guess I would say a couple things here, Sterling. One is that part of the restructuring is, as we called out, the primary overlay is to accelerate our cloud mobile development and the headroom for that. The other thing is really the secondary part of that is to really clear the way. It's almost the second aspect of moving through the industry change. And so what we found as we got through this is that there's a little -- some overlaps, some things that we needed to clear up and just kind of streamline as we've gone through this. So I think this actually should help, not hinder, as it relates to that particular point, would be my thoughts. Carl, I don't know\u2026","Carl Bass","Yes, I would totally agree with what you said.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Dan Cummins, ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Thanks. My question was answered.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, as part of the changes you're talking about through the cloud and the like, how are you thinking about the long-term structure of the distribution channel in terms of scale and concentration? What I mean is in your largest distributor Tech Data, which is not of your bar but a distributor, is now over 1\/5 of your revenues, is that something that you think has advantages to grow proportionately over time to give you some distribution scale benefits or how are you thinking about that sort of structure?","Carl Bass","Yes, so we spent a lot of time talking to our partners about it. I think the role of resellers will remain largely unchanged as we move more to online services and offerings. Obviously, certain ones will adapt themselves more quickly and move more easily. But in general, I think the opportunity is the same. I think for the various distributors, it's a different question because the role they play in terms of financing, logistics, et cetera, changes dramatically in an online world. I mean I don't want to get too in the weeds here, but I\u2019ve talked to many of our biggest distributors about plans that they have for their business. And I think all of them are aware of these changes and are making plans about it and probably best to talk to them about how they're going to deal with it. But I don't think there is a changed role for the distributor in order to make it through this transition where I feel like for the resellers, it's a much simpler one. They still are the primary contract contact with the customer, customer still needs integration and training and other services. So I think their primary function remains intact and the opportunity does as well.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. A follow-up about the manufacturing market, I understand that you're issue cropped up largely in July, but now that everyone in the mechanical and manufacturing space has reported, you seem to be the only one that didn't grow either sequentially or year-over-year. And I'm just wondering if you think, in fact, that there's been some change in competitive situation or is there something that you saw in July that they haven't yet seen.","Carl Bass","No, like I said, at this point, I'm putting more emphasis on our own shortcomings than I am on something that somebody else would see who is not going through a similar transition. I guess that was the end of my comment. So what I see, I don't expect them to necessarily see the same things. I think in 90 days we'll talk and we'll say if we've seen it. Generally speaking, we've really outgrown all of our competitors in the manufacturing space over the last half a dozen years. I see no change really there. If anything, I see more opportunities for us. At this point I see this quarter as an anomaly in terms of gaining market share. But kudos to others who made it through some of the same transitions and macroeconomic weakness that we seem to stumble upon.","Operator","Your final question is a follow-up question from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Security.","Brendan Barnicle - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","If you -- if this is already asked, but the Media and Entertainment business didn't really recover this quarter. I think you had expected that it would on the release of the, I think it was the C Series servers that have been delayed. What happened there?","Carl Bass","Well, I think a number of things. I'll -- let me give you a few points and Mark has a few things. One, is one of our big markets for M&E is India. That was a weak area. So that definitely affected it. We also had some products that didn't ship in this quarter, which also affected it that we'll see towards the end of the year.","Mark  Hawkins","Yes, I -- that's exactly what I would add is I think that's a combination of product and then also the touch points of these particular geos that added to the issue. It was more in the hardware side. It was the biggest impact, by the way, between the 2, between that and the animation.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Dave Gennarelli for any closing remarks.","David Gennarelli","Well, that concludes our call this afternoon.

Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal year 2018. On the line is Andrew Anagnost, CEO and Scott Herren, our CFO.","Today\u2019s conference call is being broadcast live via webcast. In addition, a replay of the call will be available at autodesk.com\/investor. As noted on our press release, we have published our prepared remarks on the website in advance of this call. Those remarks are intended to serve in place of extended formal comments and we will not repeat them on this call.","During the course of this conference call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding future events and the anticipated future performance of the company such as our guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal \u201818, our long-term financial model guidance, the factors we use to estimate our guidance including currency headwinds, our maintenance to subscription transition, our customer value, cost structure, our market opportunities and strategies and trends for various products, geographies and industries.","We caution you that such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and that actual events or results could differ materially. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017, our Form 10-Q for the periods ended April 30, 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, including the Form 8-K filed with today\u2019s press release and prepared remarks.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Dave. Our strong Q2 results are a continuation of the broad-based strength across all subscription plans and types and geographies that we experienced last quarter. As we demonstrated over the past several quarters, we are executing well and making real progress on our two major initiatives, growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to subscription and expanding our market opportunity with increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. These consistent results increased our confidence in the model transition and our ability to achieve our goals.","There are several areas to highlight in Q2, including the fact that total ARR grew 23% at constant currency that we added 153,000 total subscriptions. The recurring revenue has increased to 91% of total revenue that we have overachieved on revenue and we have coupled that with strong spend control, which has led to better than expected EPS performance. In addition, the maintenance to subscription program, what I will refer to later as M2S, is off to a great start.","Now, let\u2019s take a closer look at our Q2 performance. The trends we are seeing in annualized recurring revenue are clear signals that the transition is working. Subscription plan ARR nearly doubled on a constant currency basis driven by the strong uptake of all of our subscription plan offerings. Subscription plan ARR now represents 43% of total ARR, and we still anticipate it will become the majority component by the end of this fiscal year. I would also like to share with you another piece of data that really provides us with confidence in our ability to grow ARR going forward. If we isolate ARR growth rates for AutoCAD LT and our animation products, which are further along into the transition and the rest of the products, we saw total ARR growth in the mid-30% range for these products.","A year ago, the growth rates for these products were similar to those we are reporting for our overall business. The same effect can be seen in our reported revenue for these products and it\u2019s a great leading indicator as we continue to move to the transition. We added 270,000 subscription plan subs in Q2, led by continued strong adoption of product subscription. 63,000 of these subscriptions were generated from our maintenance to subscription or M2S program. Even when normalizing for M2S, total product subscriptions more than doubled year-over-year with triple digit growth in each major geography including emerging countries.","New customers continue to makeup a meaningful portion of product subscription additions and represented close to 30% of the mix for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growth and emerging, converting unlicensed users, and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Some of you noticed that we started out Q3 \u2013 our Q3 promotion targeting legacy users a couple of weeks early. Now this led to some conspiracy theories about our Q2 performance. You should know that the timing of these global promotions is set months in advance. Our rationale for starting early was the result of our experience from Q3 of last year. Starting the promo a couple weeks early allow us for greater absorption of our communications to our partners and customers, which tends to take longer in the summer months due to vacations. The mission was to get the promo detailed out to the channel rather than driving subs in Q2. And as expected, an immaterial number of subs, about 2,000 were generated from this promo in Q2, but we positioned the promo for success here in Q3.","Subscription plan subs also had strong contribution from our new enterprise customers via enterprise business agreements or EBAs. As expected, our net EBA sub adds were not nearly as much as the seasonal strong Q1. EBAs with our large enterprise customers have been a successful component of our transition leading to both increased subscriptions and account value, while providing increased flexibility for our customers. This increased flexibility has led many of our EBA customers to increase their usage as they adjust to the new licensing system. This is a win-win situation, but it does create a short-term drag on ARPS. For example, if we isolate just the population of EBA customers from June 2016, the monthly average usage for these accounts increased 10% in the last year. However, we don\u2019t see a corresponding revenue increase until the customer does a true-up or uplift upon renewal. This year, we have the opportunity to renew the first wave of token flex EBA contracts that we signed 3 years ago. Its early days so far, but we are seeing on average that contract size is increasing by over 30%. In Q2, we renewed two very large EBA deals worth over $10 million each. In one of these deals with a European based global engineering consulting firm, the renewal contract value was 150% greater than the original value. This company\u2019s engineers are spending roughly 5 million hours a year using Autodesk products and the EBA contract gives them access to our entire product portfolio.","The third component of our subscription plan subs is our cloud products. This is the TAM expansion part of our transition and we are extending our leadership in the cloud. Total subscriptions grew by 200% and continue to be driven by BIM 360, our construction management and collaboration tool followed by Fusion our cloud play based design and manufacturing tool. To give you more insight, I want to spend a little more time on the massive construction opportunity which is where our cloud based BIM 360 has gained an early leadership position. We are utilizing the cloud to allow our customers to take their BIM models all the way into the field giving building owners and general contractors a digital platform for collaboration, coordination, and visibility. This is a really big deal because it\u2019s something that has been sorely lacking in the past. And when it comes to the world of building, we have a powerful brand and a powerful reputation. We are making significant penetration with the biggest general contractors in the world and with building owners and doing this by driving the value of the building information model into their project ecosystem. The result is we are both expanding BIM 360 deals after successful initial implementations and we are signing new deals with companies and organizations that we have never worked with previously.","Building owners are starting to mandate BIM 360 to gain competitive advantage in project efficiency. One Q2 deal was an international airport that is investing in thousands of BIM 360 subscriptions as part of a multibillion dollar renovation project. Their goal is to use BIM on all suitable projects to inform and enhance future facilities management. They even wrote BIM 360 into the process for all future development projects at the airport. Another great example is with the general contractor that influenced a large state university and a large municipality to write BIM 360 requirements into their specifications and permitting process. This is the kind of success that builds on itself over time. Now, partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plan subs.","As we have said in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions and the rate of decline will vary on the number of maintenance plan subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate and pace of the M2S program. A little more than half of the decline in maintenance subs was a result of fast start to the M2S program. In fact, nearly a quarter of all maintenance renewal opportunities migrated to subscription. Of those, that migrated nearly 10% upgraded from an individual product to higher value industry collections. M2S is yielding some early data that is very encouraging and very interesting. I would like to share a few other points with you. Specifically, some customers are doing partial conversions of their maintenance fees, but if you look at it overall, the participating accounts are growing their total subscriptions and growing their spend with Autodesk.","In other words, account that participate in M2S are purchasing net new product in cloud subs and we are seeing this behavior across all geographies. Keep in mind that it reflects only 6 weeks worth of data, but these early figures are better than expected and bode well for the next few quarters of execution. As I said, we would like these maintenance customers to move sooner rather than later as product subscriptions provide the greatest value and increased flexibility, supports and access to our cloud products. Moving to a single model makes the most sense and will immensely simplify our business and how our customers transact with Autodesk.","Now, let\u2019s talk a little bit about ARPS. For the third consecutive quarter, we experienced a small sequential increase in total ARPS. It\u2019s worth repeating that there are many things that will influence the short-term performance of ARPS, including product mix, geo mix and timing. Another example is that the M2S program is having a near-term impact on ARPS. M2S is having a positive impact on maintenance due to the price increase for those that stayed on maintenance and a negative impact on subscription plan ARPS due to the discount offered for conversion. Product subscription ARPS grew year-over-year, but if we normalized for the effect of M2S, it would have grown about 10% year-over-year and had its third consecutive quarter of sequential growth. As expected, subscription plan ARPS is being negatively impacted in the near-term by cloud subs as well as the increased usage in EBA accounts.","I spoke about these influences at Investor Day last year, so it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the more successful we are with cloud products and increased usage with our EBAs, the more it will be a near-term drag on ARPS. Of course, the flipside of faster than expected M2S conversion is that the more people that take the offer here in FY \u201818 the smaller the price increases we will realize in FY \u201819. We will moderate that impact by continuing to focus on the upsell to collection. Having said all that, we remain confident that overall ARPS will be positively influenced going forward by less discounting and promotions to our legacy users, the price increase for maintenance customers and the migration to higher value products. We still expect to see ARPS inflect up by the end of the year.","Now, I will turn it over to Scott for a few more details on the financials.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. Driving more users to subscription aligns with another one of the transition-related initiatives, which is to drive more direct business. Total direct revenue for the second quarter was 29% of total revenue, that\u2019s up from 25% in Q2 last year and just 20% 2 years ago. We continue to generate strong growth in the volume of business we are doing with our large enterprise customers and we are experiencing exceptional growth with our e-store. Over 30% of our North American product subscriptions have been generated through our e-store. We expect to continue to meaningfully grow both our direct enterprise and our e-store business as we go forward.","We are pleased by the broad-based strength we are experiencing from a geographic and product family perspective. Each major geography, including emerging markets reported sequential revenue growth. And for the second consecutive quarter, we experienced a marked improvement in our performance in Japan, an encouraging sign as we have made some changes there. We also experienced sequential revenue growth in each product family.","Moving to spend management, we have been able to execute and drive results while firmly controlling our spend growth. Non-GAAP spend increased by 1% in Q2 as expected. We remain committed to keeping spend flat this year and next year although we are seeing an increased FX headwind to our expenses. We are achieving this through divestments and reallocation of those dollars to initiatives that drive our transition.","Looking at the balance sheet, reported deferred revenue grew 17% against the tough compare last year when we had the end-of-sale event for the last perpetual licenses of suites. We also stopped selling multiyear maintenance renewals earlier this year in conjunction with the M2S program, which adds to the headwind. Unbilled deferred revenue increased by $33 million sequentially, which would have added another 2 percentage points of growth to deferred revenue. Total unbilled deferred revenue now stands at $63 million and we expect it to continue to grow meaningfully as we move more of our enterprise customers to annual billing terms.","I will also note that during the second quarter, we issued $500 million in 10-year notes taking advantage of the current low interest rate environment and we have redeemed $400 million of debt that was due to mature in December. That\u2019s a good lead in to our capital allocation strategy. We repurchased 1.2 million shares in Q2 for a total of $119 million. That averages out to $102.71 per share. During the quarter, we rebalanced our buying strategy by putting more weight on opportunistic versus systematic buying and we will continue to make adjustments to this program as we go forward recognizing our ongoing commitment to share buybacks.","Turning to our outlook, our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view over the past several quarters, with most of the mature markets relatively well and little change in emerging markets. As we look at our outlook for Q3 and the second half of the year, we expect seasonal patterns generally consistent with the last 2 years. As I mentioned, we have made some targeted divestments that allowed us to reallocate that money, but it also created a slight headwind to reported revenue, both of which are incorporated in our annual guidance.","Q3 will be the first quarter, where the year-over-year revenue comparisons or apples-to-apples compared back to our first quarter of subscription-only sales, but remember that our Q3 fiscal \u201817 results included $38 million of licensed backlog that rolled over from the end-of-sale of suites perpetual licenses in Q2 \u201817. Normalizing for that, the midpoint of our Q3 revenue guidance range represents year-on-year growth of 13% as reported revenues now begin to inflect upward. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are increasing the midpoint of our guidance range for revenue and we increased the range for net subscription adds for the fiscal year. ","Overall, our strong first half results increased our confidence that the transition is working for our customers and our partners. It also sets us up for success for the rest of the year and reinforces our conviction on our fiscal \u201820 targets. We have executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on the success as we progress through the rest of fiscal \u201818 and work toward our fiscal \u201820 goals and beyond.","Before we open it up for questions, I am going to turn the call back over to Andrew for a few closing comments.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Scott. Obviously, one big change this past quarter was that I was appointed CEO. I am humbled by the Board\u2019s decision and I want to thank my friend and longtime associate, Amar Hanspal for all his work and dedication to Autodesk over the past 20 years. Secondly, I want to assure you that we remain fully committed to the FY \u201820 goals around ARR, subs and cash flow that we put forth 2 years ago. Finally, while the near-term and long-term goals remain clear, I thought I\u2019d share with you my focus areas for driving success in achieving these goals.","First, we are hyper focused on enhancing the subscriber experience and delivering more value to our customers. It has to be frictionless for our customers to manage their subscription with Autodesk and it has to be obvious to them, what is driving value from subscription. Second, we are going to continue investing in our own digital infrastructure and creating opportunities for our customers to transact and engage directly with us. We have made nice progress in this area over the past couple of years and I want to further enhance and accelerate these advancements. Third, I am absolutely committed to winning the construction space and winning in the new world of digital manufacturing. The opportunity is enormous for Autodesk and our customers. We have done well to establish an early leadership position and we are not going to slowdown. I hope that gives you a better idea of how I am approaching my new job. The next year of Autodesk will not be defined by simply product or business innovation, but in their combination. We must excel at both, all in the service of our customers. I couldn\u2019t be more excited about the opportunity to leave such a great company and I look forward to reporting on our progress as we go forward.","Operator, we would now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening Andrew and Scott. Two questions, one to start longer term, Andrew how reasonable is it to expect or when would you expect that your direct business would become the majority of the business and\/or that the e-store would become the majority of the direct, at any point so that of course, you are having the requisite back office and infrastructure which you just alluded to a moment ago. And then secondly, you talked in your prepared remarks around large customer, EBA customer usage, and mix issues, could you address that more broadly in terms of wider customer base in terms what you are seeing so far in terms of usage of products and specifically your confidence that in fact the mix will go more and more towards collection from standalone than we might have seen to-date?","Andrew Anagnost","Alright, Jay, so first thank you. So let me address the first question and then I am going to ask for clarification on the second one. So with regard to the first question, I am not going to give you a timeframe, but I will kind of down [ph] the problem a little bit more for you. In terms of a steady state for us, it\u2019s probably more like a 50-50 split between our direct efforts and our partner efforts, and we think that\u2019s the right steady state for us not only from serving our customers well, but also basically from the structure of the business in terms of what the right kind of profitability mix is. And when you look at that moving forward, the percent of the business that actually comes from direct high touch, the major accounts subs probably won\u2019t change that much over time. All of that growth is going to come from the digital direct piece. So actually roughly speaking, digital direct and physical direct will split that 50% another 50-50. So you could kind of see a 25-25-50 type model for our business moving forward. Timeframe wise, I don\u2019t want to give a timeframe for that, but it\u2019s definitely going to be over a relatively narrow time horizon. Now, your second question, I just want to make sure I understood you were asking, what is the mix of usage within our EBA accounts or just clarify your question a little bit for me, so I make sure I answer the right question.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Sure. So, you have in the past been able track usage of the suites for example, because they were instrumented for that, and I imagine you should be able to do the same now under subscription for all products, standalone and collections. The question is really two-fold, one how confident are you that customers are in fact going to mix up towards more collections from standalone in terms of initial licenses, and then once they have a collection that the usage of enough products will be there for them to want to continue renewing the subscription on a collection that there is enough indispensable products, let\u2019s say within the collections that basically your ARPS it must go higher over time?","Andrew Anagnost","Alright, great. So thank you for clarification. I always want to make sure I am answering the right question for you Jay. So first off, let\u2019s \u2013 let me kind of break the question up into some pieces. Right now, the run rate for collections is already up to what our historical suites run rate is. So we are already back to where we were with suites in terms of collection up-tick. The other little piece of information I want to give you, and it\u2019s kind of some additional color on the M2S program. If you heard the earlier comments, we said that 10% of the customers moving from maintenance to subscription were up-selling the collection. That\u2019s 10% of the total customer is moving. If you look at those who are actually eligible when you subtract out people that are by default going from suites to collections or people that actually don\u2019t have the option to move from a standalone to collection, it\u2019s almost 25%. So what you are seeing is not only a run rate that\u2019s up to our historical suites level, but in acceleration in the M2S migration that\u2019s looking really solid in terms of getting people to collection. So it\u2019s looking good right now Jay, and it\u2019s heading directionally in the right direction. So that\u2019s kind of the current state. Now to your next question about how confident are we with the product usage within a collection and the things associated with that. So there is a couple \u2013 I will answer the question by bounding it in two ways. One, historically with suites, we have known that it only takes two or more products of usage for people that really just continue with the value proposition of the suites. We see no reason at all why that should change in the collection paradigm. So we expect to see the exact same behavior for the people that have chosen to move to collection. The thing that actually gives us even more confidence is the fact that unlike suites, we\u2019ve blended more of the cloud into the collections. So there is actually more extension from the collection into other types of capability that provide value than there was in the suites, that\u2019s one. The other thing that bounds it is you are looking at our experience with EBAs and what happens when we provide more portfolio access. It just inevitably drifts over time to broader product usage. We see on average quite significant increases in the breadth of products that are being used. So there is nothing right now that indicates that we are going to see any kind of different behavior than what we have seen in the past.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saket Kalia with Barclays.","Saket Kalia","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you hear me okay?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, we can Saket.","Saket Kalia","Okay, great. Well, first off congrats Andrew on the permanent appointment. First for either of you, could you maybe describe the mechanics of the M2S impact on ARPS this quarter, you said in the prepared remarks that subscription ARPS would have been I think about $509, so is this the impact of the discounts to convert, I remember kind of hearing that the discount would be the sweetest [ph] now and decline over time, so is that what we are seeing or did you maybe see a different mix of conversions perhaps than you were originally expecting?","Scott Herren","Saket, we saw all the above. We did see as people converted from maintenance to subscription. You remember the attraction was they get a significantly discounted product subscription if they turn in their perpetual license that they have. So an existing maintenance customer that converted was able to buy that product subscription at a significant discount that obviously pulls down the ARPS on product subs. The faster we can make that transition move, the faster we can move people off of maintenance and over to product subscription, of course faster the transition works and the better off we all are. But it does have a short-term effect on ARPS. If you just isolated product subscriptions for a minute and said let\u2019s net the M2S impact out of it, that\u2019s the statistic that we gave in the opening commentary. Product subscriptions by itself without M2S the ARPS increased 10% year-on-year and it was the third consecutive quarter of product subscription ARPS growth. So part of what you are saying is just the M2S effect that\u2019s kind of a bucket shift that people moving from maintenance mid-quarter up into subscription, all 63,000 subs moved, but only a fraction of the ARR was accumulated in the product subscriptions bucket. We also did see mix and we always see mix a little bit in Q2. So our historical trend is that ARPS comes down a bit Q1 to Q2 because both cloud and we talked about the success we have success with cloud 200% growth in our cloud substantial. We know cloud subs have the lowest ARPS that has weighted averaging effect on the overall subscription plan ARPS. The second is enterprise where we don\u2019t get a lot of new enterprise sales during the quarter, but we continue to drive usage. So we continue to drive net mostly active users into the denominator of that ARPS equation. So as we accumulate more users into the denominator and don\u2019t move the numerator that has a negative effect on the ARPS for enterprise sub. So we actually saw both. M2S had an impact on product subs and mix had an impact on the overall subscription plan sub ARPS.","Saket Kalia","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s really helpful. And for my follow-up maybe for you Andrew, I believe you said you are converting about one in four maintenance subs up for renewal, is there a change in the portion of the remaining 75% that\u2019s churning off versus let\u2019s say accepting the price increase if you will?","AndrewAnagnost","Saket, when we first constructed this program, remember the whole thing was to balance churn associated with price increases. We always knew there would be some incremental churn resulting from increasing prices. It\u2019s very modest. So, what we are seeing is well within the bands of what we expected and yes, actually in that 75%, you do see a little bit of extra turn as a result of the price increase. But again, that\u2019s why we constructed the program the way we did to make sure that we actually minimize the churn. But right now, it\u2019s well within the bands we expected.","Scott Herren","Yes. And Saket, you have got the data to do the math, right. We told you what the maintenance plan subs are and what the sub ads were. So, it\u2019s minus 117,000 maintenance sub adds for the quarter and 63,000 of those left maintenance and dropped into converting over to product subscription. So, you can see what the remainder is and divide that by the base that would have come up for renewal during the quarter. So, it\u2019s right in line with expectations.","Saket Kalia","Yes.","Andrew Anagnost","Which kind of reinforces the point is pay attention to the net adds. The net adds tell the real story.","Saket Kalia","Understood. Thanks very much.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Saket.","Operator","Your next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird.","Rob Oliver","Yes, thank you for taking my questions. Just on that 25% number, how did that align with sort of your internal expectations? And then what sort of feedback have you gotten kind of early on from the channel as to what makes people kind of jump, but I know Andrew you talked about your primary goal here as you know kind of ease of use in the product and getting people to understand the implicit value of subscription. So, can you talk a little about some of the feedbacks you are getting? And then I just had a very quick follow-up. Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","So, first off, I want to make sure I reiterate exactly what that number is. So, we are all on the same page. Remember in the prepared remarks, we said about 10% of the total people moving from maintenance to subscription were choosing to migrate. As a subset of that, that we are actually eligible to migrate it all. So, of the subset that we are already on suites that default went to collections, of that subset almost 25% are moving. That is above what our original expectations were with that base. So, this is a good result. We view it positively. Now, let\u2019s be clear though, half a quarter does not a trend make, but it\u2019s certainly a gratifying result to see. Right now, in terms of the value proposition the customers are buying on, I suspect the majority of the conversations are hey, if I get on the collection now, wow, this is the best place I will ever get for a collection. I should probably get on that boat right now. And some customers are quite frankly in a wait-and-see mode, how is Autodesk going to increase the value of the subscription offering, where are they working on we have been very transparent with some of our plans. But I honestly think right now they are just looking at a strategic choice and saying, I should go with the collection right now, because that\u2019s just \u2013 this is the best price I\u2019ll ever get.","Rob Oliver","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then any update you guys to the thoughts around piracy that you gave on last year\u2019s Analyst Day, I think you said 1.3 million actives as you mined through the users and any thought on an update to that number or any trends? Thank you very much.","Andrew Anagnost","So, first off, the numbers holding the trends, the trends aren\u2019t changing. We are absolutely increasing our effectiveness in targeting that piracy base. I think I have told you guys previously in the past this year, it\u2019s all about increasing the quality of the leads that go into the existing machinery for piracy. Next year, it\u2019s all about automating our communication with the customers that are actually using pirated software and supplementing the existing resources that are focused on piracy, but no change in the trends. We are piloting the automation that\u2019s going to communicate to customers directly in the product with regards to their usage of pirated applications. That will be rolled out sometime next year. So, we are continuing to head in the right direction there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","Thank you, guys for taking the question and very nice quarter. Two questions. One relating to maintenance ARPS sort of taking the other side of the equation, you guys actually saw a nice increase there. Is that related primarily or solely to sort of the price increases that come, what if they don\u2019t take the test part of the M2S subscription or are there kind of mix shifts going on there that perhaps higher priced guys tend to stay on maintenance as other guys are attriting? And is that trend line of increasing ARPS and maintenance, is that something that we should be looking to continue in our model?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Keith, it\u2019s the flipside of what I was talking about earlier to Saket. So, as people move from maintenance to subscription, let\u2019s say they move on July 1 which is the beginning of the third month of the quarter for us, so upon maintenance for two months, I converted on July 1 in the third month. The way that that gets recorded is I have got two months of maintenance revenue and one month of product subscription revenue, right. But the entire sub dropped down to the product subscription level. So the impact \u2013 there is actually impact in both places. There is, if you will a tail of revenue left behind in maintenance that has no sub attached to it that drives up the maintenance ARPS. And then there is a partial quarter of revenue showing up in the product subscription side, so you get this understated ARPS. So the increase that you see in maintenance, the biggest driver of that is the flipside of what we talked about as the headwind on subscription plan. There are a couple of other changes, pricing maintenance agreements have gone up to 5% in price and there are some mix shifts by products and by geo, but the biggest driver is just the compounding effect of maintenance to subscription. So as we \u2013 we will be in this mode. We will be in this maintenance to subscription mode now for the next several quarters, certainly through fiscal \u201819 and into fiscal \u201820. And I think that it probably it will \u2013 this bucket shifting will continue to make it difficult to look at products of maintenance sub-ARPS versus subscription plan APRS. And probably the better way to gauge our overall progress on ARPS is going to be look at the total ARPS. That will net up the effect of this tail of revenue left behind in a partial quarter where they landed.","Keith Weiss","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And if I could just one about OpEx, you guys went through several quarters of basically total expense declined this quarter, you saw some slight growth, is that an indication that sort of the expense reduction programs will kind of run its course and from here it\u2019s more about holding steady, was there more room to run in terms of taking actual expense out of the equation here?","Scott Herren","Yes. Keith, we have continued to focus on that. Now, we are flat from \u201816 to \u201817, flat again this year, flat again next year. Obviously, each year we give a \u2013 basically a merit increase in salaries. So we are continually looking at where we are spending money and using the portfolio management approach to sharpen the things that we have to continue to focus on to be able to live within a flat spend envelope and still drive the transition and drive the most important things. So I talked a little bit when we gave guidance for the year and you will see a little bit of it in the prepared remarks. We had a couple of divestments. Those are \u2013 those were expected through the year, but that\u2019s an example of the kind of things we are doing as we manage the portfolio to reduce spend in some areas so that we can afford to continue to increase in other areas and still stay flat in aggregate.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. And Keith one of the questions we always get on this, it\u2019s, how are you able to continue the execution you are doing when you are looking in this expense control environment. This is really all about picking the most important things to work on. Obviously, we are doing well in our net adds, so we are focusing a lot on that. And by the way another area where we focused on is BIM 360 in the construction space, it\u2019s going so well that we actually shifted money during an expense constrained environment to accelerate future development in that space. So it\u2019s just a matter of picking your priorities and over time you will expect us \u2013 continue to expect to see us to divest from things that just simply aren\u2019t aligned with where we need to focus over the next few years.","Keith Weiss","Helpful guys. Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks Keith.","Operator","Your next question is from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.","Michael Barrett","Hey, this is actually Michael Barrett on for Phil. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Just want to circle back to the maintenance plan decline, obviously 63,000 of those 117,000 directly moved over from the maintenance subscription plan, did the rest \u2013 are the rest of those all just sharing off the platform completely, was there any shelfware in there, are there customers who had moved over prior to the promotion that just simultaneously had a maintenance plan and the subscription plan or should we really think of that as all just turning out of the base?","Scott Herren","Yes. Michael I will start and Andrew if you want to add color you can. It\u2019s 117,000 minus 63,000, 54,000 churn on 1.8 million sub base. Not all 1.8 million came up for renewal during the quarter, but that\u2019s a pretty normal churn rate for our maintenance plan. So we really saw nothing extraordinary even in the face of an announced 5% price increase. We really saw nothing extraordinary in the churn rate within maintenance. So there is nothing \u2013 there is no other moving parts under the covers if that\u2019s the question you are trying to get at.","Michael Barrett","Great. Yes, thanks. That was what I was trying to clarify. And then just on the move to collections what sort of impact to subs if any have you seen from that move? I know, you have called out, at your, I believe your Analyst Day in the past if you have a customer who has two subscriptions per subscriber and they move to a collection that\u2019s minus one subscription even though it\u2019s ARR accretive, has there been any impact on total subs or is it too early to tell at this point?","Andrew Anagnost","Well, we have lots of data from the suites days that the effect is consolidation effect kind of range from 2% to 5%. If you look at what\u2019s going on with the maintenance to subscription moves and some of the term we are seeing as people move from maintenance subscription, it\u2019s right in line with those exact same numbers. We see consolidation, but it\u2019s incredibly modest. You have to remember, people need to use the software. They need the software for themselves individually. So, when you consolidate products, yes, you do see some modest consolidation. It\u2019s right in line with the kind of consolidation we saw with suites.","Michael Barrett","Great, thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the results. I believe you guys implemented a file format change at the end of March. Can you talk about the mechanics of this and if any impact on quarterly sub adds? And I guess secondarily, you have done these in the past can you sort of remind us historically that the impact of something like this converting non-maintenance paying active users?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So, first off, just to give you context, every 3 to 5 years, we actually do one of these file format changes, because what happens is we start to accumulate technical debt inside the file format and we have to do these things that prevent bloat. So, yes, we did one of those in this round. What you generally see is an initial decline in the number of active legacy seats, the non-subscriber seats, we saw that, but then it takes a year or two to diffuse through the entire ecosystem. So, what you get is an initial chunk associated with the release of the product, where legacy users shift up to the new product. And then over time, as people are integrating with the ecosystem, you see more and more attrition out of this non-subscriber base. So, we expect to see the exact same pattern. It\u2019s happened historically over and over again. So, we are right on track with that right now.","Matt Hedberg","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then you have commented in the past you, coming once these 3-year M2S conversions come up, there is going to be a price increase that\u2019s sort of I think if it\u2019s well-documented, at least you have talked about it. Is this a once \u2013 like a one renewal cycle trend to kind of get back to sort of normal discount rates or might this be a couple of cycles. I was sort of trying to give out the magnitude of that price increase?","Andrew Anagnost","You want to take this?","Scott Herren","Yes. Matt, we have also tried to articulate that. When we get to the end of the 3-year period, so someone coverts from being a maintenance subscriber to a product subscription, they give up their perpetual license. They get this reduced price for product subscription. And without having to pay for all 3 years upfront, they are grandfathered at that price for 3 years. At the end of that \u2013 and that\u2019s for people who convert this year and next year fiscal \u201818 and \u201819. At the end of that 3 years, they revert to what we have been calling the terminal price, which is the price of conversion compounded over 3%, 5% increase, so in effect the 16% price increase from where we started the entire process. So, they will snap up to that level. So, they took a 5% increase. If they convert this year, that\u2019s roughly a 10% increase at the end of their 3-year grandfathering. And then it\u2019s going to take time for that pool. So that will create a pool of product subscribers that are at significantly lower price than a new product subscription and it\u2019s going to take time to migrate that pool up to the price of a net new product subscription. That\u2019s not going to happen in 1 year or 2 years and that would be too big a step.","Matt Hedberg","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","MarkGrant","Hi, this is Mark Grant on for Heather. Thanks for taking the question. Saw the disclosures around the M2S program with the subscription plan ARR and the net subs coming from that program. One, are those metrics that you plan to disclose on an ongoing basis? And then just second on maintenance renewals realizing that, that M2S program might create some noise in the seasonality of renewals this year, can you give us a sense of the split of contracts coming up for renewal between the fiscal 3Q and fiscal 4Q? Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. Mark, to your first question, we will continue to provide that visibility. I think because it\u2019s fairly disruptive between the two big pools of subscription plan and maintenance plant, we will continue to provide the same metrics that we gave this quarter. So, the impact on where they have landed in product subscription in terms of how much accumulated there and the number of subscriptions that moved. I still think it\u2019s going to be difficult for you to sort out at a more granular level. What\u2019s happening inside, it\u2019s because those transitions take place during the quarter. And so, if you go back to example I talked about earlier and moving to beginning of the third quarter, there is a tale of revenue left behind on the maintenance side that will not move over. And so it\u2019s \u2013 I would encourage you to try model ARPS if that\u2019s important to you, I\u2019d encourage you to try to model at the total level. In terms of the number of maintenance agreements that come due in the second half of the year, we haven\u2019t given that kind of seasonality metric historically, but what you see is as with most enterprise software companies, we do see a bigger second half than we do in the first half. And so you can expect to see it be slightly more opportunities for conversion in the second half year than what we would have had in the first half.","MarkGrant","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I apologize if you covered this in the prepared remarks, I missed it, but of the users that chose to make the move over to subscription from maintenance. Can you give us a sense of what products were most popular that actually chose that switch?","Andrew Anagnost","Well, so first off, very good on a suite, it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer for you to do this. So, we saw lot of people on suites making the move to subscription and taking up the offer pretty quickly. And then it kind of follows from there to products like AutoCAD naturally is the next biggest product up there. So, it\u2019s pretty straightforward.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then Scott on to a different area on the FX side, I know you guys your hedging program, but just want to make sure how with the recent moves that we have seen included with your hedging program. Is that impacting the outlook here for the back half?","Scott Herren","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. The interesting part about FX and particularly the subscription model where a lot of the revenue that we report in a given quarter was actually sold in the prior quarter right. So, as we opened the quarter, we have got a very high percentage of the reported revenues for Q3 sitting on the balance sheet at exchange rates that are commensurate with when those were actually sold. So, there is a lag effect in revenue, really independent of the hedging. Whenever it\u2019s sold, we have the hedge benefit, but then it goes in deferred. So, the benefit of the weaker dollar will take a lot longer to show up in revenue simply because a lot of reported revenue is coming off the balance sheet before the FX rates change. We will see it much more immediately on the expense side. We hedged the net exposure, but we will see the impact FX had much more immediately on the spend both COGS and OpEx side.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, thank you very much. Good afternoon, guys. So the cloud subscription growth again was very impressive and it sounds like you are really starting to see BIM 360 construction and related activity ramp up as well. On the other hand, I believe the comps on cloud subs make it a little tougher later this fiscal year given the acceleration that we saw in that year ago period? So I was just kind of curious how we should generally think about cloud subs growth over the balance of the year?","Andrew Anagnost","You are right in BIM 360 we are seeing a really good acceleration of cloud growth. We see nothing that would indicate that, that\u2019s going to slowdown as we head throughout the year. And the only thing above is to highlight anything as you grow the base larger, the base you have to renew gets larger as well. So, we will be watching that very closely, but the momentum \u2013 there is really nothing out there right now that would slow the momentum, particularly on BIM 360.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, perfect. Thanks, Andrew. And then with respect to EBAs, I know Q2 obviously is not a seasonally strong quarter for you there that your unbilled deferreds were up significantly again on a sequential basis. How is the EBA uptake tracking relative to your expectations both in terms of numbers of customers signing on as well as the degree of ARR spending increases? Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Gregg. The EBAs are tracking right in line. EBAs are always heavily weighted into the second half of the year. And so if you go all the way back to our Investor Day last year when I made sure everyone understood that we were going to move many of our EBAs from billed upfront to annual I said I thought the impact on deferred revenue by the end of the year would be $300 million or more of unbilled deferred that would accrue and that\u2019s still our expectation on the unbilled deferred by year end. So expect to see the unbilled deferred grow more heavily in the second half of the year, as we sign more of those EBAs. But in general the EBA business is tracking right in line with our expectation.","Gregg Moskowitz","That\u2019s great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Wong from Citigroup.","Ken Wong","Hey guys, when looking at your sub guide, I guess the midpoint is around 650 and you guys are already kind of halfway there and correct if I am wrong but you are saying the second half you add a lot more, can you help us understand some of the dynamics that are going into your guidance and thinking for the second half?","Scott Herren","Yes. Ken, we shifted the entire range up by 25,000, so prior guide on subs was 600 to 650. We shifted it up to 625 to 675. And a lot of that\u2019s based on the strength that we have seen in the first half of the year. And we have touched a little bit on this in the opening commentary. It was a very strong first half. Our net sub adds coming from the enterprise business outpaced our expectations in Q1. The legacy promo continued to be strong and cloud in the quarter we have disclosed our cloud sub adds grew 200% year-over-year as Andrew said. So we had a very strong sub add in the first half of the year. Second half of the year is right in line with our expectations. So it\u2019s not a \u2013 there is nothing \u2013 there is no difference than what we expected in the second half built into that guidance. What you see in the guidance range shifting up is the strength of first half.","Ken Wong","Got it. And then maybe in term s of just renewal rates, I know in the past few quarters it\u2019s kind of across the different subscription lines maintenance product, etcetera, you guys have seen always kind of close to peak, if not peak, how are those tracking in Q2 here?","Andrew Anagnost","Our renewal rates are tracking exactly the place the way we were expecting to track right now. So we are right in line with everything \u2013 all of our expectations.","Scott Herren","And Ken the place to look to get a feel for that is again look at the net sub adds. And we have given you the visibility of maintenance and you can get a real sense of the \u2013 what the renewal rates look like there, because we told you how much of the 117,000 that went away were conversions over the product substantial. You can do the same math on subscription plan and look at what the net adds are there and that gives you a sense of not just what the volume is or it\u2019s the combination of what the new volume is and what the renewal rates are. And so and back to your earlier question at the midpoint of our guidance by the way 625 to 675, so the midpoint is 650, that\u2019s 21% growth year-on-year. So it\u2019s right in line with our expectations.","Ken Wong","Got it, great. Thanks a lot guys. Good quarter.","Scott Herren","Thanks Ken. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Talanian with Evercore ISI.","Ken Talanian","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. So you mentioned earlier that you had reinforced conviction in the fiscal \u201820 targets, given the better than expected results, do you think it\u2019s reasonable to assume there is upside to those targets?","Scott Herren","Yes. Ken, I will start and I see Andrew smiling. I know he can\u2019t wait to add some color to this. One of the things that we have done \u2013 those targets of course we put up a little more than a year ago at this point. And the goal in setting that out was not to say this is guidance that we are going to update it every quarter, it was to say this is where we see ourselves headed as we work through this transition. One of the things we spend a lot of time on back in December at our last Investor Day was talking about the various steps we had taken, the leverage we have pulled to in effect de-risk that set of targets and to provide some buffer between where we think we are going to land and what those targets are. And we continue to do that. We continue to pull those levers and continue to drive for those targets. I don\u2019t think it would be wise for us to try to continually update what that number looks like.","Andrew Anagnost","It\u2019s good to see you asking questions like this. I mean I think right now all of us being on the same page that it\u2019s looking more and more likely that we are heading in exactly the right direction for our FY \u201820 targets, I think it\u2019s a good place to be. There is no reason for us to revise those targets right now.","Ken Talanian","Okay. And I guess just more specific question, can you talk about the mix of products that you are seeing transact through the e-store?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. When you look at the e-store, the e-store really dominated the low end of our offerings. We actually did you see almost every type of product type that we sell going through the e-store. But if you look at what the majority is, a lot of it\u2019s going to be LT and then the next largest chunk is going to be AutoCAD. And that\u2019s basically the majority of the e-store traffic that\u2019s totally what you would expect from e-commerce transactions, the lower end of our value spectrum.","Ken Talanian","Great. I have just one quick follow-up to that one. Do you know if you are seeing any pirates essentially transact for the e-store.","Scott Herren","We know the pirates don\u2019t announce themselves when they arrive at the e-store. However, it\u2019s highly likely that some of them do show up there. Alright, especially if they are buying LT or something like that, but like I said pirates don\u2019t declare themselves, but it\u2019s probably likely especially given some of the digital related targeting efforts we are doing work with piracy. But some of them show up buying there.","Ken Talanian","Great. Thanks very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Your next question is from Shankar Subramaniam with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Shankar Subramaniam","Hi, I am asking the question on behalf of Kash. I have a quick question on what can be the churn rate of the current renewal base for the subscribers for next year, so the question I have is so most \u2013 some of the projects that the construction engineers use would be a short-term project or some can be a long-term project, so if the subscriber growth in the current year is driven by short-term projects, is likelihood the next year they might drop out, but can you talk about what the mix is, I don\u2019t know if you know this or not, but when you talk about the mix between subscribers who are using for a short-term basis versus a long-term basis?","Andrew Anagnost","So the pattern you are talking about if no projects were in the pipeline at all then I would probably worry about that. But for every project that drops off another project shows up. So that\u2019s just the wrong way of looking at it. There is a steady state of projects within the ecosystem, projects retire, new projects ramp up. So there is really no material change in the run rate because of the cyclicality of a particular set of projects. There is always new projects in the pipeline.","Shankar Subramaniam","Got it. And one on the digital manufacturing strategy you talked about the focus area for that, can you talk about is there any particular segment you are focusing on the 3D printing, IoT or not and where are you in that strategy implementation and when do we see the benefit of it, is it more beyond fiscal \u201819?","Andrew Anagnost","So the opportunity that we are dealing with right now where the market is fully ready and the technology is fully aligned with the market rate [ph] is in construction. When we look at the digital manufacturing opportunity, the market is still coming to terms with okay. What does it mean for us to be using solutions in the cloud when I am a product manufacturing, how much of the 3D printing capability is actually going to be practical for my applications. So what you are seeing right now is in low volume manufacturing aircraft components and things like that, greater adoption of 3D printed workflows and some of these more automated workflows that\u2019s eventually moved down, so the bet on digital manufacturing is like the next long-term bet after the construction bet there we are playing right now. So we are actually \u2013 what you are seeing in the series of bets that provide a very strong path for long-term growth for the company.","Shankar Subramaniam","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And we have reached our allotted time for questions. And I would like to turn the call back over to David Gennarelli.","David Gennarelli","Great.

Much like last quarter, our third quarter results reflect strength across industries, geographies, and products. We continue to make meaningful progress in our business model transition to a more recurring subscription based business, adding approximately 121,000 subscriptions, which includes 25,000 Delcam subscriptions that were not previously captured.","As a result, the third revenue increased significantly to a record $1 billion, a milestone for Autodesk. All three of our major geographies, as well as emerging economies, grew double digits on a constant currency basis, led by growth in EMEA. Similar to last quarter, the areas in which we\u2019re seeing weakness are those affected by geopolitical turmoil. ","We also experienced strength in transactions greater than $1 million. These large deals were spread across all the major geographies, and fairly even spread between [AEC] and manufacturing. While the number of these large transactions increased nearly 60%, the total value of these large transactions increased over 200%.","Our investments in enterprise sales and consulting services have directly led to the increase in large deals and the size of these transactions. Many of these large deals were flexible enterprise licensing agreements. In addition to being a great benefit for our customers, these token-based contracts create a larger recurring revenue stream, which is recognized ratably.","These agreements are also contributing to our subscription growth as we\u2019re experiencing increased use of our cloud services. Third quarter license revenue would have been approximately $26 million higher before the impact of flexible enterprise license agreements. ","The environments for global construction, coupled with the continued customer excitement for our desktop and cloud-based BIM tools resulted in a strong Q3 for our AEC business. Anchored by [unintelligible], our BIM portfolio continues to resonate with customers across segments, but especially in construction. ","We closed several large deals with construction companies that include BIM 360, which continues to be one of Autodesk\u2019s fastest growing products ever. The AEC suites grew 23%. The large AEC deals that we closed during the quarter were across all geographies, including deals with four of the top 25 E&R design firms.","Our manufacturing team delivered strong growth of 20% in Q3. Growth was driven by wins in large verticals including industrial machinery, consumer products, and automotive. Strength in our core product design suite is leading the growth, but we are really encouraged by what we are seeing with our cloud-based products.","We are particularly pleased with the customer response to Fusion 360. It is the next generation cloud-based CAD system for mechanical engineers and industrial designers. We put Fusion 360 on the Mac App Store last quarter, and within a few days, there were over 100,000 downloads.","Not only are small customers using it, but we\u2019re increasingly seeing large customers adopt it, often replacing their traditional desktop tools. With PLM 360, we added many new customers, and perhaps even more encouraging is that we continue to see customers returning to purchase additional seats. ","Three of our top five PLM 360 deals were based in EMEA, where we are showing a lot of progress. We also closed our largest-ever manufacturing deal in Q3. This was an eight-figure transaction covering design, simulation, data management, and consulting. It was also our biggest PLM 360 win to date. ","The customer is a Fortune 500 industrial and technology company. It\u2019s a story we\u2019ve heard for years. They\u2019ve been struggling with their legacy PLM system and began looking for a cost-effective, scalable alternative that would integrate easily with their other business systems. Rather than spending millions more dollars on their old PLM system, they\u2019re using PLM 360.","We believe this is only the beginning of the cloud-based PLM revolution. It is easier to deploy, easier to configure, and a lot less expensive than legacy PLM systems. ","This quarter, we announced our plans to introduce cloud-based data management to complement the existing cloud-based PLM. Our business model transition is gaining momentum. We\u2019ve added 285,000 subscriptions through the first three quarters of thank you. This has been a fantastic start that is well ahead of our initial expectations.","The discontinuation of the upgrade program at the end of this fiscal year is helping drive our [maintenance] subscriber count. It\u2019s not surprising that we\u2019ve seen a lot of customers take advantage of the upgrade program, and we are experiencing a higher maintenance subscription attach rate with these upgrades.","What we\u2019re really encouraged about is the contribution we\u2019re getting from desktop and cloud subscriptions. AutoCAD LT has quickly become our leading desktop subscription offering. As we mentioned at our investor day event last month, a meaningful portion of our desktop subscription customers are new to Autodesk, and about half are subscribing by purchasing through our e-store. Those are great early trends.","Cloud subscriber growth remains very high and similar to desktop subscription. It\u2019s bringing a significant number of new users to Autodesk. Our cloud-based project collaboration tool, A360, is still in limited release, and we\u2019re very encouraged by some of the early indicators for that product.","Our mobile and cloud-based products are being adopted by our customers, which validates the investments and focus we\u2019ve put into these products. Autodesk has moved quickly to establish a leadership position in cloud and mobile and in many ways, we\u2019re just getting started. ","The early success we\u2019ve experienced with our business model transition has in part led us to accelerate the process. As we outlined last month, we plan to stop selling new perpetual offerings over the next 12 to 24 months. Stay tuned for more details around this over the coming months, as we start to discuss specifics with our customers and channel partners regarding these plans.","Given our strong Q3 performance, we\u2019ve raised our FY15 guidance ranges for billings revenue and subscriptions. The advancements we\u2019ve been making in cloud and mobile are just beginning to show up in these metrics. ","Earlier this year, I called out that operating margin is muted for a number of reasons, including the impact from the business model transition, investments we\u2019re making in our cloud infrastructure, the dilutive effect of the Delcam acquisition, as well as incremental investment spending on key initiatives.","Additionally, commissions and our employee incentive program are volume-related and increased based on our better-than-expected billings performance.","Lastly, I\u2019m very pleased that earlier this month, Scott Herren joined Autodesk as our CFO and is joining me on this call. Scott brings with him a broad mix of financial sales and product management experience. His leadership experience at Citrix will benefit Autodesk in our model transition over the coming years. I\u2019d like to thank Sue Pirri, who did a great job leading our finance organization during the interim, as well as the rest of the finance team.","So to wrap things up, we were really pleased with our overall results in Q3. The year has shaped up to be stronger than our initial view, and we remain confident in our long term business model transition goals of 12% billing CAGR, 20% more customer value, 50% more subscriptions, and 30% operating margins.","As you know, a key element of our model transition is ending perpetual offerings over the next 12 to 24 months. While we are not providing FY16 guidance at this time, keep in mind that doing so will impact the top line profitability in the short term. As always, we will monitor global economic conditions as well as currency movements as we head toward FY16.","We look forward to building onto early successes and transitioning Autodesk to a more profitable and recurring subscription-based model over the coming years.","Operator, we\u2019d now like to open the call up for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] The first question comes from Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill","Carl, the last couple of quarters on the billings you\u2019ve obviously done really well, mid-20% growth, yet the fiscal guide at 15% to 17% would just imply a stronger falloff in the next quarter. What\u2019s your sense in terms of is that just a conservative view on your behalf for the fourth quarter? And I\u2019m just curious if that eight-figure deal, how that is going to be recognized.","Carl Bass","Yes, the eight-figure deal is a ratable deal, and so it will be taken over a longer period of time. The one thing we said about the changing model during this year is that promotional incentives got weaker towards the end of the year. So while we\u2019ve exceeded it for all the quarters so far, we\u2019re always a little bit cautious, because the incentives to do so go down.","As we get to the fourth quarter, the incentive is eliminated, except for the fact that it\u2019s expiring. So there\u2019s less financial incentive, there\u2019s greater time-based pressure. Trying to wrap those two together, that\u2019s where we ended up as our guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss","It looks like really strong progress in the business model transition. I was wondering if we could kind of sort of cut off at the head what\u2019s going to be probably the biggest bear case out there of how do we know that we\u2019re not pulling forward potential demand out of FY16 with this strength this year? How do you guys get comfortable with that you\u2019re going to be sort of able to sustain the pace of maybe like billings growth, if you will, as we go through further into this business model transition?","Carl Bass ","The first one, for me, Keith, is getting more people on maintenance subscription is not a pull-through. And so I\u2019ve actually had a little bit of a hard time just reckoning about that, because we have customers who were not on maintenance who are now on maintenance. It\u2019s a big thing. Any way I look at it, I think that\u2019s the best possible outcome for us, to get a nonsubscriber on subscription.","We\u2019ve also talked about, as we\u2019re moving forward, that while this is a promotion for this year, we\u2019ve talked a lot about what we\u2019re going to do next year in terms of ending perpetual licenses. In many ways, that\u2019s probably a bigger incentive for our customers to do something differently.","And I don\u2019t know if I can help you take the bear and put it up on the wall, mount it, and stuff it, but I think some of the arguments out there are trying to extrapolate from too few facts, or to take this one thing and say, you know, this is the only incentive program that will work with our customers. And I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s true.","Keith Weiss ","If I could potentially sneak one last one in, just in terms of the mix of the subscriptions that we are seeing, is it remaining relatively constant with the strong heavily weighting towards the maintenance subscriptions, or are you starting to see a richer mix of desktop subscriptions in there?","Carl Bass ","It\u2019s richer, but it\u2019s still heavily, heavily subscription, because that\u2019s the one being promoted. And the others are off small bases, so we like the trajectory of the other ones, but in terms of meaningful financial contribution, it\u2019s maintenance. And while we\u2019ve said it may slow down going into the fourth quarter, I think the proportion will remain somewhat constant. ","Operator","The next question comes from Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter Pritchard"," ","Just a question as it relates to the token related deals. It sounded like in the first couple of quarters of the year you didn\u2019t have as much business go that way. In the third quarter, you had about $26 million that was a headwind, and then it sounds like last year you had some impact, and I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand how you expect that business to ramp in the fourth quarter, and then do we expect to see a more significant uptick in that revenue stream as you go into fiscal 2016?","Carl Bass ","Why don\u2019t we start at the back end of that question? I think we\u2019ve demonstrated over the last few years that this investment in enterprise sales and consulting services has really paid off. We tried to demonstrate it a little bit at investor day, where we showed you not only our customers paying more, they\u2019re using more. This has been truly a win-win situation. ","We\u2019re going to continue to invest in it and even to our channel partners, the thing I say all the time is when we win these big enterprise accounts, it\u2019s good for the whole ecosystem. So this is not at the expense of our channel partners. Quite the contrary. It is reinforcing business for our channel partners.","So we\u2019re going to continue to invest in it. We think we\u2019ve barely tapped into it. We outlined that we\u2019ve had kind of in the dozens of accounts that we\u2019re talking to with this. And there\u2019s probably upwards of 1,000 customers who will eventually move this way. And we\u2019re going to keep doing it.","Now, one of the things also about it, just to the timing that you talked about, we have always had a lot of these deals in Q4. Last year we made a conscious effort to move some of them into Q3. For a number of reasons, we like to spread it more fully throughout the year, but it is not fully within our control.","And so I suspect it will always be a little bit back end loaded throughout the year, but just in general, the two takeaways are we\u2019re going to continue to invest, because we think it\u2019s really good business, and the second thing is this level of flexibility with products is something we hope to offer to a broader range of our customers, not just the top thousand accounts.","Walter Pritchard ","And then just a question for Scott. Welcome aboard. It may be too early to ask you this quarter, and you don\u2019t have all the history, but I look at your rates of revenue guide for the year and the operating margin guide for the year is sort of the lower half of where you were talking before, and you mentioned that you have more commissions being paid out, and we\u2019ve seen this over time with Autodesk where if the performance is good, it impinges on the margins in the near term. Can you talk about how much of what\u2019s going on on the incremental expense side here in the guide now has to do with that versus investments that you have to make more for the longer term?","Scott Herren","It\u2019s both. We are investing in cloud infrastructure, buildout for the business model. We\u2019re investing in the back office system so that we can handle the higher volume of transactions. Delcam is in there, which is hitting the op margin year on year, and I think the one unique thing that we see in Q4 is some of the volume related things that hit Q4 around both commissions and variable comp for the year.","So I don\u2019t think it makes sense to break that out, but I think the way you need to think about it is it\u2019s a combination of both. The volume-related things in Q4, and some of those trends, the investment in the business model transition, frankly, will continue in the next year. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle","Scott, just following up on Walter\u2019s question, can we assume that margins have bottomed here, or given the model transition, particularly at the end of perpetual coming sometime over the next 12 to 24 months, should we expect that maybe margins go lower still? ","Scott Herren ","We\u2019re not giving guidance right now for fiscal 2016 and beyond, as you can appreciate. We\u2019re in the midst of our fiscal 2016 planning right now. So I\u2019m not at liberty at this point to talk about some of the longer term trends.","Brendan Barnicle ","Well, as I think about how we think about modeling licenses, and those perpetuals essentially going away, is there a point next year that we may have a quarter where that license line just is at zero, and so we should be kind of preparing the models for that? ","Scott Herren ","I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll hand back off to Carl on this. Whether it\u2019s next year or beyond, I think what we\u2019ve said is we\u2019re planning to end of life perpetual license in the next 12 to 24 months, and that of course is a big driver of that license line.","Carl Bass ","Yeah, and the only thing I\u2019d add, you know, I tried to give you guys a little bit more color when a number of you were here during investor day. One of the variables that we have the knobs and dials around this are whether we do all products at the same time or stagger it, and whether we do all geographies at the same time or not. So we do have some level of control over those things. What we were more indicating is directionally, by the end of the 24 months. ","I think in some ways it would just be unusual operationally to drive to a place where we get to zero license revenue in a quarter, but directionally, I think you clearly understand where we\u2019re headed.","Brendan Barnicle ","As you have more of these eight-figure deals, like that large one that you mentioned that you\u2019ll be recognizing over time, does it make sense at some point to share an off balance sheet bookings type number? ","Carl Bass ","Welcome, Scott. [laughter]","Scott Herren ","Yeah, thanks for that. You know, Brendan, I think it\u2019s fairly straightforward. I know it\u2019s a calculation that gets done today, and I think it\u2019s not that difficult to pull it right out of the change in deferred revenue plus the announced revenues. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s that difficult a metric. It is something that we\u2019ll talk about if it makes sense, besides guiding to a growth rate, just to start to guide to an absolute number and then report on that.","Brendan Barnicle ","Scott, I was referencing those deals where you don\u2019t bill all in advance, so we don\u2019t see it on the deferred revenue, and you have some that\u2019s off balance sheet.","Scott Herren ","Oh, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re talking about the enterprise agreements specifically?","Brendan Barnicle ","Right. As you do more of those and they become more material, is that going to be a metric we should start to look at, like we do for Salesforce or Microsoft\u2019s contract on build? ","Scott Herren ","I don\u2019t actually have a plan. I would say it feels to me it\u2019s a bit awkward to announce that, because all of the revenues there, all those enterprise agreements, are captured, or most of them are captured in the deferred revenue balance. So it feels a bit awkward that we split it out today, but I don\u2019t have a plan to either continue to be more explicit on that or not.","Carl Bass ","If it turns out that somehow it\u2019s so opaque that you\u2019re having trouble understanding it, then we\u2019ll provide some clues to how to do that. I hope it becomes a problem. [laughs]","Operator","The next question comes from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Heather Bellini","Carl, at the investor day last month, you mentioned that in fiscal 2016, you thought that you could add at least as many subs in that period as you add in fiscal 2015. And I guess I\u2019m just wondering, would you still say that\u2019s possible given your significant outperformance and your new sub-guidance for this year? And then I just had a follow up.","Carl Bass ","I know what you\u2019re trying to do. You\u2019re trying to trick me into giving guidance for next year. [laughter]","Heather Bellini","[laughs] We would not do that. ","Carl Bass ","I know that. You know what, I feel really good about the trajectory of the subs. I\u2019d be a little hesitant to start guiding for subs for next year, but right now all I would say is all the curves on the subs look really good, and three months from now, in February, we\u2019ll start trying to break it out. There\u2019s nothing here that I see going in the wrong direction, but we\u2019ll just wait the three months.","Heather Bellini ","Okay, and then the follow up question was, I know you all have been working on some initiatives to help drive renewal rates higher, and I\u2019m just wondering if you could share with us, are you seeing some of those initiatives start to pay off, and as a result, how have your renewal rates been trending? Because I know that\u2019s big for Q4.","Carl Bass ","Yeah, so the renewal rates are definitely being driven higher. Some is being driven programmatically, like we talked about with the end of upgrades, and some it\u2019s just more attention to detail, if you will, about the nonrenewals. And so we\u2019ve done a better job, we\u2019ve put more systems in place, to track that. We\u2019ve been [unintelligible] our partners and ourselves to do it. It\u2019s edging up on small numbers, because [we\u2019re at] a relatively high number, but it\u2019s still a good direction and material.","Operator","The next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.","Gregg Moskowitz","First question is for Carl. Just wondering if you saw any changes in the quarter with regard to the mix of new versus existing subscribers across both desktop as well as cloud?","Carl Bass ","No, a lot of the trends we outlined in October are kind of continuing. And I think they\u2019ll be relatively stable, but we\u2019ll update them and if we see a material change we\u2019ll talk about it. But we\u2019re learning as we go too.","Gregg Moskowitz ","Scott, wanted to ask where we are right now when it comes to the investments that you alluded to in back office systems and cloud infrastructure. When we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, how much of this lies ahead versus kind of what you guys have done already?","Scott Herren ","It\u2019s day 14 for me today, so what I\u2019d say on that front is obviously those investments didn\u2019t start just this quarter, they\u2019ve been in flight. But I think it\u2019s a significant transition, both in building out the cloud infrastructure for the world that we envision around desktop subscriptions as well as building out the back office systems to handle the significantly higher volume of transactions. So it\u2019s still early innings on those investments. ","Operator","The next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.","Saket Kalia","First, I realize it\u2019s still early to provide guidance for fiscal 2016, but just given the moves that we\u2019ve had in the euro and yen, can you just talk about how FX exposure might look next year compared to what you\u2019ve hedged?","Carl Bass","As we\u2019ve talked about, we always have the rolling hedge. We continue to have that. But FX will definitely be a headwind next year. [Or maybe it] moves the other way. If it just stayed where it is today, it\u2019s definitely a headwind, and it gets more significant as we go out to the end of next year versus Q1 of next year.","Scott Herren ","Yeah, if you look at our hedge program, it is layered out in time, and so obviously as the year goes on, the exposure from today goes up. But I\u2019d say you can look at our revenue mix, you can see where we are. Obviously the euro is a significant currency for us. The yen\u2019s a significant currency for us. And it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll take into account when we do provide guidance for fiscal 2016.","Saket Kalia ","And then Carl, I think you said last quarter that the third quarter was a little bit slower in terms of subscribers coming from maintenance renewals compared to the fourth quarter. Is that still the case?","Carl Bass ","If I said that, maybe I misspoke. I thought it was the other way. Generally speaking, what I thought is you\u2019d see, in Q3, more subscribers in the small, medium part of our business. And what we would see is more enterprise agreements in Q4. And you know, that was really our best guestimate, as I said, on those two factors of the time-based nature of expiring, yet the financial incentives were going to zero.","Operator","","The next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","","On the enterprise flexible licensing agreements that you\u2019ve got, can you give us a sense, what\u2019s the average duration on those types of deals? So in other words, when would we expect the deals that you did this quarter to start coming back up for renewal?","Carl Bass ","I\u2019m not sure if I can give you the average, but typical is a three-year agreement. So that\u2019s a very typical agreement, is a three year.","Scott Herren ","And I think, Sterling, bear in mind these deals are largely ratable in terms of revenue. So they\u2019ll drive a bit of lumpiness in the billing stream. It will be a little bit smoother on the revenue stream.","Sterling Auty","And then can you give us a sense of the linearity of the subscribers that you added through the quarter? Was it fairly linear, or did you see any particular patterns through the quarter? ","Carl Bass ","If you take out the Delcam one, which is a one-time thing, but if you look at kind of the organic, it tracks pretty closely to the way you would have seen the seasonality around revenue historically. So a little bit heavier in the last month of the quarter, but not tremendously so. ","Sterling Auty ","And then last question, I know you\u2019re not giving us when in the 12 to 24 months you\u2019re going to eliminate the perpetual licensing, but can you give us some of the factors that are kind of going into your decision process?","Carl Bass ","Yeah, we\u2019re looking at a number of things. We are working the program with our customers. We\u2019ve engaged them and are talking heavily with them. We\u2019re working with our partners. I mean, what we intended to do, as opposed to the kind of rip off the band aid strategy, was we were going to work through this slowly and deliberately. And we\u2019re making sure we keep the business as intact as possible as we move through what\u2019s a fairly big transition. ","Operator","The next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Carl, I\u2019d like to ask first about the famous 2.9 million active base number from the analyst meeting. That is, customers who\u2019ve purchased product but haven\u2019t gone on maintenance. By our math, the largest piece of that, of the three main buckets, is customers who upgraded since fiscal 2010 through this year but didn\u2019t for some reason take maintenance as well. Could you talk about why those customers would not have taken maintenance in spite of all the promotions and inducements you\u2019ve had over the years for them to do so when they upgraded, and how do you now get them to convert? Then a follow up.","Carl Bass ","When you go to Best Buy, do you buy that service contract, Jay? You know, I think there are a lot of things that we do. I mean, if they ask me one more time at checkout if I want that service contract I\u2019m going to shoot them. [laughter] I think it\u2019s the same thing. Remember, we\u2019ve talked about this as we\u2019ve reintroduced these programs, many of our customers have been buying for decades. They have a certain buying behavior. We\u2019ve talked about, depending on the product, they may feel like the maintenance subscription is more or less valuable. ","So the two biggest factors we see are the lower cost products generally have lower attach and renewal rates. And the other one is geographically, there\u2019s wide variance between, generally speaking, developed countries and emerging economies. So those are the two biggest differences.","You know, as we move forward, we hope to eliminate that choice by the combination of this year\u2019s program and next year\u2019s program, or over the next two-year program. We\u2019re going to get to a place where customers are on a program with us.","Jay Vleeschhouwer ","The follow up is at the analyst meeting, you mentioned value per account as an important metric. That\u2019s come up in some conversations since then. Would a corollary to that be that at some point, Autodesk would introduce a single \u201cAutodesk account\u201d as a kind of uber suite for access and particularly for driving the flex licensing downmarket into SMB? Would that be some way that you could approach combining flex licenses with making it more broadly available or appealing to the smaller accounts?","Carl Bass ","Yes, let me break this into two questions, which somehow you managed to put it into one. And I\u2019m still looking for the connection. But let me just separate it. It helps my feeble mind process it. ","On the ARPU conversation, we talked about value per account. Some people have asked us about ARPU. What we\u2019ve said about ARPU, because of the \u201cA\u201d in there, it\u2019s going to be really mix sensitive, and we have a wide range that\u2019s going into that. ","And we do think the distribution of it will be more helpful, or some categorization or bucketing of it is better. And I think if you do it by account, it\u2019s a way of normalizing that is not nearly as mix sensitive. So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve thought about there. ","Second question in my mind is about what I said is we\u2019ve seen tremendous reception from the enterprise licenses. Customers truly appreciate the flexibility and the access to pieces of software they might not have had. We think many of our small and medium business customers will want the same thing. ","You mentioned the uber suite. I think we will introduce something that is similar to giving people access to the portfolio for a fixed price. We\u2019re not going to announce anything today, but it\u2019s certainly directionally where we\u2019re headed. Again, we think this is a win for everyone involved, at least while we\u2019ve been able to manage more closely in the enterprise space. We will first broaden it there, and then secondarily, introduce it to the more general population. ","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Ashley of Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley","I\u2019d just like to go back to the success you\u2019re having with the large deals and just maybe try to get some more color on how you\u2019re driving that. I think you mentioned that some of it is your consulting services, but if you could just maybe walk us through how you are having success in driving those here with this go-to-market, that would be great. ","Carl Bass ","Yeah, you know, the unsaid thing that I scratch my head too is kind of if you\u2019re having such great success with it now, what took you so long? And one thing that we have seen very clearly is the buildout of capabilities of our consulting services have mattered a lot. So it\u2019s one thing to provide access to people, but if you really want to drive usage and adoption, we need people onsite to do that, particularly in large, complex organizations.","So it\u2019s large, complex organizations that already have complicated business processes in hand, or ones like, for example, in some of the engineering construction firms, where they\u2019re going through a transformation and adopting BIM, and they need help understanding how to best bring that into their business. And the differences in places where we have consulting versus we don\u2019t are dramatic in terms of their adoption and in terms of the increasing value of those contracts when they get renewed.","The second thing is, I think this is just one of these things, as we began to have a bigger major account presence and listen to our customers, we realized that that was happening simultaneously with the buildout of a much bigger and broader product portfolio. So if you were to roll this back five years, part of the thing was we just didn\u2019t have as rich a set of offerings to go in with. ","We now have a much richer set of offerings, and that\u2019s true both in our AEC, [our M&E] and our manufacturing products, and we have the people who can deliver what\u2019s really needed for the customer to be successful. ","Probably the third factor is slightly more environmental, in which there\u2019s been a conditioning in the buyers of software to look at more term-based models to look at more consumption-based models, and people are much more comfortable with that. I think when we first started, there was a little bit of a negative reaction in certain accounts. ","I think what\u2019s happened, just to give you kind of the inside and the color commentary here, is that what has happened in a number of these accounts is that people are happier. They\u2019re okay paying more if they feel like the software is really being used. There\u2019s always this suspicion that they were buying things that were not being fully utilized, but now because of the tokens, they feel like it\u2019s being used.","The secondary dynamic that goes on within these accounts is that they can do some kind of an internal accounting about it and charge back to the cost center that\u2019s using it. And I think the combination of those two things, plus the accessibility of the broader portfolio is winning over. And like we showed you at investor day, it\u2019s pretty dramatic, the increase in usage, and company satisfaction as a result of the customers who have done this.","Steve Ashley ","And just a quick follow up to Sterling\u2019s earlier question on the enterprise flexible license agreements. He asked about the duration. You said while you didn\u2019t have it at your fingertips, a lot of the deals are three years. Is the mechanics here that after a year you go in and do a true up and there is some maybe adjustment made or remuneration to you from these contracts?","Carl Bass ","Yeah, there\u2019s just the constant accounting, which people have tokens that they burn off. They buy what they think they need, and they eventually run out and have to buy more, a little bit more than a true up. I mean, it\u2019s better just thinking of it as you just bought a bunch of tokens. ","And I would say most people so far have guesstimated on the low side of what they need. And the reason why they guesstimate on the low side is they go out, they make the software available to the broader community, there\u2019s more usage of it, and they end up having to go back and buy more tokens sooner than they would have otherwise thought they needed to. ","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital Markets.","Matt Hedberg","I wanted to ask about the geographies here. Obviously EMEA was your strongest geo. Carl, I\u2019m wondering, was the strength there Autodesk specific with the transition ongoing here? Or are you seeing a different environment there than what some of the macro indicators might imply? And then also, APAC obviously grew 10% too in constant currency. Maybe a little additional color there?","Carl Bass ","Let me just use this to riff on a broader thing I\u2019m seeing geographically, which is the Americas is strong. There are a lot of good secular trends in the U.S. They remain strong. The places like the Middle East and Russia, Russia particularly, business might even be down by half in Russia over comparable periods. Just to put it in perspective, we\u2019ve always been very interested in the emerging economies, but they\u2019re in the low single digit percentages. None is bigger than 3% of our revenue.","But Russia and the Middle East have been clearly weak. The other places have been okay. There\u2019s a little bit of weakness that we\u2019ve detected in Japan, coupled with a weakening of the currency, and the currency is as big an effect right now as the actual business. ","Europe, the middle of this quarter, it seemed like there was a lot of consternation about Europe. I put it in not the strength of the U.S., but relatively strong, and even some signs of increasing strength in southern Europe, which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been able to say for probably seven years. ","Matt Hedberg ","That\u2019s very helpful, and then maybe a quick follow up. At analyst day, you talked about instituting a new campaign to lower the margin dollars on license sales and increase them on the desktop. So I\u2019m curious, you\u2019re 20 days into this. What\u2019s been some of the initial feedback from the field on some of these changes?","Carl Bass ","Yeah, so we\u2019re just beginning. We said we were going to start with LT. You know, one of the things just in general that people should think about with this, LT is a very different product than our other products. It\u2019s a good experimentation, it\u2019s a high volume product for us. And so far, so good in terms of the reception to it. But also, it goes through, at least on a mix basis, a different channel than some of our other products.","And just in general, when people look at this, I would say what people have to understand is that there\u2019s a difference in products between LT and others, and the other thing I would say is as we do this, just keep in mind that the programs you put in place, either when the programs are new or the products are new, are considerably different than what you do as they mature. ","So there\u2019s a fair amount of flexibility. I mean, there are a number of degrees of freedom, depending on the product and the channel and the maturity of the product. So right now, longwinded answer. The short answer is the LT one is fine, and you\u2019ll see us continue to do this as we work our way through the entire portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord.","Richard Davis","You bought, I was trying to remember, Moldflow, back in I think like \u201908, Blue Ridge back in \u201911, and I can\u2019t remember if Delcam had much simulation. But anyways, what are your thoughts with regard to kind of organic and even inorganic growth in simulation, because it\u2019s a less iterative design tool, and it works perfectly, I would think, with that kind of burst capacity relationship you have with Amazon Cloud?","Carl Bass ","Two things there. One is we\u2019ve always talked about the cloud being good for two reasons. One is for these computationally intensive tasks and the other really is the central coordinating hub for collaboration. Things like finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, are perfect for cloud-based computing. it works really well for those, as you say, burst, high peak demand needs. So we see it as being really good for that.","It\u2019s also, particularly as you move from the desk of the analyst to that of the engineer. In many large companies, they built out computing centers for the analysts, but not for every engineer. So it gives access for the average engineer to much more computing capability. ","So we\u2019re really happy with what we\u2019ve seen, and I think the difference, when you look at us versus, you know, other companies in analysis and simulation, is we\u2019re just much more focused on the engineer than the analyst, and some of the things we\u2019re doing with the products should be viewed through that lens. ","Operator","The next question comes from Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.","Kash Rangan","Carl, when I look at your business model transition and follow along the commentary with the last couple of quarters, it feels like a lot of the upside in deferred revenue seems to be predominantly coming from flexible licensing agreements and also catch up maintenance. So where is the real business model transition happening here with respect to the Adobe-like desktop subs that you would like to pursue?","And as it relates to that, when you look at fiscal \u201918, if the company\u2019s going to be in [unintelligible] licenses, which is terrific, how should we think about how you get to 30% non-GAAP [unintelligible], because the appeal of the license is going way. That seems like a steep [unintelligible].","Carl Bass ","Two things, Kash. On your first question, I would say for example, forgetting everything else about the business model transition, I can\u2019t think of a healthier way to grow your business than selling more value to your best customers. ","It\u2019s just as straightforward as that, and so call it token based or flexible licensing. Just the idea that your best customers are buying more products from you seems like everything about it is good. And in some ways, it answers your question, because the most sustainable thing is having good customers who want more products from you and are paying you more money for it. ","The second thing is I think a number of people have looked and tried to draw conclusions too early in terms of the business model transition. What you saw this year was the end of a multiyear program to eliminate upgrades. What we\u2019re heading into is a multiyear program to end perpetual licenses.","At the end of that, the company is in a distinctly different place than it was when entering, where the primary means for your customers to buy things were perpetual licenses with upgrades. And you come out the other end, and everyone is in a recurring, ratable relationship with you.","So I\u2019d say that is fundamentally changing it. The difference - and I say this whether it\u2019s Adobe or Microsoft or anyone else, or any of the born in the cloud SaaS companies - we all end up in an identical place. So you roll out three four years, and there will be virtually no difference, whether you\u2019re talking about Salesforce or NetSuite or Workday or Autodesk or Intuit or Adobe or Microsoft. ","It\u2019s the software industry that\u2019s changing. We\u2019re all delivering software on the same platforms in the same way, and our customers, truthfully, are pushing us to buy it in the same way. So I think some of the distinctions in the transition maybe trying to put too fine a filter on it and trying to understand things that may not look identical in year two or year two and a half versus something else. ","But if you just step back and look at the long term, you say, companies end up in the same place, we\u2019re all selling enterprise applications that are centered around cloud, social, and mobile, and the business relationship with the customer will be a long term subscription model. And so in that way, I think is the easiest way to see the similarities.","Kash Rangan ","And on the implications for margins, certainly this is a thoughtful transition, but what I struggle with is as licenses fall off, the subscriptions, you have to cut a lot of cost to get to 30% non-GAAP margins versus the 13. Just wondering, what drives that? ","Carl Bass ","Yeah, so the first thing is, I think if you looked over any period of time, I would say there are two different things. So one I\u2019ll get to, what costs have to change? But the first one is, the amount of revenue over time is the same, if not more. And we saw that with like the enterprise licenses. Customers are paying us more, even though there are no more up front licenses. And so the lifetime value or the value over a fixed period in time is actually higher. And I think that same trend that we see with our enterprise customers we\u2019ll see with our other customers.","As I\u2019ve been very willing to say, repeatedly. I think the two areas where we will see a change is, one is our R&D spend is relatively high right now. We\u2019re supporting two different technology models, a traditional desktop model and we\u2019re building out for a SaaS infrastructure, and so we\u2019re doing development infrastructure costs on both simultaneously. And the second one is our sales and marketing is high when you consider the total between what we spend and our various channel partners spend on sales and marketing.","So I think if you combine those two, both of those, as a percentage, and certainly if you do the calculation on the overall ecosystem as opposed to us, goes down over time, and that\u2019s how you get to 30-plus percent.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Williams from Evercore.","Matt Williams","Carl, just quickly on the partner side of things, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us an update on partner interest around rentals and clouds. I saw a press release earlier today around the PLM business and a partner that was announced there. And I\u2019m just wondering sort of what sort of traction you\u2019re seeing within the partner base around the PLM 360, BIM 360, some of the cloud offerings and how they\u2019re adapting to the desktop subscription offering as well.","Carl Bass ","Yeah, so I\u2019ve seen more traction amongst our traditional partners around desktop subscription, because it\u2019s the same products licensed differently. The pickup amongst our traditional partners has more variance when you get to these offerings like PLM 360 and BIM 360. So some partners have been greatly involved with it, but in other cases, we have actively gone out and recruited new partners whose business is already much more aligned with this.","So some of our existing partners are much more willing to make the transformation, others\u2026 Some of these, like the PLM deals, involve large amounts of services. We\u2019ve talked about they are million dollar deals. For some partners, that\u2019s a little bit much. Others are reacting really well. But I would say some of our newer offerings like BIM and PLM, you will see a higher proportion of new partners entering the mix and desktop subscription. The bulk of that work will be covered by our existing partners. ","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Koenig from Wedbush.","Steve Koenig","I joined the call a little late, so I apologize if this has been asked. I wanted to go to the subscriber additions for next year, where you\u2019re expecting a fairly similar level to this year. In light of maybe an update after the Q3 now, any thoughts on where these subscribers will be coming from? Are you still thinking about desktop subscribers as being a priority for next year? I guess if that\u2019s true, maybe just a little bit of color on what kind of people would you be targeting in that 3 million base of active but not really paying users that haven\u2019t chosen the upgrade this year but might go to a desktop subscription next year? Or am I thinking about this wrong?","Carl Bass ","No, I think if you look at next year, without getting too quantitative about it, I think with the end of perpetual licenses, you\u2019ll see a large number of people going to desktop subscription as a result of recognizing, as they get nudged toward doing that. You\u2019ll also see, just based on the maturing of the products, more people going to cloud-based subscriptions. ","And the last one is, I think there will be a substantial number of people who move to maintenance along with perpetual licenses. For those who want to continue to buy this way, and as that\u2019s removed, they will go buy perpetual licenses with maintenance to stay in that mode. So I think you\u2019ll see a substantial portion of maintenance subscribers next year, but you\u2019ll see an increasing number of desktop and cloud.","Operator","I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to the presenters for closing remarks. ","David Gennarelli","Thanks, operator.

We're really pleased with our third quarter results. Q3 marks a significant milestone in our transition. It's the first quarter where we only sold subscriptions and were off to a great start.","New model subscriptions grew by 168,000. New model ARR grew 91% at constant currency, and recurring revenue jumped to 76% of total revenue. More generally, we made progress on our two major initiatives growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model, and increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions. Given that this quarter was the most uncertain when we started the year, these are fantastic results. So let's look at the details.","For the quarter, we added 134,000 net subscriptions. New model subscription additions more than tripled year-over-year to 168,000, while the maintenance subscriptions declined as expected by 34,000 during the quarter. Product subscriptions drove the vast majority of the new models of additions. The launch of industry collections, the next generation of suites that include many of our cloud services contributed to our strong growth this quarter. Collections are a great example of how we\u2019re simplifying our offerings while increasing lifetime customer value.","During the quarter, we ran another promotion aimed at converting our legacy, non-subscriber base to new product subscriptions. Like the promotion in Q1, legacy non-subscribers were offered product subscriptions at a discount when trading in their old perpetual licenses. The Q3 promotion added approximately 43,000 product subscriptions, significantly more than in Q1. In addition the overall average selling price was twice as high as the Q1 promotion due to a lower discount and the fact that customers favored higher price products. And lastly, more than 50% of the subscribers tuned in licenses that were seven years back or older. This reinforces our view that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to the latest software.","While the promo successfully migrated many legacy customers to our subscription model, product subscriptions continued to attract a significant number of users that are new to Autodesk. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. We believe some of these people were previously pirating the software and now have a much more affordable option with product subscriptions. This is consistent with the fact that emerging countries are some of the fastest growing areas for products subscriptions. In other cases, these new users have been using an alternative design tool and should now afford software from Autodesk.","Overall product subscriptions grew by more than 30% quarter-over-quarter with new subscribers coming from the legacy base from people previously pirating the software and from new customers switching from other systems. Particularly pleasing is that this strong performance immediately follows the end of sale of perpetual licenses for suites.","We also had another record quarter for cloud subscription editions. They nearly doubled from the second quarter which was also a record. BIM 360 and Fusion 360 once again are leading the way, but we also have continued to have success with our other cloud products such as AutoCAD 360, Shotgun, and Collaboration for Revit. It is clear that we\u2019re building on our leadership in the cloud and that cloud services are growing in importance with our customers. We see the benefits of the cloud\u2019s inherent scale and connectivity.","For example, during Q3 we signed a large BIM 360 contract at a global construction company. Last spring, they started a pilot program, less than 200 seats for new projects. Working with them on their implementation drove rapid adoption. Their results were so strong that they signed the seven figure agreement, expanding their use of BIM 360 Glue, Field and Docs to additional projects, reaching over 2,000 subscriptions in just one region. Now they are planning to scale their BIM processes even further, eventually using BIM 360 for all projects in all regions.","Maintenance is our other significant subscription bucket. During the quarter, we included for the first time 13,000 maintenance customers from our acquisition of Solid Angle. As you already know, July 31 was the last time customers could add maintenance to a perpetual license, so the incentive to stay up to date with existing maintenance contracts is compelling. In Q3, the renewal rate for maintenance subscriptions was strong, ahead of last year. But with no new maintenance agreements being sold, total maintenance subscriptions declined. As we\u2019ve said before, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward.","The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal -- the renewal rate and our ability to incentivize maintenance customers to switch over to product subscription. This migration is good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves them to our newest and best products. While we are still working through the timeline, at some point, we will further simplify our offerings and the maintenance subscription and product subscription offerings will converge into a single program.","Now, we will get into ARR. New model ARR growth surged to 91% on a constant currency basis, and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new subscription offerings. Total ARR grew 15% at constant currency. ARR growth was negatively impacted this quarter by the allocation of our market development funds, which are accounted for as contra revenue and booked upfront in each quarter. Prior to Q3, these funds were allocated across all revenue streams. But the end of perpetual license sales, a 100% of our market development funds are now allocated to recurring revenues in ARR. This impacted ARR growth by 3 percentage points or about $40 million. FX rates also continued to be a headwind for ARR in the quarter. The combination of FX rates in contra revenues reduced total ARR by about a $100 million or 7 percentage points in Q3, which was sizable.","Despite those headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our FY20 ARR CAGR of 24%. I mentioned last quarter that some of our moves to drive subscriptions in ARR revolve around pricing. In early September we made changes that rationalized the pricing of AutoCAD LT, AutoCAD and the AutoCAD verticals. The aim was to drive customers to the right product for their needs and do so with higher billings and ARR. I\u2019m pleased to report that these actions are motivating the intended customer behavior.","More LT uses are buying [technical difficulty] AutoCAD and the volumes for AutoCAD and especially AutoCAD verticals increased significantly quarter over quarter. For the overall AutoCAD family of products volumes and ARR increased because of these price changes. We focus on subscriptions in ARR as a key metrics to measure our progress in the business model transition. However we have received many [technical difficulty] question on trends in annualized revenue per subscription or ARPs. So I thought I'd spend a little extra time on it this quarter and we\u2019ll spend more time on it at Investor Day next week.","Let's start by focusing on new seats added in Q3, excluding the promo seats, as they have the temporary effect of depressing ARPs and so their renewals which will be at the full price. Suite and collections in the U.S. saw a year over year increase in ARPs of 24%. In Germany the increase was plus 79% and in Japan it was plus 26%. AutoCAD LT in the U.S. saw a year over year increase of plus 9%, in Germany the increase was plus 55% and in Japan 50%. The AutoCAD family which is the sum of the newer AutoCAD and the vertical AutoCAD for the U.S. saw a year-over-year increase of 8%. In Germany the increase was 13% and in Japan 78%. Because of the strong year over year changes for new seat purchases the charter over quarter ARPs change for the sum of AutoCAD, AutoCAD vertical and AutoCAD LT in the U.S., Germany and Japan were 5%, 35% and 64% respectively.","This was simply the result of more people buying vertical AutoCAD than vanilla AutoCAD and more people buying AutoCAD instead of AutoCAD LT. Exactly the result we were looking for from the pricing change and why we generated more volume in ARR from the AutoCAD family. These are very positive outcomes. In fact except for a few emerging markets in Europe we see essentially the same trendlines everywhere. So why aren't these results reflected in the aggregate ARPs number we report? There are two primary reasons, first the calculation is extremely sensitive to mix in the early stages.","Small numbers exaggerate the effects of short term shifts internally, geo mix, promotions, et cetera, until it starts to normalize when the number of customers is large enough. Secondly, the method we use to count ARR and subscription is very sensitive to timing within the quarter. On an as reported basis ARPs can significantly understate the value of a subscription. The net-net of all this is that fundamental business drivers are very positive, but the aggregate ARPs of the company is declining because the various mix impacts, calculations around ARPs, FX and the constant revenue impact of market development funds. In fact factors such as mix drove about 50% of the declining ARPs trends.","We expect these impacts to converge to a steady state and that\u2019s when you\u2019ll see aggregate ARPs begin to increase again. We will provide more insight into the components of the new model subscriptions as they mature into a bigger base next year. I know many of you are keenly interested in this area and we will spend a lot more time on this at next week's Investor Day.","Total direct revenue also increased as a proportion of total revenues to 29%, up from just 17% two years ago and 25% last quarter. As we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as our e-store.","On the expense side we continue to prudently manage spend. Total non-GAAP spend decrease by 2% year-over-year, this marks the third consecutive quarter of decreases as we diligently control our spending. We had already committed to keeping our FY18 spend flat with FY17. We are now committing to keep our FY19 spend flat as well. This will require some additional effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do at this stage of our transition and that we can do so without compromising the long term health of the company.","We also remained aggressive with our stock buyback program in Q3, buying back 2 million share with an average price of $68.74. We have now repurchased nearly 7 million share this fiscal year and plan to remain active buyers through both programmatic and opportunistic needs. This is another area, we will discuss in greater depth at our Investor Day on December 6. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our Q3 results. We have increased confidence that the transition is working for customers, partners and Autodesk and that we are on track for the FY20 targets we set.","Turning to our outlook, as we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters, global conditions have held steady with most of the mature markets performing relatively well while many of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluate our strong Q3 results, and look ahead to Q4, we don\u2019t see any meaningful change in the demand environment. Talk of increased infrastructure spending and tax reform in the U.S. would likely benefit Autodesk, but it's far too early to determine if the election results will have a material positive or negative impact on our business domestically or abroad.","Our view for the rest of fiscal '17 remains positive. Our revenue and EPS results were slightly better than we expected in Q3. Q4 typically experiences a sequential increase due to seasonality. And we expect to see that again this year. But keep in mind that Q3 revenue benefited from $38 million in backlog from the end of sale of a perpetual suite at the end of Q2. Since we\u2019ve ended the sale of most perpetual licenses, backlog is now zero and it won't be a material contributor going forward in the subscription only model. We feel great about the way subscriptions are trending and now that Q3 is behind us, we are bringing up the bottom end of our previous range for subscription additions and we are on track for the spend target that we lowered last quarter.","When we started down this transition past three years ago, the objective was the same as it is today, build long term shareholder value and establish Autodesk as the leader of the next generation of design and engineering software. We are accomplishing these goals in three simple ways; one, we are increasing the life time value of every estimates by moving them to subscription models. Two, we are changing our cost structure by focusing our product portfolio and go to market strategies. And three, we are building the best cloud and mobile based products and services in the industry with significantly expand our TAM as the underlying technology platform shifts to the cloud.","Next week at our Investor Day Event, we\u2019ll provide further detail on significant items on our past to our transition goals including $6 in free cash flow per share in FY20 and $11 in FY22. Some of the items we\u2019ll cover include an update on the transition overall, focus areas that achieve the 20% growth in subscriptions and 24% CAGR in ARR. The factors includes ARPs, TAM expansion opportunities in construction and manufacturing and success with our cloud offerings. The evolution of our go to market strategies to align with the subscription business, recent operating changes that will increase our access to foreign cash and dramatically increase our financial flexibility, and our thoughts on capital allocation. ","To round things up, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be finally in the subscription only model. We\u2019ve executed well over the past few quarters and we\u2019re looking forward to finishing the year strong. Our vision and strategy are working. The business model transition is ahead of plans and we are leading the industry in delivering cloud based software for the next generation of design and engineering. With this quarter we become more confident in our ability to increase shareholder value by creating a more predictable recurring and profitable business and achieving the goals we set out for FY20, for subscriptions ARR and cash flow. ","Operator we now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.","Saket Kalia ","First just sort of a housekeeping question for you Scott. Can you just remind us what market development funds are from high level and what sort of dollar amount we should expect that to be on an annual basis?","Scott Herren","Yes, sure. Saket. So market development funds are common to every company that sells through a value added reseller channel. So it's in effect demand generation dollars, it's money that we make available to our resellers for them to go off and drive demand -- presales demand for the product. So it\u2019s not a new program, we\u2019ve had market development funds for years. I think what's changed this quarter is the way those market development funds are allocated. They are not treated as an expense, they are treated as a contra revenue, meaning they\u2019re subtracted from our reported revenues.","It runs $10 million to $11 million a quarter, and so historically what\u2019s happened is that was allocated pro-rata to the sales through the channel which were heavily driven by license sales. This quarter of course, there is no license sales, so all of the market development funds, the same amount we've always spent, ended up being allocated for the first time to recurring revenues, and so the $10 million or $11 million per quarter when you annualize that of course is between $40 and $45 million for the year.","So first time, we've seen that effect on recurring revenue was this quarter and I would expect it to stay in that range going forward.","Saket Kalia ","Understood, that's very helpful. And then for my followup, and I'm sure this is going to be something that we talk about a lot more next week, but how sensitive is the long-term model to mix, meaning can you just talk us through qualitatively maybe how different the mix is across the product ranges in this first quarter with total subscription compared to what you are modeling in that $6 per share in free cash flow, and maybe just qualitatively how much leeway do you have with that mix?","Carl Bass","Let me start with this and Scott feel free to jump in. We have a variety of mixes that we try to talk about, one was about certainly product mix, one is about geo mix, there\u2019s others like term length, and then there are very specific things, the difference between for example, EBA\u2019s and maintenance. Those numbers look different as well as certainly the cloud revenues look different.","So those things matter a lot, we have a fair amount of flexibility, we understand the price range that these things will come in. Right now we\u2019re actually above the plan for where we expect it to be and one of the things I tried to do in the middle of the prepared remarks, give you a little bit of information about what\u2019s selling on a like-for-like basis. So that\u2019s were -- those were those quotes in the middle, all about how much more people are paying this year or this quarter compared to the previous year or the previous quarter. And we thought it was important to really compare the like-for-like, so that people could understand it.","One of the things we also mentioned is, going forward we\u2019ll start breaking this out for you, having an average of averages of averages is way too confusing as we\u2019ve all seen. I think, the folks at Goldman did a nice job at breaking out the model in their most recent report and I think they did a nice job of looking at the stuff we did, though it\u2019s not identically our model, it\u2019s closing certainly has the major effects in there, and a good understanding of the time and mix we anticipate seeing and the price ranges. So maybe that helps a little bit. We\u2019re going to spend a lot more time next week walking you through this, but hopefully that\u2019s a start on the problem.","Scott Herren","Saket, the other thing that I would add to that is, I think mix is a bigger effect on ARPs right now than it will be longer term, you just need to look at the ARPs for maintenance and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s far more steady, because it\u2019s a much bigger base of maintenance subs, so as the base grows, mix will become slightly less important. I think longer term, the more important metric than ARPs is ARR, and so one of the things we\u2019ll look to do is provide you better insight into where we think ARR is headed, so that ARPs calculation becomes slightly less sensitive. ","Carl Bass","Next question operator. Karen are you there? Okay, we seem to have lost the operator. Hang on one second while we try to reconnect to her and see if we can keep the Q&A moving.","Scott Herren","This is a first for me of all the earnings calls I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had this happen.","Operator","I\u2019m here now. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steve Ashley","I would just like to ask on the promotion, if you could give us some color on how much of that might have been direct versus indirect and what role the e-store might have played in the performance there?","Scott Herren","Yes Steve, the promotions, you know Carl laid out the success of the 43,000 subs that came through the promotions. It was almost entirely driven through the channel versus through the e-store.","Steve Ashley","Okay, perfect, and then I would just like to ask about collections and I realize they have not been out very long, but with that you introduced multiuser pricing and that's kind of the first time that's been out there. Wondering if you've gotten any early response to that or if there is any early color you can provide on that new pricing option.","Carl Bass","You know it's still early. We're trying to replicate some of the things that we had in the previous model. But really I mean it's only a quarter worth of data, so we'll update it more as we go through next year. But we know it is one of the things that customers really want. It's one of the important things you know that whole middle bulk of our customer base has multiple seats , and while we offer lots of flexible offerings for people with large number of seats through the EBAs, people are also looking for it in here, so we\u2019ll update you as we go.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs.","Shateel Alam","Hi, this is Shateel Alam filling in for Heather. Thanks for taking my question. First question was just on new model ARR. That increased by 43 million, I'm not sure if you specifically broke out what the MDS impact was for specifically new model, but first could you break that out and then also last quarter\u2019s new model ARR increased by 63 million, we're expecting it to increase in size again this quarter, going forward now that your subscription only should we expect new model ARR increase of each quarter to get larger?","Scott Herren","Yes Shateel, the overall amounts that ARR was affected by the allocation of MBF, again MBF not a new program, but it\u2019s the first time it's really been heavily allocated, exclusively allocated to recurring revenues that\u2019s why we're seeing the impacts so pronounced in this quarter, it was about 40 million on the overall, if you split that between how much was allocated to new model versus maintenance. It's about 6 percentage points on a year on year basis about six percentage points of growth for the MBF impact on new models and about two percentage points of growth reduced by MBF being allocated to maintenance. So overall it was three points, but if you split it between the two it was about six on new model and about two on maintenance.","Shateel Alam","I just had one follow up on collection. Suites used to represent 30% of your revenues, I'm wondering over time do you expect Collections to also end up representing 30% of total new model ARR and how long do you think it would take for that to ramp to that level?","Carl Bass","My best guess is that it will be less because of the additional offerings we'll have with you know the cloud offerings and the consumption services tied to things like collections, so I think it will be less, but not substantially so.","Operator","Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Jay [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Carl, I'd like to ask you, for my first question a technology question stemming from [indiscernible] University a couple weeks ago, particularly if you could try some of your technology disclosures from two weeks ago to the longer term business implication, in other words, you have some very interesting things to say I thought about your future architecture with the quantum project, you talked about. There are numerous references to what you talked about as a common data environment, new architecture and so forth. So talk about the commercial implication and commercial plans for that as you showed two weeks ago and what that needs for the next number of years in terms of the business model? And then a selling follow up question.","Carl Bass","Yes, sure Jay [ph]. I mean this goes back a number of years, we have firm believe that engineering software is going to move to the cloud, all design and engineering software will be in the cloud. We started to demonstrate that with the number of products we talked about some like BIM 360, we\u2019ve shown kind of the basic architecture with products like Fusion 360 and how they take advantage of the connectivity and the compute power of the cloud. So we started to demonstrate that and we started investing in this area three or four years ago.","As I have said before while everybody is rightfully focused on the business model transition of our existing business and how we are using it to attract new customers, what I think people will must be surprise about as you look out the next couple of years, if the size of the cloud business that we build, and how we really expands our TAM.","So we are going to spend a bunch of time next week showing a little bit more, you were at AU and got to see it, we\u2019ll try to put kind of a an investor look on it, so that people next week can understand what we are doing and what the important is, and why we are investing in the cloud and why this really is the next generation architecture.","I have talked in the past about being a place for collaboration as well as giving access to virtually unlimited amounts of compute power which is something our uses demand and so it\u2019s just a natural fit. It's unusual that engineering has been one of the slowest to move to the cloud, but we see lots of evidence of hitting the tipping point, not just in the U.S. but other places in terms of customers willingness to adopt it. And so next you\u2019ll hear a bunch more.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Gregg Moskowitz from Cowen and Company.","Gregg Moskowitz","Carl, thanks for the additional information on ARPs during your prepared remarks, having said that given where you are today, you do have a lot of grounds and make up to reach 24% ARR CAGR by fiscal '20, can you elaborate on what gives you the confidence that you get there?","Carl Bass","Part of it is -- the calculation method we chose gives great certainty and repeatability, it's very auditable, but it is a method that can greatly understate the amount of revenue coming in. So one of the things we do and we\u2019ll walk you through this example, but what we actually do is we take the revenue that comes in for the quarter, the recognized revenue which if it's particularly back end loaded, can be close to zero, and we divide it by the number of subscribers at the end of the quarter. So in the extreme if somebody -- so for example, I\u2019ll use one example that\u2019ll illustrate two points, the promotions were very heavily backend loaded.","So you have a low phase offering that\u2019s discounted, coming in very close to the end. So what you might get out of that is one day out of 91 worth of revenue, we\u2019ll call it four days out of 365 or slightly less than 1% of the revenue that that subscription is worth, but we divide it by a whole subscriber. So it greatly under stakes the value.","Even as we go through this it will normalize as Scott mentioned because the numbers come up -- the numbers get larger and you\u2019ll get the same effect moving from quarter-to-quarter. In the beginning it's very sensitive to mix its very sensitive is to timing. So we\u2019re ahead of our plans from where we want to be and while I understand that some people are paying lots of attention to ARPs, I think the better thing to look at going forward and we\u2019ve tried to stress it as ARR, as Scott mentioned we\u2019ll start giving you guidance on ARR and on the ARPs one we\u2019ll start breaking it out so you don\u2019t have to be guessing at the co-efficients between what\u2019s in cloud, what\u2019s in EBA, what\u2019s in product subscriptions and even in the subset that's something like the legacy promotion.","We think we can help you understand that a little better, again I'll tell you again one of the reasons we gave the numbers in the middle of the prepared remarks about like-for-like was to show you the increase in pricing that we were seeing and that was both -- there were some numbers that were quarter-over-quarter and somewhat year-over-year and we\u2019ll detail that a little bit more next week at Investor Day, so you can see the thing. And what we think is the like-for-like is the best comparison.","Gregg Moskowitz","Okay, perfect. Thanks for that detail and I agree that will be helpful and I look forward to that. And then just one for Scott, any update on the timing to potentially change the segment classifications on product subscriptions and EBAs from the hybrid approach to 100% subscription on the income statement?","Scott Herren","Yes, Gregg fast enough [ph] on that. I would love to have that done now. I think I mentioned on this call last quarter the complication we\u2019re doing it is, it\u2019s not the revenue side, it\u2019s the cog side. We working that very carefully, so the goal will be to end up with three revenue lines instead of the two that we have today, because I recognize the confusion it causes. The three lines would be one for maintenance revenue, one for subscription revenue which ties the new model and one for kind of license and other. As there will still be a small amount of license revenue that comes in. We\u2019ll have to go through of course it carve up differed revenue and then new revenue going forward, so my goal is to get that done as quickly as possible, I'd look to roll that out next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley.","Stan Zlotsky","This is actually Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith. Thank you for taking our questions. So how much of the churn on maintenance subscription base was driven from maintenance subscribers moving over to desktop subscribers, and a quick follow up what happening with OEM and what are you thinking with the latest on pricing for the maintenance and enticing those customers to move over to become full product subscribers? Thank you.","Carl Bass","So on the first part we don\u2019t know exactly, we use an estimation method that's fairly manual in order to do this and so we\u2019ll try to explain this a little bit next week, but we don\u2019t actually know exactly how many set through manual process. And we don\u2019t automated it because that will make less and less sense going forward. ","While I think I understand the second question was about conversions of the programs?","Stan Zlotsky","Yes it\u2019s actually, are you driving pricing increases to entice people to move over from maintenance or are they doing it voluntarily through seeing a greater value proposition of those products or is there a third option [multiple speakers] thinking about?","Carl Bass","I think both on right now, and an ongoing basis it\u2019s going to be a combo of the two. We\u2019ve some incentives to move people forward we choose to go early. But a lot of it is a value in the new offering, which is the latest and includes large aspects of the cloud in it and gives you those additional flexibilities. So we think there will be a little bit of a push and a little bit of a pull.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Davis from Canaccord.","Richard Davis ","If I\u2019m a firm that\u2019s decided the switch to the cloud, to what extend should we thinking about -- is there any risk because this happened with Oracle to some degree, is there any risk that I would consider other cloud option, I mean obviously yes, but have you seen any kind of data that would say, that\u2019s an issue or is more just like, listen we\u2019re going to switch and when we switch I have all my model in Autodesk so I\u2019m just going to go to your new model? Thanks. ","Carl Bass","On the cloud stuff Richard, in terms of having mature viable cloud products to both the AC industry and manufacturing. We\u2019re really the only one that have it. You can look out and see some small startups that barely having interaction. We probably have three orders of magnitude, may be four orders of magnitude more usage in the cloud then they do. ","So I think for people who are deciding that the cloud has real benefits, I think Autodesk is the natural choice. We\u2019ve detailed a little bit at previous times, where we said, more than half and sometimes it was three quarters of the users of Fusion are coming from other mechanical CAD packages.","So it\u2019s not just our users, who are adding on cloud capabilities, it\u2019s really to attract new users. The second part of it is, one of the things we did when we introduced our cloud products is we made sure they weren\u2019t only direct competitors with what we already did. But it was to extend the market. So if you look at BIM 360, BIM 360 wasn\u2019t a replacement for Revit, it was to extend having model based design go all the way out to the job site and reach all the construction workers.","Those are the kind of things we\u2019re trying to do, is expand the reach of our products, because of the more natural platform. And I think you\u2019ve seen the same things in other parts of enterprise software with SaaS offerings, where people are expanding into parts of the company, that their legacy applications would have never go to. And I think it\u2019s identical in the design and engineering world.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from a line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty ","Carl, your prepared remarks you did touch upon the infrastructure possibility in terms of the new administration. Can you level set for us if you were to just give us a rough estimate, what percentage of the Autodesk business at this point is infrastructure related and how should we think about that within the U.S.?","Carl Bass","You know just for construction or broadly speaking the AC business, think of it as roughly around 50% and then you can take the fraction that's the U.S. part of that and go from there. And of course Mexico's going to be building the wall, so I guess we can extend to the rest of North America. So that's about the reach of it, you know it's the American part which is about a quarter on about 50%, something like that. I'd put it in the 10% to 15% range. ","Sterling Auty ","Okay fair enough and then can you give us an update, so you touched upon the e-store a couple of times, the Analyst Day last year you talked about a lot of the improvements that you were making in North America the initiatives to move international with the e-store, where are you on those initiatives and you know are you at a point yet where you can start to break out how much of the revenue is actually coming through the e-store.","Scott Herren","Tell you what Carl I'll start and you can jump in. We have -- of course e-stores everywhere, we\u2019ve launched our own e-stores now across North America and in most of Europe. The e-store continues to grow. We talked about the proportion of our sales that were direct versus indirect grew to the high 20s this quarter, I think 29% up sequentially from 25% just last quarter and 17% a year ago.","So it continues to grow as a proportion of total sales and I think we'll continue to see that happen not so much because we're guiding people there, it's that style -- when you get to a subscription model buying direct is a style of interaction that customers want to have with the company much more so than when I renewed my subscription to the Wall Street Journal, I don't walk down to a bookstore to do that. I go to WSJ.com and do that renewal and I think we're going to see more of that business move in that direction.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question you know how much revenue in the quarter came from indirect channel and where do you think channels could be as percentage of revenue over the next couple of years.","Scott Herren","Yes, Monika that's the data point I was just trying to give. So the direct channel in the quarter was 29% of sales and up from 25% last quarter, where that goes longer term it actually is a topic that we'll talk about again next week, but I don't think our view has changed much from the perspective that we had a year ago, which was as we get off the fiscal '20 we think the channel continues to be a significant part of our sales in terms of absolute dollars we think there are more dollars of sales going through the channel in fiscal '20 than there were in fiscal '16. But in terms of a percent of pie, the percent of the total sales that get done, it'll be a smaller percent by the time we get out there.","So I think we'll see a case where the channel has a place where absolute dollars of revenue growth, by the way probably fewer channel partners out there than we have today, so it's a more profitable business for the channel partners that remain but as a percent of product sales it will come down pretty significantly from where it is.","Monika Garg","Got you, thanks. I have a question, on the final call Carl you talked about a lot of question on that already on the call. So if I look Q-over-Q ask for new model are down almost 10% in spite of the fact that collections were slow on subscription due to higher our revenue of per suite items, so why would that be the case and then, seven straight quarters of ARPs for new model being down?","Carl Bass","Generally speaking we have continued to add lower price products as we build this out. We started with the lot of EBA, we started with a lot of transactions going through the e-store. But we also went through, when you have backend loaded quarters, you greatly understate the value of that subscription. It's why during the thing I try to breakout how the prices were increasing for like-for-like products going forward. And I think that\u2019s going to be an important one. What you are getting is, you\u2019re trying to look at in average and guess the component pieces and rather than having you guess what we said we would do next year, is break it out so that you can actually see. In the interim what we did is we gave you some numbers for showing that the prices are actually increasing, even if the calculation methodology in the mix is heading down.","As we said just some of the mix issues were responsible for 50% of the decline, so mixing time plays a big role here and remember how I just described that calculation that if you buy something at the end of the quarter for example on the last day, it greatly undervalues what that subscription is worth over the long term. At the quarter end which we had a fair amount of promotion and the promotion was backed loaded, you are going to see that. But I\u2019ll reemphasis again, the prices of like-for-like, for people buying the same thing that they bought last quarter or a year ago, those prices are going up significantly. And I highlighted how they were going up significantly across the world.","Scott Herren","Yes, Monika what I would add, and again we will spend more time on this next week. If you go back to new model subscription sales a year ago, it was a small number, they were largely in mature markets, healthy mix of monthly and annual as well as many of them came through the e-store, the channel is still largely focused on selling perpetual licenses at that point. What we have seen over the last several quarters is a pretty significant uptake of new model subscription sales and I am talking about products subscription sales now, pretty significant uptake of those in emerging markets, which I think is healthy for the business.","Certainly I would expect some of those to be recapture of pirates in those emerging markets, but as that happens of course those are lower priced, so that\u2019s a headwind on ARPs. We see a lot more long term sales of product and lot less monthly, frankly we had a lot of tow dippers coming in monthly previously, previously we now have a lot more annual and multi-year.","Again good for the business, but that monthly subscription price is about 50% higher than the annual subscription price, the monthly times 12 is about 50% more than annually. So that mix shift again good for the business not necessarily good for ARPs, it\u2019s a headwinds, and then as the channel has gotten really engaged and is driving this, so a higher proportion of the sales of products subs come through the channel then a year ago were many of that things sold off to e-store again I think that's a positive for the business it gives us scale but it cuts into ARPs. So three trends that are very positive for our business and positive for the long-term ARR growth, but all that cut against growing ARPs in the short-term.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup.","Ken Wong ","Carl you mentioned the convergence of maintenance and rentals early and I think you might have been heading down the path on one of the earlier questions, but could you give us some color on some of the moving pieces of that particular convergence?","Carl Bass","Yes, there are number of things that we've talked about. So one is if you look out to kind of call it FY\u201920 we want to be in a place where first of all we have really a single kind of offerings with a single back office and infrastructure to support it. One that will be a combination of subscriptions, product subscriptions as you see it plus a consumption model on top of it. That's where we see the business heading.","Along the way it's how do we motivate customers to move from one model to another that\u2019s actually in the program, what are the price points, how does that transition working and we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about this next week. But in our mind getting to a single model is really important, it will give the best service to our customers it will be the most affordable us to have, we can start getting rid of some of the systems that were designed for a different era and be able to really concentrate on giving a world class experience for what users are trying to do today.","So as we go through the next couple of years we\u2019ll talk about how we do that and how we do that the most prudence and responsible way.","Ken Wong","Got it, looking forward to next weekend then. And then building on Stan's question around maintenance and just renewal, any rough sense of the magnitude of renewal that are coming up in Q4 relative to Q3?","Scott Herren","Yes, sure Ken. So renewals tend to be on the anniversary of when the license was sold and of course Q4 as far has been our biggest quarter, we've sold the most perpetual licenses over -- if you look back over the last several years we saw the most in Q4. So we have a significant renewal base that comes up during Q4 that I would go back though and highlight what Carl mentioned in the script, renewal rate is actually stronger this year than it was last year.","So yes we're seeing a decline to the absolute numbers, but it's not driven by decline in renewal rate, it's driven by the rate at which the maintenance agreements come up for renewal and then in some cases we are incentivizing them and successfully moving them over to new model.","Carl Bass","Yes, we\u2019ll also see an effect in Q4 some people moving to EBAs. As we've talked about we are really encouraging our large customers to move to EBAs and there is an issue in which we don\u2019t count the subscribers until the following quarter. You might have seen this in Q1 of this year and the same phenomena will go on.","So particularly if someone goes from being a large maintenance customer to an EBA customer you will see some of that attendance to depress the number of maintenance customers and you will see the corresponding increase, but you won\u2019t see it till Q1.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities.","Steve Koenig","I apologize if this question has been asked, hopefully it hasn\u2019t. I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your expectation for subscriber -- subscription counts, which implies acceleration in the out years. May be if you could give us a little color on -- or a ranking of the factors that will drive that, when you think about things like piracy and cloud et cetera. What\u2019s going to drive that acceleration that you guys are looking for and to what extend are you starting to see those things kick in?","Carl Bass","So in the kind of the existing business, what we\u2019re really looking for is the three places we saw at this time, one was legacy, one is piracy and one is new customers. And I think we\u2019ve seen this effectiveness. We\u2019ve been able to detail the effectiveness of the legacy programs very specifically. Piracy is a little bit harder, unlike legacy where people claim to be a legacy customer, people don\u2019t claim to be former pirates. So it make it a little bit difficult to identify them as former pirates, but we do have our ways. I expect to see more from that and like we said about a third of the customers coming are new customers.","In terms of the other things that we see is, good growth amongst our enterprise customers in terms of EBA\u2019s in the size of those and then the whole new category of cloud customers and consumption. So you both have cloud customers and then consumption models where people kind pay as they go for various services. Many of them will be tired directly to cloud products but many will be consumption, based into things like the Collections. So for example if someone is doing simulation or rendering in a collection, they will get some amount with it and if they wanted use extra they will pay as they go. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re expecting to see that.","Steve Koenig ","Got it, I\u2019ll leave it at that, thanks Carl. ","Carl Bass","And next week you\u2019ll see a bunch more about it, but right now our cloud business is doing incredibly quickly, we\u2019re really pleased with the growth we\u2019re seeing in the cloud business. We\u2019ll talk more about which customers we\u2019re getting with the cloud business and why that expands the margin.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. ","Brent Thill","Carl you mentioned a third of the subscribers are now coming from new customers. I\u2019m curious what may be most surprising to you, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of switchers from the competition, Greenfield, old users, pirate, how do you put the community together and highlight where you seeing the strongest numbers of new users coming into the platform?","Carl Bass","I probably put in, probably in that category, I have to guess, like I said, right now we\u2019re doing a bunch of manual work to figure out all the new customers, how many were really free [ph] we\u2019ve seen before versus those who pirated the software. So we\u2019re trying to understand that dynamic a little bit more, and then we\u2019ll talk a little bit more about that.","As a rough guess, one of the ways to think about it, we\u2019ve talked about this before. For every legitimate user out there, there is about one, slightly more than one user who's not paying for the software, so my guess would be, as we made some of these offerings more affordable from an upfront perspective we're attracting a fair number of the pirates. So the piracy base is probably bigger than we originally anticipated, you know kind of last year when we laid out these goals.","The second thing is the legacy base is probably bigger than we laid out last year at this time. We saw it in terms of the distribution throughout the years again you know the mid-point is again around seven years. So we're seeing a fair number of people who are historical users. So on both those fronts we're kind of pleased. You know the Greenfield is a little harder to identify for certain, the other ones we have a better chance at, but we'll give you a little bit more color on this as we go and we get the numbers. ","Like I said at a certain point it won't actually matter, but we are looking at both piracy as well as maintenance customers who are moving over.","Brent Thill","And just a quick follow up, you've been talking a lot about you know the make process, you can bill it, but then you got to make it and you mentioned in the past it hasn't been a big -- maybe as big a piece of revenue could be a lot bigger in the business. Can you maybe just update us in terms of what you're seeing on that core area?","Carl Bass","Yes. So for example you know a lot of -- I mean we're seeing a number there, in the AC area you know particularly with products like BIM 360, BIM 360 really is communicating with all of our nontraditional customers involved in the process. If things like our structural analysis software for the architects and engineers BIM 360 encompasses the entire workflow, all the way from architects to general contractors, to subcontractors and next week we'll go through a bunch of deal, a bunch of what we're doing there and how it's reaching people that are actually on the construction site, building stuff.","When you look at the other things like manufacturing Fusion 360 as well as all of our advanced manufacturing products are really very specifically about you know the next part of the process, I\u2019ve kind of joked, but we're helping people make beautiful digital prototypes things that stay on that side of the glass, but you know our customers get paid for making real things. And so what we started doing a number of years ago is starting to helping them in that process, of taking it from one side of the screen to the other side of the screen and we have you know lots of stuff going on in composite materials, a lot we have going on with machining, communicating on the factory floor as well as the construction site, those are all expansions of the market and we'll spend a fair amount of time.","We generally spend most of our time and probably appropriately so, as people have been very interested in the business model transition, but like I said this is a growing and very important part of the business and as people look you know to the next couple of years they\u2019ll become increasingly important. So we'll give you some more details.","Operator","Thank you, and that concludes our question and answer session for today, I would like to turn the conference back over to Autodesk management for any closing comments.","David Gennarelli","Thanks Karen, that will conclude our call today, as Carl mentioned we do have our Investor Day next week, next Tuesday the 6th, it's going to be at our gallery in San Francisco and after that we'll be at the Barclays conference in San Francisco on December 8th, if you need to reach me, you can reach me at 415-507-6033 or email me with any questions.

All non-GAAP numbers referenced in today's call are reconciled in the press release of slide presentation on our Investor Relations Web site.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Abhey. Our great momentum from the first quarter carried into the second quarter resulting in strong performance with revenue, billings, earnings, and free cash flow coming in ahead of expectations. We also crossed the $3 billion mark on ARR for the first time, which was driven by solid performance across all regions and products. Our last 12 months free cash flow of $731 million is the highest amount of free cash flow we have ever generated in a four-quarter period in the company's history. We performed well in the first-half of the year demonstrating focused execution and the strength of our recurring revenue model.","Although we continue to execute well and are not materially impacted by current trade tensions and macro conditions, we are aware of the current business and geopolitical environment that is causing uncertainty in the market. As we look across the next six months, we are taking a prudent approach to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '20. However, we think the uncertainty caused by macro-related events is only a short-term issue. We remain confident in our ability to achieve the fiscal '23 goals we have laid out for you. Our confidence is grounded in the value delivered by our products, their ability to help our customers differentiate via innovation and digitization, focused execution delivered by our partners and sales teams, and the significant strides we are making to capture the non-paying user community.","I would also like to point out that although there are headlines of some impact from the current environment on a few industry verticals, like manufacturing, we outgrew competitors and gained share in this space. The construction industry is also holding steady, and continues to invest in innovative solutions, and we saw ongoing strength in construction this quarter. Before I offer you more color on strategic highlights during the quarter, let me first turn it over to Scott to give you more details on our second quarter results, as well as details of our updated fiscal '20 guidance. I'll then return with further insights on the key drivers of our business, including construction, manufacturing, and digital transformation before we open it up for Q&A.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Andrew. As Andrew mentioned, revenue, billings, earnings, and free cash flow all performed ahead of expectation during the second quarter. Overall demand in our end markets was solid during the quarter, as indicated by our strong billings and revenue growth. Growth was driven by both volume and pricing, which is a result of the strong uptake of our products by new users, as well as increased usage with existing customers. Sales volume of AutoCAD LT also remained strong. This has historically been a leading indicator of potential demand slowdown. And as you can see, revenue from our AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products grew 31% in the second quarter. AEC and manufacturing revenue rose 37% and 20% respectively.","Geographically we saw broad based strength across all regions. Revenue grew 32% in the Americas, 27% in EMEA, and 33% in APAC, with strength across almost all countries. We also saw strength in direct revenue, which rose 38% versus last year, and represented 30% of our total sales, up from 28% in the second quarter of last year. Before I comment on ARR, I want to remind you of how we define it. ARR is the annualized value of our actual recurring revenue for the quarter, or said another way, is the reported recurring revenue for the quarter multiplied by four. Total ARR of $3.1 billion continued to grow steadily, and was up 31%. Adjusting for our fourth quarter acquisitions total ARR was up 27%. Within core, ARR growth was roughly in line with total organic growth, and was driven by the strength in product subscriptions.","In Cloud, ARR grew 175%, propelled by our strong performance in construction. Excluding $98 million of ARR from our fourth quarter acquisitions, growth in organic cloud ARR, which is primarily made up of BIM 360 and Fusion 360, increased from 43% in the first quarter to 45%, which is a record for that product set. We continue to make progress in our Maintenance to Subscription, or M2S program. The M2S conversion rate of the maintenance renewal opportunities migrating to product subscriptions was in the high 30% range in Q2, which is higher than our historical rate. This uptick in the conversion rate was in line with expectations as our maintenance renewal prices went up by 20% in the second quarter, which made it significantly more advantageous for customers to move to subscription. Of those that migrated, upgrade rates among eligible subscriptions remain within the historical range of 25% to 35%.","Now, moving to net revenue retention rate, during Q2 the rate continued to be within the range of approximately 110% to 120%, and we expect it to be in this range for the remainder of fiscal '20. As a reminder, the net revenue retention rate measures the year-over-year change in ARR for the population of customers that existed one year ago or base customers. It's calculated by dividing the current period ARR related to those base customers by the total ARR from those customers one year ago. Moving to billings, we had $893 million of billings during the quarter, up 48%. The growth in billings was driven by strength in new customer billings and strong renewals with continued momentum in our core products. And as we have said in prior quarters in line with our plans, billings are also benefiting from a return to more normalized levels from multi-year agreements.","Remaining Performance Obligations or RPO, which in the past we have referred to as total deferred revenue is the sum of both billed and unbilled deferred revenue, and rose 28% versus last year, and 3% sequentially to $2.8 billion. Current RPO, which represents the future revenues under contract expected to be recognized over the next 12 months was little over $2 billion, an increase of 23%.","On the margin front, we realized significant operating leverage as we continue to execute in the growth phase of our journey. Non-GAAP gross margins of 92% were up two percentage points versus last year. Our disciplined approach to expense management combined with revenue growth enabled us to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by 14 percentage points to 23%, while absorbing two meaningful acquisitions. We realized significant leverage from our investments in sales and marketing and R&D initiatives during the quarter, and are on track to deliver significant margin expansions in fiscal '20 and further expand non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 40% in fiscal 2023.","Moving to free cash flow, we generated $205 million in Q2. Over the last 12 months, we've generated a record $731 million of free cash flow, driven by growing net income and strong billings. Lastly, we continue to repurchase shares with our excess cash, which is consistent with our capital allocation strategy. During the second quarter, we repurchased 253,000 shares for $40 million at an average price of $159.54 per share. Almost all of our repurchase activity during the quarter was through our 10b5-1 plan, which we entered into before the most recent market volatility.","Now I'll turn the discussion to our outlook. I'll start by saying that our view of global economic conditions and their impact on our business has been updated to reflect the current state of various trade disputes and the geopolitical environment and their potential impact on our customers. While we have not seen any material impact to our business, we are taking a prudent stance regarding customer spending environments in the U.K. due to Brexit, Central Europe due to a slowdown in the manufacturing industry there, and China due to trade tensions. These items individually are not material headwinds, but in aggregate are responsible for our guidance adjustment, which now reflects our current views based on what we know about the environment today.","Our pipeline remains strong globally, including in these regions, we began noticing some changes in demand environments in these areas toward the end of July. As such, for these affected areas, we feel it's appropriate to adjust our expectations for the rest of the year. As you'll soon hear from Andrew, customers continue to increase their spending on our products even in these areas and our renewal rates are fairly steady. Additionally, we are now assuming more billings will occur later in the quarter for the remainder of the year.","At the midpoint of our updated guidance, we're calling for revenue and ARR growth to be approximately 27% and 26% respectively, which speaks to the resiliency of our model versus prior cycles. The wider the normal range of our full-year guidance is a result of the greater uncertainty we're expecting over the second-half of the year. Additionally, currency now offers a headwind of about $10 million to our full-year revenues versus being neutral at the beginning of the year. As such, the low-end of our updated constant currency guidance is in line with the low-end of our initial outlook we shared with you at the beginning of the year, and it also reflects the potential for a slight deterioration in the environment from the current level.","While our billings guidance has come down by about $50 million, billings are still expected to grow by approximately 50% or 40% after adjusting for the adoption of ASC 606 last year. This supports our view of strong demand for our products even in uncertain environments. Regarding free cash flow, the $50 million adjustments to $1.3 billion is primarily a result of our updated view of billings and their timing. We expect to achieve our original target of $1.35 billion trailing 12 months free cash flow during the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and while it's too early to give you a detailed color on fiscal 2021, we expect to continue growing billings, revenues, and free cash flows while expanding our margins. This is supported by what we're seeing in North America, especially in AEC, where our pipeline remains strong and we have more visibility into our business within Central Europe and China. Construction is also performing very well as we continue to increase the value we're bringing to our customers, and we continue to make strides with capturing revenue from non-paying users.","Looking at our guidance for the third quarter, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million and we expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 to $0.74. Third quarter free cash flow is expected to be modestly above second quarter. The earnings slide deck on the Investor Relations section of our Web site has more details, as well as modeling assumptions for fiscal '20.","In summary, I want to remind everyone that since our business model shift, we have moved to a much more resilient business model that generates a very steady stream of revenue that is less exposed to macro swings than when we were selling perpetual licenses. So while we are adjusting our fiscal '20 guidance slightly, we're still expecting revenue growth of 27% for the year, margin expansion of about 12 percentage points, and we're confident of delivering on our fiscal '23 targets.","Now I'd like to turn it back to Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Scott. As you heard me, we delivered very strong performance in the first-half of the year, and despite negative headlines from Europe and manufacturing, we are still seeing strong demand for our solutions.","For example, a large European automobile company recently signed a new three-year Enterprise Business Agreement or EBA despite a more challenging macro backdrop for their industry. They see the new agreement as an investment design, and they know innovation is needed to stay ahead of the competition. They view Autodesk as a market leader in this area and counting us to provide new innovative design solutions such as generative design. The EBA also offers for them the flexibility to access our entire product portfolio, including products ranging from manufacturing and agency collections to Alias, 3Ds Max, Maya, and Walt, while at the same time representing a more than a 130% increase in annual contract value for us.","We will continue to partner with them to ensure that they get maximum value out of our products and remain a leader in an industry that is undergoing significant change. Our customers know that at the end of every downturn is an upturn, and if they don't continue to innovate and use the latest technology tools throughout the cycle, they will be at a distinct disadvantage when growth returns. This underscores the importance of our products regardless of the macro environment as well as our customer's commitment to investing in technology to stay ahead as competitors.","Now, let me give you an update on some key strategic growth initiatives, we are focused on, specifically our continued traction with construction, gains in manufacturing, and leveraging our digital transformation to capture the opportunity within our non-paying user base. These initiatives are key drivers of both our near and long-term business. In construction, BIM 360 was the primary driver of our organic growth in cloud led by BIM 360 Design & Build. Our customers are continually finding value in this offering, and the PlanGrid team continues to see strong momentum. For example, Tutor Perini, one of the largest general contractors in the U.S. selected PlanGrid over some competitor offerings for two 500 million key projects. The team wanted to provide real-time up-to-date documentation and plans to the field. Senior management for these projects had used PlanGrid before at a different firm, and this relationship provided an opportunity to demonstrate plan for its capabilities for these two projects.","PlanGrid set up the projects by processing the drawings and pulling out title block information categorizing the drawings with tag and hyper-looking detail call-outs for 2,000 drawings in under an hour. This was an immediate time savings for Tutor Perini. Additionally, the field teams have access to new drawings, changes, RFIs, and some middles right away, and an easy-to-use interface. Going forward, we continue to look for opportunities to partner with Tutor Perini across all of their products and subsidiaries.","BuildingConnected and Assemble also performed well as we continue to focus on integrating these offerings. During the quarter, we integrated BuildingConnected's bid management solution with PlanGrid technology, enabling the seamless transfer of data from pre-construction to the building process. The integration allows construction project managers to automatically push design and pre-construction files from BuildingConnected to PlanGrid, saving time, reducing errors and further enhancing the cost savings associated with using both platforms. And as you recall, we integrated Revit with PlanGrid with the launch of PlanGrid BIM last quarter and have received tremendously positive feedback from customers regarding the update. In the first quarter after its release, the product is also being used in over 650 projects by more than 300 customers. These integrations are steady steps towards providing Autodesk construction customers with integrated workflows that connect the office, trailer, and field.","We are also continuing to see outstanding cross-selling with our recent construction acquisitions. For example, during the quarter, [indiscernible], an existing Autodesk customer expanded its relationship by adding BuildingConnected and Assemble solutions to reduce the time to open new locations and downtime to the construction updates and existing locations. And as a reminder, infrastructure is an area that we have seen in the past performed well during macro-related slowdowns, and we continue to focus efforts in this area. This quarter we secured a new Enterprise Business Agreement with Gannett Fleming. Gannett Fleming is a leading global engineering and architecture firm ranked Number 35 on the ENR top 500 design list. The Gannett Fleming Executive team considers a strategic partnership with Autodesk to be a distinct competitive advantage. With the EBA, Gannett Fleming now has direct access not only to the full portfolio of Autodesk technology, but also to a wide range of Autodesk services and expertise that will help them achieve their corporate growth and market expansion goals.","On the manufacturing front, revenue grew 20% in the second quarter, despite a more challenging manufacturing environment in Europe. Customers are seeing the benefits of our differentiated solution, and we continue to gain market share, while displacing competitive offerings in this space. For example, during the second quarter, a leading Swiss watchmaker selected Autodesk design and manufacturing collection to replace SolidWorks, given the flexibility offered by solutions. In addition, our investments in general design and Fusion 360 have resulted in competitive displacements not only in the CAD market, but also in the Computer Aided Manufacturing or CAM space with our lower barrier to switching vendors. As a result, we see displacements of competitors like Mastercam, and once we're embedded in those customer's downstream processes, we are increasingly penetrating design activities within those same accounts. Customers pick Fusion over competitive offerings due to its integrated CAD\/CAM functionality, its compatibility with other CAD tools, ease-of-use, and attractive pricing model.","Now let's talk about progress with our digital transformation. Many of you recall that a key part of this transformation will increase the insight we have on our non-compliant user base. One of the initiatives we undertook to accomplish this started last year and has given us the ability to analyze usage patterns of our non-compliant users. Since last year, we have analyzed significant amount of data on these users, including how long they use the software and how their journey traverses across non-compliant usage to downloading free trials or using student additions. With this data, we can test different ways to convert them, including in-product messaging and leveraging our inside sales team. While still early in the conversion process, we have an increasing amount of data that allows us to take necessary actions to convert this large pool of potential customers.","In the quarter, we expanded our pilot cases for in-product messaging to many international regions, and enhanced our license compliance initiatives using our sales teams as well as being email campaigns. These conversions resulted in multiple deals, including two over a $1 million, one of which was in China. Our billings from license compliance initiatives were up by approximately 65% versus last year, although on a small base. So, as you've heard, we made great progress this quarter that enabled us to finish the first-half of the year strong. We continue to execute well in construction, where IT spending remains strong. We are making competitive inroads and manufacturing with our innovative solutions and are making strides in converting the current 14 million non-paying users into subscribers. We are highly confident in Autodesk's ability to capitalize on our large market opportunity, and are committed to delivering our fiscal '23 goals.","With that, Operator, we'd now like to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.","Saket Kalia","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here.","Andrew Anagnost","Hi, Saket.","Saket Kalia","Hey, Scott. Hey, Andrew. Hey, Andrew, maybe just to start with you, slightly higher level question on the macro, I know we spoke about some of the regional items that we've seen, whether it was the U.K., China or Central Europe, but I want to maybe think about the macro from a different lens. Clearly a lot of concern out there about the manufacturing economy, and as we know, not all of Autodesk's business is levered to the manufacturing space, but for the part that is, can you just give us some color on the verticals that Autodesk sells into, whether that's auto or aerospace for example, just to sort of get a sense for where Autodesk kind of sits with regards to different sub-segments of manufacturing specifically?","Scott Herren","Hi, Saket. Before we jump into that, I'd like to clear out something. We've heard that there's some confusion in our guidance metrics from the press release footnotes. So, and what our current guidance for free cash flow for fiscal '20 is $1.3 billion, we get there by saying free cash flow -- or cash flow from operations will be $1.37 billion, you'd net out $70 million of free cash flow to get to $1.3 billion. So, I think the footnote created confusion that the $1.3 billion wasn't already netted for CapEx. It is. So it's $1.37 billion before CapEx as cash flow from ops, $1.3 billion is the free cash flow guide for the year. Okay, go ahead.","Saket Kalia","That's helpful. Thanks, Scott.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, it's good to clarify. So, let me address your question about verticals in manufacturing in particular. All right, first off, just let me just frame a few things. Our manufacturing business actually did pretty well. We grew 20%, a lot better than any of our competitors. That has a lot to do with the way we're diversified. It also has a lot to do with the price points and the upfront -- the reduced upfront cost of our offerings are pretty attractive to a lot of people, and we're also seeing acceleration in the CAM space due to the Fusion 360 portfolio and the way it integrates design and CAM along with the generative capability. So, we're seeing pretty strong performance in manufacturing, but to your point about which verticals we are exposed, our biggest vertical in manufacturing is what we call industrial machinery, and this is machinery of all manner and type. It's machines you'll see inside automotive factories, but it's also machines you see that package cereal or to wrap toys, or to do any manner of things, make paper, and large industrial machines. It's our single biggest segment.","Another really big segment for us is what's called building product manufacturers, and these are the people that build things that go into buildings, and they're also the people that build things that hang on buildings and prefabricate components of buildings, so think doors and windows manufacturers, think air conditioner manufacturers, think curtain wall manufacturers if you understand how skyscrapers are made.","Our smallest level exposure is actually in the auto and aero space, where other competitors have deeper exposure in terms of the engineering processes. We are definitely big in auto in some of the more forward-looking aspects of the auto industry. So we're embedded deep in the design departments, which are several years ahead of where the current production is and where production volume is. And we're also working closely with a lot of autos and some of their next generation production workflows. I think you've seen some of the things we've been talking about with generative with regards some of the work we've done with GM and some of the other automotives to kind of help consolidated multiple parts in multipart assemblies into a single 3D printed part. And we're definitely engaged in some of that work, but that's some of the hierarchy of exposure we have to manufacturing. Make sense?","Saket Kalia","That does. That's really helpful. Scott, maybe for you for my follow-up, a little bit of a different topic, but I'd love to talk a little bit about the remaining maintenance business. Obviously this is the last year of M2S price increases, as you've mentioned before. And that maintenance ARR sort of continues to decline in that high 30% range. How do you sort of think about that decline in coming quarters? And maybe just speak to sort of the profile of your remaining maintenance customers. I guess with the last 25% price increase should we sort of start to see a step up in that maintenance base decline or should we kind of think about it kind chugging along the way it has so far. Any color there would be helpful.","Scott Herren","Yes, sure, Saket. So this is the year -- by the way, it's a 20% price increase, not 25%. But Q2 is the first full quarter that that third price increase that we announced three years ago, it went into effect at the beginning of Q2. This is our first quarter with that, and we actually had some interesting results. The conversion rate of -- maintenance rates that came up for renewal actually increased, which is what you'd expect with the staying on maintenance going up 20%, from what had been about a third of those that come up for renewal converting to something in the high 30% range for the quarter. So conversion rate increased, as expected.","Interestingly for those that did elect to stay on maintenance, and some do, the renewal rate actually ticked up. I would've expected with the increase in price it to stay flat or maybe even decline, it actually, the renewal rate for maintenance for those that did not convert actually it ticked moderately, but ticked up slightly in the quarter. So we're seeing the exact same -- the behavior we expected when we laid out the M2S program. And at this point it's -- we have three more quarters to go, it'll actually overlap into the first quarter of next year before it's finished.","Saket Kalia","Got it. Very helpful, guys. Thanks.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Saket.","Andrew Anagnost","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Winslow of Wells Fargo. Your question, please.","Phil Winslow","Hey, thanks, guys for taking my question. Thanks for the commentary on Asia-Pacific and Europe. I wondered if you'd give is more color on what you're seeing in the U.S., particularly just into the quarter and in terms of the pipeline there, and particularly by vertical, that'd be very helpful. Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, so the Americas and the U.S., in particular, were strong. We grew 32%. Our pipeline is solid in the U.S.; it's solid across the whole Americas. Our visibility is pretty good. We're seeing broad strength across all the segments. So we're not seeing any weakening in any kind of segment or by any types of vertical. So the U.S. business is looking solid. And it continues to look solid right now and until something changes in the environment. But we saw a great visibility in our pipeline to the U.S.","Scott Herren","Phil, the other comment that's worth adding on to that is, I think there was some concern that emerging markets might have underperformed during the quarter, and it's actually -- you have to dig into the appendix of our slides that we posted on our Web site, but you can see emerging markets actually grew north of 30%. And obviously there's -- a chunk of those emerging markets are in the Americas as well. So we continue to see, with the exceptions of three areas that we pointed out, we continue strength geographically across the board.","Phil Winslow","Got it. And also in terms of the breakdown, as Saket was saying, obviously your business is sort of like a matrix internationally and then by multiple verticals, and then multiple sort of sub-verticals within inside of those verticals. When you think about just manufacturing exposure versus, let's say, your commercial construction versus media and entertainment, is there one geography that's weighed more, let's say, towards your commercial construction and one more towards manufacturing? Any sort of color in sort of the\u2026","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, absolutely. So that's an easy place, Phil, to give some color. So, construction, we're definitely leaned more towards the U.S., there's no doubt about it. On manufacturing we're definitely leaned more towards Europe. We've historically been more successful in Europe relative to competition than in the U.S. So when you see manufacturing slow down in Germany it slows down our overall manufacturing business. So Europe is definitely where we're more exposed in manufacturing. The U.S. is definitely where the bulk of business is for construction right now, though we're growing pretty quickly internationally on the construction side as well. But that's kind of the high-level breakdown.","Phil Winslow","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Phil.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities. Your question, please.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Andrew, a quarter ago, on the call, you made some interesting remarks regarding what you're calling your early warning system, this was in the context that you were talking about digital infrastructure and your customer engagements team. The question is, what is that system telling you in terms of some of the key metrics that it's set up for in terms of usage and other metrics. And is it thus far a U.S. oriented system or is it giving you signals globally that are helping you? And then secondly, a longer-term technology or roadmap question. I made some comments on the call earlier about your integrations thus far with the ACS acquisitions and the BIM and Revit, and so forth. What about the roadmap however between AEC and manufacturing, if you're going to pursue industrialization of construction you have to have that cross-segment integration. You haven't really spoken about it much, but perhaps you can talk about that roadmap?","Andrew Anagnost","Okay, all very good questions, Jay. So, first, let me talk about the early warning system and what it's telling us. So it is broad geographically. It tells us about multiple products in multiple geographies. And one of the things -- and what it's also intended to do is give us a predictor scores that are at risk renewals so that we go take direct action with regards to at-risk renewals. What I can tell you at a high level is it's telling us is there's no slowdown in usage of our products, right. And in fact, usage continues to grow across all types of products and all manner of verticals. So we're not seeing any systematic declines in usage or usage activity [indiscernible]. Our pirates [ph] continue to use our products robustly, and as do our paying subscribers, but remember that the core part of that system is designed to help our teams understand which one of our accounts are most at risk for renewal. And yes, you're right, we watch things like activations, we watch things like product usage, and we watch other things like access to support that allow us to kind of score these customers in terms of risk, but it's global, and we're not seeing any changes in the usage trends, usage continues to go up globally.","Now with regard to integration of the construction, I think you're actually pointing to a very important area, and it's one of the things that we're really focusing on behind the scenes, and it has to do with creating some workflows for the building product manufacturers, which includes, like I said earlier, curtain wall as well as the components that go inside of buildings. So what we've been working to do is expand the interlope between Revit and Inventor, so that you can actually take low-precision models from Revit, move them into the high-precision environment of Inventor, so that you can get -- do fabrication prep for things like curtain walls and other types of manufacturing components, and then actually move them back into revenue in the low-precision world in an account slated way, so the changes that happen inside of Inventor go back and update inside of the Revit model as well.","We've been improving those integrations continuously behind the scenes. You're going to see more improvements in those integrations in Q4, and a continuing roadmap next year. It's not completing fully industrialized workflows for construction, but it's a prerequisite to making sure you have a good BIM to manufacturing or 3D solid modeling workflows, so that you can actually do some of these more complex interactions between a building information model and a 3D model for manufacturing purposes. So, we continue to work on those Revit and Inventor integrations, and you'll see acceleration in that area.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thanks, Andrew.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you. Just a couple of questions here, Andrew, I just want to make sure that your tone and your conservatism, it seems like you're not seeing the weakness here, so to speak, but you're just being more conservative in your outlook. I just want to confirm that that's how we should be reading your comments. And then, I guess one of the other questions would be how we see growth trending, and churn and see growth, which may be a precursor to a slowdown if you think of the fact that your products are deployed as increased deployment as people are hired into the industry? And then I guess the follow-up from there would be just from a linearity perspective after last quarter when you said linearity was a little bit more backend loaded, I know you guys were going back to, assuming the same linearity in Q3 this year that you did last year, is that where it actually came out of? If you can give us some color there, that'd be great. Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","All right. So, what I'll do is I'll answer your middle question first, then I'll answer your first question, second, and I'll let Scott answer the third, okay?","Heather Bellini","Thank you.","Andrew Anagnost","So, your middle -- it's okay, see growth ensuring, no change, all right. We're seeing the same kind of see growth, where our renewal rates are solid. In some places, we are seeing improvements. So, all of those trends are consistent right now with a fairly steady environment. Like we said earlier, we've seen some indications in certain specific markets that lead us to be a little bit more cautious, particularly Germany and manufacturing, U.K. and Brexit, and you know, the state-owned enterprises in China, we simply cannot engage with them, and that's going to put pressure on our expectations relative to those markets. Even though emerging in China is a small part of our business, it's a small percentage. Over a couple of quarters, we could easily add up to $5 million in missed expectations, but there is a lot of noise. You can all hear it, it's all going on, there's change -- there is something new every day, all right, all you have to do is checking Twitter feed. So, there're all sorts of noise, and what you see us doing, and I want to make sure we put this in context. What we did is we took the high-end of our guidance down. So, we narrowed the range. The low-end of our guide on a constant currency basis is unchanged.","So, this is a prudent narrowing of the range to kind of reflect this noise we're seeing in the system. I think it's the right thing to do right now. I think it's appropriate, but even if you look at the worst case scenario on all of that, worst case scenario, we're coming in at 96%, at worst case of the numbers we set out there four years ago. I think that's pretty good. That's not just great modeling. It's actually great execution in flexible and adaptive execution, and it's that ability to kind of track the business to that kind of fidelity that gives us a lot of confidence in terms of what we're looking to see out in FY '23, and I want to make sure just since you asked the question, I want to reinforce a few things that are really important drivers around some of this stuff. First off, one just side comment, we could easily do some unnatural acts to hit that free cash flow number at what we stated previously in the last call. You wouldn't want us to do that. I have no interest in pushing an agenda in that direction, and we're just simply not going to do it. It's not good for the business, it's not good for the long-term health and for the long-term prospects of the business, and we have to pay attention to the long-term prospects of the business. So we're not going to do any a natural things to try to drive that free cash flow number up, and I think that's an important point. But the resilience in the model, because remember, as we move into next year the model transition is done, and we've got the resilience in the model us look out to FY '23, but look at just how the midpoint of the guide changed, half of that is due to currency FX, okay, a total complete short-term impact on our business.","The other thing I wanted you to be aware of in terms of what's kind of guiding us with the conservatism, and we're at pipeline solid, we're looking out pipelines, we've got more visibility to our business than we've ever had before, the pipeline looks good in countries where we're historically having problems. I think you might remember a year ago we talked a lot about Japan, Japan is doing great. So, we're seeing things like that, but more importantly, as we look out beyond the FY '20 guide into some of the FY '23 things, construction is doing really well. We believe the construction is going to continue to do well during the downturn, IT spending construction continue to grow during the downturn last time. In '07 and '08, Revit continued to grow for us. I think you're going to see that same thing, our performance on non-compliant users is getting better and better, and also, let's just say there was a protracted downturn. Something interesting happens in those downturns, infrastructure spend tends to go up. We've gotten in front of that. We've done some things in our core design products and our construction portfolio to ensure that we're good partners to the infrastructure business. So, we intend to capitalize on any infrastructure spend that could come out of a protracted downturn. So, you're right, we are simply being conservative and we're being prudent, because of the noise out there in the system and because of the weakness we saw in some places, where they can have impact on our expectation, was correct. We're growing robustly in all those places. We just have higher expectations for those places, and I think it's the right time to make that kind of adjustment, and it's all short-term, but we're still very confident about what we can do in FY '23.","Scott Herren","And Heather, I think the other\u2026","Heather Bellini","Yes, Scott.","Scott Herren","Yes, in other part of your triple questions, that was around linearity, and I think the thing that we are seeing in linearity, and again in Q2, which was consistent with our expectations in Q2 was more sales are happening a little bit later in the quarter than what we had experienced in the second-half of fiscal '19. So, it's more like the traditional linearity that we had in the first-half of fiscal '19, and that's now built into our forecast for the second-half of this year. So it has a couple of effects when you do that obviously, and Andrew has talked about this a big chunk of the adjusted in our guidance is all tied to FX, but holding out aside, as linearity pushes on a little bit, it has an effect on billings, where billings covered layer in a quarter, and then you end up collecting some of those billings is kind of during the current quarter and the following quarter. So there's a little bit of an effect on billings and an effect on free cash flow as well from linearity, but that's the way to think about it. The midpoint of the guide is 27% revenue growth, midpoint of the billings guide is 40% growth even normalized for the 606 implementation at the beginning of last year, and the midpoint of the guide is 12 points of margin expansion. So it's a strong year. We continue to feel good about the momentum in the business.","Heather Bellini","Great, thank you so much.","Scott Herren","Thanks, Heather.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda of Berenberg Capital Management. Your line is open.","Gal Munda","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just in the manufacturing side. We see the manufacturing is going below the AEC part of the business, and I was just wondering if it's macro-related or is it maybe got something to do with the comments you made around the shift to the new platform, you mentioned that Fusion 360 is gaining market share, you mentioned that Fusion 360 is growing very, very strongly, and I'm wondering whether Fusion 360 by taking market share is also potentially taking market share from some older solutions, they have like Inventor, which might provide kind of short-term headwind to the revenue there?","Andrew Anagnost","All right. So, Gal, let me let me kind of answer that and cover that. First off, we grew 20% manufacturing better than any of our competitors, all right, better than the market. So, our performance in manufacturing is actually very strong. The relative difference in the performance between manufacturing and AEC is simply due to the fact that AEC is stronger. What we're seeing in AEC is Revit is not only being adopted very robustly, it's actually being mandated, or BIM is being mandated in more and more countries and for more and more projects. Japan in particular is an interesting place, where historically BIM was slow to be adopted, and it's starting to see an acceleration of adoption, and you're seeing BIM mandates showing up in Japan as well. So I want to make sure that we understand the relative performance difference between those two things, and our performance relative to competitors in the overall market.","Now, to your point about Fusion, one of the reasons why there is no cannibalization related to Fusion is because one every Inventor customer that's getting Inventor to the collection gets Fusion with it, all right, so they actually get both products. So, if you buy and subscribe to collection, you get all the things that are at collection, you actually get Fusion as well, and Fusion is a design app, can't do all the things that Inventor does. So there's very little kind of cross overlap between those two applications in terms of actually complete design things. The growth that you're seeing in Fusion is actually coming more from competitive swaps. We always like -- we've always given several examples of SolidWorks displacements, we've seen other placements as well, and this growth in the CAM space as well, where the integrated end-to-end solution and the price points are just really, really attractive. So, I just want to make sure that we put color on that, manufacturers doing great, the relative difference between AEC and manufacturing has to do with the fact that AEC is doing better, and it's doing better because of BIM mandates and BIM momentum, and we're not seeing any cannibalization from Fusion in our core Inventor business.","Gal Munda","Perfect, that's very helpful. And then just as a follow-up, could you comment a bit about the performance between the direct and indirect, so basically the channel and your own sales force, you basically mentioned that you had some significant EBA wins, maybe also comment a bit more on the e-commerce side of things, how the direct performance is going there?","Scott Herren","Yes. It's Scott, Gal. We talked about the mix being 70% through the channel, 30% direct, which is compared to 28% direct in Q2 of last year. So, it's grown a couple points. Our direct business actually grew 38% year-on-year. So we're seeing good strength in direct. Within EBA, as we continue to do most of our EBAs in the second-half of the year, and within that, most of them in the fourth quarter and the second-half of the year. So the EBA business while we had good traction with EBAs in Q2, the quarters where we really start to see a lot more EBA businesses late in Q3 and then through Q4. The e-commerce business or e-store is actually growing very nicely year-on-year, again, growing off a smaller base, but growing very nicely year-on-year, and that's part of our overall digital sales approach, right, it's not just put up a store and try to drive people to it. We also use the e-store as the backend transaction engine for a lot of our inside sales teams. So, we're seeing very nice growth through that whole digital sales channel, which comes to us at higher net revenue content to Autodesk. So, it's actually performing quite well.","Gal Munda","Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.","Scott Herren","Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Gal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Ken Talanian","Thanks for taking the question. Yes, as you think about the uncertainty related to the second-half, could you give us a sense for how you see the billings impact related to demand patterns and linearity differ if at all between the larger EBA type customers and the smaller volume-oriented ones? And along those lines, how should we think about the EBA renewal opportunity in the back-half of this year versus last?","Scott Herren","Yes. Ken, we always have -- as I just mentioned, we always have more EBAs in the second-half of the year and in particular, in the fourth quarter than we do in the first-half of the year. That was -- we know when those EBAs are coming up for renewal, and we have the best insight of any of our transactions on what's happening with the EBA. So, we have a good sense of when those are going to close. That said, as always it's been pretty accurately reflected in our outlook. What you see in terms of the adjustment in billings of $50 million adjustment in billings, first of all, in context, it's a $50 million adjustment at the midpoint on a number that's greater than $4 billion, right, so it's a little more than a 1% adjustment in the full-year billings, half of that $50 million roughly is strictly FX. The remainder is really localized around the three areas that we talked about, around the U.K. with concerns over Brexit, and we saw that actually much more so in July than we did in the first two months of the quarter; same with the slowdown in the manufacturing base in Germany, and then with the state-owned enterprises in China. So the adjustment in billings is really a reflection of FX, and then those three kind of localized effects that I think everyone's feeling, not just Autodesk.","Ken Talanian","Understood, and if I may, given that you've already reached about $98 million in ARR from your acquisitions, and I think you're targeting $100 million for the year, how are you kind of thinking about the contribution to the year now?","Scott Herren","Yes, super happy with the way the integration has gone, and Andrew, I'll let you comment on this as well talking about the numbers. I'm super pleased with that, and the $100 million that you referred to was really what we talked about the PlanGrid. So it'd be slightly higher when you add BuildingConnected to that as well. I feel like we're on track. I'm really happy with the way those have performed so far, it's -- those are two really significant transactions to pull-in in the same quarter, and not -- we haven't lost a bit of momentum at either one of those. So feeling good about construction business overall, and maybe the interesting point before I hand off to you, Andrew, is not only have we done well with the acquired products, the breadth of the portfolio we have in construction now has created an updraft for BIM 360, and we talked about our Cloud, our organic Cloud ARR growth at 45% for the quarter, BIM 360 is one of the big drivers of that. So, we continue to see not just success in construction with the acquired assets, but a bit of a halo effect, because of the breadth of that product portfolio on our organic BIM 360 products.","Andrew Anagnost","You took all my interesting points.","Scott Herren","Oh, I'm sorry.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, look, the construction portfolio is performing really well. That is very unusual to get this kind of first-half, you know, first two quarter performance out of big acquisitions like that. We're happy. On the integration side, senior leaders from the acquired companies are taking senior positions inside the construction solutions team. So, we're seeing better and better alignment between those organizations. We have a lot of confidence in where we're going with these things. You see continuing stream of product integrations. Our customers are getting comfortable with our roadmap. The reason customers accelerated their purchasing of BIM 360 is because basically they just -- they see us saying, doing, and acting in all the right ways. So, they're doubling down at Autodesk, and that's nothing, but an excellent sign for how this business is going to grow into next year.","Ken Talanian","Great, thanks very much.","Andrew Anagnost","Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Zane Chrane of Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Zane Chrane","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to dig into manufacturing little bit more. The 20% growth in manufacturing revenue really was driven by ARR added in Q3 and Q4 of last year. If I look at the annualized value of manufacturing revenue based on the number of days in the quarter, it looks like it's down about $4 million or $5 million in ACV compared to what it was at the end of Q4. So, and that's in contrast to pretty strong incremental growth in manufacturing revenue each quarter of fiscal '19, is the weakness in first-half on that incremental manufacturing revenue added? Is that due to increased churn or lower expansion with existing customers, or just a pause and adoption due to the macro uncertainty? Thank you.","Scott Herren","Yes, it's neither, Zane. So, to be clear, the 20% growth in manufacturing is in line with the growth in manufacturing we've seen historically over the last two or three quarters, that we're not seeing -- even in the markets that we talked about, the three markets that we talked about having localized impact, we're showing strong double-digit growth even in Germany, which of course is a manufacturing-based economy\u2026","Andrew Anagnost","In ACV.","Scott Herren","In ACV. So, we're not seeing that kind of -- I'm not exactly sure the math that you did there, we're not seeing -- we can pick it up offline, and we're not seeing any acceleration or deceleration, significant deceleration on the manufacturing side. Renewal rates look strong across the board. New product subscription growth with -- back to one of the questions that came up earlier was in line and actually slightly higher is what we've seen in the prior couple of quarters. So, the manufacturing space continues to perform well, and I think it's a bit of a standout relative to our peers that are far more manufacturing-focused when you look at that growth rate.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, just even to comment on Germany, and we'll just talk about it from a pure ACV standpoint. The ACV growth in Germany was still double-digit, high double-digit growth. What we saw was a gap between our expectations, and the growth we were seeing as we headed into the end of the quarter. We have high expectations for that market, and those expectations were not getting met in the same kind of pattern that we would have expected in past quarters, but ACV is growing across the board manufacturing. So, I think maybe it's something that would be absolutely good to follow-up on and make sure we got the math right there.","Zane Chrane","Okay. Then the next -- just a quick question on the gap between the results versus your high expectations going in, is the gap more driven by lower expansion than you expected or less adoption from potential new customers?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So it is mostly a cross-sell and up-sell opportunity slowing down a little bit, you know, I'll give one example as we look out into the end of the second-half, accounts in some of the European countries where we expected to see EBA conversions are looking like -- the more going to be subscription sales versus the EBAs. So what we're seeing is a little bit of change in behavior at the EBA level and at the up-sell and cross-sell level, and that's really what's triggering our caution. And in terms of what we saw during the quarter, we expect a certain level of uptick in the ACV as we get towards the end of the quarter, and for the manufacturing in Germany, in particular, we didn't see that uptick in ACV. We're still doing great growing, but we didn't see the uptick we expected towards the numbers we want to see. We took that as an indicator of some slowness.","Zane Chrane","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kash Rangan","Hey, guys, thanks for being completely detailed and transparent with all the disclosures. I was also curious, given that we've not seen any meaningful turn in the business so far, how confident are you that we have levels at the estimates, or is it potential no -- rather revisions potential based on what you might uncover in the quarter or do you feel that you've seen enough and you've scrub the model enough to account for -- whatever it is that you saw in July and that we should be okay from this point onwards?","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. So obviously we spent a lot of time scrubbing the numbers and looking at this and making sure that we were looking at this in a prudent way. We feel confident that we've set the guide, right, I mean, obviously we're one tweet away from something changing, you know, unless something radical changes in the macro environment we feel pretty confident given our pipeline visibility to what we're guiding out there right now, and again I just want to reiterate what we did is we narrowed the range from the top-end down, the bottom the constant currency stayed the same, right, prudent measured action relative to what we're seeing out there. We think we've got it right, and look, if something comes from our field, something will come from that field, but we feel like we've got it right and we scrubbed our numbers. Scott, do you want to comment\u2026","Scott Herren","Yes, the only thing I would add to that, Kash, and it's a great question and I appreciate you asking it, so we can talk about it on the call, is that -- as we started to analyze, not just where we're headed in the -- with the strength of our pipeline and the overall strength in our renewal rates, which the renewal rate is becoming a bigger and bigger part of our business. Net revenue retention stayed in the same range. Renewal rates on a volume basis if anything ticked up modestly of course that picked up slightly sequentially. So, I feel good about the core business, and we talked about the Remaining Performance Obligations, even the current RPO, right? So those are -- they're going to turn into revenue in the next 12 months, growing 23% year-on-year. Who knows what the next Tweet will say, but we feel like we've built in and everything that we can see at this point. Yes.","Kash Rangan","Thanks so much again, and appreciate the transparency.","Scott Herren","Yes. Thanks, Kash.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Davis of Canaccord. Your question, please.","Richard Davis","Thanks. Two quick questions, one, you had a little bit of kind of work on rationalizing kind of the overlapping features between PlanGrid and some preexisting functionality, how far are you on that? And then on the second question would be share repurchase, I think you said 253,000, how much is left, and can you accelerate that, can you surge that, or what's up of that? Those are two simple questions. Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes, Richard, thank you for that. All right, so first off, let's talk about how we position the portfolio to our customers and port position the breadth of our portfolio. I made it very clear that the BIM 360 products that's going to focus on project management, project-centric workflows, and all the things associated with managing projects from start to finish, and integrating them into the pre-construction workflow. PlanGrid is going to focus on field execution and all the things associated with field execution and the capturing of information in around field execution and communicating that information back up into the global project management environment. We've made progress on multiple fronts. Like I said earlier, we've integrated BIM into PlanGrid, and so, there is BIM PlanGrid integration. We've also integrated some BuildingConnected bid management function into PlanGrid as well, but one of the really exciting things that we're working on, and it's part of the integration strategy is that both the PlanGrid team and the BIM 360 teams have seen the next generation building BIM 360-docs solution we built as being the foundation of what we call a Common Data Environment. This is something that's specked out in the AEC industry. It's called the CDE. And docs is going to be the foundation of our Common Data Environment and both PlanGrid and BIM -- and on all the other core BIM 360 functionality are integrating into that platform, which gives us a great steppingstone, not only to satisfy some pretty complicated requirements around Common Data Environment, but also to bring the products together more rapidly. So, you're going to hear a lot of things from us in the second-half of this year, in the first-half of next year about how these portfolios are coming together, but our customers get it, they understand, and they are buying in more to our solution because they see us acting in the direction of what we said we're going to do.","Scott Herren","And Richard, on your stock buyback question, you're spot on, so we spent $40 million during the quarter, year-to-date we spent $140 million. There is no change in our stance on cap allocation. So we'll continue to offset the core support the growth of the company first, took offset the dilution from our equity plans and then return excess cash to shareholders. We've been doing that pretty effectively with a more opportunistic buying pattern. So, our price grid is based on some Monte Carlo modeling that we do. And during the trading blackout window, of course we have to trade under 10b5-1 plan. Our trading blackout window began in early July, right before the most recent market volatility. So the grid that we had set up didn't necessarily reflect the volatility that we round up experiencing. At this point, I think you should definitely expect us to be back in the market buying back stock.","Richard Davis","Thank you so much.","Scott Herren","Yes. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.","Tyler Radke","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in here. So, you talked about how you think some of these macro issues, there are only a temporary thing or a short-term thing, I guess what gives you the confidence there, and then as you think about your lowered expectations, is it fair to say it's all coming from manufacturing, or is there any reduction in your view on AEC? Thanks.","Andrew Anagnost","Yes. All right, so first off, again, let me just clarify a few things that give us confidence about the short-term impacts. One, half of the change in the midpoint of the guide is currency effect, okay. So, let's just make sure we're all level set on that, remember, it's currency effect, I think that's really important. The only thing that gives us a lot of confidence is our pipeline visibility. We have more visibility, because of the changes in some of the models that we have in terms of our go-to market model with the rise of our mid-market programs and some of our direct programs, we have quite a bit of visibility into our pipeline, and we can see into our pipeline, we see robust pipeline, we have visibility all the way through to the end of the year, and also visibility beyond that. So we feel pretty good that some of these things are short-term effects. All right. In addition, we don't see anything slowing down with regards to construction and with regards to our piracy conversion work. So, if we just -- if we just look at high-level, those things are all kind of short-term impacts on our business.","All right, and what was the second part of your question, because I thought you asked another clarifying thing about what gave me confidence on the short-term?","Tyler Radke","Yes, that was just the confident that it's only a short-term macro part, and then on the -- I think you kind of answered it, but around the guidance, was it all a reduction in manufacturing, was there any reduction on AEC?","Andrew Anagnost","No. Yes, there is no incremental view in AEC. The change in guidance came from those FX effects and our view of the impacts of the softness we saw in manufacturing in Germany, the softness we saw in the U.K. and the gap between our potential in China and what we're actually able to execute on. Those are really the key drivers.","Tyler Radke","Okay, great. And if I could just sneak in one more for Scott, as you think about kind of some of the expense levers you have if you continue to see more softness, just what's kind of your willingness to maybe pull back on hiring, or being more conservatives, you have to keep free cash flow or profitability targets in place?","Scott Herren","Yes, it's a great question, Tyler. I think we've graphically demonstrated pretty effectively over the last four years, sound, spend, discipline. We continue to show to demonstrate sound, spend, discipline. We've effectively kept total spend flat for -- ex the acquisitions in Q4 we have total spend flat for four consecutive years. So, there will be a bit of an opportunity for us to take up spend at the same time we're increasing margins. If you look at this year, we talk about spend growth of 9% and margin growth of 12 percentage points of margin year-on-year. I expect margin to expand again into fiscal '21, although there is some pent-up demand percent having been flat for four consecutive years or some pent-up demand. So, spending will increase current course of speed, barring something significantly different happening in the overall macro environment spending will see a little bit of an increase again in fiscal '21.","Tyler Radke","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.","Abhey Lamba","Thanks for joining us. This concludes our conference call for today.

And unless otherwise noted, each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Carl Bass.","Carl Bass","Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. We started FY '12 with a target of 10% revenue growth and 200 basis point operating margin improvement. Despite some economic turbulence, through consistent execution, we finished FY '12 with 14% revenue growth, 260 basis points of margin improvement and 32% growth in EPS. This is strong growth, particularly on the heels of our FY '11 results of 14% revenue growth, 480 basis point operating margin improvement and 33% growth in EPS, capping the year with a strong performance in the fourth quarter. ","Fourth quarter revenue was driven by growth across all of our major geographies, with particular strength in Americas. All of our businesses performed well, driven by demand for our suites. We achieved record results in several areas, and we made solid progress in advancing our operating margin and EPS.","There were several areas of notable growth and achievement during the quarter, including 12% growth in total revenue; 25% growth in total suites revenue; 18% growth in revenue from commercial new licenses; record revenue levels in AEC, Manufacturing and the Americas; record maintenance billings in deferred revenue; 360 basis point improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; 31% growth in non-GAAP EPS; and solid cash flow from operations.","In addition to strong financial performance, we made substantial progress on many of our key initiatives in the fourth quarter. We launched our new design and creation suites almost a full year ago now. We believe the new suites deliver a tremendous amount of value and functionality, and we've been pleased with the customer reception and uptake to date.","We're especially pleased with the adoption of our specialty plant and factory design suites and how they're opening up new industry opportunities for us. ","I've talked to you before about the investments we've made in direct sales to elevate our presence within major accounts around the world. We experienced continued success in this past year, culminating with a record 36 transactions that exceeded $1 million in the fourth quarter. We also had a record number of $1 million transactions for FY '12, increasing 24% over the last year. Much like our overall business, these large transactions extended across all of our business segments and geographies.","We also continued to see our investment in the government vertical payoff. We won some high profile contracts with large federal and international agencies. We recently closed deals with the Brazil National Department of Transportation Infrastructure and the New Mexico Department of Transportation. In only 2 short years, we have won 6 state DOTs, and we believe that we can further expand our business in this sector.","We also continued to expand our business in Manufacturing. Our digital prototyping and simulation products for Manufacturing are winning accounts that have long been the domain of legacy technology providers. We're seeing particular success with consumer product manufacturers that are using our solutions to conceptualize, design, simulate and visualize their products. We're the only company that can provide the spectrum of interoperable tools, saving them precious time and energy in the development cycle for fast-moving markets.","We're excited about our next major release in just a few short weeks. In addition to launching new additions of many of our current products and suites, we'll officially debut our PLM offering. We view the PLM market as a $3 billion opportunity to disrupt and democratize. Our new cloud-based solution is designed to transform how manufacturers manage their entire product life cycle. ","Being 100% cloud-based, Autodesk PLM 360 marks a new generation of PLM and is affordable, easy-to-use and simple to deploy, bringing the benefits of PLM instantly to anyone within the extended enterprise. Since we announced our plans for PLM 360 at Autodesk University, companies of all sizes have been piloting this next-generation cloud-based alternative, from small companies eager to deploy PLM for the first time to large enterprises that have become disenchanted by existing legacy PLM systems. ","Customers are currently using PLM 360 to solve a large number of business problems, including project management, RFQ for suppliers, manufacturing time and cost estimating, customer list management, customer service management, billing materials and change management. PLM 360 offers significantly new functionality and deployment options for our customers. To us, it represents a very large pool of potential new users and significantly extends our presence in the manufacturing market.","On the other end of the spectrum from large deal and PLM is our budding consumer business. We continue to broaden our consumer offerings in FY '12. And our consumer portfolio now includes dozens of products across multiple platforms, including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android and online. What's really amazing is how the number of users of these products has exploded over the past 18 months to over 50 million. This represents a tremendous branding opportunity in the near-term and long-term revenue potential.","Another key initiative to help control costs and improve customer experience is to increase the use of electronic delivery of new licenses in most developed countries. In advance of this action, we reduced the amount of inventory in the channel over the past 2 quarters by approximately $13 million in total. Channel inventory now stands at a historic low of approximately one week. Over time, we expect to phase in electronic download of new licenses in emerging countries as well.","In addition to an unwavering focus on improving our products and delivering more value to our customers, we simultaneously look for ways to improve the efficiency of our organization. We've recently realigned some of our internal resources, including organizing our sales teams by industry. We believe this will unlock salespeople from geographical restrictions and leverage their expertise on a global basis. The changes are intended to better serve our customers and drive future growth.","We've also made some adjustments to our channel program for FY '13, drawing on best practices from our various geographies. For example, we're making it easier for our partners to sell our full portfolio of products by expanding product access. We've expanded our deal registration program on a global basis to drive both increased service and growth. And we've globally aligned our incentives program, which encourage partner investment and specialization and continuous customer satisfaction improvements. We've received positive feedback on these changes to date, and we're confident these enhancements will positively affect our global channel partners. Overall, we believe our progress in each of these important initiatives positions us better as we enter FY '13.","So to wrap things up, the fourth quarter was another strong quarter, capping what was a terrific year of consistency and growth for Autodesk. We're confident in our ability to deliver continued double-digit growth in FY '13 as we focus on our 5-year targets of 12% to 14% revenue CAGR and operating margins of at least 30%. And finally, I want to thank our employees and partners for their outstanding efforts and essential role in delivering these great results.","Operator, we'd now like to open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Carl, I had to go back in the model quite a ways to look for that type of growth out of the Americas region. I was wondering if you could drill down in terms of what you're seeing and kind of how you view the sustainability of that growth? And the actual question, will that help drag Europe along in a couple of quarters as well? And I had one quick follow-up.","Carl Bass","Yes, sure. Yes, it was certainly a pleasure to see the Americas grow at that rate, Brent. And I think what we're seeing has been a slow steady build. I mean, it doesn't feel like it's over-the-top. It just feels like it's been growing. We saw the turnaround kind of start 1.5 years ago, almost 2 years ago, and it's just been building. And I do think we saw a little bit of reflection a bit this quarter of a different mix than certainly what we might have anticipated. And as we went into the planning for next year, I think the mix will be slightly different and I think Americas will continue to do well. I think Asia will do well. I think there are still question marks about what's going on in Europe as you well know.","Brent Thill - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just real quick on the realignment around the industry. In your view, how does disruptive -- is that going to take a while for this to settle in? Or do you view it more of a tweak and we shouldn't anticipate any major big changes in the field?","Carl Bass","I think for the industry realignment, which is really about our direct salespeople, which again, first of all, is only a fraction of our business. It's less than 20% of our businesses that way. I think it will improve the effectiveness of that sales force over time. We're giving them more products to sell. We're basically going on saying, go to the manufacturing company. And whether they're looking for tools for product development, looking for PLM tools or looking for tools to build their factory, we can give you all those different tools and service that account more effectively. Probably the bigger change -- and so I don't think it's going to be a big deal. And many of the people who do that job everyday who are doing it, they have to really tweak their offering. They have just a little bit bigger portfolio of products to sell. What I'm more excited about is extending those changes to our channel partners and allowing our channel partners to sell more of the portfolio. For some of them, it's not a big deal. For others, they've had to go to unnatural acts when a customer want something but they haven't been authorized to sell it. And now just having broader access, as well as the tools to manage that, I think are important.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So it feels like AEC is really taking a nice step-up on Manufacturing, which seems to be the early improvement area for you. It's doing well but cooled off. I'm just wondering, when we look at Manufacturing and suite adoption as we move forward, should we see some re-acceleration or has it kind of reached a steady-state in terms of what you're thinking out of the growth for Manufacturing?","Carl Bass","Like I often find myself saying on these calls, I wouldn't take too much out of one quarter. Manufacturing has held up -- I mean, held up well through the downturn. It's the market for us that held up best. Coming out of it, it's been strong all the way through. I don't see this as a trend. I'm very excited about what we're seeing in the Manufacturing accounts. I think our competitive position has never been stronger. And I think it's really a combination of what we have to offer, including the new PLM offerings, and a little bit stumbling by some of our competitors. And so I think it's a nice thing. I think you'll see good growth in Manufacturing continuing through the next year.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up. When you look at the suites, you have the different flavors, the more expensive, more robust and then more of an entry-level. What's the experience now that you're another quarter in with them in terms of where the customer is gravitating in terms of their buying?","Carl Bass","I think our expectation going into this was that we were targeting people to buy the middle tier suite. That was really the intention all along. We've seen a little bit more buying at the high end than we originally planned for. More people are buying that top-tier suite than we had originally imagined.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.","Brendan Barnicle","Carl, I wanted to follow-up on that Brazil win that you had on the stateside. Does that -- on the public sector side. Does that then get you into the individual states in Brazil as well, and is there multiplier effect around that like you've seen in North America with the individual states here?","Carl Bass","In every one, I think there are 2 effects, one that you mentioned, Brendan, and then the other. I mean, one is, government agencies tend to look to other government agencies for guidance in what tools. There's nothing like a customer reference coming from another DOT or from the state DOTs looking at the federal. That's a really important thing. But probably an even bigger effect is that many of these organizations, while they are large engineering organization, the bulk of their work is done by the private sector. So they -- and in many cases, they either really mandate particular tools or they highly recommend tools, and so you get the ecosystem to use the tool. So the combination of both customer reference, as well as the spill-on effect of the ecosystem adopting the tools, are both really good things. I'll say even in like the New Mexico DOT, each of these agencies certainly evaluates these things for their own needs. But it sure helps when they're able to look at a similar kind of agency and look at their peers and understand what it took to adopt it, what the changes were in bringing in new technology and then, of course, what the benefits in return on investment was.","Brendan Barnicle","Great. And then -- and Mark, just following up on that net maintenance billings number up 18%, which is what I had up last quarter as well. It's had nice acceleration. Can that accelerate further from here or is this sort of where it tops at because you're starting to get some tougher comparisons, I think, going forward?","Mark J. Hawkins","Well, we're certainly pleased with the 18% for sure and I -- we don't guide to billings per se, but we're definitely happy with that. We like the product offering. And probably, I'll just kind of leave it at that, but we were certainly pleased to see that transpire, Brendan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Carl, following up on your comments earlier about managing the inventory down and electronic delivery. Could we foresee that at some point, the company will evolve it's model to sell-through revenue recognition or activation of license-type revenue recognition as one or 2 of your peers have?","Carl Bass","Yes. That's exactly the direction we've been headed. We would like -- we've always said we'd like to get to a sell-through model. And we're not there yet. We don't have all the things that we need.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's not encompassed in this year's guidance then, just sort of a clarification?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, just -- I mean, just jump in there and say that, that's correct. We -- again, we talked about the channel being down approximately to a week. It's very close. It's very close to that. But right now, we have like emerging markets and LTs that are not -- they're still going to have some channel inventory there. But eventually, as Carl said, we're going right to that, but that's not factored into the guidance for this particular year, that last week. We'll just to continue improve. And over time, you'll see that happen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup.","Walter H. Pritchard - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk about emerging markets. It looks like it was about 16% of revenue and growing in line with the small companies. And just curious if you could give us a little bit more detail inside that metric and specifically, if you'd expect in your long-term plan that 12% to 14%, if emerging markets needs to grow faster than the overall to hit those ranges long term?","Mark J. Hawkins","Sure. Let me jump in on this. In terms of the emerging market, one of the things -- to give you a little bit more color, we were pleased with the growth overall. One of the stars -- we don't quote on all the different countries, but Russia, for example, was very strong, both in the quarter and for the year. That would be one example. But we had good broad-based growth in the emerging markets. We believe, although it's choppy by quarter, any particular quarter, it can get to a little bit lumpy from that standpoint. But over time, we always see that as a leader and will lead growth faster than the average growth in the company there, so that's certainly what we would expect in FY '13 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Ashley from Robert W. Baird.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I would just like to drill down on the AEC business. The assumption, I guess, is that the U.S. was probably very strong. But could you comment on how the AEC business was in Asia Pac and EMEA, and what your kind of outlook is for the business in those markets?","Carl Bass","Yes, it certainly was strong in the U.S., and we were seeing some form of recovery in the AEC market in the United States. We've really hit the tipping point with BIM or building information modeling. I mean, we've hit the point where there's huge amount of demand from owners. It's being mandated by government agencies. And as we've always talked about, the drivers -- to a large extent, the place where most of the money is spent is in the construction part of AEC. And what we've seen around the world definitely differential rates. But worldwide, we're seeing the adoption of BIM technology. And so for example, historically, Japan has been a laggard with respect to the adoption of technology. They've been primarily doing 2D technology in AEC. And just in the last year, we've seen the leading firms, the genecoms [ph] in Japan all adopt BIM technology. So that's a dramatic change that, again, like I talked about before, has a huge spillover effect for the entire industry. And I've said it before, say it again, it's no longer a question of if, but really of when people will be doing 3D modeling and simulation and visualization in AEC. And so I think we're just in the sweet spot of the adoption. Certainly, the macroeconomics in each of these countries affects it on a quarterly basis. But if you kind of stand back and squint, you can just see broad adoption of a new way of doing business.","Steven M. Ashley - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Mark, I was wondering could you comment on the outlook for FX, and I understand you guys have a rolling hedge. If currency rates stay about where they are, are we looking at an impact to revenue in the coming first quarter? Any guidance or comment you can make around that?","Mark J. Hawkins","Sure. Let me just speak to it. The first quarter, in a way, you're absolutely right in terms of the rolling hedge. In the first quarter, things are pretty well locked in the way rolling hedge works. As you get closer and closer to the current quarter, you step up the amount of your hedge and it becomes quite firm in the planning. So we pretty well have that locked in. We don't expect to see anything really different there based on the hedges that we have in place. And then as you get further out in the year, we're less hedged. And so for example, by Q4, we have a small fraction of the year hedged, and then we'll just layer it up to nearly complete hedge when you get to the end quarter. So FX has been fully comprehended in our guidance for Q1 for sure. And we've factored in the hedging that we do have, the more limited hedging for the rest of the year into our guidance, plus normal assumptions. Hopefully, that helps.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord.","Richard H. Davis - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","So Carl, unlike just about every other design software company, you have an enormous installed base into which you can upgrade and sell new modules and things like that. Meanwhile, every public company I hear says they're gaining market share. So that kind of reminds me of the school teacher who says every kid is above average. But in any case, how do you think about the relative contribution of your go-forward growth of sales into installed base versus selling to new customers?","Carl Bass","First of all, I'm chuckling a little bit because in many ways, market share is so easy to calculate. I don't know why all of you deal with it as this anecdotal thing of allowing people to say, \"I'm gaining market share or I'm not.\" While certainly there's less information about other parts of people's models, I think there's really only 2 ways to calculate market share. And one would be to look at revenue and another one might be something like seats. But in each case where it's reported, the numerator and the denominator are really straightforward. And whether it goes up or down is actually a fact. It's not a matter of opinion. So I don't -- in some ways, I just don't get it. Why you almost let people get away with -- if Autodesk grows at twice the rate of another company, I don't know how they're gaining share on this, or maybe I just don't understand market share. To the more -- maybe that was just your prelude to your real question rather than my rant about market share. I mean, one of the things that's interesting for us is in almost every case, customers have some of our software. And so we don't have as big a distinction between new -- kind of brand-new customers and existing customers. What we do look at a lot is the place we play in the value to the customer. So there are places we were, front and center, the most important product that they use to do their design and engineering work. There are other places where we play a peripheral role. And a lot of it is moving from those peripheral roles to more central roles. But if you go out there, it's very hard to find any sizable engineering company or somebody in media and entertainment that doesn't use our tools to a small extent. So I guess, the answer would be there. But I would say, at a certain point, when you go from a small niche player within a firm, you're actually changing the quality of the relationship in some material way. It's not just gaining more share within the company, you're changing your relationship with the customer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with Jefferies.","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Mark, can you maybe just help us with that maintenance billings number that, I think, is 18% in the quarter. I think the simple average for the year is about 20%. And the question is really when that starts to flow through into your maintenance or subscription revenue line and when we might see that sort of maintenance revenue begin to accelerate?","Mark J. Hawkins","Sure. I'm happy to give you a framework on that. You hit the number right, 18% for the quarter, about 19% to 20% for the year for the maintenance net billings. That's exactly right. And the way that -- the way I think about this is that the vast, vast majority of those billings of maintenance are single year. And so 12 months ratably, those billings will be broken in and recognized over time. So you can take that, you can see our record deferred revenue. We have about $719 million on the balance sheet. And you could know that the vast, vast majority of that is single year. And so you have to make an assumption around that, Ross, of what that fraction is. But I'm telling you, the absolute vast, vast majority is single year. The second aspect is, you have to make a call on multi-year. When we have multi-year, the biggest part of multi-year is a 3-year deal. So the way I would encourage you to think about this is take the total billings, make a fraction that you think is multi-year and the vast majority that's a single year, and then start using in one hand, divide it by 12, and the other hand, divide it by 36. And you're going to get a good proxy for how that's going to flow into revenue. Okay?","Ross MacMillan - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Yes, definitely. And then just as a follow-up. When you introduced suites, you guys were obviously promoting the suites to stimulate some early adoption. And I'm curious as to whether you feel now that the suites have been out there for a year and obviously, the adoption is -- has been very good, whether there are some changes you might be making on sort of promotional activity around suites and whether you think you can capture more upfront license revenue from the suites at this point?","Carl Bass","We've been thrilled with the adoption of suites. We're always kind of looking and will continue to tweak where we do promotions, where we see opportunities. Certainly, taken as a whole, you'll see less promotional activity around the suites than you saw at the introduction but kind of still reserve the right to look, whether it's geographically or on a particular line of business, where we want to incent people to move more quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Cummins with ThinkEquity.","Daniel T. Cummins - ThinkEquity LLC, Research Division","Let's see. The op margin has peaked in the fiscal 2Q each of the last 2 years. What's the -- what should our expectation be seasonally going forward? And then I had a follow-up on your DSO.","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, so a couple of things. One is that we do have  certain pattern in terms of spend and in revenue, seasonality wise, in a normal environment. And we're certainly then approaching a more normal environment that we have been historically. During the great financial crisis, it really was not normal, but we're getting into a more normal period. And for example, I think you're familiar that, for example, in Q4, we incur a lot of launch costs. We're getting ready to prepare for the future product release, and we also have annual employee incentives and things of that nature. That's an example in Q4. In Q1, we classically have the actual launch costs additionally and some of the various dynamics that we normally see in Q1. And so I do think we're approaching more normal seasonality. The best advice I have for you is think about our annual guidance. And each quarter, we're going to give a better line of sight to how that breaks out and try to keep dialing that in for you. I think that we've given you a solid guidance for Q1 that reflects some of the seasonality of spend typically there. And in Q2, we'll give you a little bit better refresh. But in the meantime, I think we are approaching normal seasonality.","Carl Bass","Yes, I think the Q1 and Q4, the things that go on in these quarters aren't changing. So if I look forward this year and next year, I don't see any changes. Commissions and bonuses will still be in Q4. Taxes and launch costs are in Q1. I mean, it's just going to continue that way. There's no big changes there. Do you want to -- Mark, do you want to answer the DSO question?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes. And Dan, do you want to frame the DSO question that you had? I just want to make sure to address that. ","He may not be able to come back, operator, but I'll -- let me just address DSO, generally. DSO is up about 6 days year-on-year, and that is really driven exclusively by the fact that we had record billings in Q4. And in particular, the billing linearity was later in the quarter. And so what you will see is the benefit of some of those later quarter billings actually showing up in terms of cash flow in Q1, and you'll see a DSO improvement as well. So it's really -- it's almost exclusively driven by that. So hopefully, Dan, that addresses your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.","Perry Huang - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Perry Huang for Heather. I was hoping to ask a question about the Manufacturing segment performance. In the prepared remarks, I think it was highlighted, the contribution from strong growth in the simulation offerings. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color there? For example, was there particular strength in, say, a particular type of customer? And also, do you see your simulation business as a key selling point for your overall Manufacturing portfolio, sort of along with your upcoming PLM offering?","Carl Bass","Yes. So one of the things -- we've talked about simulation for a while. One of the parts of the business, plastic injection molding, our Moldflow business did particularly well. And I've talked about this before, when we talk about digital prototyping, a large payoff for the 3D modeling that we do and that we enable is the ability to do analysis and simulation and optimization. It's becoming increasingly important to manufacturers in a much more competitive environment. They are trying to lower costs and get products to market more quickly. One of the things I highlighted in those opening remarks was what we're seeing in consumer products part of our business. That is typically really short-cycle products. Many of them include things like plastic simulation. Time to market and cost are critical in that arena. And our products are good there. But generally speaking, when I see what we're doing now -- and you got to step back in some ways, Perry, and go back to we were quite the underdog in manufacturing not that many years ago. Certainly, in all the design and engineering tools, we've reached parity if not exceeded the capability and functionality of our competitors. Again, we've done the same thing with simulation, where we now feel very confident in our offering of simulation tools. And we're excited about offering PLM. We talked a lot about companies needing to manage the process around how they manage products. And we think we found and developed the appropriate technology for our customers there. So we now feel like we have a complete offering for manufacturers, all the way from small to the largest in the world. And like I said, I've seen quite a bit of stumbling from our competitors, which -- what we don't root for. It's not the worst thing that happened to us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is Dennis in for Phil. G&A was up a bit more than we had sequentially. Was there anything to call out there onetime in nature or was it just seasonality? Or should this be the new run rate that we should be thinking about going forward?","Mark J. Hawkins","There is, Dennis, something to call out there. About 1\/2 of that nominal growth is basically the FX gains and losses for the OpEx hedge that are showing up in G&A and for the total OpEx. So that's -- nominally, it kind of distorts the total number in a small degree. I think the thing to look at even with that being the case, if you look at G&A as a percent of revenue, it's scaled and improved year-on-year as a percent of revenue for the quarter and for the year substantially. It went from like 8.3% last year to, I think, 7.8% to 7.9% this year. So we expect more and more efficiency there, and we're seeing that. But there is a good catch on your point. It is a definite anomaly with the FX hedge gain and loss.","Carl Bass","And just to generalize it, I would say, we're being quite vigilant about expenses, G&A particularly. But all the expenses, we're being quite vigilant.","Dennis Simson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you give us an update on Autodesk cloud in general and maybe dig deeper into the pilot program with PLM, if there's anything specific in terms of recurring pain points that you hear from larger customers that you keep on hearing from the traditional PLM products?","Carl Bass","Yes. So I'm quite excited about the cloud in general, where a huge amount of our development is directed that way. We think it's a really important component. Just to give you the 2 flavors of it, just to remind everybody. One part is high performance computing, things like doing simulation, visualization. Those high performance computing activities are really well-suited to kind of the scalability of the cloud. The other place that lead us into the PLM part of the discussion. Broadly speaking, the cloud is really good for collaborating. It's helping people manage their projects, their products and the people they work with. The PLM offering is an example of that. We publicly started to talk about it at AU. There have been really 2 groups of customers that we've been working with. One are new customers, who have heard about PLM, of course, but never used it. They always thought it was too expensive, too far out of their reach but certainly have a need to manage the processes around manufacturing. And we're having good success with them. I think the thing that was most surprising to us is the uptake amongst really large customers. Now every one of these very large manufacturers certainly has at least one PLM system of record. Some of them have 2 or 3. Many have had multiple implementations. And what we're finding out is a large degree of dissatisfaction with those installations. In other places -- in some places, they were looking for wholesale replacement. In other places, especially users, they want to Chernobyl their PLM installation. They want to entomb it in concrete and surround it with more modern flexible tools. And they were looking to reach parts of the organization that either because of difficulty or expense, they couldn't build there PLM systems to reach. So we're having a surprising amount of success in the larger customers, which is -- I would have thought we had more to prove there early on, and it would have taken a little bit longer to develop. But in some ways, our best customers are those that know PLM, understand PLM and know where they find it wanting.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to sort of extend on the question that Ross was asking. If you went through that logic on the subscription billings, it would seem to imply that subscription revenue should accelerate into FY '13 off of what we saw in FY '12. And based on that assumption, talking about sort of FY '13 total revenue growth at 10% would seem to imply that your product revenues are going to decelerate to something under 10%. Is that the right way to think about that there is that level of conservatism in the model that your product revenues will be somewhere below 10% for FY '13?","Mark J. Hawkins","I think -- here's what I would say, Keith. First of all, I think you got my sense of how to take billings into subscription revenue gave kind of the key levers. And obviously, we're always thinking about attachment renewal for the new business as we go through the year as well. But I think people hopefully got a good sense of that model. I think, if we kind of level up and step back, I think the growth rate of, we said, at least 10% we think is really solid, and we're confident in that number. We think it's after -- again, just coming off a strong year, we take a look. We work with our sales teams. We look -- we work with our channel partners. We look at our funnel -- our deal funnel. And we come up, we look at our subscription revenue and all the different factors. And we come up with what we think is a solid guidance. And I think at least 10% falls in that category, and so I think the -- that's what I would do is kind of level it up from that standpoint. And hopefully, that gets a little bit to the spirit of your comments. Carl, I don't know if you have any additional thoughts, but those are mine.","Carl Bass","Yes, I mean, I think you outlined it well, Mark. We don't have -- we don't do a lot of detailed guiding around specific parts of it. And as I've said before, I think things over a quarter can vary quite a bit. I think this quarter is a good example of where we saw certain metrics move. They had bigger bearings than we would have imagined. But generally speaking, I feel confidence about the greater than 10% growth. We're watching all the moving pieces. As we go through the year, we'll give you kind of more insight on exactly what we're seeing. Generally speaking, what we're seeing is, geographically, real strength in in the Americas. There's a couple of question marks out there in the global economy. We touched on a couple of the industries where I think our market position is great. I'm thrilled with the deferred revenue. I think that's working. Programmatically, I'm looking and going, love to see the new product revenue this quarter. Happy about what we're doing with the cloud. Happy with suites, simulation. And really, the place where I have my eye a lot is on this new PLM offering.","Keith Weiss - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Excellent. And just as one follow-up, can you potentially give us some kind of color on where the key leverage, that 200 basis points of leverage should -- where we should expect that to come out of the model?","Mark J. Hawkins","Yes, one, I already talked about, the continuing vigilance around expenses. We're continuing to look at it there. And as we've shown and demonstrated every year, except that one year that I don't like to talk about, that as we increase the volumes, that some of it just naturally falls out of the model. As we can drive volume in any of these product lines, with it more money falls to the bottom line. And so as we do -- we make investments up-front. We made investments in simulation. We've made investments in suites up-front, and then we try to capitalize those over time. And I think as we're able to get those to greater volumes, the benefits accrue to the bottom line. So it's really a question of just scaling.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with Longbow Research.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","I don't know if you have a chance to let me in for a follow-up, but let me ask about business combinations. The prepared remarks said you spent $40 million on them. I'm actually calculating from the cash flow statement. There is additional $79 million in the quarter on business acquisitions. I'm wondering if you can reconcile that and give us a little color on what are they? And I guess, there are 5. And what are your expectations collectively? Could they generate a point in revenue? Any thoughts there would be helpful.","Carl Bass","So let me talk to generally. Mark is doing some research over there on the exact numbers. I mean, generally speaking, this year, we were a little bit more active in M&A activity. It was mostly small deals. The number you said doesn't quite fit for the fourth quarter and the third quarter there. There was a fair amount of M&A activity. We're continuing to look for both small acquisitions that round out our offerings. And they'll tend to be in places like cloud-based stuff, some of the simulation, some of the PLM stuff is where we'll be looking for more things. And we're continuing to look for those medium-sized companies that will contribute to the top line. As it sits right now, the acquisitions that we've done today, they're fully contemplated in the guidance we gave you. And I think if there's anything different, we'll let you know.","Mark J. Hawkins","And just a couple of things to just make sure to call out here from that standpoint. One is, I want to make sure that we're comparing one with net of cash, one of gross cash would be one item to look at. The second item is that when we talk about M&A, there's M&A, and then there's also just pure intellectual property that we're buying and minority investments that we're making. So we can take this off-line and give you even more breakdown on that. But I just want to be really precise on that, but it all ties out from at that standpoint. Okay? Steve, we'll have Dave tie out with you right after.","Steven R. Koenig - Longbow Research LLC","Okay, great. If I can't follow-up, I'd like to ask Carl a little bit more on this hot button from Richard's question earlier. I think it's related. Just asking to hear about the long-term conversion of your base from 2D to 3D. I agree, Carl, that with your calculation, and it looks like you are growing faster than the 3D market. But in Manufacturing, you don't own that market like you do in 2D. Is it just slow and steady progress here or is there any silver bullet? I mean, what's the winning ticket here to get ahead?","Carl Bass","I mean, I think if you look, it's been true for years, in the portions of the Manufacturing market in which we participate, we've been growing at 2x, 3x, 4x the rate of our competitors. A bunch who asked me last time about one competitor in particular, when I insinuated that they were obfuscating financial results by way of not disclosing what was going on with acquisitions, I think time is proving me to be right. They just talked about growth for next year, total for the company in the 6% to 8% range. So anything that was in the middle teens was really a result of that acquisition, and that's why I go back to you really have to look at the numbers and just parse them slightly to take out the effects of either currency or those kind of acquisitions. If you -- so the portions of the market in which we participate in generally have been CAD. That's been the design and engineering software. And we've had growth rates in the teens to 20% range when our competitors have been growing at a maximum of 1\/2 that rate. That, to me, is market share gain. I think when you go and you look at the other places where we're entering, we're doing really well in simulation even though it's on a tiny number. And I think compared to some of the big companies there, we're a tiny fraction of what's going on. So while we're growing really quickly, it's still relatively small. PLM is a nascent business. We're just entering it. I'm incredibly optimistic about what we've heard from customers so far. But I think in many ways, we'll be able to show really large growth rates. And so I'm very confident about our position there. The other thing is, I think for the first time we have a complete offering that covers really all the bases in terms of what a manufacturer would need. And in most respects, it's a much broader portfolio we get to offer the manufacturing companies than any of our competitors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital.","Matthew Hedberg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I know you guys don't guide to cash flow. In 2012, it lagged revenue growth a little bit. I guess I'm wondering, for fiscal '13, given the revenue growth and margin and inherent leverage in the model, is there anything that we should be aware of from a cash flow perspective that would change that, I mean, to ultimately having cash flow grow more in line with revenue? And then as a quick follow-up, I'm wondering if you could comment on ASPs in the quarter.","Mark J. Hawkins","So a couple of things on the cash flow. Matt, well, we don't typically guide on that, as you talked about. We did call out a little bit of an anomaly due to billing non-linearity, if you will, in Q4. So one of the benefits of that is that, that will show up in Q1. And so in the same way it took a way a little bit from cash flow in Q4, it will have a little bit of an adder in Q1. And I think you should assume that our cash conversion cycle is going to be pretty stable. From that standpoint, our CapEx, which is important when you're looking at free cash flow, you'll continue to guide it between 2% to 3% of revenue. We've historically fell in that zone. I think just last year, we had, what, 2.8%. We've been a little lower, a little higher. But I think if you pick somewhere in the middle there, you're probably going to be in a pretty good zone to think about the free cash flow from that standpoint. And I think if you look at even this year, even with a little bit of the dampening with the non-linearity in Q4, when you look at cash flow, it's something around the  $570-plus million, $574 million range. And you look at our operating margins at $533 million. And you're seeing the quality of our income in the sense that our cash flow is growing faster than our revenue -- or excuse me, faster our operating margin. So those are couple of relationships that I'd have you consider, Matt, as you think about modeling for the future. Now on the ASP, Carl?","Carl Bass","Yes, not much change in ASPs this quarter. The usual variation, nothing exceptional to call out, no big trends that we're forecasting for next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Blair Abernethy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Blair Abernethy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Carl, just one more on the PLM side of things. Can you just give us a bit of a little more detail on your go-to-market strategy at this point, in particular, sort of direct versus -- direct sales versus the channel preparation? Where are they at now? And also, can you shed a little more light on what your pricing is looking like for the PLM?","Carl Bass","Yes, sure. In our general introduction of new products, our approach to go-to-market when we're bringing new products to market tends to be a little bit more heavily weighted towards direct. And the reason for that is we want to make the feedback loop between what our customers are saying and what we're developing and how we're tuning our approach to marketing be as short as possible. This is no exception. We're doing the same thing. You'll see a disproportionate amount of the early business that we do will go through our direct channel. But I would say, our PLM business is being fully contemplated as a channel business. In the limit, I don't think you'll see any difference in our PLM business in terms of the mix between direct and channel over time. But we really do like to go out there with customers early on, understand what their pain points are, try to understand where people are being most receptive to the extent that there are things that -- objections or needs that they see unmet in the product. We want to understand that as quickly as possible. The other thing that we often talk about is that it's difficult for some of our channel partners to make big investments in new products. And so what we try to do is in some ways kind of soften the ground, try to understand as much as possible and direct them to what we think are really the best candidates. So rather than having 1,000 independent experiments, we rather take the brunt of that on ourselves, coordinate the activity. So in the first 3 to 6 months, you'll see a little bit more preponderance of direct deals. I would suspect by the end of the year and certainly moving into the next year, this is a business that looks identical to our other businesses.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick follow-ups. I got cut off earlier. First, is there an appreciable difference in mix or adoption of suites by GM or do you see that being configurations and the maintenance attached, for example, of suites is pretty much consistent across the regions? And then secondly, on the PLM pilot that you talked about earlier, Carl, could you talk about the role, if any, that you're seeing from your existing Vault product either with the new customers or existing -- or legacy customers? Is Vault at all playing a part in the piloting or are the customers predominantly using just the pre-configured apps that you showed at AU?","Carl Bass","Yes. So the first question there, Jay, was around the suites. Yes, I mean, we generally don't break it out. But for you, Jay, I'd tell you there's not much difference. It's pretty consistent. There's always a little bit of a bias towards developed countries over emerging economies. There's usually a little bit bigger pickup in the Americas rather than Asia Pacific. But within those kind of norms, not much difference. And almost every programmatic change we've made over the years shows that exact same dynamic of adoption. So when you look back on subscription, direct sales, almost everything we've done kind of follows that same pattern, and it's very consistent with that. Around the PLM pilots, I mean, one of the things that's interesting about it, and here's where we get a little bit too much in the weeds of terminology, our Vault product, what it really does is data and document management. It's been hugely successful. There's millions of people who are using it. It's a wildly successful, easy-to-deploy solution, and all of them are deployed behind the firewall. What we chose for PLM for us was really managing customers processes. And what we said we were going to do is do that in the cloud. Now what's interesting is when you go and you look at most of the current PLM vendors out there, a big proportion of the sales that fall under the rubric of PLM are really data management. That people have been more successful with data document management than they've ever been about managing the process. So while they've been sold on the managing process, it hasn't worked. And that's really kind of tilled the ground for us because people understand that they want to manage these work processes. Our product works with document management, whether it's in our Vault or whether it's in any of the other document management or so-called PLM systems. We're really agnostic about where people choose to store the documents. What we're giving them is tools to manage the workflow and the processes around it. It works well with Vault. We've certainly seen adoption amongst Vault customers. But there's no particular tie there as many of the big accounts that I've talked about, as well as the small accounts, have been non-Autodesk data management customers. Hopefully, that helps.","Operator","At this time, I would like to hand the call back to Dave Gennarelli, Director, Investor Relations, for closing remarks.","David Gennarelli","Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us today. Next week, we'll be at the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference in San Francisco. And then later in March, on March 29, we'll have another webinar on our PLM business so tune in for that. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
