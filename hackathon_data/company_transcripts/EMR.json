During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 5, 2015.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Craig Rossman","Thank you, Robert. This afternoon, I am joined by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at Emerson.com.","A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 90 days. I will start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on slide two of the presentation.","Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% to $5.4 billion with underlying sales flat. As a result of lower oil prices, capital spending reductions by global customers in oil and gas markets, particularly upstream were faster and more significant than expected.","A broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly in North America and China, and most pronounced in energy-related markets affected order rates and resulting sales in the quarter. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind.","Order rates reflected economic conditions -- difficult economic conditions in the quarter beyond oil and gas, continued weakness in European short cycle spending impacted demand. However Europe is beginning to show signs of movement, benefiting from the depreciation of the euro. We expect European competitors to continue to use the weaker euro to their advantage.","Global Telecommunications customers continue to expect capital spending across all geographies and Climate Technologies order rates were affected by the U.S. residential air conditioning pre-built in the previous two quarters.","Turning to slide three, gross profit margin declined 110 basis points to 40.1%, driven by volume deleverage resulting from the sudden drop to flat underlying sales growth after two quarters of moderate growth. Specifically in the U.S. which turned negative after two quarters of 8% underlying sales growth. Gross profit margins also reflecting unfavorable business mix and higher costs related to increased strategic investment in 2014.","Reported earnings per share increased 84% to a $1.42. Adjusted earnings per share decreased 16% to $0.65, excluding a $0.77 gain on the sale of the Power Transmission Solutions business. Current markets conditions will acquire more focused on the execution of strategic programs.","Turning to slide four, for the second quarter P&L summary, as mentioned, net sales decreased 7% versus the prior year, while gross profit margin was down 110 basis points. Included in the results was the $932 million gain on the sale of the Power Transition Solutions business and restructuring spend of $44 million, 15 million shares were repurchased during the quarter.","Turning to slide five, underlying sales growth in the quarter was flat, excluding unfavorable currency translation of 5% and an impact from divestiture of 2%. By geography, demand was mix with the Middle East and Africa up 8%, Europe up 2%, Asia up 1%, while the U.S. was down 3% and Latin America was down 7%.","Turning to slide six, business segment margins declined to 260 basis points to 13.2%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Operating cash flow decreased due to a lower operating results and investment in working capital. Operating cash flow will take a couple of quarters to recover. Trade working capital performance was also affected by the business slowdown.","Turn to slide seven for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales grew by 2% with a 5% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales decreased of 3% in the quarter.","Upstream oil and gas activity slowed as the results of industry capital budget reductions, while downstream activity continued to be a bright spot, particularly in the power and chemical and petrochemical markets.","Demand in Asia was up 6% with strong growth in India and other emerging markets offsetting a slight decline in China, while Europe was up 7% with double-digit growth in emerging markets. Similarly Africa was up 3%, reflecting favorable activity levels across the region.","Margins were down 350 basis points due to unfavorable mix, the impact of the stronger dollar on operations, higher levels of invested spending and increased restructuring. Demand is expected to remain weak for the next 12 months.","Turn to slide eight for the Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation net sales decreased 16% as currency translation deducted 6% and divestitures deducted 8%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 2% versus the prior year. Second quarter results were affected by weakness in short cycle European demand, upstream oil and gas, and industrial spending in energy-related markets.","Geographic demand was mixed with North America down 1%, Europe down 2% and Asia up 1%. Reduction in upstream oil and gas spending continue to negatively affect order rates in the Power Generating Alternators and Electrical Distribution businesses.","Margin decreased to 130 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and a 40 basis point impact from divestitures. We expect market conditions to remain mix with some improvement in Europe and continued weakness in energy-related markets.","Turn to slide nine for the Network Power segment results. Network Power sales decreased 9% as currency translation deducted 5% and divestitures deducted 1%, resulting in an underlying sale declined of 3% versus the prior year.","Demand for global -- decreased global demand for Telecommunications Power business continued, while the Data Center business decreased moderately reflecting continued weakness in infrastructure investment.","Geographic results varied with Europe up 4%, benefiting from hyper-scale data centre project revenues in Sweden, while North America was down 7% and Asia was down 5%. Margins decreased reflecting volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring. In the second half of the year we expect improving data center market conditions with continued weakness in Telecommunications Power spending.","Turn to slide 10 for the Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies net sales decreased 6% as U.S. air conditioning customers work through pre-built inventory from the previous two quarters. Underlying sales declined 3% as currency translation deducted 3%.","Asia was down 2% as growth in India, Australia, and Southeast Asia air conditioning and refrigeration businesses was more than offset by slowing demand in China. In other regions, Europe had slight growth of 1%, Middle East and Africa was up 35%, and Latin America was down 19%. Modest underlying growth in the second half of the year will be led by the HVAC and Refrigeration businesses.","Turn to slide 11 for the Commercial and Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales grew 3% with a 2% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 1%, led by favorable market conditions in the U.S.","Growth in the food waste disposers, storage and wet\/dry vacuums more than offset declines in the professional tools business. Recent softness in the professional tools business reflects reductions in oil and gas-related spending. Favorable trends in U.S. construction markets are expected to continue, supporting an outlook for moderate growth in the second half of the year.","Turn to slide 12 for the 2015 outlook. The global macroeconomic environment will continue to be challenging for the remainder of 2015, as strong headwinds with lower oil prices, strength of U.S. dollar and a broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly in North America and China will place downward pressure on underlying sales growth across most of our businesses.","Visibility is limited in this environment so our focus will be on controlling what we can. Near-term profitability will be negatively affected by volume deleverage as a result of the rapid decline to lower underlying growth expectations. Therefore, restructuring will continue to be accelerated and will now be expected to exceed $140 million for the year.","Based upon these market conditions, we now expect 2015 net sales to decline 7% to 5%. Underlying sales growth is expected to be 0% to 2%, excluding a negative impact from currency translation of approximately 5% and a 2% deduction from divestitures. Reported earnings per share is expected to be $4.17 to $4.32, including a significant reduction from currency translation, the power transmission solution divestiture gain of $0.77 per share and accelerated restructuring costs of $0.09 per share.","And I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Craig. Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us today, both shareholders and investors. I will probably be longer than normal. I had some things I want to get out and discuss with my shareholders. Clearly, we had a very challenging tough quarter and the market headwinds that we\u2019re facing today has become much stronger in this over the last 60 days.","But you know, we know how to deal with it. We\u2019ve been here before and the necessary actions, reviews, executions are underway and there will be more on this in a few minutes. We will continue to execute the tactical and strategic actions required to create long-term shareholder value of this company.","The Board, the OCE and the senior management team fully understand and fully debate what needs to be done, the timing, the actions and when and how we go about it. Our actions clearly have been underway since February. We talked about this at the investor conference, but given the stronger and broader headwind, we\u2019ll now need to be deeper, broader and even more properly measured against where we\u2019re trying to take the company long term.","April, underlying orders appear to be shaping up to be down 5% to 8%. So let\u2019s step back and review the where we\u2019ve been, where we\u2019re up to, the actions and with the discussion that we\u2019re having internally and basically how I see this as we\u2019re going forward. Now consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing in our monthly orders, we had a tough second quarter after underlying sales for corporation been nearly 5%, the last six months before this quarter hit us.","The dramatic slowdown for the precise accountants out there is probably 4.75%. But for today it\u2019s nearly 5%. The slowdown in capital spending in the oil and gas industry and related markets have been faster and deeper than we anticipated. This has had a significant effect on the sales and profitability of our process business, resulting in deleverage and some unfavorable mix and actions will be needed to improve that at the proper speed.","Overall impact has been a sharp drop in demand across most of our industrial businesses across the U.S. There is a lot of business around oil and gas that\u2019s being impacted. It\u2019s just not oil and gas spending.","Capital spending on telecommunication equipment has decreased sharply -- sharply since early this calendar year as key cut companies space reduced investment levels due to slowdown in economy, due to regulations, due to laws whatever being put upon them in our customer base.","A sharp decline and continuing transition to the data center designs negatively affected the result of our network power business. But there's nothing new and different from what we\u2019re seeing and we\u2019re taking the actions there also to protect ourselves. Overall, now the trailing three-months with April can be around negative 8%. This tells me the third quarter will be challenging.","Third quarter sales could be negative, slightly negative underlying clearly with dollar they will be but slightly negative underlying unless there is a turn sometime in May and June. We have been through down cycles before. This is my third as a CEO of Emerson Electric. We are confident the businesses will come back strongly when the investment environment stabilizes.","In 2009 and 2010, underlying sales in our process business declined for five consecutive quarters and then recovered strongly. Now we have no visibility on when that happens again, but we do know investments will rebound and we need to make sure we take the cost actions needed to temporary fix the profitability but also keep in mind we\u2019re not going to jeopardize our core technologies or our market share.","As we've done in the past in this type of environment, we will be intensely focused on the levers we can control. Over the last several years we've made meaningful strategic investment to serve our customers and strengthen our market positions and now we need to refocus given the environment that doesn't look like growth but flat at best. ","The markets changed and we need to react. We are taking the necessary target action, the cost of this corporation across this world both at the business level and the corporate level to get the cost of line for an environment we could be facing for many quarters, maybe multiple years of tough growth.","The bottoms-up approach, each business unit, is evaluating where we need to have the investments and where we do not need those investments, where we need the capacity and where we do not need the capacity, how we deal with the stronger U.S. dollar, how do we compete against our dollar -- our euro-based competitors coming out of Europe, our yen-based competitors coming out of Japan, who have created through currency movements a significant competitive advantage on a price cost situation.","We will continue to do the necessary restructuring. It will continue for the rest of this fiscal year. And I -- as I discussed with the board most likely through the first six months of fiscal 2016, as we take the actions necessary to compete, improve profitability and protect our market position in the world where the dollar is much stronger than it was this 12 months ago.","Our current field with the current actions we identify to be 3,000 people across Emerson to achieve cost reduction of at least 150 and hopefully more on an annual run rate basis. There will be more actions needed, given what I see today and given the continued negative underlying growth rates that we've seen over the last three or four months.","As you know and debated with me, both friendly and unfriendly, we\u2019ve been actively repositioning and evaluating our portfolio to improve the profitability, to improve the core growth opportunities and to improve overall quality of this company. We have divested 12 businesses with $3.5 million of sales over the last seven years. These divestitures have improved probability and improved our growth rates.","We communicated previously that we will continue to evaluate the portfolio and we have underway today the divestiture of InterMetro storage business, which will happen sometime before the calendar year is done. We continuously discuss with the Board, the actions necessary both on acquisitions and restructuring and portfolio management, necessary to make Emerson a stronger, more profitable, faster growing business.","The Board, nor the management team are afraid of taking the tough actions. And we will do what\u2019s necessary to improve our profitability, our earnings growth, our cash flow in a very tough environment. We will continue to be very discipline with our capital allocation.","We will continue to look for the right acquisitions. We took one small and went to the Board today. I'm hoping over the next 12 months, we will see more assets available for us to invest in. The current focus is on improving profitability in a low growth environment. Our current focus is to improve our cash flow after we get through this dramatic down shift in our marketplace and take that money and invest it in the portfolio that will give us growth and profitability going forward.","We will continue to aggressively look at the portfolio. We will take actions that are smart and disciplined. We will not take knee-jerk reactions at this company. It\u2019s not the way I operate. We intend to return approximately $3.8 billion for our shareholders this year through dividends and share repurchases.","Over the last three years, we have returned a total of $6.5 billion or 63% of our operating cash flow through dividends and buybacks. We will continue to focus on high level of cash returns for our shareholders, improving our portfolio mix, driving value and doing what we can do best in this type of environment. We've been dealt a challenging hand. I\u2019m not afraid of that hand.","We are taking the necessary actions across this corporation. The Board is fully engaged. The Board fully understands what needs to be done and is supporting the management team to the tune of getting these things done. We clearly see the next six months as very challenging to us and we can clearly see the impact of the dramatic drop-off in spending in many of our core businesses, the much stronger dollar and I'm not talking about translational impacts.","I\u2019m talking about the fact that our global competitors coming out of Europe and Japan now have a unique advantage. So, we need to take the necessary actions to protect our position and improve our profitability over time. There is no quick fixes here. This is hard work and this management knows how to do it and we will do it.","I do not like the quarter we just reported but unfortunately it happens and we will take the necessary actions to go forward from here. I appreciate the support of our shareholders. I appreciate the support of our investors and I truly appreciate the support of the Board and the management team as we work hard here over the next six to nine months to improve the position of this company and earn back the respect of our shareholders and our investors.","So with that, we will open the floor for questions. Thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi.","David Farr","I can\u2019t wait for that first question. I got my baseball bat out. I got my Rally Monkey here. I\u2019m getting the sword out. Who\u2019s first? Julian?","Julian Mitchell","Yes. Hi, Dave. Just a question first on the operations. And I guess your revised fiscal year guidance implies operating margins bounced back quite a bit in process and in Network Power in the second half from Q2. Just wondered if there was some one-off or mixed issues that hurt margins in those two businesses that you think go away?","David Farr","Yeah. The big issue, Julian is if you step back and look at what hurt the second quarter in a big way and we obviously have some hills to climb in the second half, is that our underlying U.S. sales were over 7.5% in the last nine months. Process is very strong in that time period. We went from underlying U.S. sales of 7.5% to negative 3% in one quarter.","As we announced in February, we knew things were getting weak but they happened very quickly in a couple key markets -- U.S. and China and Latin America. We are sitting in a situation where our facilities have been repositioned in the last couple years in the U.S. We moved position, production into the U.S. and now with the stronger dollar, we will have to move things around and we are sitting absorbing some fixed costs that we have to deal with, which we have started initiating in early February. And we will start getting some payback on that in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But still we will be facing this headwind because of the dramatic drop-off in our core businesses here in the U.S. and the market mix.","So what we are banking on right now is that we are quickly tackling the fixed costs, we are quickly tackling the costs and what we are seeing is we'll see some profit improvement as the year goes on. That\u2019s the measurement we are going after right now and Am I got exactly, right or we\u2019ve got exaggerated? It really depends how fast things drop-off.","But right now that fixed cost hit us real hard in the second quarter and we are aggressively going after it. We spent, I think around $45 million in restructuring in the second quarter. We will try about spending another $65 million to $70 million in the third quarter. So, we will start getting payback on that as we go forward. So that\u2019s what the game plan is, is we\u2019ve got absorb that de-leverage.","The other issue we\u2019ve got going on right now is we are going to quickly tackle the working capital, which means we take the production down and that will have a little deleverage impacted. So we are playing this game. We know how to play this game but I know that it\u2019s going to take us three, six, nine months to get through there to get that effect. But we will get the profitability back. There is nothing wrong with the core business as the profitability can\u2019t come back on.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then just you talked on the call and the release about tactical and strategic actions and at the same time, the need to avoid a knee-jerk reaction. So maybe just clarify the timeline of how you are looking at businesses like Network Power in that regard, please?","David Farr","I put my sword in the ground. I think almost 2.5 years ago I said 3 years so I don\u2019t think the timeframe has changed one iota. I do think that -- what we tried to do at the Board level is talk the day-to-day how do we get our cost of line quickly to deal with the price cost issues, to deal with the lower volume. And then strategically, you just don\u2019t want to ignore the strategic issues that we face as a company from a portfolio mix and we will do that on a systematic approach that makes sense.","I mean, as you well know, my focus is if we are going to decide to get out of the business, I want to get out of the business that creates value for my shareholders. I am not going to cut and run just to cut and run. I think that is the wrong thing. I think my shareholders would be very mad at me if I did that. They expect me to manage the assets that we have here profitably and to create that value the best we can or to realize that value and that I am no different. Genetically that is how I built and you know that.","Julian Mitchell","Right. Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Julian.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, Dave, on the process, maybe a little bit more on what you\u2019re seeing in the different geographies, I mean North America obviously gotten a lot of the highlights, that you know China, LatAm, just what are you seeing and what\u2019s your current view on where this might head?","David Farr","I do. I can give you a sense of that. Just generally from the businesses worldwide, the U.S. looks for us is kind of shocked, I would say shakier for the next -- from an industrial standpoint for the next two, three quarters. Europe is slowly getting better. We had a better Europe as you know. The one place that I am really concerned about is China in the lack of investments and the slowdown and I will get to specific business in a second.","But clearly overall macro right now, U.S. is a concern to me. China is a concern to me. Latin America is a concern to me. Europe I think is getting slowly getting better. And then outside of China, we are doing pretty well. And then Canada continues to invest as they are trying not to lose market share in the oil and gas market.","But if I look at the various businesses and I am trying to get the chart here which has it broken down by ordinary. I would say process right now is seeing a tough time -- a tougher time in China. They are seeing a tougher time in the oil and gas companies in Southeast Asia. They are doing better job in India. The Middle East has held up for us, because we had a lot of orders and they have not backed off and orders have held up what surprises me a little bit.","Profit outside of Western Europe has seen an improvement, and I think we are going to start seeing an improvement out of the Western Europe export business. So I think that will get better. Latin America I think right now is going to be a tough year for process control. Just Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, so that\u2019s right now I see it. I think we haven\u2019t reached bottom in certain markets and that includes the U.S. And I think that we haven\u2019t reached bottom in probably China or we haven\u2019t reached bottom in Latin America. The rest of places seem to be stabilizing and you notice we are coming up a little bit.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. And then just on this telecom piece, I mean obviously it\u2019s hitting you very hard right now, maybe just -- is that net neutrality related stuff or what else are you seeing there? And aside from, I mean it seems like that\u2019s kind of the near-term driver, are you happy with the way the data center piece of the business is performing, just maybe a little split between the pieces?","David Farr","Yes. I think from my perspective, it is really hard in the last four months is the dramatic cut in spending from the standpoint of the impact of net neutrality. And also there is some shifting going on in the industry rather world and where money has been spent, not being spent. That\u2019s hit us pretty hard. That one to be honest really caught us, I mean, a little bit surprised in the dramatic cutback and how fast these guys can cutback as they reshift their priorities and that hurts us quite dramatically.","And we are about going after the fixed cost there and taking the capacity out and down, but that takes us a couple of quarters. In Europe right now, our Network Power data center enterprise business, I like the improvement we are seeing. I see slow gradual improvement.","I would say in North America right now there has been very little improvement. It goes up and down quarter to quarter. The customer base is not really moving forward relative to spending money and a big part of that customer base also excluding the telecom power but also the enterprise side of that, we sell lot into the telecom space and enterprise side too and they have really cut back in spending.","And then the other place we\u2019ve seen a dramatic cutback is in China. The rest of the part of Asia is doing pretty well. So there has been another hit here and we are significantly taking restructuring across Network Power from a technology and the products we have today are likely have that\u2019s not an issue. It\u2019s just the fact of where we see it coming out at this point in time.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yeah. So, Dave, I appreciate all the extra detail on the actions. You mentioned a number of times in the prepared remarks that you\u2019ve seen European and Japanese competitors using the currency advantage. It sounds like that\u2019s done to cut price or done to be more aggressive on price, is that true? And how are you responding? Are you going to respond with discounts? So maybe just describe a bit more on that, Dave.","David Farr","I think the short-term -- in the second quarter, the price cost issue other than price cost maybe issues around outside United States have been little. There has been some price cost issues relative to say eastern European businesses where we are sourcing and the movement on that. The price cost issues coming out of Europe and the Japanese competitors, we see that hitting us more in the second half and going into early next year. So that\u2019s why we got to get ahead of this curve, because we know they will, we know that we\u2019ve been here in this case before. It wasn\u2019t in my first two or three years as CEO that we had the euro at parity when we actually ran down at 85.","I saw how the European competitors acted at that point in time. And I would say they are going to pick up the competitive nature of this. The amount of project opportunity out there is still I think still shrinking, so it\u2019s going to be more competitive and they have an advantage with the euro and the yen where it is right now. So we know their actions will be very I would say sharp on the pencils and sharp on the price. And we obviously will do what is necessary to protect our share, but we will also not going to do stupid things from the standpoint of having to give away price where we have the unique technology.","So over the last several years we have the dollar helped us quite a bit and now we have it flipped. And we have to get our cost back in line relative to where we source things and where we position stuff which we will do to be able to compete and protect our margins. But it will take us six to nine months. Don\u2019t be surprised, it will take us six -- and we know how to play this game. And in the meantime, we will see them coming at us. It will be more the second half of the year on the pricing actions.","Nigel Coe","And where do you think you are going to see the bulk of this pressure, do you think it\u2019s pretty broad based or do you think it\u2019s more centric within Network Power and Automation?","David Farr","I think it\u2019s going to be broad-based. I think you will see across the industry. I think you will see it. U.S. companies have had a unique situation where I would say you go across the U.S., I don\u2019t care what companies you talk about be it industrial or consumer, U.S. companies have done very well in the last 10 years and gaining market participation in the U.S. marketplace. And I think you\u2019re going to see some of the foreign competition taking advantage of this dramatic shift in the dollar -- euro, dollar, yen situation. This is no doubt about it. This is just the Emerson Electric, trust me.","Nigel Coe","No, I think you\u2019re right there. And then just a quick one on process margins, it sounds -- it seems like your guidance is baking in the sequential improvement in process margins, which is what we normally see seasonal. But as process goes negative in the back half of the year, which creates a bit more pressure. You mentioned you had to cut inventories. Do you think the process margins have bottomed in 2Q, or do you think there is a bit more pressure in the second half of the year?","David Farr","What the margins face in Q2? I mean, I think I would say they got hit pretty hard this quarter and I mean based on what I see, they normally would come back up. We\u2019ve taken -- Steve Sonnenberg and the whole management team have worked extremely hard very earlier on the restructuring side, I would say they are going to get a little bit better.","From my perspective, I want to figure out how to get their margin back up and so they have for the whole year to get back more online to where they should be. But there are a lot of things moving in that first -- in that second quarter, even including relative to selling a litigation suit. So I think that we\u2019ll get the margin back up in the third and fourth quarter.","But clearly, these guys are taking action. Right now, I would say the action is underway. Process Management and the Network Power have been the big, big spenders of restructuring both in the second quarter and in the third quarter. So the Steve and his team knows what it means to get to that margin, they\u2019re going to get it.","Nigel Coe","Okay. Dave, good luck.","David Farr","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Thanks. And good afternoon, Dave and Frank.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steve Winoker","I like that enthusiasm.","David Farr","I mean, if we decided -- I can\u2019t decide -- is there any reason to come to New York? You already asked all the questions. You probably did your good afternoon.","Steve Winoker","There is always more, Dave. We can really get into it, right.","David Farr","I am going to allow you to take two questions from you, no. Who all is going to talk, okay. And I\u2019m very slow answering questions.","Steve Winoker","Just bring in the baseball bat, okay.","David Farr","I got right here partner.","Steve Winoker","So listen, I\u2019m trying to -- there was a time when you used to talk about the strength of the dollar being good for Emerson or a stronger dollar being good for Emerson.","David Farr","Strong dollar good for the country I said.","Steve Winoker","Okay. So I just want to talk about the cost base so for you. I mean as you\u2019ve gone international here on the dollar, what are the things that you can do beyond just restructuring on the material side? Are there other things that you can do that could actually change the margin story a little bit and help you on the pricing front as well?","David Farr","Yes. One thing Emerson does have, as you all know we have a very global manufacturing base say for process. So we can shift where we make the product, either into Mexico, either into Eastern Europe, either into Asia and rebalance that to take advantage of where the currencies have weakened along like the euro or like the yen. So we have very strong manufacturing facilities in Mexico and we have manufacturing facilities in Eastern Europe.","So you\u2019ll see us already in the capacity sitting there. So you\u2019ll see us merely moving in. We had just gone through a process over the last 12 months of moving manufacturing back into the U.S. And now with the capacity we have in certain and like all cost locations versus the dollar and the euro, we\u2019re going to quickly move there. The other thing we have to start moving our sourcing for the standpoint of both internally and externally and that takes six to nine months. And there we can get our cost back in line to get our margin back up both through the restructuring effort and moves but it takes us time.","And then that allows us the pricing flexibility necessary to compete against countries that are playing the currency game against us. We do as a nation -- we as a nation and that\u2019s why you believe in the strong dollar. I think we cannot have the nation as a weak currency. I believe quite strongly that we will take the actions necessary to move stuff around the world and we\u2019re going to have the flexibility to do it. And we will do it and it\u2019s already underway.","Steve Winoker","And what\u2019s baked into your planning and thinking, your best thoughts about trough volumes here. I mean, what do you think about oil prices? How important is that at this point to you sort of calling and volume starting to get better in two or three quarters or what are you thinking on that front?","David Farr","My plan right now is that there is no growth. And you can say two quarters, three quarters, four quarters, five quarters, six quarters and what it takes for us to have increased earnings as we move out into that 2016 time period is what I\u2019m focused on. What actions we need to fix the cost structure to compete in no growth environment to allow us to show earnings growth and make 2015 the bottom of this one, my game plan.","Steve Winoker","But when are you thinking things don\u2019t get any worst, maybe that\u2019s the way to say it from a volume perspective?","David Farr","If I was that good, I wouldn\u2019t be a CEO anymore because I can go out and can run that and you wouldn\u2019t get quiet the same publicity that you have every time you open newspaper about how overpaid we are and how we tried to hurt people and I don\u2019t know. I mean, from my standpoint right now, I think as I look at the U.S., I look at what\u2019s going on, I look in Europe, I think you\u2019re probably talking early 2016 before you start seeing you can say things are turning back up even on the underlying volume basis.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Dave.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood","Hi. Thanks for taking my question, Dave. Just at a high level, you spoke about oil prices a bit, but WTI did fall to 45, now it\u2019s back above 60 today. Curious what type of lag that you see when you\u2019re taking to customer with bidding or quoting activity and how you might think that recent improvement could impact the orders?","David Farr","I think the people -- I don\u2019t think that our customer base will move much in the thought process and going from 40 to 60. I think these guys -- our customer base is now, they have been shocked, they have been hit, they are reallocating capital. They have their own thing, they\u2019re looking at -- I think there is going to some prior consolidation in this industry. So there is some capacity could be coming out.","So I think this space right now is set at price expectations that it could easily get hit again. And so these guys were managing their capital allocation such that they are going to cut spending probably for at least 12 to 18 months. And that\u2019s my view of it right now. And I don\u2019t -- I think there is more downward potential on the price of oil given what\u2019s happening in the world to slow down, what happens maybe in the Middle East if there is an Iranian deal. And let\u2019s say that there is more potential oil coming in the marketplace. So I think they need to be very cautious and I think they will be very cautious.","Mike Wood","Great. And the $0.09 restructuring that you had cited, should we think about that paying off on one to one dollar ratio and have you taken a look at your CapEx, R&D goals or any areas respond there as well? Thanks.","David Farr","Yeah. I think, our -- historically when we -- our restructuring is one to one. And so right now, the number we\u2019re looking at is about $140 million. I would say, as the year goes forward that number is going to move towards $150, $160 for the fiscal year. Most likely as you look at -- if you look out beyond that and total price of cycle paying is spending over $200 million in setting the cost structures its corporation.","And capital right now, based on what I see, we are going to try curtail little bit, but I have set motions on redeploy the capital that we have started about 18 months ago and so in Eastern Europe and also in Mexico.","And I also have what I would call risk hedging and capital from the standpoint of what I manufacture things. So I don\u2019t see our capital take a dramatic drop-off, but I would say as we get into 2016 and 2017 that capital number as a percent of sales will come down.","Mike Wood","Thank you.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Hello there.","David Farr","I have got [indiscernible] doing.","Christopher Glynn","Oh! God. I think I want to go back two years ago. You get any start as you concerned that way.","David Farr","We need a couple pictures. I think we have got it -- we need a picture we lost our base our ace.","Christopher Glynn","Sorry to hear that.","David Farr","Yeah. Actually, Chris, no sorry for that, that didn\u2019t sound very real, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","The trade deadlines are ways out, you got sometime. Dave, in the past and today you\u2019ve kind a described the accordion aspect of your global cost structure and ability to respond to things like currency. Guessing, maybe there is a pretty big magnitude of opportunity to leverage that in process, but wondering if you could describe sort of the scope of what can be done there?","David Farr","I mean from our perspective, we can move it around and it takes us time. We can both not only Process, but Network Power, Network Power has the same flexibility both in Mexico as they do in Eastern Europe, as they do in China. And so the Network Power has the same capability as does Process, as does Climate, as does most of all the industrial businesses.","So from my perspective, we are going to go after that moving, where we source the biggest opportunity for us is actually sourcing, where we know the dollar base sourcing had become very competitive for us for about two or three years. Now we are going to start shifting out and that will create non-dollar base sourcing, which means there is probably less job in the U.S. and more jobs other places around the world.","So we are already underway here and our cost of goods sold, pressures -- our SG&A pressures, we can deal with those things. And I mean that's the game plan we know how to play. We also know that it is going to take us six to nine months and we\u2019ll slowly get some benefit as we move into the second half of this year.","It\u2019s -- that accordion is still is very workable and we\u2019ve had a lot of tactical meetings here within the corporation in the last five or six days and as we are try to expand thing and taken a real serious look at what we think is going to happen in the next three, four, five quarters. So accordion is moving right now and it\u2019s going to be moving pretty rapidly.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then just going back to March, it seems like April didn\u2019t get any worse or maybe a touch better you mentioned something, we know is trending up? But what about -- what happened in March was maybe one-time in nature whether its channel flush or something else?","David Farr","Don\u2019t believe that.","Christopher Glynn","Okay.","David Farr","I don\u2019t believe that. I think if you look at the underlying -- I think my personal opinion. I think inventories in the U.S. are still too high given the pace of business. I heard numbers were small for all my directors that imports, it took a surge in the month, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s March or April, that tells the imports are already starting to come in and so, you want to borrow pen?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes.","David Farr","You have incorrect, okay, he is already shaking his pen. But I think that this thing is got some lives to go, because I think there is a shift going on as people adjust relative to weaker demand and they also adjust as we look at this whole issue relative to imports going up and also the impact on the sourcing, which we just talked about. So there\u2019s two or three layers here that you guys are through and I think that\u2019ll have an impact on U.S. operations of all companies.","Christopher Glynn","Got it. Thanks. Have a good day.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Take care. And for me a pen, shaking god damn pen around.","Craig Rossman","You cut call, Frank, I am trying to use as long as I can.","David Farr","Okay.","Operator","And we will take our next question Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon.","Deane Dray","Hey, Dave. I\u2019m actually at the OTC show in Huston today at the Offshore Technology Conference and I was just at the Emerson booth, there was some good traffic there? But what I did notice was big emphasis on reliability consulting, maybe less on trying to sell equipment but more on a differentiated sale regarding efficiency and as you say and so forth? Is that going to be the part of go-to-market strategy to process over the near-term?","David Farr","110% correct. The issue here is there\u2019s been such a strong expansion in the oil and gas industry that the capacity went in very quickly not necessarily looking at optimization and now what we see with our capabilities from the people resources in our technologies is that we can optimize what they\u2019ve already invested in and we see the focus from a customer really shift hard that way and you clearly are seeing that in that trade show and you\u2019ve see it across not only the oil and gas but also the chemical industry and the power industry in a big way.","So you are seeing this, this is going to be the game plan in our solutions organization and Jim Nyquist is totally focused on that. In fact one of the acquisitions that we took the Board today is very, very much focused in that same area and so that\u2019s where the game is going to be.","Deane Dray","That's helpful. And with downstream being one of the brighter spots, maybe you comment on how resilient your MRO business for process has been and I know we had some refiner strikes, are you seeing deferred maintenance and what your expectation for the MRO side of process?","David Farr","We haven\u2019t seen any differed action yet in the MRO and that's another reason why we have a big third quarter, typically third and fourth quarter, because we see more MRO action around that time period.","So right now, we have not seen a slowdown of that. That would be the key issue for me relative to how our margins come back if we get into the second half of the year and then the day-to-day MRO.","Once the [indiscernible] business really disappears then we\u2019ll have a lot more pressure versus the big projects. But right now it\u2019s holding up -- it\u2019s holding up from the perspective of day-to-day sales. So, I feel okay about that.","Deane Dray","Great. Thank you.","David Farr","You take care and stay in touch. And try not to hit anybody. You are not supposed to be driving around at the same time you are talking to the CEO of Emerson.","Deane Dray","No, no. I am stationary. I am outside the conference.","David Farr","Okay. You are on your feet. Don\u2019t walk across the street and get hit or something like that, okay?","Deane Dray","Yes, sir.","David Farr","Okay. See you later.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hey. Good afternoon guys.","David Farr","How you doing after, Scott? How you doing?","Scott Davis","I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019m trying to figure out the world and a lot of your comments are pretty bearish. So, I'm a little concerned. I mean, one of the things you mentioned, Dave, just the third kind of, I think you said down cycle since you\u2019ve been CEO. And the Fed is still providing plenty of stimulus out there and you\u2019ve seen the lending data and such. Are we walking into a recession here or is this a -- how do you define this, I guess? It sounds likes things are sequentially not getting better or in fact maybe getting worse to the exception of maybe Europe?","David Farr","I think free money is running. Of course, we are already in the eight year of free money. Free money doesn\u2019t do anything for us. I mean it\u2019s a -- there\u2019s plenty of cash out there. Cash is not the issue. The issue is trying to figure out how to get a sustainable type of demand. I think what really is going on is we\u2019ve had a couple of major, major shocks to this industrial space that we operate in, with the price of oil dropping off dramatically and all that spending going on, with that shift in the dollar.","And then also basically, there\u2019s better jobs out there but the jobs numbers are really not that exciting relative to employment levels that we've seen just 10 or 15 years ago. I mean, the workforce participation is not all that exciting. And then you\u2019ve seen the global China growth slowdown and Europe is getting better. But Europe\u2019s getting better at 2% out of 1%.","So, I don\u2019t think we are in a recession. I just think just we are in this economic slowdown and if they are not careful here, you could bump this thing into a pretty tough period and that's my standpoint. I am calling the way I see it right now. I am dealing with an issue where business has dropped off dramatically and we are going to have to deal with that.","And I don\u2019t worry about calling recessions, not calling recession. I am taking action now and so where we are. And I\u2019m not walking away from market share that we\u2019ve gained over the years and we are going to figure out how to win that and protect it, so that's what I\u2019m calling.","Scott Davis","It makes sense.","David Farr","I don\u2019t call recessions. There\u2019s a Fed that does that but I would say -- ","Scott Davis","I guess just trying to get my arms at sequentially, how much worse things get and are you the only guy who has the guts to call a spade a spade or is everybody else just not seeing it yet or something? But I guess that's for another conversation but I guess the\u2026","David Farr","I just have to be a little bit straightforward on this guy.","Scott Davis","Yeah. Historically, it\u2019s correct. If you look at your stock price, Dave, I mean, based on your commentary, it sounds you can make an argument, assets are overvalued because earnings need to come down still. But based on your stock price, it's pretty depressed and how do you think about that versus M&A? I mean, the M&A market is still a little pricey right and it\u2019s going to be a while the prices come down but your stock is acting a little piggish here. At what point do you say buybacks may be a better plan and we will buy our stock when nobody else wants it?","David Farr","Well, we did buy as you well know. We are buying well over $2.5 billion this year and we\u2019ll continue to buy next year, not probably at that level but we\u2019ll continue to buy. Clearly, I don\u2019t -- I think the stock has been hit pretty hard and there\u2019s reasons for that. And people are challenged relative to our underlying growth. But I can't worry about that day-to-day. I don't like the fact that stock has been hit hard. I\u2019m just dealing in the facts right now and the facts show that the underlying demand out there is weak and may stay weak for several more quarters and we are just going to get the cost to back down in line to compete against our international competitors.","And if other companies don\u2019t want to do that, that\u2019s fine. Maybe other companies have better magic formulas, maybe they are doing a better job. So be it. But right now, I know what I am dealing with and I know we aren\u2019t competing and we are not losing. And I have no intention of losing and we are just going to get across the line to make sure that we can compete and drive the levels of possibility. Even in a tough quarter, we still had a very strong underlying profitability in this quarter. A lot of companies would love to have that underlying profitability in the quarter but that's not what Emerson finds acceptable.","Scott Davis","Well said. Okay. Dave. Thanks and good luck, guys.","David Farr","You take care.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Hey Dave. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Hey. Also just thinking big picture here about the portfolio and how you do drive growth going forward? I mean, if 2014 was peak cycle for Emerson, you just grew earnings kind of 3% peak-to-peak over kind of a six or seven year period of time and obviously a lot of different stuff happened but that's kind of the nature of my question.","David Farr","It\u2019s reasonable, Jeff that type of growth is not acceptable.","Jeff Sprague","Right so.","David Farr","This is why our stock is sitting where it is right now and I am not a fool. I understand that. I don\u2019t need to be told that and I fundamentally -- we are a premium company and I do not like what we face right now. So, we are going to figure out how to get premium underlying growth, both at the topline and bottom line, both through acquisitions, repositioning and restructuring, that\u2019s the game we plan. And I can\u2019t be more specific than that.","Jeff Sprague","So then just shifting to Network Power then, you did say in February that the business is restructured, you now just need to figure out how to drive profitability. Obviously, just keep getting fresh curve balls in this business. I mean, other than kind of the passage of -- so like the better term kind of probation period that the business maybe under, what is that that you are looking to see there in terms of a decision point?","David Farr","I think that from my perspective and what we\u2019re underway right now, I have everything I need at this point in time, trying to deal what I need to deal with. But it\u2019s just a function as I said, if we\u2019re going to drive our business, I want to figure out how to create the right value for our shareholders. I\u2019m not just going to dump and run if that is the decision. So, I think pretty much we have a good understanding of the marketplace. I see what -- I think what we can drive the profitability level to. Yeah, we had a tough quarter but a lot going on there. So, I mean, I think it\u2019s a pretty straightforward decision at this point in time. Now the question is what the best way of putting the execution to create the right value for my shareholders?","Jeff Sprague","And then just one last one on this FX at the price, maybe wishful thinking but we hear a lot of other companies say, the Japanese and European guys aren\u2019t going to do that because they\u2019ve got global footprints like we do and what goes around comes around on currency. Do you think there is any merit to that? I mean, there is clearly nothing wrong with being girded for them to come after you. But do you think global footprints have changed enough that maybe the behavior does not get as egregious as you fear on price?","David Farr","I\u2019ve one simple answer, no.","Jeff Sprague","All right","David Farr","I believe they\u2019ve changed enough.","Jeff Sprague","All right. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Good afternoon. This is Deepa Raghavan for Rich Kwas. How are you today?","David Farr","Good afternoon. How are you doing?","Deepa Raghavan","Very good. Thank you. We hear you on rate pricing or optimizing cost structure and M&A and return of capital. But question is do you have any thoughts on relating share buybacks at this point in time, given where we stand right now with growth or CapEx or next opportunities in M&A?","David Farr","At this point in time, no, we\u2019re going to spend $2.5 billions in share repurchase this year. I would expect right now we\u2019re probably getting in the $1.5 billion range next year. Mike, our focus is we\u2019re hoping to figure out how to find some asset as this marketplace is slowing down from an industrial space. There are some assets out there. And we\u2019re obviously working that real hard to be able to try to do more acquisitions as we get into the 2016.","Our preference is to figure how to -- if we\u2019re going to position and move out certain assets, how to also try to get some acquisition. So we\u2019re working that pretty hard right now. But at this point in time, the $2.5 billion of share repurchase this year set. And I do not see changing that and I see next year be in somewhere in that $1 billion to $1.5 billion range.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. Question on METRO forward margins, I know it\u2019s been talked about in Q&A. But you plan the 3% in this quarter, I mean, I know the target still remain 12% margins over a medium term. But how realistic is that that we model for high-single digit margins for the full year, for your fiscal \u201815?","David Farr","I mean, from my perspective given the significant restructure underway in network power. I mean that you\u2019re going to get hit at the EBIT line and so it\u2019s going to be challenging. But we still believe that 10% to 12% is doable as we reposition as cost structure and we get some kind of underlying improvement in particularly telecom space, which they\u2019ll come back within the next three to six months. So the business model hasn\u2019t change in that. It is going in and out of quarter, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. Last question for me. Tax rate for the full year, I mean do I watch it on a normalize basis, its more 31%, 32% or 34%, 35% like last year?","Frank Dellaquila","On operational basis we are looking at around 31%. The tax rate is inflated because of the gain on the divestiture. Operationally, we should be in the same within a percent or so where we were last year.","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","David Farr","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Hey, good afternoon, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Inch","I want to ask about -- I want to go back to the currency issue and we\u2019ve been in this environment where the yen is been weak for a while. And it didn't seem that the Japanese ever stepped up to try for perhaps various reasons, stepped up to try and do much about it. And then in the relative -- in the relative perspective, I mean the euro is only collapsing short period of time.","So just curious, what do you think is going on kind of around the world to all of a sudden have this increasing price-based competition, which I don't believe is unique to you. All of a sudden happen if it didn't really happen for so long in Japan, why is it happening more rapidly, given the relatively shorter duration of the euros decline?","David Farr","I think for the yen standpoint, it is a function of -- in the early stages, the Japanese recover. There is more internal focus for investment as we thought inside Japan. And as that recovery as sort of petered out from the standpoint of the economics and if you look at the underlying growth rates in Japan are not that strong right now. They've had a turn externally.","And we\u2019ve seen a ramping up in the last three to six months as they\u2019ve become much more aggressive around Asia and Europe and then also here in the United States. And this is the function, I think they're doing internally and now they\u2019re coming back out quite strongly. The European thing is a situation that we\u2019ve been here before we know its like, we know it takes a lot of gear up. And they\u2019ve been in a situation where they not had real underlying growth in Western Europe for a while.","So now you\u2019re going to see those European EPCs, the European small businesses, the European large businesses now be competitive, so they can go out and compete against all of the U.S. companies or other companies around the world. And I think that is the natural behavior to do that. They\u2019re going to go and we\u2019ve seen that before and everyone keep saying, the rebalance are not going to do that. But I don\u2019t think they rebound that much.","And from my perspective, you could see why they\u2019ve played that hand. You also had got a 25%-30% of competitive advantage on, just on a pure translation side. I think the games were played before and I think will be played again.","John Inch","Yeah. I know especially in a slow growth world, it makes perfect sense. I want to ask you more of a strategic question around restructuring. If you go back to the last recession, right, lots of companies were able to very successfully preserve their profitability despite the steep downturn because they all advanced their playbooks of restructuring. I guess one of the questions or concerns I have and it\u2019s maybe less to do with Emerson but I\u2019d like to get your thoughts on this is that as we go into what could amount to another downturn and obviously, probably won't be nearly as severe.","But is there as much action to take to be able to preserve profits like, very simplistically, haven\u2019t the lot of American industrial companies already downsizing and implemented lean and other tools to the point where they just isn\u2019t as much opportunity to cut costs if in fact we go into a more protracted slowdown, what are your thoughts?","David Farr","I think the answer is again, no. I think there are opportunities. I think there\u2019s been a lot of new technologies. There has been new ways we can share technology innovation and innovation around the world. And I think, the companies can take advantage of that. And given the fact that the currencies don't move and the cost structures don't move, eke altogether allows companies that someone said earlier the firm that would balance.","I think that there is opportunity that we see it today. And so I don\u2019t think the game is over with. I think there is always room for this. It maybe not China play this time where last time was a lot of China play. This time you are playing with different spaces and different locations and there is different approaches. So my fundamental belief is that the answer is no. There's room to fix your cost structure and there is room to improve your profitability.","John Inch","And one more Dave, do you believe your cost structure is more variable today, given sort of this technology in globalization versus pass-through that not really that clear because obviously, we\u2019re more variable, you could preserve your profits far better than perhaps anyone anticipates, right?","David Farr","I think we\u2019re less manufacturing based than it\u2019s historically been. So the people underestimate our software. They underestimate our systems, the solutions capability. I think, they all think that we\u2019re just a pure manufacturing company in this readout. I think the company has more variable cost than in the past. I mean, for us dealing with this pretty quickly, I think we have a lot more variable versus just pure fix large, fix manufacturing plants.","John Inch","Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","David Farr","Take care, John. All the best to you.","John Inch","You too.","David Farr","From our perspective again, I want to reiterate it was a tough quarter. I appreciate it. I appreciate your patience. Thanks for all the excellent questions. And I look forward to seeing everybody. And again, we\u2019re very much focused on execution right now in the company and in the discussion at the Board level as the last two Board meetings are very much based on the short-term tactical issues but also at the same time strategically, we want to return to our premium value growth company. And we will figure out what it takes to do that. And in the mean time, we have some other issues we deal with and we\u2019ll deal with ourselves. Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing all of you in the near future. Thanks.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Tim Reeves. Please go ahead, sir","Timothy Reeves","Thank you very much. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Welcome to Emerson's First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start with the first quarter summary on Slide 3. Sales in the first quarter of $4.1 billion increased 9% with underlying sales of 4.5%. End markets remained strong for us globally with the notable exception of our heating and air conditioning business in Asia. Commercial & Residential Solutions was down 1% underlying and was up 7%, excluding the Climate Asia business. Automation Solutions was up 7%. Trailing 3-month underlying orders remained in the 5% to 10% expected range through the quarter with December, up 7%. GAAP EPS was $0.74, up 21%, and stronger than our guidance in November. ","First quarter cash flow was down versus prior year, impacted by accounts payable and accruals timing, which is expected to reverse in 2019. We repurchased $800 million of shares in the quarter. And through January, we've completed our $1 billion repurchase target for the full year, acquiring more than 15.7 million shares. ","Turning now to Slide 4. First quarter gross margin was up 20 basis points on higher sales, and EBIT margin was up 110 basis points, including 50 basis points of dilution from the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Leverage on higher sales, lower incentive comp and favorable other deductions drove strong EBIT margin performance. A tax rate of 20.9% benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter. ","Turning now to Slide 5. The first quarter underlying sales growth was led by the Americas, where growth was strong across both Emerson platforms.","David Farr","And I would like to call out my Latin America team, who I've been pretty tough on the last three years relative to their negative growth, but I said to them, \"If you guys delivered 10-plus percent growth this quarter and each quarters after, I'll call you out in the call.\" But again, I want to thank all the Latin America team for making it happen, and I look forward to seeing this continue at, at least 10-plus percent for the rest of this fiscal year. Thank you.","Timothy Reeves","The Automation Solutions in Latin America was up double digits, and Commercial & Residential Solutions up mid-single digits. Europe growth was stable across both platforms, and Q1 marked the third quarter of steady growth of Automation Solutions and the ninth quarter for Commercial & Residential Solutions' steady growth in Europe. Asia, Middle East and Africa was down 2% due to the Asia Climate business, which was down more than 20% on slower heating and air-conditioning markets. ","Turning now to Slide 6. Total segment margin was down 110 basis points and was down 50 basis points, excluding the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Segment margin declined due to unfavorable price\/cost impact at Commercial & Residential Solutions and certain timing items that impacted Automation Solutions. This was in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect the 2019 segment leverage target of 30%, excluding the Aventics and Tools & Test acquisitions. Capital expenditures were up as we made progress on previously announced facility expansions and upgrades in our Climate Technologies, Final Control and Measurement & Analytical instrumentation businesses in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia. Trade working capital improved 10 basis points, driven by receivables and inventory performance.","Turning now to Slide 7. Let's talk about Automation Solutions, where underlying sales were up 9% in the quarter -- sorry, underlying -- Automation Solutions sales were up 9% and up 7% on an underlying basis. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 12%, and December backlog increased modestly versus September on strong December bookings and a successful enterprise system upgrade across the business that resulted in the planned loss of several shipping days, the impact of which was approximately 1 point of growth in the quarter. ","Strong demand for MRO and Brownfield upgrade and expansion projects continued to drive growth. All world areas were positive, and we continue to see favorable trends in our -- in capital formation for investments in LNG midstream infrastructure as well as downstream capacity as sovereign interests trend towards increased energy, chemical and refining self-sufficiency. Segment margin was down 50 basis points and was up 10 basis points, excluding the Aventics acquisition. This improvement was driven by leverage and favorable price\/cost, offset mainly by the carryover impact of growth investments that were ramped up in the second half of 2018. These investments were to expand KOB1 project capacity and our global service organization capabilities. The incremental impact of these investments was approximately $20 million in the first quarter and will lessen as we go through the year and comparisons normalize. In addition, the new revenue recognition rules reduced sales and profits in our software business by approximately $6 million which we will recover in the year. This is the adoption of new software -- of revenue recognition accounting rules. For the full year, we continue to expect incremental margins of 30%, excluding the Aventics acquisition.","Turning now to Slide 8. Commercial & Residential Solutions' underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were down 2%. The decline in Commercial & Residential Solutions was driven by slower heating and air-conditioning markets in China, a trend that began in mid-2018. Importantly, we see a path to return the growth in the second half of 2019 as comparisons ease and spending recovers in China. Growth in the Americas was driven by strong demand in cold chain and residential air-conditioning markets and solid momentum in professional tools markets. Margin decreased 150 basis points, excluding the Tools & Test acquisition, due mainly to unfavorable price\/cost, which was in line with our expectation for the quarter. ","We expect that the price\/cost trend will reverse and provide a tailwind to margins in the second half of 2019. Over the past year, we've successfully implemented price increases behind strong material cost inflation and tariff headwinds. Going forward, we expect pricing actions to catch up and to outpace material inflation as cost pressures ease. For 2019, we continue to expect full year incremental margin of 30%, excluding the Tools & Test acquisition.","Let's turn now to Slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to include the impact of recent acquisitions and provides our second quarter expectations. Underlying sales guidance remains unchanged, and the net sales guidance is updated to reflect the impact of the A.E. Valves acquisition, which closed in December; and the GE Intelligent Platforms acquisition, which closed at the end of January. ","The EPS guidance range has increased $0.05 for the first quarter tailwinds and includes $0.03 dilution from recent acquisitions, which mostly hits us in the second quarter. We expect the full year tax rate to be 24% to 25%. ","In the second quarter, we expect 6.5% underlying sales growth and EPS of $0.84, plus or minus $0.02. The EPS guidance builds in $0.02 of headwinds from recent acquisitions. ","So please turn to Slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Tim, thank you very much. I appreciate everyone joining us today, and I also look forward to talking and meeting all of our key investors in New York City on February 14, 2019. If you have not signed up for the meeting, please do right away because we do have limited space where we're having the meeting in the New York Stock Exchange. I also want to thank all of the global employees, especially our new acquisitions members, who are learning to work and play -- and plan month-to-month like we do within Emerson. These are great additions, and I truly appreciate the support and efforts you're putting forth, be at the Pentair Valves & Controls business; be it Aventics; be it the Textron; Greenlee tool and Klauke; now the A.E. Valves in Belgium; and now our newest member, the GE Intelligent Platforms in VA, Virginia, and Germany and worldwide. I will also be visiting -- for you GE people, I'll be visiting Charlottesville in March 1 to see what's going on and get an update first-hand. ","So if you look at Slide 10, the first thing you've got to know is Rocket got his first Emerson stock certificate last night. It was his fifth anniversary, and so we've issued a share and he got that. He got pretty excited about that, you can see. And unfortunately, he's not very good with the crayon quite yet, but we're still teaching him how to do that. ","You can see from the orders, our order trend line is in line with what we've been talking about starting last year, this 5% to 10% range. Please keep in mind that we will bounce within this range, sometimes at the high end, sometimes the low end. And don't be surprised like last year, we could touch bottom or even slip out for a month or so. It's a way orders go in lumpiness. ","You'll also notice that the preliminary January numbers, which we -- we're just getting in. I thank Frank and his team for pushing this to get this information to us, but they're in line with the overall trend line, around the 7% range. ","Also, both Commercial & Residential has ticked up and moving up towards the positive line, and Automation Solutions numbers stay at the high elevated layer but still doing extremely well and trending very much like we thought when we talked to you in November. You will remember, I talked to you about a slowdown in China. I talked to you about a slowdown in Asia-Pacific. I talked to you about what we saw happening since June of 2018. And it's been baked into our schedule, and we are starting to -- and we'll talk further about the sort of upturn that we're starting to see in Bob Sharp's business, in particular, around the commercial -- climate technology businesses in China and Asia-Pacific. ","We went out in a Chart 11 earlier this month with information to counter misinformation based on the media's drive to drive a recession in North America. As you can see, our global orders in Automation Solutions have been trending quite strongly across broad base, and I'll have more to say about that. But I think you know what we saw in the last 3 months, plus 12% across all areas. ","I would like -- happy and tell you today, too, I heard Golden Pass is going to move forward a big Exxon project with Qatar. I understand it's a big part of Exxon's big expenditure in North America of over $50 billion. And clearly, we'll be participating in that program one way or another. ","But clearly, the orders are very good for us. They're consistent for us. The January order trend line is moving this way. I had made a comment when I was in -- visiting investors in the month of December and early January that I would communicate a little bit differently in the first 2 months around what we're seeing as I and my team are watching very, very closely what's going on in this marketplace. So far, we are seeing the trend lines we thought. We are not seeing any fundamental slowdown. We will discuss this in great detail at the presentations coming up on February 14. I have -- expand the presentations and the presenters so you can get a little bit different insight, not just listen to Dave Farr speak, which you guys have listened to for 20-plus years now, but give you some different insights. But clearly, our world area orders are holding in very nicely.","Let's talk about Slide 12 and a different cycle. The cycle, as we see it right now, is slightly different from the last cycle when the price of oil was running at $70 to $100 per barrel. You can see in the 2010 to 2014 major project awards very, very heavy upstream oil and gas investments, oil investments, in particular; less in LNG; a little bit less in refining; less in chemical. As the price of oil went up, they really overinvested. ","In this cycle when we're seeing the price of oil is going to be balancing between $45 and $70 per barrel, we see a different cycle. Our customer base is talking differently. They are being much more cautious, and you could see what we see at this point in time. As we look at the funnel laid out for the next couple of years, we're seeing a little bit less in the upstream oil. We're seeing more midstream. We're seeing a lot more LNG, i.e. Golden Pass, i.e. the investment that was just announced in -- up in Canada and on Mozambique. There's a lot of investments coming on the road in LNG. We're seeing more in refining, which will be out further in this cycle, not this year per se but probably '20, '21, '22. And we're seeing very good investment in chemical and life sciences. ","We see a much more balanced play here for us, which is good for us from the standpoint of longer-term order trends and also profitability. It is a different cycle than last cycle. We'll talk more about that. But my investors need to understand, we do pay attention to cycles. We do understand cycles. And this one is a lot different and more favorable to us from, I'd say, a consistency standpoint and especially as we drive our KOB 3 aftermarket business and trying to stay above 50%, which we have seen for the last 12 to 18 months.","On Chart 13 is the trend line of Commercial & Residential Solutions orders. You could see that we saw this trend line dropping off in Asia. This is Asia driven a lot by China, and we saw this starting to drop off in the May, June of last year. We talked about it. We communicated it. Maybe people didn't believe it. There is a reason why we had a 4% at the low end of our underlying sales growth rate. We said it would be 4% to 7%. ","We're starting to see this trend line move up. You can see the star on the Commercial & Residential Asia's number seeing -- trending upwards. From there, you could also see the total Commercial & Residential getting very close to 0. China is the same way. ","The issue for us is we look at the last 4, 5 weeks, the week after week after week improvement, we're starting to see the improvement relative to orders coming out of China. Product is starting to sell through. The channel is being cleansed, and we're also starting to see government centers go in around the products that we sell and serve into the China marketplace. The government understands. They pull back, and they understand they probably went too far and they now are going to start investing in certain segments, which are good for us relative -- especially around heating, cooling and environmental areas. ","If you look at our core cold chain, if you look at our other businesses in China, they are still growing quite rapidly. And Bob will talk about that on February 14. But there is no guarantee. But there's one thing about Emerson, as people have to understand, we do track, and this is not something that's surprising to us. We've been seeing this, and we sense it's going to trend line back up. Right now, we've entered right into the Chinese New Year, so we have little less information coming out. But clearly, what I see right now says, \"I feel comfortable with the second half that we mapped out when we laid our forecast in November for our shareholders.\"","If you look at Chart 14, this is the Commercial & Residential Solutions, the price\/cost expectations. As you know, we -- as we go through the cycle, we got squeezed with higher material costs. Our price\/cost structure got out of kilter. It takes us time to get it back in with our large customer base. We are now moving forward. In the first half of this year, we still have not got the price\/cost totally in line. It will be there by the second half of the year, as you can see in this chart, where the favorable price is now starting to help make up for the margin that we lost and absorbed and ate the cost structure over the last 4, 5 quarters. The first half of this year, in particular the first quarter, we got hit, not only the down volume, but also the leverage impact of our higher material costs. Pricing is going in. It helps but not enough. From quarter-to-quarter, you're going to start seeing, as you look at first quarter to second quarter margins, you will start seeing the benefit of this improvement. So incremental margins between first quarter and second quarter between Commercial & Residential will be positive, will be moving 30-plus percent. As you move in the second half, they will make up for what they lost in the first quarter. ","We feel very comfortable about this right now. We've been working very closely with our customers. This is the cycle we go through. We know how to manage this cycle, and I feel very good about this.","The same thing we said about Automation Solutions. When you look at the first quarter, our volume was slightly less than we thought because of what Tim laid out relative to the new system that we put worldwide, relative to the new revenue rec rules, relative to a couple other things. ","However, when we come out of a fiscal year like 2018 where we have our highest sales in third and fourth quarter, our costs are going in. So we're -- and putting the costs in because of investments you see going forward in 2019. Then you go into your lowest quarter, we have those investments that we made in the second half of 2018 that we have to absorb in a lower volume. Therefore, our margin gets hurt in the first quarter. ","It is normal. It is expected. And then as we move to the second quarter and the third quarter and the fourth quarter, Lal and his team will start delivering higher than 30% incremental margins to make up for the higher cost structure that was built in.","Key point: if volumes or businesses start weakening, we obviously clearly have to take action because our volume is based on what we're laying out here, based on the orders, based on everything we're seeing at this point in time to either Bob's business or Lal's business. If the volumes don't recover, then we will start taking actions in the cost line. We do not see that. The market is unfolding exactly as we thought it would in the first couple of months in the quarter, and we feel very good about that. ","If you look at Slide 15, again I want to welcome the newest members of Emerson, the GE Intelligent Platforms acquisition. It clearly is going to add about $125 million sales this year. With the accounting impacts and investments we're making, we're going to be hurt about $0.03 EPS. With the price\/cost resetting of our performance shares long-term compensation plan with a dramatic drop-off in the first quarter of stock price, we've clearly had a benefit in the first quarter, and it's helped us for the whole year which helped us offset this dilution. So we raised our EPS guidance for the year.","And by the way, folks, this is nothing new. Last year in the first quarter, we had a hit of $40 million on PE shares. We have a variable long-term performance-based plan in stock, and it's based in variable targets. If the growth rates go up, our targets go up. If the growth rates go down, our targets go down. So every quarter, we're marking the market. We're a little bit different. I firmly believe you have to have some adjustment to what the markets are doing, both up or down. And therefore, we mark-to-market every quarter. This is an extraordinary quarter. The stock price dropped from $79 to low $50s. And we got hit pretty hard from that point, but the benefit side is we picked up, obviously, the P&L, which is a true P&L, which we allowed flow-through, net of the EPS impact of the acquisitions.","Mike and his team are -- Mike Train and also a lot of those guys are working very hard with the new acquisition here. We'll be talking to you. Mike Train will be giving a specific presentation in New York in February 14 of what our initial expectations are with GE joining our Systems & Solutions business. This is a unique technology and a capability that we're really welcoming in, and we're looking forward to building out and installing over the next 3, 4, 5 years. This is not going to be a 1-year move. It's going to be a multiple-year move. So I'm very excited about it. ","So again, I want to step back and say the quarter is on line what we expected. It came in a little bit different than we -- when you look at the pieces. You look at the whole year, we still feel very comfortable with our year, both in the sales growth, our profitability standpoint. Clearly, we -- the order pace is there. From the Commercial & Residential space, it's starting to turn up. North America was strong. It's primarily China, Asia and the Middle East that was weak. And Automation Solutions is very strong around the world, which is a good thing to see at this point in time. ","So with that, I'll open the mic to take some questions, some Q&A, from our participants. Thank you very much, everybody.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The leadoff is Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","I don't recall a time ever where you've broken in to Tim's script to interrupt in a shout-out.","David Farr","Well, you have to understand that I was pretty upset with my Latin America team. They know that. I call them dead cats. And for 3 straight years, down orders and sales. And so I said, \"If you have to bounce this quarter, I'll let you have it,\" and I gave it to them. So it is unique, Deane. You're right.","Deane Dray","That's about as big a shout-out as I've seen you do, so those guys, hopefully, appreciate that. Just on the first question, hopefully, you can expand on the comments on the oil cycle and why it's different. And you said specifically you'd see less upstream activity, and here we are in a quarter where you are seeing some strong upstream. Do you think that fades? And maybe just clarify the point about seeing less.","David Farr","You know what? I think it's going to be more balanced. I think what happened last cycle, Deane, is the oil and gas -- oil companies, integrated oil companies felt very compelled to really go out and get more reserves when the stock -- the oil price was sitting at $90 to $100, and there was this huge surge of spending that was overwhelming the industry and obviously overwhelmed us. As you know, our orders and sales in oil and gas got up to well over 40% in that cycle. So I think they're being more careful about this. And also, they're investing much more in gas. There's a shift going on relative to the market -- energy use in the marketplace from pure oil to more gas, and I think that what's happening is there's more of a balanced approach here. And to be honest, I think the investors were very intense on our oil company CEOs about, \"Hey, guys, be more careful.\" And I think that we still see this good level of investments, but my look at it right now it's going to be spread out over multiple, multiple years. And I see the initial wave, and we're going to talk a little bit about this in New York. There's a lot more investments coming on the LNG side at this point in time. So it's still going to be a good number if you look at the total, but it's going to be spread out. And the oil companies are going to take smaller bites. I mean, I'll give you an example. In our first quarter, our largest KOB1 order was $9 million. That's it, first quarter. They're still -- we're still looking at smaller bites of apples, lot of KOB 3, KOB 2. The KOB1 are starting to be built out and build-booked, but they're being more cautious, which I like. I really do like that.","Deane Dray","Great. And just as a follow-up, we've got the State of the Union tonight. Maybe just refresh us on the current, as you see it, impact from tariffs, anything on the shutdown. And hopefully, we can contain it to that.","David Farr","Relative to the shutdown, there's been -- there's very little impact to us relative -- maybe some of our customers but not -- there's not really anything significant relative to shutdowns. I don't like shutdowns, but it really wasn't any impact at all from our perspective. On the tariffs side, it's pretty -- it's very well contained. The President has made it very clear the way he lays them out. And so as he telegraphed back in '17 and '18, we got ourselves positioned relative to cost, relative to backups, we have continued to worked that issue. I firmly believe we will not see another significant increase in tariffs. We might see a little bit here and there, but we're getting ready for it in case something does happen. But the cause -- the impact of tariffs right now is well contained in our pricing actions, both on the Automation side and the Commercial & Residential side. And so I feel that we have that pretty well set for this 2019 at this point in time. And hopefully, nothing new will come up out of the woodwork, as you said, Deane.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. So just to expand on the project pipeline, obviously the market swooned pretty dramatically, like you mentioned, in the December quarter. It looked like people were very worried about the macros, but I did want to just get a sense for has anything slipped in your project pipeline of note? Is there any trend to discern on, things that might actually be at risk that you are seeing delays on? Or is it steady as she goes?","David Farr","Right now, the project is steady as you go. What we need to watch, and that's why I'm communicating a little bit deeper and broader. I'm not going to give as much detail next time we communicate relative to the list that we did this time, as you know, Gautam. But I'm watching a lot on KOB 3 right now. That will be the sign from us. It's not going to be KOB 2 or KOB1. It's going to be KOB 3 initially. The projects will move forward. We'll do the work. We'll make awards. We'll do the -- all the FEED work, anything like that, and then that will come down the pike. We should start seeing some significant project bookings this quarter, in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter well into 2021. We're going to lay out a couple of charts for you because this very question in the meeting on the 14th which we see based by world area, where the projects, the major projects are going to flow because it's very difficult. ","And going back to what Deane said earlier, this is a different cycle, and we want to lay out by industry what we see at this point in time when these projects will be flown. It's going to be much later in 2019 and early 2021. You'll see this by both the systems and controls. And so haven't seen anything push yet, but I'm watching KOB 3. If the CEOs are going to make the decisions, my customer base are going to make the decisions relative to spending. Let's say we're going to spend $10 billion for the whole year. Normally, they would spend maybe $2 billion in the first quarter and then sequentially spend a little bit more. Are they going to tap that $2 billion down a little bit to see -- make sure things are okay? So that's what we're watching right now because our KOB 3, as you know, has been running quite strongly. It's what this -- our pace is right now, and I want to make sure that that's where the first sign is. And we haven't seen it yet and we're going to keep watching it, and we'll keep communicating and we're going to put orders out and talking to investors, so we'll get a feel for it. But that's where you're going to see it first, okay?","Gautam Khanna","That sounds good. And just a quick follow-up on capital allocation. You've already done $1 billion of buyback. What should we earmark for the year?","David Farr","$1 billion. When we laid out our financial plan last year, we laid out x -- for a 3-year plan, $1 billion, $1 billion, $1 billion. We laid out x dollars for acquisitions. And until we see the x dollars for acquisitions, which we'll talk about when we're in New York, we're not going to make any changes. Frank and I talked to the Finance Committee and the board today about this very issue that we're seeing padded $1 billion, assuming there's no dramatic drop-off in the marketplace. Now if there's a dramatic drop-off, I will reopen that subject very quickly with my Finance Committee. But right now, assuming no dramatic drop-off, we're going to hold to $1 billion. We're going to reevaluate our acquisitions that we do here in 2019. And if we see something changing, i.e., up or down, then we'll adjust our capital allocation based on that. But I try not to adjust my capital allocation too rapidly, maybe typically I would look in every 12 or 18 months. So that's where we sit at this point in time, Gautam.","Operator","Next is Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","It's been almost two years, Dave, since you did the Pentair valve deal, I think you did, around April of 2017, if memory serves me right. But...","David Farr","You're right on the mark, exactly right.","Scott Davis","Okay. And I think business conditions were still pretty tough for a couple of quarters after you closed that. But do you think -- are you back kind of on-the-deal model or ahead-of-the-deal model or behind? I mean, where -- what's kind of the state of the union on that...","David Farr","I think we -- I'm going to ask Ram to update you guys. Ram is going to be present -- he's going to present and part of his presentation will -- just briefly beyond that because it's an important thing we made. It's a big acquisition for us. From my perspective, we are ahead of the plan relative to sales, profit and cash. Ram and his team have done a phenomenal job. The market, clearly, has turned our way. We are in a period right now which Ram will talk about is that we're making significant capital investments in that company relative to globalizing its manufacturing base, so manufacturing in the U.S., manufacturing -- better manufacturing in China, better manufacturing in India, better manufacturing in Eastern Europe, better manufacturing in Middle East. And the issue is we're trying -- as you know, we have a much more global manufacturing strategy than V&C did, and they are more worried about tax planning. So we're ahead of that. And if the orders keep holding up, which they are right now, I think I feel very good about this acquisition and the impact we're seeing relative to our Final Control business.","Scott Davis","Okay. That's good news. And then just a follow-up. I don't know -- I'm looking at Chart 13 where you've got the Commercial & Resi Asia orders. I don't remember seeing...","David Farr","You were looking at Chart 10 with Rocket, what's wrong with you? You have no sense of humor, Scott. That's your problem.","Scott Davis","No. That's one of my many problems, Dave. Yes. If you go back -- I mean, you know this business a lot better than we do. I mean, if you go back long history, these huge order swings, late -- or early 2018, way up, now way down, I mean, are they almost -- and is it more of just massive inventory swings in the channel that the customers just aren't that -- aren't as evolved as the Western guys and make a lot of motional inventory decisions? Or is there really that much of a sell-through delta when you look at...","David Farr","No. I mean, what happens is -- you're exactly right. We have these swings. We've always had these swings in this side of the business, but Automation Solutions cycle in China is typically more up for a long time and drifts back down. This business, as you well know, went basically seven quarters of 20-plus percent growth. Now what happens is the government has -- incentivizes changes relative to efficiencies, changes relative to environmental issues, and the government makes major investments in incentives into the country for the consumer and industrial workforce -- or the industrial customers. And then all of a sudden, the government makes the decision out of the blue to stop. And so what happens is the channels stopped because they see it coming, see it coming. And then also then what happens is we -- that backlogs and it gets purged. The difference between the U.S. and China is our U.S. government does not put the incentives out there that cause this. Yes, our channels buy more disciplined. But right now, the channel is being worked off.","Plans have been pushed back, and what we're doing is we're optimizing our facilities right now for the next wave. In the next wave, we'll start coming as we move out of this fiscal year going into the second half of the year. So it's a pretty normal situation. I can't always tell which quarter it's going to happen, but we know it always does. And -- but this was pretty clear. We could see -- starting to see in May, in June. We're starting to hear the government is backing off. The discussions between our 2 governments have obviously created a little bit more of a tension there, too. So I think that's where we are at this point in time. But the channel is a starting to shrink its inventory, and the orders are starting to come as they start building out. So I think the cycle started. I can't guarantee anybody that. But as you said, we've been in the business a long time. We're marking our 40th year in China and -- this year. So I feel good that the cycle is just starting to pick back up. I don't see it going to 25-plus percent, though. I think until the government really motivates it, I don't see it going that high again.","Operator","The next question will be from John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","Yes. So I guess a question here around free cash flow and just the timing of when you get back the accounts payables and the accruals and just to kind of set expectations on the conversion ratios going forward here.","David Farr","From our perspective, I think it's going to be more in the second half. We'll start getting a little bit better improvement in the second quarter. Typically, we have a slow start. We have to work our way through it. Frank and I, we've analyzed the heck out of this thing. We have -- Frank and I have our neck out with the board and with our investors that are $3.2 billion, and the fact that we want to get to $2.5 billion free cash flow this year is a very important number for us. We will talk about it. ","So I feel very good that we'll get back, but I think it's going to be more in this -- the third quarter, fourth quarter, we start seeing it. It's going to be one of these years that I think we're going to be more rear-end loaded than we were -- historically were. Sometimes, we're more front-end loaded. But that's where we are. But one thing different this year, because capital took a while -- just like spending last year took a while to get ramped up in the third -- into the third and fourth quarter, capital is the same way. So capital just got ramped up in the second half, and we had a -- we have a strong investment profile in the first half. So our capital is going to be more front-end loaded this year than it was last year. So I think it's going to be more third quarter, to be honest, before we start seeing the catch-up. That's where I am right now.","John Walsh","Okay, great. And then, I guess, just maybe another question around capital allocation. Can you give us some flavor around how the deal funnel looks just in terms of size of the acquisitions that you'd be looking at?","David Farr","In 2019, we have -- we're looking at around $500 million of acquisitions. And right now, our funnel would say that's about what we're going to be doing. We don't see -- we are working, courting and developing acquisitions for the $1 billion level and $2 billion level, $3 billion level in 2020, '21 and combined together. Those are definitely not maturing as fast as we wanted. But then again, we just went through a lot of acquisitions the last 2.5 years, and we're trying to digest that. So right now, it looks like $500 million this year, maybe $400 million; next year, maybe $1 billion, $1.2 billion; and the year after that, around the $2 billion range, based on what we're seeing activity that we're engaging. And I just think that the funnel has slowed down at this point in time, and not unusual, and I expect that to start increasing as we get back into the late 2019, early 2020. Going back to my previous comments that Frank and I talked to the finance community this morning is, as we look out and we're sitting in 2020 and we see the funnel still not forming enough for this $1 billion or $2 billion that we're talking about, then we're going to have to revisit that capital allocation. But we'll do that at the appropriate time.","Operator","The next question comes from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","On the 2Q outlook, when we look at the acceleration, the 6.5% versus what you saw in the first quarter, I guess, just the level of confidence around that and the expectation for each segment.","David Farr","I feel pretty good about the 6% to 6.5%. This is a -- the big issue is going to boil down to, historically, we look at from sequentially somewhere around $250 million to $300 million sequential. We're looking from first quarter to second quarter. We are looking at a $500 million sequential primarily because of the improvement we're seeing in commercial residential and, primarily, Climate Technology. So therefore, that's going to be something that we're staying very close to and we must stay communicating to our shareholders on because the cycle is a little bit different from Bob Sharp's business. And that -- I feel comfortable right now based on what I'm seeing. And the key issue for me is this Bob's sequential orders coming from China and Asia-Pacific continue to hold up as they are starting to build. And if they do, then I feel good that we'll make that in the second quarter. From the backlog and the order pace that we see right now in Automation Solutions, I feel very, very comfortable with that one. The wildcard for me is when you want to -- you can ask Bob in New York, when he's there, the one you're going to keep asking us, as you talk to Tim. Is -- are we seeing the China, Asia-Pacific orders come that firm up for us that gives us a little bit higher delta from the first to second quarter? That's the key issue for us right now.","Nicole DeBlase","And as a follow-up, so you talked about how the cycle is different within AS. I guess, what does that mean for margin mix? So does -- like if we look over the next several years, does it mean that the typical margin headwind that you guys see from large projects coming into the mix isn't as bad as you've seen in cycles before?","David Farr","I think it -- what it means is the large cycle -- the projects will start hairing our margins, but they'll take a while to hit it. They might take a little longer, or they might be spread out. It's -- based on what I'm seeing right now, it means that, as you get into the 2020, 2021 time period, if the projects fall out, while I think the impact to the negative margin will be less and less, won't be as dramatic as we saw historically. The key issue for us right now is the mix and where things happen, which industries. As the KOB 3 stays up, which is our drive, we want to get that to stay above 50%. That helps us. We're making investments to do that. So what it tells me is that our margin progression, excluding the acquisitions, should be a little bit easier this time than it was back in the last cycle. That's what I see right now.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Tusa","Just a question on the price\/cost stuff. I know last quarter you talked about $125 million or something like that of, I think you mentioned of like, of headwinds from tariffs and stuff. But this chart suggests that it's not quite as bad as that. Maybe I'm comparing apples and oranges. And then, am I right, as far as the price is concerned and how that phases in given you guys are like a little bit more into the component kind of supply chain that you have to generally kind of wait for the right time to go to the OEMs with your kind of annual price increases as opposed to the OEMs that can kind of dictate whenever they want to their distribution channel?","David Farr","There are a couple of things here. One, we've already worked with the OEMs so the price is built in for the year along this line here. This is -- the $125 million number for the total company is still a good number, Steve. That has not changed. This is one piece of it which is, what, Section 301. And so I think what we've laid out across the board is pretty consistent, and we have the $125 million match. I think that if you -- all said and done, as we get in the -- as the year unfolds, our price\/cost numbers will be slightly, I mean, neutral to slightly green, not much different. But everything is pretty well laid out. It's been discussed. The channel, which we obviously had with AS, the Automation and Solutions business, we've got that laid out. And in commercial residential, they did the heavy lifting late last year with their OEMs and got that built in. And as you -- you're right, we have to plan out with our OEMs over multiple quarters, but we've been doing this for a long time. The same thing will happen if the price -- the cost goes the other way, we'll have to plan that back out too. So I think we're in pretty good shape. I feel good about that right now, Steve.","Charles Tusa","Okay, that makes sense. And then just to -- when you say -- so this basically all means when you look at kind of the comps on like acquisition-related charges, I mean, your fourth quarter comp on margins when you think about price\/cost and the deals that you've kind of done here, I mean, that should really kind of unmask a really positive trend line into kind of 2020, correct?","David Farr","That's in the game plan. That's exactly right. Our fourth quarter, based on what we're laying out right now, assuming we -- our order patterns happen the way we want them to happen, we should go into 2020 in a good pace, exactly right.","Operator","The next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","On the project funnel you defined a couple of quarters ago, yes, I think we stood at $6.8 billion the last time you showed us the number. And maybe this will wait until the analyst meeting, but a lot of what you're talking about with KOB 3 sounds like it wouldn't really fill the funnel in with a large number of dots, maybe more dollars. But any way you could size where that stands today? Or has there been any of pause in that funnel?","David Farr","Yes, I can, and we are going to give you a lot of details. We're -- I've been trying to figure out ways to communicate this, the phasing of the funnels. And not -- as you well know, none of our customers -- or competitors do this. But I think it's important for you to understand this, how we look at it. So the number's over $7 billion right now. Tim, what is the number?","Timothy Reeves","$7.6 billion.","David Farr","$7.6 billion. And we're -- what we're going to show you is how this unfolds the next 2, 3 years and how it goes by first half, second half. We're trying to phase that by industry and by world area. It's something -- I'm trying to help you all and help myself so I can communicate to you on a consistent basis. As you well know, it's an assumption based on what we're seeing, but we've been in this business a long time. So I think we'll come up with better ways, and we're going to try to lay that out for you in next -- in February 14. So be prepared for a lot of bubbles, and be prepared for a lot of charts and numbers like that by industry. And you may want to bring someone to write down faster with you because I guarantee I won't be giving this chart out. And right now, I think there's only one page that's going to be with any information on it. It's going to be a page with Rocket's picture, and the rest is going to be blank. I mean, so -- and I think that's what -- this is a Dave Farr approach, you know that.","Joshua Pokrzywinski","Of course. And then just shifting over to some of the M&A you've done lately, obviously, trying to build out a discreet platform. You made that pretty clear last year with the progress looked like. But I just want to be clear, as we lap these acquisitions, that I would imagine, we engaging with some of these customers that maybe you guys did business with when you still owned the drives, the drives brand businesses, it requires a bit of an investment to kind of rebuild in that channel, reinvest in the product. Should we expect that to still be in investment mode as we head into next year as -- and even as we kind of lap some of the accounting components of the M&A?","David Farr","Yes, we're going to have Mike put out some preliminary discussion along this line here. We see the GE acquisition -- GE makes some good technology investment in this acquisition. It's -- from a technology standpoint, it's pretty good. We've got to make some critical investments relative to not only a standalone PLC type of control or Intelligent Control. We also are going to have to figure out how to embed that with -- relative to our Ovation's platform in the power and water and our DeltaV where -- and within the process side. And then what we need to do is be able to work on the channel work. So we're going to be in a good investment mode here for the next couple of years. It's going to a huge number, overwhelm it, but this acquisition more is from a standpoint of a technology product and channel, and we're going to have to create a hybrid approach to this channel not to absorb it all within our process channel or with our power channel. We've got to -- as you said, we've got to keep that discrete channel out there and rebuild that channel. So Mike is going to be talking about what we're seeing from an investment mode in their initial changes, but this is something that will unfold with you all over the next couple years because of this is all about investment and rebuilding a presence for us to grow out of going forth for the next 3, 4, 5 years, well beyond the Dave Farr era.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.","Nigel Coe","You mentioned LNG a number of times, and you've talked about LNG being a bigger mix going forward than it's been in the past. Would you agree that LNG is probably your biggest growth opportunity in automation? And would you also agree that you haven't seen much of that growth yet so, therefore, it's all on the come?","David Farr","Yes, I think it is, incrementally, for the next couple of years, it is our biggest growth opportunity, and we're going to talk about that on the 14th. And yes, the projects are just starting to unfold. There's 3 been announced already, the one in Canada, one in Mozambique. We've got the project down South here in Golden Pass, which was -- it's basically -- we've said -- formally said, it's going to be funded by Qatar and ExxonMobil today. We know of at least 3 more coming down the pike. Saudi Aramco want to make huge investments in gas. And so we see a good wave relative to gas. And what we like about gas, you'll see the makeup in gas, it's a very broad portfolio of our products. So when a project goes in, it's a huge project. We could get several hundred million dollars of systems, interpretation, control software in an ongoing basis for a long, long time. And so it is something that's really good for us relative to the long haul. It's something we've built out over the years from an acquisition standpoint. So I like what we see, and I think we're going to have a good run at it here.","Nigel Coe","And then addressing Nicole's question in different way, if we're going to have less upstream, less E&P-type projects going forward, more LNG, more refining, more chem, what does that do to the nature of the project in terms of dollar size, in terms of Emerson content? Any appreciable margin in things we should think about there?","David Farr","We're still doing some work on the margin. It would -- my opinion, the project size, we're going to be smaller, overall, when you look them all different, Nigel, and that's something we're going to -- we're trying to size. We're still working that issue. Tim and I have been pushing our people to try to come up with that because that's a very relevant question on the cycle. So the project -- so therefore, I like the project size being small because it doesn't -- it means it's less volatile from the big chunks that you get in the business and the orders that we saw last cycle. If it's going to be heavy LNG, it's going to be heavier chemical, a little bit of refining, that's a better long-term margin profile for me. And I'm just -- we're just working our way through that right now. But it should be a better margin profile based on the big, big heavy oil type of projects. But that's something we're working on. And I want to have something to show you guys and gals in February 14 in that very, very question because it's a very relevant question.","Operator","The next question is from John Inch of Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Yes, so AMS, are you still signed up for the 19% margins with the deals you've done, I think, though, as you've been talking about, it's 2021. Does that still feel about right?","David Farr","We're going to push hard to get to it. Right now, if I get -- be very truthful to you, we're probably a tad less than 19% by 2021 with some of the deals. You know that GE doesn't help me because the GE margin is not plus. So -- but our target is still to get to 20% -- get that 19%, and that's what we're trying to drive this whole mix basis that we're just talking on from the last question coming out of Nigel. But that's still our goal. I still feel good that we get real close to it. And so that's where we are at this time.","John Inch","And then to get to the C&RS guide, it looks like margins in the back half maybe have to exceed the back-half 2018 margins. Is that -- does that seem reasonable based on the flip you're going to see with respect to price\/cost?","David Farr","Yes, these guys are quickly looking at it. Frank says yes. Tim says yes.","Timothy Reeves","Yes, we're going to have to ramp in the second half, yes...","David Farr","And the answer is yes...","John Inch","All right, so that's reasonable. And then maybe this maybe a question for Frank...","David Farr","And they got to do it. For the old people out there, you guys got to deliver that margin in the second half, in the Emerson team. That's -- I just want to remind the guys who listen to this call: deliver.","John Inch","They heard it. One more question for Frank. Trying to put the $63 million of corporate swing into a context. Is this an accrual adjustment for the entire year that flows through the first quarter -- or fiscal quarter? And then what actually happens, for instance, if the stock were to shift or swing up or down, I don't know, $10 to $15? Like if it went up, for instance, do you have to all of a sudden record a big double sort of expense in the corporate line? Or how does that work?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, because we have a plan where the target is very -- well, we have to mark-to-market every quarter. As Dave said, we've had big marks in the past, but this one is unusually big because of the stock price move in the first quarter. So essentially, all of that was due to the incentive comp about $60 million -- $60-odd million of it was due to incentive comp. And we've already given some of it back here. And we will give some of it back in the second quarter if we stay near these levels. And as the price goes up, we will then again have to run some of that through the P&L. So it really depends on what you assume about the stock price, but in any reasonable assumption, we'll give some of it back, but there will be probably a significant part of this that flows through the year -- that will flow through the year.","David Farr","Yes, John, what we do is we look at a model based on the trend lines, and we typically have the stock going up in each quarter. And so what happens, what we build into the quarter, we thought the stock would -- I mean, we didn't think the stock was going to stay at $79, but we didn't think it was going to go to $50 -- $56. So we probably had somewhere around $75 built in there. And so as the stock dropped off, we got the big pickup. Right now, we -- if you look at the plan, we have that stock going up for the rest of this year. But right now, we've already given part it gained back. But we feel comfortable -- what we picked -- some of that, we picked up and we floated through for the year. So that's how it works. We're unique in this regard that we've always had a variable plan, and we like keeping it that way. I want to have our people -- if growth rates go up, I want our growth -- relative growth rates to go up with that and have tougher targets.","John Inch","So would you expect the corporate expense to be kind of the 1 -- to go back to this $140 million, $150 million zone for the coming 3 quarters?","David Farr","That's a good question. Is that where...","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, I would.","David Farr","Yes, John.","Frank Dellaquila","I would. That's probably a good estimate in terms of where we think we're going to be in total for corporate.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","In any event, I wanted to ask, I guess, maybe since you're not shy and you're on the sidelines...","David Farr","Who? Me?","Robert McCarthy","Yes, I don't think you're shy. What do you think what's going on with the carrier and the spend here? And do you think it changes the environment overall with respect to the OEMs, and do you expect consolidation in this space from your vantage point? What do you expect to happen over the next couple of years?","David Farr","My vantage point right now says the consolidation does not happen, and we'll have an independent carrier out there and that we'll be managing the similar type of customer base for the next several years. Does something happened 4, 5, 6 years out? It's possible. But my feel right now is UTC is headed towards the spend very hard. They worked this -- Mark and his team have worked this very, very hard. And I know -- by the way, I know how hard it is. I took out 40% of Emerson that way. It's a lot of work. And so that's what I feel right now, Rob. I don't see a consolidation in this move.","Robert McCarthy","And yes, just to follow-up, in terms of China overall, away from commercial and resi, which is pretty clear that there's this channel adjustment that's going on, how would you say what you're seeing there? And I think in my conversations with you prior, you kind of contrasted some of your more industrial-facing or Automation-Solutions-facing business versus the more bleeding edge of consumer and residential where you would expect it a little more stable. I mean, what's your outlook there, excluding this kind of channel correction we've seen? And can you kind of talk to the growth you're seeing in China excluding that?","David Farr","You take out this channel, we're growing solid 15%, 20% with this piece. I mean, Bob will show you the breakdown. I know we put the chart up at the board today because our board asked the same questions. We dissect the, what I call -- we call, the heating and cooling business within China, which is down 30%, 40%. The other two segments were up. I think, Frank, didn't you show a 20%, 30%?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, they were up big.","David Farr","And for the quarter. So we have clearly built out a strong, more balanced business in China than, say, 5 or 6 years ago. But we're still not there yet because this 8 -- heating and ventilating and cooling business was up 30%, 40%, and it's a big business, now dropped off. But over time, what we're trying to do is we're trying to build up a more balanced portfolio of businesses in China and across Asia that gives us that -- a little bit more smoothing than we would see right now. It's smoother today than 10 years ago, but it's not smooth enough to stop from hurting us from a quarter standpoint. So -- but we're getting make progress. And Bob is going to talk about that because this is our investment direction that we're making to try to have the other parts of business be a bigger and bigger chunk of the Asia business and give us a little more smoothing impact.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So in Europe, Europe was up 3% in both of your businesses in Q1, which seems like actually a good result after 2% growth last year, especially given some slowing in the major European economies. You mentioned last quarter that you see some unique opportunities in Europe in FY '19. So do these opportunities end up leading you to outperform in Europe? And do you still think Emerson grows in Europe in the 2% to 3% range for '19?","David Farr","Our fundamental goal is to be closer to 5%. And there's a couple things going in Europe, from a technology shift relative to commercial and residential and then also some incremental investment. And so like, I'd say the new generational power area is different than the past as we've participated in. So our goal this year actually is to see the number closer to 4% to 5% for Europe. And that's what we're trying to get to from the standpoint of overall sales. And I think the order pattern's there at this point in time, and we feel good about it. Now clearly, we got to see this -- we got to see a little bit better number than 3% in the second quarter. It should be more like 4%. But right now, my team is holding pretty tight to that 4%, 5% for Europe for us. Even a weaker GFI number in Europe, we just happen to be in a couple of segments which are investing, and some of our customers in Europe which are exporting products to, say, Middle East and Africa, see some upside from that perspective. So right now, my Europe business looks decent.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay, yes. That would be quite good. And then you do seem confident that Asia orders have bottomed in Commercial & Residential Solutions. What do you need to see in orders here over the next few months to support that 3% to 5% sales growth that you have for the year, what kind of uptakes you would look at? Because, obviously, the deceleration has stopped, but the orders are still negative.","David Farr","Yes, we've got to see on a map -- we've got to see this thing go positive in the second quarter from an order standpoint. I think we're forecasting underlying growth for commercial, res still close to flat, Frank, in the second?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes.","David Farr","So what we need to see is our order pattern turn up in the second fiscal quarter, which is the first calendar quarter, and moving above that line, which is pretty close to it. And so from my perspective -- and so right now, these guys are telling me, these guys, yes, we're going to be low -- plus low single digit. I was wrong. I thought -- low single digit driven by U.S. and driven by Europe. But I think it -- what I'm watching for is Asia. And does Asia get back up to that 0 line and above line? And if it does, then I'd feel very good that our commercial and residential for the year can do this 3%, 4%, 5% type of growth, and that's what I'm seeing right now, short term. I'm watching -- on the Automation Solutions side, I'm watching KOB 3 in a couple of industries. On the commercial and residential side right now, I'm watching China and Southeast Asia relative to their HVAC capital orders. So that's what I'm watching.","Operator","And that question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas","So two for me on investment. If AS order growth continues at this pace, double digits, any incremental investment here later in the year that you have to make relative to what you have budgeted? Or is that more of a '20 phenomenon in terms of incremental investment?","David Farr","If Automation Solutions orders stay above 10%, then we're going to be -- they're going to be pushing us pretty hard as we leave the year on 2 things: a global execution sales and engineering group -- service or organization group that we're going to have to start putting in very rapidly in the fourth quarter going to the first quarter, which will raise the cost from the fourth and raise the cost on the first and slow down the smaller quarter. That will be the pressure point there. And secondly, what will happen is Lal will be coming to Frank and I and say, guys, we've got to pull back in some capital and for capacity in a couple of places. And I know Lal and his team look at that. And Frank and Steve Pelch, Frank from the CFO and Steve for the COO, have this constant dialogue going relative to that. But Rich, to your point, if we see orders staying 10%, 12% for another couple of quarters, then we're going to have to do some incremental investment at AS to be able to serve that. And right now, we're not banking on that based on our forecast, but that would be good news to deal with. But that -- clearly, that will create some tension for Frank and I relative to our free cash flow and allocation standpoint. So that's what we see.","Richard Kwas","And then just a bigger-picture question on U.S. resi. I mean, I know you don't have a lot of direct exposure to new construction, new U.S. resi construction. But obviously, the HVAC business is somewhat tied to that. What do see right now? There's some consternation out there with regards to where we are in the cycle. From your vantage point, it doesn't seem like you're concerned about U.S. resi, but are you watching for as you go through the next few quarters?","David Farr","From our perspective right now, the upgrade marketplace has still been very strong. If we start seeing that the upgrade, the repair market, the incremental expansion of homes, if that slows down, then -- which hasn't yet, not the new homes but the upgrades, then that would bother us down the road. The channel is in very good shape right now. Our customer base is in very good shape right now. So I feel decent relative to the cycle. And as we get into -- every month -- our customers are very short-term oriented relative to the U.S. We're talking U.S. here. And so we see their order pattern month -- or week after week after week, and it continues to fill in. And Bob keeps Frank and Steve informed on this because that's important relative to us. But I'm not worried. As long as the -- if the consumers' incomes are still going up, employment still high, they're going to spend money on the current homes, which is what we see right now in the United States, which is a good thing. Are you going to be there on the 14th, which, I guess, is next week? I stand corrected. I was...","Richard Kwas","I will be there.","Operator","The next question then will come from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","There was a little beating around the bush or maybe not even beating around the bush to kind of trying to get to this project mix over time and how it kind of plays on your margins. One of the things you said that I thought was interesting is that you're working to keep the KOB 3 above 50% throughout the horizon. And I'm just wondering, in the past when you've got into big spikes of project activity, how far down in the mix does KOB 3 really play? And should we expect a significant margin differential because of that?","David Farr","Okay. Historically, it would drop down a 45%, 46%. And we -- with the investments we're making both in the distribution organization and the sales service organization around the world, which are significant, we started it last year. Ram is doing even more this year and the next year. We have a unique situation right now where several of our competitors both on Final Control and some of our systems competitors are pulling back in certain marketplaces, and we have a unique opportunity to gain some aftermarket share. So what we've -- we're incentivizing the organization from the standpoint of making these investments and going after that installed base is to try to keep that KOB at 50%, keep a five in front of it. Will it be 50%, 51%? I'll take a 50%. And what that will do is that will smooth our margins somewhat as the bigger projects come into play. It also means we're gaining market share aftermarket. And one of the areas that we -- several acquisitions we made really did not have the aftermarket infrastructure or the aftermarket focus that we have, and so they did not -- they lost some of that business, and they didn't maintain that business. So what we're working at, Jeff, and we really we've been hard at this with Ram and his team and also Jim Nyquist, is really focusing how do we regain more and more of that aftermarket. Some of our competitors are a little bit weaker right now, and we're trying to take that -- we're trying to take it to them right now when the window's open. I think the window is going to open for another 18 months, and I've told Ram we've got to get it done. And so talk to him about this when you see him in New York. And he's going to talk about it in his presentation because this is -- this strategically long term is good for us from a profitability standpoint and smoothing out the cycle curves a little bit too.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, that's really interesting. That's an interesting nuance. And then just one little follow-up on this investment spending question that a couple people asked. I get it if the sales are running a lot hotter, you're going to have to spend more to kind of accommodate those sales. But just looking at this year and kind of the headwind you had to kind of get through in Q1, are you at kind of run rate investments now? Is it kind of in the base, so to speak, and not a significant headwind?","David Farr","Yes, we're -- as we would in the second quarter, we're running -- we're in the run rate. I think the question was, was our run rate sort of structured from an 8% to 10% type of order base here. And I think the question is that if that order pace stays at 10%, 12%, 13% the rest of the year, the consumer will be -- as we move into 2020, will have the infrastructure to deal with that? And the answer is we will have to make some incremental investments. But right now from where we see at this run rate, we're in good shape for this year. They've got to execute in the second quarter. Lal knows that. The second quarter is very important from a profitability standpoint, and that will set up a much stronger second half for us.","And I want to thank everybody for joining us. And I appreciate everyone letting me have a little fun with the baseball. I don't know why it went to baseball other than Stan Musial bat right here and the Rally Monkey staring Tim down. He's got -- he's always staring Tim down. But I appreciate everyone joining us today, asking the questions and the engagement, which is -- I find enjoyable. And I look forward to seeing everybody next week in New York, and we're going to have a little bit expanded presentation from several players to give you a little bit more insight relative to our businesses, both businesses which are very strategic to us.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 1, 2017.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves (1:11), Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Unverified Participant","Thank you, Chad. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, Executive President, Emerson Automation Solutions; and Bob Sharp, Executive President, Emerson Commercial and Residential Solutions.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's fiscal 2017 third quarter results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days.","I will start with the third quarter summary, as shown on slide 2 of the slide presentation. In the third quarter, both segments grew sales to deliver 4% underlying sales growth for the company. Reported sales grew 10% to $4 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition, which closed on April 28 during the quarter. The quarter results reflect strengthening momentum across our key served markets.","I will take a moment now to discuss our June underlying orders. All commentary refers to June trailing three-month orders, excluding currency and acquisitions, which, for the consolidated company, was up 9%, marking the sixth consecutive month of positive orders.","Starting with Automation Solutions orders, the platform was up 9% with growth across all world areas, except Latin America. Europe was up low single digits; Asia, up high single digits; and North America and Middle East\/Africa both increased double digits. The broad-based momentum reaches across end markets as well with continued favorable trends in oil and gas, power, life sciences and chemical markets.","Moving to Commercial & Residential Solutions orders, the platform was up 8%, led by North America, Asia and Europe. Growth in North America reflected acceleration in residential air conditioning and professional tools in oil and gas and construction-related markets, as well as continued high single-digit demand in refrigeration markets.","Asia growth remains broad-based reflecting steady demand in HVAC and refrigeration markets, as well as continued strong electric heat pump activity in China. Demand in Europe remains strong, reflecting favorable conditions in HVAC and refrigeration markets.","We are encouraged by the continued strength in orders, and note that these trends are consistent with expectations communicated at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference in May.","Moving back now to our quarter results, earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding Valves & Controls, was flat at $0.68, in line with guidance provided on the second quarter earnings call. Operating cash flow generation was strong at $774 million in the quarter, driven by improvement in trade working capital management.","Turning to slide 3, profitability in the quarter was affected by the Valves & Controls acquisition, by both first-year acquisition accounting charges as well as dilution from operations.","Excluding Valves & Controls, gross margin was approximately flat and EBIT margin was down 40 basis points, reflecting a prior-year gain of $18 million. Earnings per share from continuing operations was down 7% due to a $0.05 impact from the Valves & Controls acquisition, comprising $0.04 from first-year acquisition accounting charges and $0.01 from operations.","Let's move now to slide 4. Global demand conditions strengthened versus the second quarter. Emerging markets were up low single digits and mature markets grew mid-single digits. Growth was supported by improving end markets in the U.S. and Asia and early signs of improving demand conditions in Canada. Growth in Asia accelerated during the quarter, led by China. Excluding China, the rest of the region also improved, growing at low single digits in the quarter.","Turning to slide 5, total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 80 basis points to 20.9%, driven by the benefits of restructuring actions and leverage on higher volume. Corporate and other charges increased $75 million, driven by $37 million of Valves & Controls' first-year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog amortization, $13 million of higher acquisition costs and a prior-year gain of $18 million on payments received related to dumping duties.","Free cash flow from continuing operations was $668 million, up 24% versus prior year and year-to-date free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 11% versus prior year. Free cash flow conversion, excluding Valves & Controls, was 143% in the quarter and 123% year-to-date. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 1.2 points to 16.1% during the quarter, with improvement across all three components of trade working capital, led by improvement in accounts receivables.","Turning to slide 6, Automation Solutions underlying sales grew 2% and net sales grew 12% to $2.4 billion, including results from the Valves & Controls acquisition. Energy-related life science and chemical markets continued positive momentum, with most end markets focused on MRO and optimization projects. Growth in North America was supported by a return to growth in Canada, reflecting renewed activity in unconventional oil and gas.","General industrial markets were favorable, particularly in Asia and Europe, resulting in high single-digit growth in our industrial solutions products. Latin America remained down and has not yet begun to recover. Middle East and Africa was down 2%, but the market there has turned. Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 170 basis points to 17.9%, reflecting the flow-through of benefits from restructuring actions and leverage on higher sales.","Based on continued strengthening of our end markets, we now expect full year underlying sales for the segment to be down 1% to 2% versus our prior guidance of down 2% to 3%.","And let's turn now to slide 7, and I will hand it over to Mr. Mike Train.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Tim (8:05), thanks, and thanks for that last chart. We've been looking for that one for a while. Been two years of very rugged market conditions. And I thought it'd be a good idea to update you on our project funnel that we shared with you back in our February meeting. At that time, we laid out expectations that we'd see some recovery in our aftermarket products and services, our KOB3, as we call it, followed by smaller projects at existing sites and then eventually, the formation of some of these larger greenfield projects. I do believe we are seeing this play out as expected.","On the large project funnel, we have seen significant growth in the funnel as more projects are being put back into play, principally in the oil and gas, refining and the metals markets. Chemicals in North America also remains very active and very good for us.","We will see several projects in the funnel get approvals to proceed in 2018, probably half of what's depicted on this chart, should have decisions in 2018, and then I'll go through the award-order-execution sales process that typically follows and plays out typically over a 12 to 24-month period. So I anticipate we'll see some of these longer-cycle deliveries start to mix into our backlog as we get into next year. But it should set us well next year and I think even maybe better for 2019. So we're pretty excited about what we're seeing right now. There's a lot of good optimism out there.","I just wanted to add if I've the time, been around the world talking to customers as part of the Operational Certainty, and Plantweb Digital Ecosystem launches and there's a lot more optimism out there as we go forward.","Oil price has been bouncing around the $40s, that's made some people a little bit nervous, but I think generally they are putting a lot of energy into it, and they are open to ideas to operate better, and I think we're really striking a chord there. So I think we're clearly seeing them, I think some of the investment we're seeing now in the shorter cycle of goods is related to them willing to operate better. So, very positive I think (9:52).","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd like to add, Mike, I want to also thank you and your team for the first 100 days, the first 95 days of integration of Valves & Controls. A lot of work by you and your team, and all the Valves & Controls people out there and it's not easy and everything that's going on right now. And so high expectations as we go into 2018, but still an outstanding acquisition and really brings a lot as you know from a customer perspective.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, very exciting. Even more.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Thank you very much. If you could pass it on to the team for me, appreciate that.","Unverified Participant","All right, thanks, Mike. Turning to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions sales increased 7% on both a net and underlying basis reflecting strong global demand. North America, which was up 6%, was driven by robust growth in residential air conditioning, and solid growth in refrigeration, professional tools and do-it-yourself products at big box retailers.","Growth of 17% in Asia was led by China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Excluding China, the rest of the region was up low single digits in the quarter. Margin remained near record high levels and leveraged 40% sequentially versus the second quarter. Versus prior year, margin declined 50 basis points due to unfavorable mix from growth in residential air conditioning and the usual timing lag between material inflation and realization of pricing actions.","This is in line with margin guidance previously communicated, and we continue to expect higher second half sales deleverage at 40% sequentially versus the first half as discussed at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference. Full year net and underlying sales growth is expected to be 5% to 6%.","And let's turn now to slide 9, and I will hand it over to Mr. Bob Sharp.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","As many of you know, the Commercial & Residential business is comprised of some key franchises, if you will, very solid growth dynamics and certainly exceptional profitability and asset management. Names like RIDGID and InSinkErator and Copeland are really synonymous with the categories we serve. Our attention now is really focused on the top line, having the necessary number of incremental programs to drive sales growth above the market with a one plus kind of a point above market target that we have.","A big part of that is the solutions focus, and a lot of our programs are around that. We're certainly meeting that this year comfortably above a point of market as we calculated, and we feel good about the programs and the momentum we have as you can see in our order rates going into next year.","This chart shows a number of the key ones going on. In residential, certainly a big story for us is what's happening in China with heat pumps, driven heavily by Beijing's interest in air quality and some other dynamics. We have over 100% growth in that area this year after a very strong ramp up last year as well. A big news, if you noticed, one of our large customers launched some new 16 SEER to 18 SEER product with our UltraTech \u2013 multi-stage product, UltraTech, noting in the promotion that it's a Copeland technology and promoting comfort at a value, which we feel is a very key part of the U.S. market.","There's been a lot of attention on variable speed over the years. In fact, this category, this area at one point was thought to be something that would be a variable speed application, and we consider it a very strong endorsement of UltraTech to have that news. You can see some other programs around sensing and European heat pump activity also.","Over on food chain, we've launched ProAct Cargo. This is a combination of the Locus Traxx and PakSense businesses we bought. We have those together now as one business with a tiered product offering. It's ramping up nicely. And a big part of our attention right now is leveraging the international infrastructure that Emerson provides to these small companies to get at either the grower or the specifier side for a total international supply chain. That's going very well.","Food waste is a big topic. Food is a very big issue for environmental emissions both on the commercial side with Grind2Energy as well as homes. There's a lot of opportunity for more responsible disposal of food using the disposers. And then we've got a nice program going on right now, a good synergy between the RIDGID business and refrigeration is that a customer of ours, who does the fittings for plumbing, sees refrigeration as a very important growth area for them. They like the idea that we can team up our pressing capability at RIDGID with our refrigeration knowledge and we have basically a troika working on this now and it's a very significant growth opportunity for us as well as this customer.","So, a lot of good programs going on. Again, we feel good about the market we're having, the growth we're having now. We'll be at the top end of that 5% to 6% range we talk about and also feel good about the momentum going into next year.","Unverified Participant","Okay. Thanks, Bob. Let's turn to slide 10 and walk through our 2017 outlook. Net sales growth is now expected to be approximately 5% including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition. Underlying sales growth is unchanged from prior guidance at 1%. Automation Solutions segment underlying sales is revised to down 1% to 2% versus prior guidance of down 2% to 3%.","Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying and net sales growth is unchanged from prior guidance at 5% to 6%. With solid cash performance year-to-date, we now expect to exceed our $2.5 billion operating cash flow target. Based on strong operational performance and order trends we are raising our 2017 earnings per share guidance. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance is $2.58 to $2.62 and includes $0.05 dilution from Valves & Controls operations.","On a comparable basis, our previous guidance per share \u2013 earnings per share guidance was $2.50 to $2.60, including the $0.05 dilution from Valves & Controls operations. As part of our continued portfolio repositioning, we anticipate an agreement on the divestiture of our ClosetMaid business in the fourth quarter.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much. I want to thank Mike and Bob for stopping in and talking a little bit about their businesses. Bob's had a great year with tremendous premium performance and running at record levels of profitability across the company and really making investments necessary to serve the industry and being the leader that we are in this industry.","I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I also want to thank the entire global organization in delivering a very solid quarter in positive sales, improved profitability, extremely strong cash flow with \u2013 conversion of free cash flow to earnings in the third quarter of 140% and year-to-date running over 120%. So, a very strong execution, back to back years in cash flow and very, very important to us.","As I said earlier, our first 100 days or nearly 100 days of the Valves & Controls acquisition are well underway. Integration is going extremely well and we're on track to have strong cash flow accretion in 2018 and earnings accretion, excluding the one-time earnings or inventory and backlog valuation, which will still flow through in the first three or four months of fiscal 2018.","A great job to the whole Automation Solutions team, especially around Final Control and the Valves & Controls team. We're extremely excited about this team of the people. We're really excited about the opportunity with this acquisition and we see a lot of good upside, both in growth and also profitability and cash. The opportunities are still there. There's no difference from what we saw when we did the acquisition and the marketplace is starting to turn up and we're seeing those improvements as we come forward, so real excited about the first 100 days, but, again, we have the next 100 days and we got all of next year to deliver and get ready for the long-term value creation of this acquisition.","The quarter came in as expected. I think if you go back and look at the transcript, I was pretty clear about the underlying sales and earnings expectations. I think I probably told you $0.86 \u2013 $0.68, I'm sorry, $0.68. $0.68 and \u2013 that's where we came in. It's just \u2013 we could see that that's where it was heading. The one positive of the cash flow and the orders were a little bit stronger and we're setting ourselves up for a very good fourth quarter and we're looking forward to having a good fourth quarter with strong underlying sales, improved profitability and strong cash flow.","Looks to us, right now, as we look at the last couple of months, assuming we execute around $2.60, plus or minus a couple of pennies, that includes a nickel dilution from the Valves & Controls operations performance not included in the one-time backlog inventory valuations or revaluations.","Orders are trending exactly like we thought they would as we reported in May at EPG. They're well within that band, and I still believe they'll trade in that band. The band at that point I think it was around 8% to 12%. I would expect maybe we could have a month at the high end of that band, and we could have a month at the low end of that band, but still trending pretty well where we thought they would.","Good mix. And as I've said earlier, we really need another two or three months of knowing that mix of orders relative to Mike's business and how that unfolds relative to short, medium, and long-term growth rates and the cycles where the orders are coming in. But clearly right now, we're seeing a mix starting to move towards the small and medium-size projects. As Mike showed you, he's got an increasing funnel, which we track on a global basis and really, obviously, seeing some big projects coming out that will start hitting us in early fiscal 2018, maybe even towards the end of fiscal 2017. But, clearly, a lot going on.","The wins as we see the global marketplaces and gross fixed investments, we're still seeing a very good performance relative to the fixed investments around the U.S., around Western Europe, around China, Asia. We're seeing some improvement from Middle East. If you remember the last call, I was somewhat concerned about the Middle East, but that's turning right now. Investments are starting to happen. And maybe, and I mean maybe, Mexico might actually start growing again, and so that will be good to see if they get some money freed up. So we have a lot of markets going our way at this point in time.","Around the profitability improvement, Automation Solutions underlying business without V&C is improving on the trend line that we thought, a very good performance. Obviously, that we'll have to continue as we try to drive back towards our historical levels of profitability. The Valves & Controls business came in at lower-profit margins, as we all talked about last time, around that 5% EBIT.","We're working hard to offset that margin, but it'll take several years, many years to do that. But from the standpoint of the underlying valuation or profitability of our Valves & Controls business, it's still going to be an 18% to 19% as we absorb this in the future. It's exactly what we laid out when we did the acquisition.","The big opportunity relative to the solution package is the growth, and the new customers, new markets are still very good. Again, that will pay out in the future, not in the near-term. And the most important thing in the near-term in the next couple of years really is the potential trade working capital on all Final Controls relative to V&C and also our Final Control business. We still believe that we have $300 million to $400 million of trapped cash sitting in there in that working capital that will help us drive down our dividend to free cash flow ratios back below 50%, hopefully sooner than later.","We're making great progress this year across the whole corporation and then cash flow, and we're seeing an improvement in the ratios and that's very, very important relative to the long-term capability for us to invest in the company and do what we want to do from an acquisition standpoint, and also make sure we maintain our dividend record and move towards actually starting to get off the minor increases towards more meaningful increases once we get back below 50%, toward that 45%. Clearly, a very strong focus point of ours and one that we're working hard on. And if we can deliver $300 million to $400 million of cash off the Final Control, that makes the net purchase price for that business even less.","Relative to Commercial & Residential, they're running at tremendous performance right now, premium to the market and underlying growth and sales growth running at very high levels of profitability \u2013 record levels of profitability. Yes, people can look at it quarter-to-quarter and say, hey, looks like things are going bad, but keep in mind, that business delivered leverage at 40% incremental sales in the quarter and will do it again in the fourth quarter.","That business is a very profitable business, and, yes, we have to deal with the price cost ratios, which are a little bit tougher than we thought just two or three months ago, but they're very manageable and we're dealing with those issues, and we're running at record levels of profitability and investing in the next generation for refrigeration, next generation of control and solutions, and really a good job relative to overall driving incremental growth, incremental profitability and Craig Rossman is here again today and after the first 60 days, he still hasn't screwed up the business, he's taken it over, but we'll give him another 60 days and we'll check on you, Craig, and we'll take a close look at you. I mean, just don't want you to mess up over there too much, and very important to me.","I want to thank the improved earnings and underlying earnings and improved cash flow as we go into the second half this year. Strong operational performance across the company, and really I think a good finish to the second half of fiscal 2017, and really a good start relative to orders and our cost structure and our overall profitability as we go into fiscal 2018.","So I'm looking forward to a good start and a lot of work we have to finish the year, clearly, and we have two months left. But I like the position we're in right now, I like the momentum we have across the company and I'm looking forward to getting this year behind us and really having growth both at the top line and in the earnings line and the cash flow line which is better than we thought originally.","But one thing I'd like to close the call with before we open up questions \u2013 to take questions is that, unfortunately, many of you have known me for a long time and have been around a long time know the conference call, I've always referred to our dog, Zorro and Zorro (24:53) is probably on his last couple of months or couple of weeks or couple of days. He's been with me for 15 years, an outstanding King Charles. Guy's got tremendous heart, but his body is not quite there anymore, but I just want to let you know for the people that do know me and have known me talk about Zorro (25:14) over the years is we're down to the last couple of days and that's an unfortunate situation. But we'll get over it and we'll move on to the next one.","And so with that, I want to close the call and take the questions for a few minutes. And with that, turn it over to the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question today will come from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning, everybody.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good morning, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Afternoon. My mistake, afternoon. Hey, did currency play any sort of significant role in the raising of the guidance versus when you set guidance last...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, no. Not at all, John. This is not a currency driven movement here. This is just a little bit better performance relative to the underlying sales and a little bit better performance relative to conversion on profitability. So that's where we sit right now.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then, Dave or Mike, do you have what Valves & Controls did maybe if you could pro forma it on the core growth basis in the quarter?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Core growth. What Valves & Controls did on their own self?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, yes. Roughly.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Valves & Controls business was down, I would say. We had them for two months. They were down. Their order pattern had been down for quite some time. So the Valves & Controls business is still trending down the top line. As you know, we talk about, we're actually going to start pruning some of the product lines out of the Valves & Controls. We're actually going to sell pieces out of Valves & Controls. We told you that we'd shrink it first and focus on the core pieces that we really want and drive the profitability up from there.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","The oil and gas projects you listed out, Mike, I think the average I think I just ran the numbers quickly, is like $49 million a project. How would you say that compares kind of versus historicals? Because if you compare it to the other ones you listed, they're actually amongst the larger ones. So I'm just curious to put it in a context.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I think the oil and gas projects we're looking at right now, there's some very sizable ones out there. I don't know if they are as big as that Prelude (27:40) type of thing that we've done in the past. But there's many of them out there. I think there's been a massive underinvestment the last few years and people are getting back in line and starting to evaluate these things. So we've added $1 billion to the funnel principally in oil and gas, a few other areas, but principally in oil and gas and there's a lot of interest there right now. A lot of things are being resurrected and starting to move.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just lastly, Dave, I mean, I think your orders run into kind of tougher compares toward the end of the calendar year. Do you believe just based on your experience, the cadence of business and kind of what you've got going on, that maybe we \u2013 you talk sort of about 8% to 12% for a month or two at the high end. Does this thing sort of settle at kind of a mid-single-digit type of order cadence kind of over the coming quarters? Or do you think it does a little bit better? Or how should we think about it do you think?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, right now, it depends really what happens relative to some of the key markets and there's some GFI forecasts which are starting to get better towards the end of this calendar year and early into next year. But I still say that our cadence is going to probably be in the 6% to 8% range as we go into the \u2013 as we get past these easier comparisons right now. But that's my first gut right now. I'd be saying that 6% to 8% type of trend and we'll see what happens, but every month goes by we'll get a better view of it, but I would say it's going to be sold single digits, yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, John. You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Just, Dave, on the guide with A&S getting a little bit better, less worse, for the year. Bob talked about Commercial Residential Solutions being at the top end, and then the overall organic growth...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't know the acronym. What acronym, Rich, did you use? I couldn't understand that. I mean, we have an Automation Solutions business, we have a Commercial Residential Solutions business. Help me out here, which one are you talking about?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So Automation Solutions view...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Rich. Thank you very much. Thank you.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A&S, Automation Solutions. So that was raised a little bit, less worse. And then CR&S was going to be at the top end of the guide. So there's no change in the underlying organic growth rate for the company, you know, negative one or plus one. Sorry. So is that just rounding? Or is that just...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's just rounding, it's rounding, Rich, and good analytical (30:12) work there. It's rounding. We're having better conversion relative to some of the margin and the profitability mix going well for us right now. Things are trending the right way, certain businesses are doing well right now. So I think that's what's going on from that perspective. We are a little bit cautious in the conversion of profitability. We know that Bob's business in the Commercial Residential Solutions was doing some investments, but he's still getting some pretty good growth rates.","We know that Mike's business was this ember (30:39) always lasts a little longer than the pent-up demand lasts a little longer, so he's getting a little bit better mix there too. So those are all things helping us right now.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then just back on the incremental margin as you start to \u2013 I know you don't have a ton of visibility into 2018 at this point, you need a few more months of orders. But how do we think about incremental margin? You had a great number this quarter for Automation Solutions in terms of conversion. As we think about what you have in the basket right now in the backlog, and the trends right now for mid-size projects, and then eventually getting to larger projects. How do we think about 2018? Just initial view in terms of how incremental margins start to play out over the next three to four quarters?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You are going to have to run \u2013 Automation Solutions is going to have to run in the mid-30s, to \u2013 what will happen again will be the mix, and that's what we want to watch over the next couple of months. But they're going to have to run in the mid-30s on the incremental to keep driving back up towards that 19% that we're trying to get to in the next several years. So, 19% EBIT. So that's what they're going to have to run.","Commercial Residential Solutions the issue for me right now is I'm talking to Bob and his team. It's all about, can they continue to run a premium growth rate relative to the market. If they can do that, then they're going to be running at record levels of profitability, and obviously from the perspective of that, we'll drive a pretty good margin, but at the same time gives them plenty of room to invest with that growth. So that's where we see it right now.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just last one, price\/cost is still negative 25 for the year, that still (32:12)?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's going to be a little bit more negative now. Steel pricing has been a little bit more negative from the standpoint, but still very manageable at this point in time. I think it's going to take us one more quarter to settle it out as we get into fiscal 2018 it will be a little bit better. But as you've been hearing on the calls, it's been a little bit tougher out there this year relative to price cost. But fortunately, we have a pretty good process. We got ahead of it and Bob's team was able to offset it with incremental margins relative to the price cost this quarter. And it's just \u2013 it's a little bit more challenging now than what it was, but still very manageable.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks so much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Rich. Appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please proceed.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Dave, how are you doing? So, you mentioned at EPG that their business is about five to six months behind Emerson in the cycle usually, and you bought the business, didn't have much backlog. But you didn't seem to allude in your prepared remarks that the business is turning or that it had turned? Maybe give some more color on that? Have you seen a turn in that business yet?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, we have. Actually, Mike showed the board today the order pattern \u2013 I guess it was not Mike, but it was Rahm Kreshner (33:33) showed it, but we're running about six months behind, five or six months behind, and they're still slightly negative. The curve is up and you think they're going to cost, what, Mike...","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I think soon, because you know, we had positive orders in March. So I think they are coming.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They're coming. So, they're coming up the curve. The incline's in the right way right now. If you think about the whole all Automation Solutions curve, they are coming right up that curve, but they're five or six months behind us right now. And so incremental we're out doing sales together right now, that's starting to work pretty quickly. So that's good news.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And Dave or Frank, I'm a little confused, maybe I should know this, but it looks like you did negative $0.01 in your operations in 3Q and then you're guiding to negative $0.04 in 4Q. Is that just extra restructuring? I know there's an extra month in there, you only had two months in 3Q but what is that in 4Q?","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","It's restructuring and the amortization which is booked in the segment.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. One extra month of...","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Amortization.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Amortization. But you're right. It's $0.04 in the quarter versus $0.01. Exactly right.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, Dave, just on the large projects, it does seem like Mike is a little more optimistic. You've said that you expect them to start coming back late in 2018. Is that still what you're thinking for the majority of these large projects? Or do you think maybe things have gotten a little better in that standpoint?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll give you my answer on that; Mike can give you \u2013 I think that \u2013 I think our customer base, the price of oil stability, the refinery business, the global marketplace, I think the large projects \u2013 or medium-size projects are going to maybe happen a little bit earlier. I'm still a little bit cautious about the large ones. I think there's still sight of line on capital spending for my \u2013 our large customer base.","But clearly they're firming. And one can be more optimistic, but I'd like to see that funnel continue to shift to the left and continue to grow on the outer side. But my feeling right now is it's a little bit better but you still have to be cautious and \u2013 because I'm going to watch the capital. And I still think our customers are being cautious with capital right now.","Now, Mike, what are you feeling?","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I think those are fair remarks. I mean we're getting into conversations with these guys because they want to get things ready to go.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","And we're going to look at their next couple of quarters as they make their decisions. But I think there is a lot more optimism around getting some stuff moving now, so we're going to have to see how it plays out. We saw the reports last week out of the oil companies. We know where their heads are. We're working that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I think that there's one difference, Andrew, that last year at this time, I talked about that we saw the MRO coming; don't be surprised as we finish the calendar year fiscal year, we'd start seeing some pent-up MRO come forward. This year, that's continuing to go, but really what's going to happen this year as we go out of this year and go into next year, I think you're going to see formation of the money's being set aside for the projects. And that will be a key point for us as we go into the budget setting of our customer base in that January time period. And I think this year they're going to say okay, money's being allocated and the project is going to start being let. So maybe a month or two sooner, but will see. That's where I am right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome, Andrew.","Operator","The next question will be from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Afternoon. Maybe a first question on the cash flow and the usage of the cash. I think you talked previously about the $300 million to $500 million or so buyback range. Clearly, I guess you're coming in probably at the very high end of that for the year. Maybe just update your buyback thoughts and how you see the acquisition pipeline today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So the buybacks is at $400 million, and so that's where we are right now and I mean we're pretty well stocked for the rest of this fiscal year. Yes, cash flow is good, but right now, the buyback is pretty well set at the $400 million. We're not going to change it at this point in time. We're probably looking at the same amount next year, somewhere between $400 million and $500 million next year. It's our current view of it at this point in time.","From the acquisition standpoint, I don't think there's been much change. I think we're still trying \u2013 looking this year at some incremental small deals. I don't know if we're going to get those done or not. But we're typically looking again, somewhere between $500 million and $1 billion over the next 12 months of acquisitions. So our cash flow right now is very good. And clearly at this point in time, we don't have anything major burning through that we're going to ramp up share repurchase or ramp up and do a big deal at this point in time.","Frank, do you have anything on there?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I think that's exactly right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So that's what we see right now.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. And then just on the organic sales growth outlook, so I think you're guiding for about 5% growth in Q4, and at EPG you talked about 4% to 5% growth in 2018. So do we see this current trend as sort of steady? Or do you think your growth can accelerate on the revenue line, at least towards the end of the calendar year, beginning of calendar 2018 and then sort of slows down after that with orders?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. So on the growth rate in the fourth quarter, we're looking at about the same growth rate we saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And then I would say that we would \u2013 I mean I think what we \u2013 the 5% to 6% is the number I gave you at EPG in May. And I'm still saying at this point in time, I don't see any change at this point in time. So there'll be some slight acceleration and it's driven off of \u2013 it's going to be driven off of Automation Solutions.","And from our standpoint, I mean Mike's business will continue to convert. And obviously he's got easier comparisons in the first half of this year because he was down probably on average 5%. And so he has a pretty easy comparison in the first half of next year. But I'm still looking around that 5% type of growth rate, 5% to 6% type of growth rate right now going into 2018, underlying growth rate.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. And on AS within the MRO piece of that, do you think you've made \u2013 you're quite some way now through that catch up MRO activity, and that will start to fade away? Or you think there's still a little bit of MRO pent-up demand left?","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","My point of view is it's still strong.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's still pretty strong. I don't see \u2013 I think \u2013 I would never accuse any of our customer base of cannibalizing or not spending enough money on MRO, but I think they understand, and I think that it's going to be good for a while here. I think we're going to be positive for a while. We're seeing it in North America. We're now starting to see it in Asia. We're going to start seeing it in the Middle East.","So it's starting a wave around the world right now. So it's a good thing for us at this point. I'd love to see it continue nicely in the first half of 2018. That would really give Mike a chance to get some of the medium-size projects onboard and working them. So that's what I see right now. I do not see a slowdown too much.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sincerely sorry to hear about Zorro (40:43).","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I appreciate it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A lot of candor, a lot of banter over the years, but you guys both have had a very, very good run. So you should hold his head up high definitely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I will, definitely. I've been doing that, and I brought my Rally Monkey in today, too, for Zorro (40:58) today. So I have my Rally Monkey in here, too, and I've got two baseball bats and my Rally Monkey, and we're all in here saying...","Unknown Speaker","Got them right (41:04)","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, I have to break Tim (41:06) in. I'm going to hit him over the head with a baseball bat in a second, but (41:12) did not warn him about some of the physical things we do in our conference calls like dropping baseball bats on my floor, but go to your question, Steve. Thank you very much for your comments.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, and sincerely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So on the Climate business, so obviously you have some raw pressure coming through. How do you kind of see there the pricing environment as you go in? I mean, I assume you're going to be negotiating on kind of that round of pricing with the OEMs this fall, or is that pretty much kind of \u2013 or maybe year end? I'm not sure. Or is that set in stone for kind of next year? Is that something that we worry about and have to assume the OEMs are going to execute on their price increases as well, because everybody's kind of feeling the pinch here a little bit in HVAC?","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I think if you go back, first of all, in 2016, if you notice, we took a very nice step in margin, because we had material pricing that was very favorable versus the customer pricing changes. 2017, we do have a lag, and in some cases we have clauses where we'll pass through, so we got some pass through of that 2016 benefit we captured.","And then, with the material inflation pickup, that causes a bit of a squeeze period, if you will. But, again, that's normal phasing. That'll play out into 2018. And then, for us, the cost reductions and product mix are a big part to the total equation as well, things like UltraTech, things like the K6 compressor and cost reductions, especially on DIY kind of stuff. And I would say, again, we've seen this coming for a long time. It's come as we thought, and it'll go in 2018.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. We have a lot of contractual stuff around as we go back and forth, and so there's leads and lags. Last year, we had a record, record quarter in profitability, and we had that kind of price cost deposit for us. So, Steve, I think we're pretty well set, and I think the OEMs see this coming, and we're working it right now, and clearly we give back and forth in this. So I think everyone is in pretty good shape right now, and we're not behind the eight ball here at all. So we're in pretty good shape.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just on Valves & Controls, so we kind of move forward into this cycle and you have this new Pentair business. Perhaps not \u2013 selling in solutions may be a little bit different than selling your really, really high quality, rich margin type of products. Should we expect a different level of incrementals, perhaps a different profile of cash flow as you sell \u2013 as you go to market as more of a solutions provider as opposed to a just really super high-end device guy?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","No? It's same kind of pricing dynamics. You're not really \u2013 you're not just going for the revenue here?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. It'd be the same similar dynamic. Obviously, on the mix of our business, you know, Steve, in the mix of business, our control systems are typically lower margin and certification is (43:59) higher. Valves are sort of the medium, some of the Valves & Controls stuff are a little bit lower, but the mix is there. There's not going to be any change in profitability and cash flow. It's the same.","Again, the revenue, the aftermarket, the key stuff here, which we're very strong in. There's not going to be any significant change in your modeling relative to the Automations business and the Final Control business at all. I think the one thing that we do have in the long-term, it's not in the next two or three years, is really a big increase potential in the aftermarket business.","So, I think Pentair and Randy Hogan had just started this and he did not have the same critical mass we have. I think in years five, six and seven I think you're going to start seeing us better service contracts, longer-term contracts, we're already starting to see some of that. That will give us a better mix than they had historically themselves.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","We're working hard on the operational footprint as we go forward, so we can hit those shorter lead times with those type of products. That's the big difference.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. Big difference in the margin, too. I'm optimistic on it, Steve. I wouldn't worry about that too much right now. That's not my worst problem, there.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then one last question, very high level and no offense to your operating guys, but you never really had operating guys on the call before, your segment heads. What was the call on bringing these guys on? I mean, it was great color. Don't get me wrong. But I'm just curious if there's any \u2013 should we be reading into this at all?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, Steve. How many times \u2013 never try to outguess me, okay? The reason I had them on is because we made some \u2013 you're something else man. Where's my Tusa Cashmere (45:42)?","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Put the bat down, Dave. Put the bat down.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I had committed to you in a session meeting (45:49) we had that I would have Mike come back after six months and talk about the funnel, remember?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I talked about updating the funnel. So I had Mike, so I wanted Mike to do it live. I could've done it, but I'd rather have Mike do it and you have guys to have a chance to take some cheap shots at Mike. And then if I'm going to have Mike on, I might as well have Bob, so you guys can take some cheap shots at Bob and I know that there's a lot of concern out there about our flow-through profitability and things like that. So there is no call here. Just because Zorro's (46:17) struggling, the CEO is not struggling. I'll still outrun you. But thank you very much for that vote of confidence. These guys are over here dying right now, holding a baseball bat over my head.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'll reserve the cheap shot for the next CEO. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Thank you very much, Steve. You're a pal (46:34). Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're not announcing succession here, Nigel. Don't worry about it, okay?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I don't know how to follow that, but...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I made it to 2017, I'm going to make it to 2018, okay?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. I have no doubt about that. I also echo Steve's comments on Zorro (46:55). Very, very sorry about that. But 15 is a hell of an age, so he's had a good run.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","For a King Charles, it's a hell of a run.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just, obviously, you're not giving FY 2018 guidance here, but any help on framing out V&C for next year just in terms of revenues, underlying margins, restructuring? Any help there would be great.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay, I'll give you. Okay. So I would say that underlying revenues for V&C next year, we're not going to break it out, but it will still be negative. I think that as we prune it and we look at some divestiture in there, I think the core rate will start increasing, but the underlying V&C business probably will be flat at best, maybe slightly down as we continue to prune and we continue to do some things there and sell some parts off. From a profitability standpoint, clearly, what we're trying to do is we're starting at 5% and we've got to figure out how to double that. And the key issue for us is how do we get that? We've got to get back on track the plan that we laid out to the board and our shareholders and make it accretive to us, excluding the accounting charges of the valuation in inventory and backlog and that's the key issue for us.","And then, obviously, driving cash flow near-term. I mean there's a lot going on right now, but I like where we are at this point in time. It will hurt us from a margin standpoint, but we're going to figure out how to make sure that we can deliver \u2013 we made a statement on cash flow accretion and slight earnings accretion in 2018 and that's the focus. So that's the framework you're thinking about right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right, right. How much restructuring do you think in 2018, Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. I think it's going to be still be around $30 million to $35 million Valves & Controls restructuring. I think you're probably looking at probably the same about for the total or rest of Emerson. So from that perspective, I think you're looking at probably total $60 million to $70 million of restructuring next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Maybe a tad higher, but yes, that's right. I'm just, yes, that's where I see right now. We're just going through the first phase but that's what we see right now. I think Mike's trying to get $35 million done right off the bat.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","We're hustling hard.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're hustling right now. We have a lot going on. I would say we're going probably do the same amount next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then on the funnel, which is a great job, but the $4 billion, (49:21) what kind of hit rate would you expect on that, Dave? I mean, what's been your win rate on projects? And on the $2.5 billion oil and gas, anything to call out in terms of mix of geographies upstream, midstream, subsea? Any help there would be great.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, from a geography standpoint, again North America and Europe and some Middle East I think would be the principal places you would expect as far as activities go for sure. From a hit rate standpoint, I mean various kind of product lines. I would argue we've been taking share all through this period right now. And we anticipate this is going reasonably well. Our customers are coming forward with this for the technologies, towards our people, towards our aftermarket capabilities, our service centers. We're doing pretty well holding our own.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We may not get all the projects, but we will get a big chunk of the projects. And so we won't get all the projects. So we've done pretty well here. But I think the key issue for us will be Asia has picked up nicely, it's just a function of I think I said earlier, when the budgets are set at the end of this calendar year, our customers are looking at their cash flow, they're looking at the pricing, and I think we are going to have a pretty good capital spend next year, which will be good for us.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That's helpful. Thanks, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care.","Operator","Next question will be from Gautam Khanna with Cowan and Company. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Hey. How is it going guys? And I'll echo my sentiments on your dog and that's awful. But yes, a good run.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","He's still alive, but he's hurting.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Yes, that's tough, certainly very. I understand. I was wondering if you could quantify the revenues associated with the product exits you've talked about at Valves & Controls. Maybe what they did last year in aggregate?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm not going to tell you off the top of my head, but, Mike, do you have an idea?","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't have it on the top of my head. It's not a huge number, it's pruning.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Less than $100 million, I mean gut stuff. That's what we're looking at. We're going to pick here and there, and certain things like that. I just know in the short-term that hurts you as you go through that process, and the backlog has been liquidated pretty hard. So...","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","And they're going to be pruned for a reason which is typically their...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Profitability, yes.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","(51:41)","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Got it. Okay. And regarding the cash opportunity at Valves & Controls, do you have an updated view on the timing of when you'll realize that? I think you said $300 million to $400 million in your comments, but previously was it $500 million? I'm just wondering how big is it? And where does it lie within the working capital accounts? And how are you guys going about attacking it?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. So I would say \u2013 I've never said $500 million, I have said $300 million to $400 million. Typically, what we're looking at right now is within 2020 we're looking at trying to get $200 million of that. I would like to see if I can get another $100 million out of that within by 2020. It makes a big difference relative to the payout ratio, our dividend or free cash flow. If you approach $300 million, we get closer to 45% on our payout. And that's ahead of schedule. And that's a big thing for us relative to our dividend or free cash flow payout.","And where it sits primarily is inventory, and they have some issues with receivables because of their delivery capabilities just were not up to par versus what we would see, and our customers typically would not pay on time when you haven't delivered. And so those are the two areas we're working on right now. And I would say across all \u2013 it's going to be a Final Control thing we're going after, and that gives us a big chance of getting that $300 million to $400 million well within that by 2020.","I mean you'll see it. We're going to have back to back years of free cash flow conversion of over 120%. And there's not many industrial companies that do that. And so I think that we're starting to see the benefit of that, and Mike's team is going to work it hard. And we're really going to push hard because Mike \u2013 Frank and I really want to be able to say that by 2020 we're getting close to 45% of our dividend to free cash flow ratio. That would be a very powerful statement for us to make.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care.","Operator","The next question will be from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Dave, with the ClosetMaid process winding down there, just wondering if anything else is emerging at the margin of your portfolio? Or if kind of the repositioning and divestiture is more categorically behind you?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The repositioning that we laid out in June 30 of 2015, the three programs, are behind us when we finish this. As we say we always have little things that we look at. But as we look at the business today, and the two platforms, we're set. And now we want to operate this and so we're moving forward. There's nothing in the works other than the little tiny product lines or plants that we're looking at relative to the Valves & Controls business. So we're set, and we're looking forward to get that behind us. And I know the whole team's working hard on that and it'd be nice to have that done and we can just run forward in 2018.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And Tim (54:46) mentioned the Middle East turning there. That was down a good bit. I'm just wondering, is that a characteristic kind of boom\/bust cycle moving into a boom period you think there, with the kind of immature market dynamic in the Middle East?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I think that \u2013 a couple of things going on. I think there's a little bit more stability from a cash flow standpoint and an earnings standpoint. They've underinvested and so they're \u2013 I mean if we look at our orders right now, the orders are \u2013 Mike has been (55:12) picking up. You have positive...","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Picking up. They're shorter cycle orders, but they're picking up.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They're picking up. So I would say, I think we're going to be next year, that market will be positive growth next year based on what we're seeing right now. I was not as optimistic last call, but now I'm starting to see some good things. Mike's team's done a great job of getting Valves & Controls, include them back into Aramco, back into some Saudi things that we haven't been able to get into before. So a lot of good things are moving our way in the Middle East. I think the only market I see with any heartbeat right now in Latin America is Mexico for us. And Bob's business is a little bit different. He's doing well down there, but Mike's business in the big projects, there's just no money.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","NOCs in Latin America are the challenge.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","And they're just taking their time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's where we sit right now.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then lastly on the $2.60 full year outlook, what's the basis from the third quarter for that? Is it add $0.04 to the $2.63?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm trying to understand your logic here. Help me out \u2013 say that one more time and run it by me. I must have Zorro (56:18) syndromes here right now.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Yes. So if you look at the $2.60 midpoint for the year, what are we using from the third quarter to bridge to that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh.","Unknown Speaker","$0.67.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$0.68?","Unknown Speaker","Well $0.68 is \u2013 excludes a penny of ops and our full guide has the full nickel of ops in it so you want to use...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$0.67. Thank you very much. That's a very good question. Next?","Operator","All right. Our next question will be from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess the first question is, in looking at kind of this recovery we're seeing I suppose, how do we think about if we go into another oil and gas swoon here? Or how should we be thinking about it? Because we got the crosscurrents of underinvestment, pent-up demand, the turnarounds, but you could be in a situation where you could see material pull back here. So how do we think about kind of scenario analysis for 2018 if we start to see a swoon again?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, I haven't really mapped it out, but if you start seeing also in the price of oil drop back below $30, $20 you'd see immediately our business, Mike's business go negative, and within the next couple of quarters it would be negative and so we'll be back into slight negative overall for the business. I don't see that happening at this point in time because the global marketplace is growing. The use of oil has gone up. I think the price of oil has stabilized, but there is that likelihood, but we don't see that in our customer behavior not do we see that in the marketplaces, but it would clearly set us back from a growth standpoint and then we clearly would have to curtail any type of investments and look at profitability and clearly look at what we have to do (58:22) V&C. But I would say that's a low probability for 2018 at this point in time.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In terms of V&C now that it's closed and you have it under the hood a little bit, what do you think is the good and the bad and the ugly there in terms of your initial expectations? What would you kind of highlight as being the most positive surprise, the most negative surprise in terms of the acquisition?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think the one positive \u2013 the negative that the business had deteriorated in profitability a little bit more than we wanted to, so our delta where we're (58:54) coming from is a bigger leap the first year and I'm telling my guys that's what it is. We've got to figure out how to get that earnings up for 2018. That would be the worst. But at the same time on the positive side, I think the people across V&C are truly engaged and they're looking forward to working very, very hard with the Automation business, which is very global, very broad and one that can get into customer accounts and get things done.","We also have the resources, the financial resources, the cash flow resources to invest in this business and so that's a good thing. So overall, Ed Monsigate (59:30) report with Mike today and Rahm (59:33) was involved in the business. Things are actually better overall \u2013 there's always some things underneath there but better overall than we thought, and we're looking forward to a very positive 2018, 2019. Just coming off a lower base, and we are where we are, and the cash flow will come out. The cash flow is there. We'll get that cash. We know how to get it up the balance sheet.","Mike Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I would say very good bones. We like what the business looks like. Very good team members; really, really, really know their business. I think with the way we're propositioning moving their operating methods towards our methods, I think they're very excited about it, and we're working our way through it, and I think it will be very effective going forward.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Rob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Go ahead. You got one more. You got one more question. Go ahead. We'll give you one more question.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I didn't want to be a mooch, but we'll get Bob involved.","Unknown Speaker","(1:00:22)","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","(1:00:25) you still work for Stifel, don't you? You're a mooch.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Stifler's mom. Get it right. In any event, for Bob, maybe you could talk about just \u2013 do you feel good about the state of your business overall with respect to Copeland Compressors position? And, I mean, obviously, you've been incredibly strong market share there, great technology position, but do you think there's going to be a level of investment or a level of defense of the technology or share over there over the next three to four years?","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","We feel good about Scroll. It's been a very strong run for literally decades now, and it's still got plenty of legs. The UltraTech has still got a lot of opportunity. As we said in the U.S. residential market, we think that's the solution on efficiency and comfort. And the Commercial side, we've got some new products in the kind of 10 to 20 horsepower area that are very competitive, and doing very well right now.","And then, there's certainly some of the bigger-size stuff we put things together in tandem and trios and things like that. So, yes, there's \u2013 we like that range that Scroll plays within. It continues to push higher, and it's in commercial applications that are very helpful, and then combined with the solutions capability. We feel good about the prospects there.","Like I said, there are other people calling the variable speed market in the U.S. not long ago, and now you see again in that middle tier customers explicitly showing that they're using Copeland Scrolls, and they got some very important sign of what's going on.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think the key issue here, Rob, is that the investments that we've been making for many, many years here both from the technologies around the Scrolls, the products around Scrolls, around the capabilities and solutions are really starting to pay off on a global basis. And so, the work that was done in Asia and China around some of these packages and we have a lot more we can do there. Same thing in Europe. Same thing in the United States. So Bob and his team have had a good couple of wins going to his back right now, which helps him a lot.","And I think that several more of those solutions we'll be hitting later this year or early next year. So I think that our solutions approach here is not just a product focus. It's really starting to pay off, and we'll continue to invest around that. I'm very optimistic. The goal for Bob is to have a premium growth, like Mike has done in the Automation business for years. And if he can do that at the level of profitability he has, that's a big winner for Emerson and Emerson shareholders.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","It's hard to find a more competitive market than China right now. And this compressor of choice in the heat pump market is a Scrolls compressor from us.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Rob. All the best to you and thanks very much for your support and comments on Zorro (1:03:21). I appreciate that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's it. And so what I'd like to say is goodbye. I want to thank everybody across the organization. And, again, thank you very much for your support on our organization. We still got a couple of months left, folks. We got to make this happen. And I want to thank our shareholders for their support and look forward to seeing everybody in the near future. And, again, I look forward to wrap up the year as we get into November.

Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded today, November 5, 2019.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the Company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Mr. Reeves the floor is yours, sir.","Tim Reeves","Okay. Thank you, Mike. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President Automation Solutions; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Commercial and Residential Solutions and introducing Pete Lilly, the incoming and upgraded Director of Investor Relations, who will surely not mispronounce Frank's name.","Welcome to Emerson's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the Slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start on Slide 3 with the full-year performance report card. 2019 required our organization to be nimble and responsive to a lower growth environment than we had expected a year ago and we did respond.","On our second quarter earnings conference call, we began talking about additional restructuring actions and we did so again on our Q3 call in August. In total, we executed $35 million of additional actions in the second half and on October 1st, we announced our Board's review of further actions appropriate for the lower growth environment we see over the next couple of years.","Underlying sales finished the year up 3% versus our initial guide of 4% to 7%. We saw slower than expected growth across both platforms, Automation Solutions grew 5%, which was mostly driven by efforts targeting our broad installed base. We saw large capital projects start to push out in Q2 and that trend continued through the second half. Commercial and Residential Solutions saw a sharp decline in Asia in the first quarter and was a headwind to growth all year.","Cooler weather hampered residential growth in North America and professional tools and cold chain markets began to slow through the second half as non-residential investment slowed. Despite slower growth, we delivered just above our EPS guidance helped by lower tax rate and lower corporate costs. Importantly, we had a strong cash flow for full year, delivering free cash flow at $2.4 billion, which was up 6% and reflected 105% free cash flow conversion. This drove dividends as a percent of free cash flow down to 50% a critical milestone.","In 2019, we completed our 63rd year consecutive dividend increases and returned $2.5 billion to investors including $1.25 billion of share repurchases, which was above our initial target of $1 billion. Today, we announced a $0.04 dividend increase in 2020.","Please turn to Slide 4. Fourth quarter results were above the high end of EPS guidance discussed on the third quarter conference call, helped by a $0.09 discrete tax benefit. Automation solutions was in line with guidance with 5% underlying growth in Q4 and full year EBIT margin of 16% spot on with guidance. Trends in the business continued into Q4 with slowing global discrete markets and soft North American upstream activity.","Demand in global process in hybrid markets remained stable. Commercial and residential solutions end markets were slower than expected and the business deleveraged on lower growth. Q4 underlying sales were down 2% compared to our expectation that the business will be up slightly in the quarter. Our fourth quarter free cash flow generation was up significantly versus prior year and we completed the $250 million of additional share buybacks announced on our Q3 call.","Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter gross margin was up 70 basis points to 42.8% and full-year margins were 42.5% demonstrating strong price leverage and cost disciplines. SG&A cost as a percent of sales fell 180 basis points as our businesses effectively control costs. Operational SG&A spend was lower compared to the prior year and also lowered sequentially compared to the third quarter. Lower corporate expenses also contributed to this improvement, lower stock compensation and the favorable impact of the prior year one-time 401(k) contributions.","Reported EBIT margin was up 140 basis points. In 2020, we will report adjusted margins, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges consistent with our new adjusted EPS framework, which we'll discuss in detail shortly. 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was up 210 basis points to 22.8%.The quarter benefited from discrete tax items similar to the prior year. Fourth quarter EPS was up 20% excluding these discrete tax items from both years.","Turning now to Slide 6. From a geographic perspective, we saw mixed results in Q4. In total, mature markets were down 1% underlying in the quarter and up 2% for the year. U.S. industrial activity softened a bit in Q4, somewhat offset by stronger Western Europe. Emerging markets were up 8% underlying in Q4 and up 4% for the year. Strong fourth quarter emerging market investment activity was led by China, up 9%. Latin America up double digits and Middle East and Africa up 8%.","Turning now to Slide 7. Total segment margin was up 10 basis points, including recent acquisitions. Total adjusted segment margin was up 50 basis points to 20.2%. This improvement reflects greater than 40% year-over-year and sequential leverage. We've updated our reporting of corporate and other costs. Previously, we showed two numbers, the differences in accounting methods line, which included a management charge to the operating segments and certain pension and post-retirement costs and the corporate and other line that included corporate operations, total company stock comp expense, acquisition and related -- acquisition related costs and other items.","Going forward, we will present three-line to more clearly show the pension and post-retirement cost the corporate, the stock compensation expense, and the corporate and other line, which includes the cost of corporate net of the charge to the businesses, acquisition related costs and other items. We believe this presentation provides greater clarity and is more in line with how our peers report. Q4 cash flow was strong. Free cash flow of $1 billion was over 20% of sales and free cash flow conversion in the quarter was 140%.","Turning to Slide 8. Automation solutions underlying sales were up 5% in the quarter and up 5% for the full year. September trailing three-month underlying orders were up 4% excluding two large nonrecurring power projects in the prior year. Strong demand continue to cross MRO spending and brownfield projects supported by primary demand, growth programs focused on our installed base. We continue to see long cycle bookings, with the September backlog for final control and systems businesses up 6%; however, our large project funnel continue to stall, as customers' capital spending plans push out due to trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainty.","North America underlying sales were down slightly as discrete and upstream markets continued to soften. Strong growth continued in Latin America. Demand in Europe was stable in the quarter and underlying sales growth accelerated on strong backlog conversion. Asia, underlying growth was broad-based led by China, which was up 18%. Strong growth in Middle East and Africa was driven by long cycle investment activity.","Automation Solutions segment margin was up 70 basis points including significant restructuring investments executed in the quarter. Adjusted segment margins was up 140 basis points to 19.5%. For the full year, excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions, automation solutions delivered over 30% leverage on an adjusted basis.","Turning to Slide 9. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 2% in the quarter and down 1% for the year. September trailing three-month underlying orders were down 2%. North America underlying sales were down slightly with cooler weather affecting key HVAC markets. Additionally, slower industrial markets weighed on professional tools and cold chain demand. Latin America demand remained solid.","Underlying sales in Europe were down slightly reflecting weaker trends in cold chain market somewhat offset by steady growth and heating and commercial air conditioning markets. Asia, Middle East, and Africa was down 7% underlying with China down 9%, primarily reflecting modest declines in commercial air conditioning in the cold chain markets partially offset by steady growth in professional tools. Commercial and Residential Solutions margin decreased 120 basis points and adjusted margin decreased 110 basis points. Lower profitability primarily reflected deleverage on lower volume and unfavorable mix, partially offset by favorable price cost.","Let's turn to Slide 10, which outlines our 2020 guidance framework. With the slowing macroeconomic backdrop and continuing geopolitical tension, we are planning for a lower no growth environment in 2020. For the full year, we expect underlying sales growth of down 2% to up 2% with Automation Solutions down 1% to up 3% and Commercial and Residential Solutions down 3% to up 1%. We expect reported sales to be slightly down with a point of FX headwind on the stronger dollar.","As Emerson has consistently done during economic slowdowns throughout our history, we have just a shifted our management and investment focus from a growth mindset to cost. We started this process in Q2 and in total, we increased restructuring investments to $35 million in the second half of 2019. As announced on October 1st, the Board initiated a review of operations, capital allocation, and portfolio initiatives, the 2020 outlook framework presented here does not include any potential implications of the Board's review.","At our February Investor Conference, we expect to present a detail the outcome of the Board's review and an updated 2020 framework -- outlook framework. Although we anticipate significant restructuring investments in 2020 as a result of the Board's review, our adjusted guidance framework excludes restructuring charges entirely. That is we have zero restructuring charges built into the outlook.","Adjusted EPS guidance also excludes significant discrete tax items. We expect adjusted EPS for 2020 in the range of $3.48 to $3.72 against a 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.69. The guidance focuses on operational improvement and margin expansion to drive earnings growth, which is more than offset by $0.29 of headwinds related to tax, unfavorable FX, higher stock compensation due to higher stock price and higher pension expense due to lower discount rates.","In 2020, we anticipate another strong cash flow year, as we continue to drive operations execution and incremental cash flow from recent acquisitions. 2020 operating cash flow is expected to be $3.1 billion and free cash flow conversion north of 100%.","Please turn to Slide 11, which bridges our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance.The starting point for the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of $3.71 and walking across to adjusted 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.69 by excluding $0.14 of favorable discrete tax items and adding back $0.12 of restructuring charges. Now walking from $3.69, we discussed first the $0.29 of headwinds next year. First, tax, the 2019 adjusted tax rate is 21.6% excluding the discrete tax items last year. This is 1.4 points better than expected 2020 rate of 23% resulting in a $0.06 EPS headwind.","Second, FX, the stronger dollar results in an FX translation headwind next year assuming October 31 FX rates hold for the remainder of 2020, we anticipate $200 million unfavorable impact in net sales, resulting in a $0.04 EPS headwind. And finally, stock compensation and pension. Stock comp is up due to higher stock price and pension cost increase this year due to lower discount rates. Partially offsetting these headwinds, we expect to drive $0.08 of operational improvement on flat to down sales, which reflects 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement in adjusted total segment margin. We also expect $0.12 of EPS from our improved debt cost structure and strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion of share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 12, which bridges our first quarter 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. For Q1 last year, we add back a penny for restructuring charges to $0.75. There were no discrete tax items in the quarter last year. The 2020 bridge for Q1, looks a lot like the full year bridge with half of the headwinds we discussed in the full year impact the first quarter. This is because Q1 last year benefited from lower stock compensation due to the decline in our stock price in late December, as oil prices fell.","In total, we faced $0.13 of headwinds, which were partially offset by $0.02 contribution from operations and $0.03 from shares and interest. These items provide $0.05 of EPS contribution, which is proportional to the $0.20 we expect in the full year.","And now, please turn to Slide 13 and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Tim and thank you very much for your service as Investor Relations and going out sort with a bang. It's an interesting time we've been having here. But I want to thank all the employees around the world for their support through Fiscal 2019. They did accomplish a lot in a very challenging marketplace.","And I want to welcome everybody on the call today, as we talk about what we're seeing in the marketplace and what we see going here going forward. But it's been a very dynamic time period as we all know. It's a challenging time period, but the management team across this Company, both here in St. Louis and around the world is very, very focused on delivering increased operational margins and a 0% underlying growth period.","If the growth is better, better for us; if it's not, we're ready for it and that's what we're doing. I also want to thank all the sell-side analysts and the shareholders that have met with Tim and I over the last 60 days and talked to us as we look sought your inputs, which we conveyed back to the Board, as we've gone through this process to make sure the Board understood, where our shareholders stood today and what they expected of us.","So if I look at where we're going right now, and you see that the order pattern in Chart 13, preliminary numbers for October, if I look at automation solutions, they drifted down a little bit but not much, running around I think around 3% underlying growth rate. Bob's business is sort of flat lining here around this negative 1 to 0% growth rate for the last couple of months. And overall, we are as a corporation looking at 1% underlying growth rate right now. As we know, we believe we're facing a very challenging time in 2020 and we are getting ready for that, and I'll have more comments on that as we go forward here.","If you look through the Chart 14, the history of Emerson from the years that we've gone through different cycles through period that I've been leading the Company as a CEO from 2000 to 2019. We have continue to the change the composition of the Company, we've continued to invest in the Company, we've divested close to 55% of the Company's assets since I've become CEO.","We repositioned and invested in new companies in our automation business invested in new companies in our commercial, residential business and we've driven our gross profit to very good levels. Our target is to get the number back into that 44 and plus percent range over the next couple of years, but we -- from an industrial operation standpoint, we know what we're doing here. We know how to invest in technology to drive higher gross profit and to drive what I'd call renewable type of business model as I look at our aftermarket business going forward.","We've had very good through underlying growth rates throughout the economic cycle. Yes, there are cycles. And yes, we're facing a cycle right now and I believe this team is focused on how we're going to improve the profitability and drive as much growth as we can for our shareholders going forward here in the next couple of years.","If you look at Chart 15 from the EBITDA margin standpoint over the time period, Emerson 21%, our weighted average peer is around 16%. Our Commercial and Residential Solutions business, is a very profitable business, a business run that runs through cycles a little bit different, a little less cyclical, runs around 25% EBITDA versus our peer group around 15%. Automation Solutions business also a very, very good business, it's been built up over a long, long time. I ran it many, many years ago, but I'd say the current leadership team is far better than I ever was back when I was running it in the late '90s but running an EBITDA around 20% versus our 15%, but we believe we have opportunities here to drive this EBITDA margins back up to its peak levels and to enhance our profitability, as we go forward in the next couple of years, and we'll be talking about that a little bit more.","If you look at our digital transformation capabilities today, we now have a very large installed base, close to $120 billion in our automation world. We have a capability with the -- our digital capability today both from a hardware standpoint and a system standpoint and we're driving unique business model around that while creating a new business within that, the focus specifically on is higher tech transformation opportunities and we have a very good start in this business today. You're going to hear more about that, as we now start talking about what we're doing, what we have to offer here, but it's really a truly unique differentiation that we have and really from the standpoint of our $120 billion installed base, it's quite unique to come off of.","And I'm -- we're very, very excited about it and we'll continue to invest in that even through a tough time, we will continue to invest in that. I also want to thank Lal and Ram and his whole team in the first couple of years of the Valves and Controls work, it's really created unique shareholder value for us, from an EBITDA standpoint, the pro forma of 2017. If you look at 2019, we're now over $600 million of EBITDA and EBITDA margins are now up 16%. We fundamentally have room to go.","We made a commitment to our shareholders that we would get to 20%, we will get to 20%. We are doing the necessary action to get to that level. It is a step by step basis and we're under way right now. We've decreased the number of facilities, you'll see more of that in 2020. We've driven out working capital on a combined basis when we took over V&C that number is close to 50% and on a combined basis, the Final Control was 35 total and we're now down to 26. We're doing a lot of different things here to drive value both from the customer perspective, but equally just important for our shareholder perspective and a lot more to go here for Ram and his team and Lal, as they go forward with this integration process and we will continue to accelerate that in 2020 and '21.","We've also continued to drive a lot of cash and back to our shareholders. If you look at our Emerson capital allocation over the last 10 years, we paid back to our shareholders in $10 billion a share repurchase, $12 billion of dividends, acquisitions we've done $10 billion worth, capital spending we've done about $6 billion worth. So we've continued to invest in the Company, continued to investment in technology and we continue to give back to our shareholders. In the last 10 years, that number of 57% of our cash flow goes back to our shareholders. This year we're over 60% as we drove back our dividend and as we grow back our share repurchase, we clearly had money to give back to the shareholders, we did not have as many as acquisitions and our intention is to give the money back if we can't use it internally.","On a return basis, as a company over the last 10 years, our return on total capital has been 18%. It is a number that goes up and down, as we make acquisitions, the number will drift down, as we integrate those numbers will drift up and over the time if you look through it. It does go up and down, but we drive at very high levels of return on total capital, a very important metric for us, both from cash standpoint, from a sales standpoint and margin standpoint, but returns on our investments from the shareholders' perspective is something it's high in our mind at all times.","If you look at the Chart 19, the only thing I want to point out is we go through the different cycles. You look at Emerson and you look at our G7 or G7 with China, the numbers cycle around. We are definitely in a downward drift right now. The concern I have, as I look at 2020, as I look at the GFI numbers right now, they're under 1%. That tells me we are facing a very challenging time period. I'm waiting for the catalyst to cause it to turn. There are a lot of people who believe that we'll see a second half recovery. We are not planning on that. We are planning on getting the cost out, getting our margins moving upward in a no-growth environment.","If we did grow, then we'll leverage nicely. But right now, what I see and I've been in this game, a long time, as you all know, I see a very challenging environment for at least 12 months, it could be 18 months and we'll see what that catalysts is that drive that. I firmly believe there will be a bounce back up. This cycle has been artificially depressed of the geopolitical issues, the trade issues, and I'm looking at what does it take to bounce it, from my standpoint, we're betting on a slow global growth for the next year, a challenging growth for us and we're adjusting accordingly.","We are going through the repositioning review with the Board right now. We have a lot of work to do. The effort is under way. It has been under way for several months. We will come back out to the shareholders later, after the first quarter and getting into that in February Investors call. But I'll tell you what I'm thinking right now. We are trying to aggressively advance our restructuring efforts. You're going to see in the first quarter restructuring number around $70 million and basically what we see at this point in time between Lal's business, between corporate and Bob. We're looking at around $70 million of restructuring on top of what we just did in the fourth quarter incrementally was $35 million higher.","As I look at the total plan from the late 2019 to '20 to '21, early '22, I would say right now, you should be factoring somewhere between $200 and $300 of restructuring as we go back to drive our EBITDA margins, or EBIT margins to record levels to high levels, and that focus is under way. The work will be done and reviewed with the Board in the coming months and then we'll share that with the outside investors, but we're well under way and we're going to take a significant hit in this first quarter, as we really action around things that should be done and to get going on this and that will come through and we report our final GAAP numbers.","It's not in the numbers that we presented to you today, but it will be around $70 million and I would expect that number obviously never hit exactly, it's going be plus or minus, but that's what we're talking about in the first quarter, up from what we just spent in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal year. So if you look at what's going on right now, the Board has is looking at operational review, looking at total cost structure across the Company, both on Bob's business, our corporate organization and Lal's business, how can we optimize the cost structure to get back to driving record levels of EBITDA margins, EBIT margins. We've hired outside global consulting firm to work with us to look at the pinch points to make sure we're not missing something.","We consider ourselves very good operating people, but having a different perspective is something is very valuable. And that's why we brought in somebody to look at this and that's under way. Again, we will review that with the Board, the Board wants engagement in this and we're going to make sure that we take a hard look at that with the Board in early February. We're also looking at the capital structure, we're looking at our capital allocation, where we see spending money, the next couple of years, how much we see in acquisitions, how much we see going back at dividends, how much we see going back in share repurchase, how much we see going back into capital spending.","Again, we're looking at where we're going to spend the money, as we go forward here. I know that we're going to put more money into capital as we rebase some of our cost structure. I also know that we will continue to drive operating cash flow and free cash flow, which will allow us to increase our dividend, as we drive down toward 45% of dividend payout versus free cash flow. We're at 50% this year and we want to get back down to 45% level. And finally, we'll take a look at all of the portfolio of Emerson, what assets makes sense, what asset don't make sense, what we can do if anything, what we can do with some of these assets, some of the businesses. This is something we do all the time, but we really put a little bit more effort into it.","We like to look at this, especially when we go into a downturn allows us a remix and it also allows us to have a chance to say, where do we want to invest from an acquisition standpoint. So everything's on the table. We had a two-day Board meeting this week on Monday and Tuesday, and we're looking forward to sharing a lot of the insights with the shareholders in our February Investor Conference, which is I think February 13th in the New York City at the famous Stock Exchange, which everyone loves to go to, but it's a good price point from a standpoint of costs. And so that's why I'm looking at it from that perspective.","But I want to know -- let you know that the Board and the Senior Management are very focused on how we can drive improved profitability, improve profit margins and also drive growth. We're not walking away from growth. But we know we are facing a challenging market. I know the entire organization around the world is focused on that. We're also making the right investments for the next generation technology, the next-generation area that really will drive growth and we're getting ready for what I would say a bounce back in the marketplace when it does happen. In the meantime, we're very, very much focused on driving that value for our shareholders through that margin improvement, the cash flow, and we're very much focused on driving that cash and paying back more money to our shareholders in 2020.","Through the higher dividend increase of $0.04 this year, assuming we continue that and also share repurchase of $1.5 billion this year. So our forecast right now says we're paying back more money to our shareholders in 2020 and we are also looking to drive higher operating cash flow.","With that, I'm going to open the mic and allow first questions and we'll go from there. Thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question we have will come from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon. I wanted to say thanks to Tim for all the help over the past several years. In terms of maybe the first question, David. So there's been a lot of sort of back and forth between D.E Shaw and Emerson and we saw that press release this morning, how would you characterize where you stand vis-a-vis D.E. Shaw right now and also when you're thinking about the Board changes we saw the Mark playing announcement, should we expect further Board changes in the quarters ahead?","David Farr","Okay. Thank you very much. So what I'd like to do here is sort of deal with this issue right upfront here and then not have that question come out to me for the rest of the day. I want to focus on Emerson and what we're trying to do here. But first of all, we get input as you all know from every shareholder and it's been part of Emerson DNA for a long, long time. It's how we operate and the Board review announced in October was the combination of discussion with the Board over the last six months and the consistent with how Emerson addresses challenging macroeconomic slowdown.","The Board's decision was shaped by input from all our shareholders. That's why I went out and I asked so many of our shareholders. I talked to nearly 40% of our shareholders over the last two months. The Board members have joined me on several of these phone calls and meetings. It's important for them to hear it. The Board understands our strong position as a company and the Board supports that we have heard from our shareholders and the Board will continue to make the right decisions for the long-term for all of our shareholders. We appreciate your inputs,","as I said earlier from everybody that I've talked to, over the last 60 days. It is important that we -- the shareholders to know that we are in control of our own destiny here. We are in control of what needs to be done with our strategy. Now, as I look at what we announced this morning and with Mark -- what we have been looking at for the last couple of years is we have two Directors, who will be retiring in early 2021. The Board Corporate Governance Committee have been looking at candidates for quite some time. We've had two candidates that we've been working on. We had an input from a shareholder.","The Board took a look at it. He was a very interesting person from the standpoint, every Board member met this individual, went through a very rigorous process and we made the decision as a Board to move into the front line versus the other two candidates that we have at this point in time. Mark has unique skill sets. He has a unique experience in the industry. He took a company through a major repositioning effort or restructuring effort. He has enormous Board experience being on the Texas Instrument Board as a Lead Director. He has an interesting background also from a CFO standpoint. He is on the Board Legrand Platt, and he is on the Board of other companies, which really do bring value to us.","So, the Board made the decision that Mark fits exactly what we're looking for any moved to the front of queue and we brought him on. And from my perspective, at this point in time I think he's been a fantastic addition. Mark -- I've known Mark for several years and I'm looking forward to his inputs relative what's going on in the industry. And I think that obviously we listen to shareholders and we are totally in control of our destiny at this point in time. Our objective right now is to execute, execute around what I've been talking the Board about and what I've been talking to my shareholders about. We are in total control of our own destiny and I want to say, Mark, was a very good addition to our Board.","Don't be surprised if I don't add another Director in 2020, late 2020, because I do have this Director that will be retiring in late or early '21 and I need to make sure that I find a replacement for her, at the same time. I'm looking for a diverse candidate there and the Board is looking at that at the same time, so Julian, I appreciate that and I want you -- if you have another question, you might want to ask, go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Sure. Maybe looking at some of the other investor suggestions that have been floating around, I think on the portfolio you've made it clear that sort of many things are on the table, maybe on the restructuring aspect, how do you and the board think about balancing that need for cost efficiency against also the need to keep investing given a lot of changes that are going on in the automation world right now.","David Farr","It's a very important point for the Board at this point in time, the Board is very focused on trying to make sure that we're not jeopardizing the future of this company. We've done several large acquisitions in the last 2 or 3 years. We're taking -- we're taking a very strong focus on how we can integrate those businesses, how do we get our cost structure, improved there.","We're taking a hard look at the touch points between the corporate and the businesses and as I committed to the Board, both Bob and Lal had to commit to the Board yesterday because they asked the question, the same question is asked us how you making sure you're not jeopardizing the future of the Company, just because you're trying to get to the short-term type of goals.","That's not something Emerson does. We over the time has been a technology leader, we've been an industry leaders, the industry and we have not -- have no intention to damage that going forward and these guys talk later on, you can ask the same question, but these guys are very much focused on the key strategic areas we have opportunities in the size of the Company to take our cost down and do things better.","We have some excess facilities through acquisitions. We have a unique opportunity to do some best cost job moves by building some new facility. So, Julian, it's -- it's a very important issue for the Board, because they do not want to make sure that Dave Farr in his last two years, does things short-term orient and then hands it over to the next generation, say, oh, \"shit\" and so I guarantee. That's on the forefront of the Board and they will be challenging me, they'll be challenging Bob and Lal to make sure that they do that.","Bob, you guys want to say anything or Lal, you want to say anything along those lines.","Lal Karsanbhai","Yes, David, thank you. This is Lal Karsanbhai. We've been looking at this weaker environment for some time now in operating in a world that's changed since we last spoke in February. And we've been accelerating restructuring across the platform, as we executed to Q3 and Q4 and as we look at the opportunities today, we are focused around structure across the enterprise, we structure we're prioritizing enhancements in speed and execution.","And the key priority for my management team is around protecting our customer touch points and protecting our technology and that's how we're working around the opportunity.","David Farr","Bob, anything you want to add there?","Bob Sharp","Yes, I'd say -- Investor Call again in February, where we talk more. I'll show you several examples of programs will drive and we continue to drive both to expand the serve market we have and get growth and it is a challenging trade off when you get a situation like this , but we are continuing to fund those and from our restructuring and cost standpoint, we're very heavily focused on the gross profit side of things in the plants and product cost and such, so we're going to use that to also help fund some of the key sales programs.","David Farr","Yes. I think the important point Julian, anything else before I pass it on the next person.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe just one last one, you talked about slowing growth in North America, I think on Slide 6, just wondering if you could give a bit more update on within automation solution specifically is all the weakness in North America still focused on upstream and discrete or do you see it spreading.","David Farr","I'll let Lal answer that question, since he is an expert in this and I'm just a CEO.","Lal Karsanbhai","I got that. Thanks, David. Julian, the weakness that we experienced in the second quarter leading through the year on discrete continues and has continued through to the fourth quarter and then to what we currently see in the environment. Likewise, we continue to see stresses around the upstream and midstream, oil and gas value chain in North America with very little spending and more acceleration of spending in the, in those markets. I have not yet seen a broader slowdown in process, particularly resi relates to MRO spend. Having said that, the North America capital environment slowed down, it's been delayed, it's been impacted by the geopolitical and general economic situation.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much, Lal.","David Farr","Well, we should move forward who is up next.","Lal Karsanbhai","Thanks. Julian. Thank you.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question we have will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Mr. Tusa.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Just on the -- on the organic guidance, I mean you're starting the year up model was for the first quarter on organic your -- you know negative two to positive, I would think in climate at some point in the next, I don't know like 10 quarters you guys will have somewhat of an easy comp, at some stage of the game. What is really bugging you within Automation Solutions , especially given you have, I mean it is process, it's kind of a backlog related business and you should, the MRO business shouldn't be that the lack of visibility there shouldn't be that. What exactly is the driver that kind of gets you to below the flat line for the year on organic.","David Farr","I think -- see, it's a fair question, given where we are in the -- from the backlog standpoint, in the order plan standpoint. I'll give you my perspective and let Lal and Bob give you two seconds on this too. From my perspective, what's scaring me is I look at the last couple of months starting -- I started talking about concern about 2019, late 2019, early 2000, back back in April, but in the last two or three months, I've seen the global GFI numbers really roll off and when I see a number that goes now GFI forecast for 2020 drop now below 1%, it scares me from the standpoint, okay guys.","At the current pace, we see maybe says it doesn't do that, maybe should be better than that as you say, but I'm more concerned about the fact that the trend line between the geopolitical, the tariffs, the trade all these different discussions right now are driving this much weaker gross fixed investment number. When I see a number go below one, historically, we move really quickly toward a zero or a negative number on underlying sales, so what -- so from my perspective, what I'm doing right now is say guys, we are driving to zero or negative number underlying growth.","I understand there's investment opportunities out there, but we've got to figure out how to get the cost structure set at that zero standpoint Steve, because I'm concerned, that's something is going to happen here from an election standpoint or Europe or something happens in the Middle East and the GFI forecast numbers are really going to happen. If that happens, we are going to be looking at a very low growth.","So I would say I'm being driven by that caution and I think that until we see that catalysts that drives that back up, you're right It should be from a catalytic standpoint, at some point a balance. But I'm not willing to say we're going to see that balance yet until I start sensing, the underlying economic numbers get better or stabilize. I don't see that yet. So that's where it's coming from.","Steve Tusa","At the low end of that range, what does that imply for your short cycle discrete business, which I would assume is going to be the the leader of that kind of negative view in the context of your other businesses, what are kind of low end of declines in discrete?","David Farr","Lal, go ahead.","Lal Karsanbhai","Yes. On the broader -- on the broader process of the issue.","David Farr","Yes and don't forget the discrete question.","Lal Karsanbhai","I'll come back to that. Steve, the capital discipline that we see out there the spending disciplines, the way our customers are looking at where they put that dollar today is where we've got to really assess how that looks goes forward. We've seen that slowdown in North America in oil and gas. We've seen in the discrete globally.","I have not seen and likely will not see tied to this economic cycle of turning the discrete markets as you -- closely tied to GDP and GFI trends and we are yet to see a recovery across the broad, discrete markets, whether that's automotive, semiconductor, packaging, textiles, et cetera. And I don't foresee that coming back. So as I think about discrete in that mix, it's somewhere in the mid-single digit negative at the low end of the forecast.","Steve Tusa","Okay. That's great. I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.","David Farr","Okay. Anything you want anything from Bob. Anything want to ask Bob on?","Steve Tusa","I'll just pick few questions. I'll leave it there.","David Farr","Bob will make a statement here then. Since you won't ask him a question, Bob, once you can make a comment because Tusa doesn't like you enough.","Bob Sharp","Well, I would just say I think you know that of my order visibility gives me about 12 to 14 days of outlook and so it's hard to see beyond that. Challenge right now is the softness is just so widespread whether it's general, industrial, commercial AC's pretty weak right now, cold chain is you watch the industry numbers right now, they are challenging. So it's hard to build a 2020 plan right now on the recovery of any sort, if it happens, that will be great. If it doesn't, what we're dialing in to do is improve margin without the growth and that's where all the focus is right now.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Steve. I appreciate. Who's next.","Operator","Yes, sir. That question will come from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So maybe just starting with a follow-on on the restructuring Slide. Let's say we do get like $200 million to $300 million cost of restructuring framework, should we think about that product like mostly dropping to the bottom line or would there be offset kind of going back to Julien's question, but in a little bit more detail.","David Farr","It's going to be, from our standpoint, typically what we're trying to target here, based on the final numbers, we're trying to get back to a record level of EBIT, which was a little bit over 19%. We're trying to get back to our record level. EBITDA, which was around 22.3 and 22.4. So some of the investment will be longer term, the payback of a little longer, but I think that what we're looking at is a mixture of the long-term impact of short-term impact allow us to drive that profitability back those peak level margins with very moderate growth of underlying sales.","So I would say that historically when we look at it, we get back a dollar per dollar, it may be over or 18 months period. But it's typically a dollar for dollar and we'll let you know as we lay this out, there are going to be some capital investments, which will be a little longer because we're going to -- we need to build some best cost facilities as we consolidate some our manufacturing and that will be a little bit different payback. But it's definitely, we still always look for dollar plus for that type of investment and that's what we're seeing right now.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks. And then just one on the first quarter. Just if you could talk a little bit about what you're embedding in that $0.02 of operational performance accretion maybe like looking at underlying sales growth and expectations for margins in 1Q.","David Farr","Yes. So we're looking at basically about 1% underlying sales growth and we're looking at probably a couple of 10th operational margin improvement. The key issue here though is now that does include the 70 -- we're banking on a recovery on the cost investments for acceleration within the fourth quarter, if we get a decent mix, in different growth, hopefully, we'll have a little bit better margin improvement there , but in reality what we're really trying to get geared up for right now Nicole is we're trying to get the -- so it's fast and the cost reduction is done in this first fiscal quarter that's why we're trying to do $70 million, which will allow us to start getting some margin improvement underlying, as we get into that second and third quarter. So we're trying to get this game going faster. I think right now we're ahead of the wave. And I'd like to get a little bit further ahead of the wave and that's how you should feel about us right now.","Nicole DeBlase","Got it. Thanks. I'll pass along to someone else.","David Farr","Thank you very much Nicole. Hope to see you soon.","Operator","And next we have John Walsh of Credit Suisse.","John Walsh","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Walsh","I guess maybe a clarifying question first, so the $70 million of restructuring in the first quarter, is there any benefit associated from that restructuring in the current guidance construct of '20?","David Farr","No. So what we've built in is no, no benefit improvements on acceleration of restructuring. So when we -- as we start doing this and we lay out the plan, we will tell you what benefit cost is going to be coming in for the cost structure and what benefit we'll get from profits in this year, because we will by getting going in the first quarter, like we are doing right now, both Bob's business and corporate Lal's business, we will get some benefit from incremental EBIT dollars this fiscal year.","And so that's why we're pushing really hard to get as much done as possible in this first quarter. If it gets tougher and tougher, go into second, third quarter. So that's why we're trying to front load as much as possible. So the answer is no, we have not booked at any cost nor the benefits, which there will be benefits.","John Walsh","Okay. And then looking at the free cash flow, I mean obviously there is some moving pieces on the EPS guide, but free cash flow of $2.5 billion came in line with us in the street, I mean can you talk about some of the levers you have to pull to drive that $2.5 billion of performance and then expectations for that to grow going forward from here, I know you mentioned some capital investments may be to drive the larger restructuring program there?","David Farr","So from the standpoint of this next 12 months, I think the best lever we have is from an operational standpoint, can we get our inventory back. I think our inventory has a room to come down a little bit in 2020, as we slowed in the sales growth and our inventory levels did not come down as much as I thought they did do pretty well.","But they didn't come down as much, so I think we still have up to a $100 million inventory, we can get out of the Company in 2020. As you go forward, the key issue that is going to drive this is a continued working capital performance in Lal's business, as he continues to integrate his two recent big acquisitions. I think Bob's business is running pretty well tightly right now. I think you guys Tools business running pretty well to the first 12 months and then obviously if we drive our profit, profit drives that cash flow. So we're trying to drive free cash flow level back up, because what we're trying to get back to is, we're trying to get back to that $4 billion operating cash flow, which allows us to get spend the capital that we need up to $675 million to $700 million.","We will be also altering our capital spend as we get to understand the restructuring programs, we may have to spend a little bit more than $600 million, which is embedded in that forecast, we may have to spend $6.25 million, but we're also going to keep trying to push the operating cash flow, because I really do want to get our free cash flow to dividend payout back down toward 48, 47 as soon as possible in 2020 or early '21 and so there is a lot of things going on right now, but we're very focused on that cash because we know that's how we drive value.","John Walsh","Great. Thank you for the color. And thank you to Tim, for all the help.","David Farr","He been a decent guy. I tell you what we're going to find a good job for him. He has really done a yeoman's job the last 60 days and fortunately we'll -- I think well I've find a really good job to recast his skills. You can work out in the gym or something like that. Thanks, John.","Operator","Next to have Andrew Obin of Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Andrew. I would say the gentle at this end is very loosely described, so you know, we're from the Midwest. I wouldn't call it gentlemen in the Midwest.","Andrew Obin","Alright, well, first, I do want to thank Tim for all the help. And I do have a question for Mr. Sharp.","Bob Sharp","You still in Suzhou or have you left the property? You're in China?","Andrew Obin","I am in China. Yes. Yes I am. We're very exciting.","David Farr","What city you're in?","Andrew Obin","I was in Shanghai yesterday, seeing our guys.","David Farr","Okay. Good.","Andrew Obin","Yesterday my time.","David Farr","Okay.","Andrew Obin","A just a question on lower end of CNRF guidance, what kind of macro scenarios and maybe we can walk what's happening in North America and Asia, would it take for you to sort of hit the lower end of your guidance, because you know comp seem to be fairly easy in Asia and to Steve Tusa's point that North American comps are not that hard either.","Bob Sharp","I think to hit the lower end of the scenario, Asia would have to keep going down and it's a little bit hard to tell right now. So I think you're getting a good read right now in the market, it doesn't feel like that's going to happen, but it's really hard to tell right now , month-to-month. And U.S. would have to we will be very difficult and that would probably be the broader industrial kind of a picture hitting the Pro Tools business, the commercial. It will be something more than just like a residential thing.","Andrew Obin","Got you. Thank you. And then question for Lal, just a couple of details, A do you include, have you gotten orders. I know that the Saudi facility wasn't Emerson facility, how much of the impact of the repairs was in Q4 and how much if any work you got for first half of next year and the second question, I think there was some talk about sort of a large, like there'll be one order slipping from Q4 into Q1. Is that correct. And are we going to see sort of any recovery from Q4 and Q1 or it's just steady rate from Q4 to Q1 on Automation Solutions?","Lal Karsanbhai","Sure, Andrew. So the Saudi facility was largely -- is largely and Emerson facility, both from a control system perspective instrumentation and valves, we saw repair activity, replacement activity through Q4 as the facility came back online very quickly within four weeks the facilities essentially back online. And, but the volume that we took in terms of our equipment to get it back online was not material to the quarter. Having said that, the modernizations that are going to have to take place within app CAG and their sister facility to get that facility modernized and safe with redundancies will have an impact to us. Those projects and are fully defined yet, Andrew, as we've gone through.","David Farr","There is still got be multi-million dollar.","Andrew Obin","You're going to be very large. As far as the KOB one order that slipped, we had talked about one specifically, we're still working that, it's very much in the work site. I'm trying to close it here with a team in Asia, Jamie in that team, here in November, it may slip into the very much outlooks into Q1.","David Farr","So, it did not happen -- still trying to get it. You'll see it, because it'll be a big order and pop.","Andrew Obin","Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.","David Farr","Again, gentlemen.","Andrew Obin","I'll still call you gentleman.","David Farr","Yes. Be safe. I know you're just a -- you're gentleman yourself, you be safe and get back to States soon. Okay.","Andrew Obin","Thanks.","Operator","Next we have, excuse me, Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you, Tim. Welcome, Pete.","David Farr","Your not in China, are you Joe? You not in China, are you?","Joe Ritchie","I am not. Nope. I'm in New York City. I think, I mean, just kind of sometime soon. So, but maybe just talk in China for a second and this potential trade impact Our guys have been writing about peak trade pain today and basically that being behind us. If we get, if we get -- if we move forward in sign Phase 1, how long do you think it will take to kind of rekick-start the CapEx engine to start seeing a little bit better growth rates across your business Dave?","David Farr","I think that I'll just take Bob's business first. I think there'll be a fairly positive impact pretty quickly for Bob just from a spending attitude standpoint. So I think that you would see a good business bounce in China. Bob has a lot of business in China, he is very strong there. So I think that way probably within a couple of months, I would say would bounce pretty quickly for him. The capital side, I think the CEOs would start, I would say within a quarter they start reevaluating. I think you start seeing some incremental spending starting to flow, a lot of work has been done, I mean, as you well know, Joe, we -- our book but not entered now our one but not numbers, how big Lal?","Lal Karsanbhai","Over $1 billion.","David Farr","Over $1 billion. So a lot of those projects are based around our China export type of market. And so I think that you would see some of those move pretty quickly. So I think that both Bob's and Lal's business would see a pretty good balance, we're obviously not assuming that right now because there is lot of uncertainty, but that would be one that would be the catalyst, as I said, that would create that second half recovery that would change us obviously to the plus two type of range and higher from that perspective, but I now be nice to see. In the meantime, we're focused on their cost. That's a good positive that would happen. The channel would move quickly as Bob said.","Joe Ritchie","I guess, Dave, then in that context, right, you guys have said call it like a flat guide for the year, your order trends are maybe kind of slightly above that, I guess in what scenario do things kind of get worse from where we are today?","David Farr","The scenario worse is that going back to my GFI numbers so that if this -- if we do not get an agreement with some improvement to get that, that tension out between the U.S. and China and it keeps grinding, I think you're going to see CEO's really continue to the curtail spending and that would drive obviously the GFI number down that would hurt us in the day-to-day spending. The other thing that would also that I'm really concerned about is the European economy does not see a recovery and the actions are trying to do with the new European leadership to try to get spending and investment going if this thing is still malaise in Europe that's a concern that we've built into that thing.","So that's we -- we don't see the catalyst yet that being triggered. We know what they are, but we don't see them being triggered if you're right Joe and what you guys are talking about and that we do see some realistic change in the discussions between the U.S. and China, we do get some realistic movement coming in Europe. That will be two positive catalysts that would change the momentum of the curve and move it upwards and obviously move that thing from zero to a positive number in growing from there. But until we see that, I mean, I want my guys to focus on getting the cost down and if we get it down fast enough and this recovery happens, then obviously we'll make pretty good leverage.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That makes sense and maybe just one quick one for Bob. Bob and just thinking through the margin profile this quarter in your business, can you just kind of parse out what really drove the decrementals margins this quarter? What were kind of the key drivers among mixed pricing, what affected the business this quarter?","Bob Sharp","Right. Price-cost was positive for us as it was in the second half, turned a lot through the year. The deleverage of the sales and then with that you get some plant issues around productivity and turnover and stuff when you don't have the growth to work off of gets compounded as part of it and then as Tim said, for mix, Resi versus Commercial and AC and cold chain, the transport and some of the more profitable retail was off against other things. And then on the Pro Tools and the disclosures in the tools area very high margin product.","So it was -- a number of things kind of lined up in the wrong side of mix in the quarter in the. We don't -- we don't see that as any particular long-term trend or something like that, it's just sometimes the stars align and sometimes things work against us in this quarter was just bad -- things just did not line up well at all.","Joe Ritchie","Got you. Thank you all.","David Farr","Yes. Take care. Hope to see you soon.","Operator","Next we have Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Dave, so when you look at Asia, Middle East, Africa Automation Solutions, the growth was 10% in Q4, which did accelerate versus Q3. You mentioned it briefly, but it does seem like it reaccelerated here, so what new markets are contributing to the reacceleration and is your confidence level increasing that China is still going to grow 5% to 8% or 6% to 8% in FY '20 in Automation Solutions.","David Farr","I think that from our perspective we saw some, some very good international growth in late in the second half of the year, as it was really good to see. I think the opportunities in China are pretty still significant, as they continue to invest in technologies in areas that are allowing them to become more self-efficient. They are clearly investing in next generation digital technologies and so we're seeing that, that's a positive.","So we had a very good year last year and the year before in China, and so I think that we still feel very confident we're going to see sales in the orders in this 5% to 10% range. So, I think we still see that, now going back to I think Joe's questions if we did get some kind of settlement and the relationships did improve, I think that will be a big positive to us, because of our presence in the quick investment opportunity, but we've got to see that, because it's just something, it's soured and we need to obviously fix that relationship.","If you look at the Middle East, I think the Middle East has huge opportunities, what concerns me about the Middle East is primarily is the fact that the geopolitical the turmoil, the other actions that are going on there, I wouldn't call it war, but the skirmishes that are going on and so I'm very concerned about this period right now and that's why I'm probably more cautious than the average person relative to the Middle East, because I'm really concerned about all the activity under way in the Middle East and the concern that I have around, as that disrupt the projects and that standpoint.","Now, the bookings would say not, but I am a little bit concerned, so I'm little bit cautious in those two marketplaces and the other one I would say is Latin America. We've had a good run, and the question is, does the whole Argentina thing, the Brazilian thing and the lack of money, does that stall saw as we go into 2020. So, Lal, why don't you give your view of that.","Lal Karsanbhai","Yes. Thanks, David. The China team did a phenomenal job serving what is for us a larger than building dollar market with very relevant customers who are willing and using our technology today and they want the latest and greatest technology, whether it's digital transformation, control systems, final controlled or instrument devices. So phenomenal job by the team to drive mid to low teens type of growth in China this year.","And as David said, our expectation today given the environment is in that mid single-digit type of growth, 5 to 10 in that range would -- based on what we see in this space today. The only one I would add, David, I think you're right on, on the Middle East and Africa, I think Latin America is a concern right now given, the skirmishes and the unrest we have just basically across the continent. We had a phenomenal, a two-year run in Latin America and we're a little bit -- we're going to watch that one very carefully as we go forward.","David Farr","Good. Thanks.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks for that guys. And then just staying with China actually in the Asian heating and cooling market, it does seem like the issues there for you guys have dragged on a bit longer than you expected. Is there a competitive issue there at all? And then you do a much easier comparisons coming up in Q1 as I remember correctly, China, heating, cooling fell off quite significantly in Q1 of this year? So would you expect Asian sales to shift now to positive growth despite continuing with the markets?","Bob Sharp","Yes. It was improving. Like we said, it was down 30, actually in the first quarter last year and then it improved and getting pretty flat, but in Q4, it was down 9% again. So it's still been bouncing around a bit. We do have an easier comparison in Q1 October data point was solid. So you could see a scenario where China is positive in Q1. And again, the question is what kind of stability that has and keeps throughout the year is a little bit hard to tell right now.","David Farr","I mean it has not been a competitive issue. I think Bob...","Bob Sharp","Yes. Sorry, I missed that.","David Farr","It's they don't have the money.","Bob Sharp","The mix and from the standpoint of the driving right now with the commercial side of the business, it's frankly not Chinese competition. It's pretty specific competition that we know in quite in detail and we're doing well there, especially with some new 25 -- product layout and then our cold chain as well. So no, we don't see it as a competitive thing. Heating really fell away the heat pumps and stuff, there's still the green air policy and stuff like that, but I wouldn't say it was as actively being worked for a while, and as that funding and activity plays out, if that recovers, that's also a big part of the story.","David Farr","I think if you think back for the people on the phone and Andrew, you talk about, I think there are a couple of big wildcard you guys -- it's China clearly -- China could be a very strong play for both businesses this year, it could be a dud, but it could be a very positive. If there is -- if favorable discussions happen between the two Presidents of the country, and we do come to some kind of terms of initial phase agreement that would create a positive mode, both in China and also in the U.S. for us.","And so those are two wildcard that I see that had the biggest impact potential for us in the upside, as we look at the Company today and that's why we're trying to work as quickly as possible on the cost because if we get this thing gone, we can get that cost down, that'll be a nice bounce for us, but those are the two wild cards, you guys are focusing on pretty hard and the questions and I agree with you on both of them.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks guys. I appreciate it and Tim, appreciate all the help.","David Farr","Okay. Thank you, Andrew.","Operator","Next we have Robert McCarthy of Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks again.","David Farr","Did you ever get out of that taxi I saw in -- did you ever get out of that taxi?","Robert McCarthy","Eventually. Yes. Eventually, I did.","David Farr","You were banging the window and kept saying, help me, help me.","Robert McCarthy","Absolutely.","David Farr","You're from some place not from the East Coast, you can get confused.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. I just wanted to honor the quiet period. That's all. You look like you were in a hurry and you're wearing the suit and got yourself shaving, I do not know, you were looking little nervous.","David Farr","You got it.","Robert McCarthy","All right. Okay. In any event, thanks Tim for everything. Really appreciate it. I think a couple of questions. First, if Bob wouldn't mind just talking a little bit longer-term about the HVAC markets from what he is seeing, clearly at a competitor conference this week, some admittedly smaller cap players have been talking about perhaps a flattening out of trends, particularly in housing or housing related consumer replacement like HVAC water heaters et cetera, where you could be seeing some pronounced weakness that could point to kind of end or pause in the echo boom of housing that we saw in late 2000 timeframe.","I didn't know from what Bob seeing over the longer term and the installed base of what he deals with the players he serves, whether there is some concern that we could be seeing a longer-term secular step down and and what has been a very strong market over the past call it 10 years.","Bob Sharp","Yes. I'd say, I think for 2020, our outlook on the U.S. market is quite modest and in the commercial probably a little bit of different dynamics within the residential and the commercial side, you see it now, I think I just saw that were for last week, the average person hanging on their health 13 years now, so they're not turning over as much which triggers a lot of the remodels, and 80 or so percent of the HVAC sales are on replacement as opposed to the new stuff.","So on the housing starts has been lumbering along in the low-1's, and we don't really see anything different about that. On the replacement cycle..","David Farr","Yes. Let me give it. Bob, you know I've been involved in this business for longer than Bob has here. And I would say there are a couple of things going on. I think there is a fundamental flattening and one of my concerns is these guys have a deal in its issue, it's a cost of the new efficiency standards and the fact that people are now replace units or repair units versus replacement because to avoid the efficiencies change-ups in the price point of those units.","So this trend has been going on for some time. I personally believe and as Bob's company structure thing, I think this is going to continue. And there's not going to unit growth, you're going to be price growth as a dollar value to growth, and that's what we're going to see as you guys go forward with your new replacement and that's what's going to happen here is to make technology value play because I think the cost of the new efficiency units, the refrigerants are going up and it drives down the underlying unit volume and that's what we did see for quite some time.","And I think that's going to continue to your point.","Bob Sharp","As we move into the next refrigerant standards for 2023 with the '18 of the mildly flammable that's going to also require some mitigating stuff on the systems, because of the flammability and they'll probably prolong some of the place or...","David Farr","I think people are looking to replace and 20 years -- I think they're going to try to drive these units as long as possible. To your point, I think that's what's going to happen. I mean, between the refrigerants and efficiencies. I think people are going to drive a lot of the news, as long as possible and that's going to drive our unit. Therefore, you're going to make out and costing to make up and price points.","Robert McCarthy","Okay. Now, thank you for that color. That's very helpful. I think the only other question I would have is just in terms of the free cash flow, I think, if my math is correct, which is often wrong, we're talking about $4 of free cash flow for next year and from that standpoint, what do you think you can drive it in the out-years and obviously given what's occurred in terms of the global economic environment and other issues, I don't think we need to talk about the target of 450 in earnings per se for fiscal '21, whether that's on or off the table, I think more importantly, what could we be expecting to see in the kind of that free cash flow number in the out years? What do you think it could compound that and maybe, and maybe just talking to the segment leaders, what can they can kind of tweak up or control, whether it's through the continued Final Control and Valves integration or other parts of the business to improve cash going forward, so that you think you can continue to compound here and a pretty higher rate because a key differentiator to the story is clearly your free cash flow conversion.","David Farr","So I'm going to -- we're going to buy on the same because these are things that as we look at the profitability as we change in our capital mix, as we do the capital allocation, Rob as we look at the capital investments and the change in the structure of the Company that's going to have an altering to the free cash flow. So we'll make sure that we will cover that at the February meeting because that is one of our objectives can we -- we as a company has always been a very good cash flow generator.","The question is, as we drive our margins as we rebase and we look at excess capital employed in the Company, we take that out, can we make that capital, our cash flow number even better. So I'm going to push on that until we finish our work here, because that's one of the outcomes of the work we're doing and that is clearly one of our objectives because we believe strongly cash will drive the value of our company and also allows us to give money back to our shareholders.","Robert McCarthy","I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Rob. All the best to you. Be safe.","Operator","And next we have Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Hey Jeff. Are you in some place. Please tells you're in China, you're in Antarctica, where are you?","Jeff Sprague","I mean the city that works, Stamford, Connecticut.","David Farr","The city that taxes or did you work, I can't even say it's taxes or works -- go ahead. Go for it Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","All right. Two things. So Dave, the $0.08 of EPS growth for for 2020 of the operational improvement that's effectively I guess on zero organic growth. Right?","David Farr","Correct. Correct.","Jeff Sprague","So implicitly that's restructuring savings, so that $0.08 is $65 million bucks or so is that carry over from 2019 actions you said earlier you have no benefit from Q1 in your guide, but it would seem like perhaps there is some restructuring coming through?","David Farr","Yes. That means there is a couple of things going on there. It does the carryover for the second half, because we accelerated restructuring in the second half of the year, that's helping us in a big way and will see that from the incremental margins. Two, the price cost has definitely helped us in this scenario, a little bit better, more favorable from a price cost that's helping us. And we clearly look at the different type of mix and we had some tough mix of second half, so we're basically we always go back to normal mix, we don't plan on same top mix. So I think that those are three things but clearly a biggest chunk of that would be the restructuring benefits we got from the acceleration from June, July, August, September and I would say that's the biggest benefit.","And then when we flow out the restructure in the first quarter, we'll tell you what that number is, we'll start laying out the benefits and you'll start seeing those incremental benefits come forward in the second half of 2020.","Jeff Sprague","But what should we expect Dave, you haven't put them in your guide, but there should be some payback from that $70 million and...","David Farr","Yes. There is going to be -- Yes. There will be some payback and I mean I don't think it's going to dollar for dollar because it's -- because we are not going full year, but I would say at least $0.50 per dollar would be estimate right now in this year.","Jeff Sprague","And then, just thinking -- right in this year. And then just thinking about what we might hear in February. So it sounds like you have full Board approval for this restructuring right you -- you know what you need to do. You're going to do $70 million in the first quarter, that's, call it 30% of a grand total of $250 million or so. So you're coming out of the gate with apparently Board approval and company buy in on the whole restructuring so putting aside kind of portfolio questions, I mean, is there some further deeper discussion on cost or other metrics or regardless of the portfolio changes or not, this is -- this is the restructuring number?","David Farr","So I do not have full Board approval yet on everything we're trying to do what I told the Board is that we are still working, the broad plans at each of the businesses are that first passes. I also have some initial work looking at from the corporate standpoint and what we can do at the corporate, but it's not done yet. So what we -- what I told the Board is there is $70 million of activity, we can do pretty quickly this quarter and I want to get on with it and they need a trust me as a longtime CEO as a leader of this company that we are not doing things that are damaging the Company, going back to what the earlier question.","So I do not have full Board approval on the total plan, but what I push these guys pretty hard is what can we get done in the first couple of months of this year to really gives us some headroom and some flexibility if things get sloppy. And so that's what the $70 million is and you're right, I push pretty hard, but the Board does trust me that I'm not going to do some stupid and then they'll see the whole review of all the plans as we go forward here. So they have not approved it, they is allowed me to take a big jump and jump on the first start here based on my credibility and leadership of running Emerson for the last 19 plus years. So that's what it looks like Jeff.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. So that makes sense. And so that would then mean that if you do the -- the full $250 million or $300 million, there is a heavier structural lift that these actions would clearly carry into 2021, you would not be able to get all that stuff, started in 2020.","David Farr","What the stuff I'm doing -- the stuff up front right now are very quick. These are very quick actions both Bob, Lal, and we are corporate doing. So the stuff that we're trying to do right now, it will be quicker and faster payback and the really structural things will take longer in the second half of the year and more into '21. So you saw what I -- what I ask the guys is find me the things that we could get on to very quickly that we -- that make a lot of sense from that we would do normally, but let's go as quickly as possible and it gives me some time to deal with the longer structural issues and how we go about looking at that. We want to prove -- I want the Board approval on those things.","And so I think that's how we're looking at it for the first 3, 4, 5 months, I'm looking at quick things we can do by going after on the quick cost structures, which don't really take a lot of of a Board approval process from the standpoint of going forward. So that's what we're look at. I'm trying to get things quicker that give us a little headroom, from the standpoint of what's going on in the economy.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thanks for the color and good luck.","David Farr","All the best to you. Thank you very much, Jeff.","Operator","Next we have Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","David Farr","Hi, Josh, you're going to be my last guy here and I apologize everybody else, but you know I have the longer questions, I have more people on the phone today, so I apologize that I will work very, very hard to get the rest of people next time or working around, but we've been already past an hour and 20 minutes.","So, but I want Josh, you got your three questions. Take your time. Your closing it . You're staying between all of us from getting a drink. Don't screw it up now. Come on.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Well, I'd have more time if Rob McCarthy wasn't such a storyteller, but we'll If you say anyway.","Just on the restructuring, if you could kind of help us with maybe the framework that you're adopting or as you're bring in some of these external folks to work -- to look at the organization, is it more kind of looking at some of the structural costs, things like G&A, where maybe there duplicate functions or is it more on trying to benchmark businesses to say like Final Control could take it to the next level, we can compare that to a competitor or something like that. Is there a specific track that this is going down or is it a little bit of all the above?","David Farr","It's more of we're looking at G&A expenses that may be that we don't need to do and we have duplication. We're looking at things that both the two businesses do and the corporate do are the things that we do from a frequency standpoint and in the process, we're sort of overdoing them and maybe we're spending a little bit more money, as we shrunk the Company into two platforms and we trade off back and forth, where could we go after from a G&A standpoint.","The structure stuff that we're working on very much is around the structure between the individual businesses, our facilities and maybe where we have too much capacity to make facilities or maybe where we have too much overlap from an organization standpoint, we may want to put organizations together. So we're looking at more of a structural from that perspective. And then we're looking at the cost structures in between all the G&As benchmarking, what we do as a company and what other companies do.","And we make sure that we are -- we consider ourselves best in class. But are we doing things too much and can we look at cost, we can take out. I mean, fundamentally we run very high levels of profitability as I pointed out, but I think we can run higher levels of profitability and how do we make sure we do that without jeopardizing the control and the discipline, our planning process in the credit billion and that we have as a company. So, those are things we're looking at, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That's helpful. And then shifting over to the demand side. And Dave, the last time we had a slowdown, you had a big set of customers in oil and gas to kind of learn capital discipline for the first time. So maybe there are levers that got pulled that wouldn't get pulled again, how would you compare some of the decisions are customers are making around timing are curtailing spending and kind of how rational those seem in the current environment or how sustainable some of those decisions are?","David Farr","Well, first, Josh, this cycle just barely got started and I don't think there has been any level of excess spending or capital that we've seen. From my perspective, I think they've been very rational, what they're doing right now is they're spending more money on short-term paybacks, you saw the KOB 3 to KOB 2. So I think there's a lot more discipline within this segment, I'll let Lal talk here in a second.","But I think it's a better process for us and if they get some clarity around what's going to happen in China, some clarity what the -- let's say the trade discussions are going to be, I think you'll see some of that capital flow out and I know they have pressures on them relative to their capital allocation, but I also think they have the capital flexibility to invest for the future and so I think the disciplined standpoint has been much better here in the last 2 or 3 years and this cycle has been truncated and pushed down and I think it could pop back up in a nice way. So, Lal, anything you want to add there?","Lal Karsanbhai","No. I think that's well said David. The discipline around the capital is there, the discipline around the operational dollars there as well. But ultimately the plants have to run safely, the fuels have to run safely, and there is a degree of investment that goes along with that and $118 billion type of installed base that we do have leads us to gain -- continue to gain customer relevance and trust as we go through the slower periods of time.","David Farr","I want to thank everybody. Tim is not going to go away. He'll be still with us. I think he'll still be with us in early February. He may be in a transition mode, but he is not going anywhere anytime soon. So, you guys at least have a chance to be nice to him one more time. I wouldn't overdo it, but I appreciate everyone's -- I appreciate everyone's patience and I also want to thank all my shareholders and the sell side analysts for giving me the time to talk about issues what's going on, what you think about the Company and what the Board should be thinking about those are very, very important inputs to us and the Board truly appreciate them, and they were summarized by Tim, Mark, and myself and they got them, and they read them. And I want to thank everybody and I will look forward to seeing you guys real soon. Thank you. Bye.","Operator","And we thank you sir also and to the rest of the management team for your time today.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Reeves","Thank you very much, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Bob Sharp, Executive President, Commercial & Residential Solutions; and Lal Karsanbhai, Executive President, Automation Solutions.","Welcome to Emerson's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start with the second quarter summary on slide 3.","Sales in the quarter of $4.6 billion increased 8%, with underlying sales up 4%. Automation Solutions was up 7% underlying with broadly, healthy and stable trends in most markets. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were flat as strong North American HVAC markets were offset by a decline in Asia and the Middle East, and the impact of distributor inventory destocking and slower consumer and certain other residential markets.","Trailing three-month underlying orders growth remained in the 5% to 10% range in the first two months of the quarter and moderated to 4% in March. GAAP earnings per share was at $0.84, up 11%. In the first half, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders and completed our $1 billion 2019 share repurchase target.","Turning to slide 4, second quarter gross margin was down 70 basis points and EBIT margin was down 50 basis points. EBIT margin was up 50 basis points excluding the Aventics, Tools & Test and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. Tax rate of 22.3% benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter.","Slide 5: Second quarter underlying sales growth was led by the Americas, up 7% with solid growth at both platforms. This result, while strong, was approximately 2 points lower than we expected due to moderating upstream oil and gas demand and the slowdown in global discrete automation market. Europe growth was stable across both platforms and Q2 marked the fourth quarter of steady growth at Automation Solutions in Europe and the 10th quarter for Commercial & Residential Solutions in Europe.","The Asia, Middle East and Africa was flat and was also approximately 2 points lower than we expected due to the Commercial & Residential Solutions climate business, which improved in line with our expectations in China, but was slower in Southeast Asia and the Middle East.","Turning to slide 6. Total segment margin was down 160 basis points and was down 70 basis points excluding recent acquisitions. This was below our expectations, primarily due to slower-than-expected sales. And we are taking actions to adjust investment spending and cost structure to deliver strong leverage on growth in the second half. Capital expenditures were up as we made progress on previously announced facility expansions and upgrades in our climate technologies, final control and measurement and analytical instrumentation businesses in the U.S., China and Southeast Asia.","Because of these expansions, CapEx spending in 2019 is more first half weighted compared to 2018. Our full year CapEx expectation is unchanged at $650 million. Trade working capital improved 20 basis points, driven by receivables and payables performance.","Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions' underlying sales was up 9% in the quarter and up 7% on an underlying basis. March trailing three-month underlying orders were up 7% and backlog continued steady growth driven by long cycle project wins.","Underlying sales trends in the quarter remained broadly stable as follows. Strong demand continued across our three kinds of business; MRO spending, brownfield, and greenfield projects. All world areas remained positive and growth continued across our world areas stably.","We continue to see healthy progress in our long cycle project outlook, a strong project funnel, steady orders conversion, and a growing backlog. There were two key areas that missed our expectations and primarily impacted growth in North America. First, upstream oil and gas was slower as Permian customers pause to assess full year investment plans in light of oil price volatility late last year and development in the Bakken region was somewhat delayed due to unfavorable weather. We expect growth to recover modestly in these regions through the second half.","And secondly, global discrete manufacturing end markets were slower. The impact of this was exacerbated in the U.S. by some rebalancing of channel and inventory from last year's tariff impact and price increases.","For the full year, we are lowering the high end of Automation Solutions expected underlying sales range from 5% to 8% to 5% to 7% which embed somewhat slower second half growth in North America and softer global discrete markets.","For North America, we expect to low single-digit growth in Q3 and mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter supported by improving takeaway capacity in shale regions and stronger growth in our long cycle businesses.","Segment margin decreased 90 basis points and was down 10 basis points excluding the Aventics and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. This result was below expectation due to timing of expected software-related revenue which we expect to largely recover in the second half of the year; the impact of foreign exchange losses recognized in the quarter; and slower than expected growth in North America.","We are adjusting our investment spending plans and accelerating some cost action to protect our full year profit margin and deliver incremental margin of 30% excluding the Aventics and GE deals. Full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 16.5% within the range discussed at our February investor conference.","Turning to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were flat in the quarter as were March trailing three-month underlying orders. North American residential and commercial air-conditioning markets were strong and our global professional tools markets were favorable.","These positives were somewhat offset by the impact of distributor inventory rebalancing and slower pace in certain consumer and residential market. We continue to see improvement in China through the quarter in line with the plan we discussed at our February investor conference.","However, Southeast Asia and Middle East markets were slower than expected, putting our expected Asia recovery two to three months behind plan. Given the slower than expected start to the year, we are lowering our 2019 underlying sales target to approximately 2% which embed second half underlying growth of 3% to 4%. Through the second half we expect China trends to continue to improve and markets across the rest of Asia to follow.","Margin decreased 150 basis points excluding the Tools & Test acquisition. Compared with the first quarter, price\/cost trended favorably and helped the business deliver over 40% sequential leverage on incremental sales in line with our expectations. We expect the price, cost tailwind and leverage on higher sales to drive strong sequential and year-over-year leverage in the second half. Full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 22%, consistent with the plan we laid out at our February investor conference.","Turning now to slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to reflect underlying sales growth of 4% to 5.5%, reflecting lower growth expectation for Automation Solutions in North America and for Commercial & Residential Solutions in Asia and the Middle East.","By quarter, we expect approximately 4.5% underlying growth in Q3 and 5.5% underlying growth in Q4. Modest acceleration in the fourth quarter growth reflects improvement in our Automation Solutions long cycle businesses and upstream markets in North America. The high end of the EPS guidance range has decreased $0.05 to $3.60 to $3.70 with Q3 at approximately $0.94 and Q4 approximately $1.13. We expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 23%.","Please turn to slide 10, which bridges our second half 2019 GAAP EPS guidance. In 2018 we had favorable discrete tax items in the second half, somewhat offset by $0.09 of one-time charges in Q4, 2018 including $0.06 of acquisition accounting charges and $0.03 of one-time 401(k) contribution charge. Together these items net to more than $0.20 headwinds in the second half.","Strong operational contribution is weighted toward the fourth quarter, and is supported by expected volume leverage, a strengthening price, cost tailwind, lapping of the section 301 tariffs impact and actions we are taking to right size investment plans and other spending.","Additionally we are increasing our full year restructuring spend to accelerate approximately $8 million of actions into the third quarter. Total 2019 restructuring has increased from $72 million to approximately $80 million and sets up a strong cost structure across both platforms in Q4 and heading into 2020.","We expect the fourth quarter to deliver particularly strong sequential and year-over-year operating leverage as the benefits from the price\/cost tailwind and reduced investment and discretionary spend build through the second half.","In the fourth quarter these items together with a modest benefit from aforementioned accelerated restructuring are expected to contribute $0.08 to $0.09 of operational EPS.","On the right we've shown our expected sequential profit cadence by business in Q3 and Q4, excluding recent acquisitions. Both businesses will deliver strong results, reflecting operational execution improving price, cost tailwinds and reduced investment spending.","Please turn to slide 11 and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Tim. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I truly appreciate it. As we look at what's happened in the second quarter and what's going on as we've seen the second half, we really want to make sure everyone understands what we've seen and where we're going to go.","Clearly, the cycle is still intact. We feel very strong about the cycle. But as I've said in February and I've said a couple of times as I've had investor meetings throughout the last several months the tapping of the brakes is truly happening in many of our marketplaces. We can feel it. However we've had to adjust to deal with that. As I look at the capital spending of our customers, it's still intact. We've been checking everyone's reported from a quarter standpoint and their capital allocation standpoint for the year and all their \u2013 in our discussions with the customers. They still have the capital program set in place, how they spend the timing, these things are moving, but they still feel very strongly about this cycle and I feel good about this cycle. Both Bob and Lal will comment on this as they go through their presentation, but thankfully we want to give you some insights about the Q2 and also what we see in the second half.","Before we talk a bit more, I do want to thank the global Emerson team. They worked hard through this quarter as we see in the quarter unfold, the shifting of the demands, the shifting of the sales and the actions necessary to deliver what we could deliver from a sales and profitability and cash flow.","It wasn't what we expected when I sat here on the phone in February and what we \u2013 and we talked in New York in February. Clearly, as Tim recognize, the U. S. was an area that we saw the weakness, in particular around Lal's business, which we'll give you some insights, but around the short-term oil and gas and also around the distribution.","Clearly, we underestimated the impact of distribution pipe being filled with price actions that unfolded in late 2018 from us and from other people, as we dealt with the tariffs, as we've dealt with the material inflation. Clearly, people decided to put the inventory in place, the voice on the pricing and then now have to work that off.","The timing of that work off is, I still has to be -- still has to unfold, we firmly believe they will be more closely aligned in early \u2013 our early fourth quarter or the early third quarter of the calendar year. In particularly around Lal's business. I'll let Lal talk about that.","In Bob's, business we talked, incrementally margins were key for Bob and he delivered that. And he delivered over 40% incrementally. The big issue we miss, and Bob will talk about that, really was around the Southeast Asia business -- I believe, in Southeast Asia and the Middle East business.","Yes, China was down. But I think we had that pretty well intact and really shaping, and Bob will talk further about that. But there are pockets of areas that we could not overcome and pockets of areas that we missed, but the tapping clearly happened.","We still feel that as we go through this third quarter, there is clearly, as I would say, we're going through two big mountains here. We're going through a gap right now and I still feel good about how come out of that gap. And that's why we give you very specific forecast around the quarters, as we see this mapping out.","We spent a lot of time -- I brought the teams in, both from the OCE in and then also Lal's team and Bob's team at the highest level and we sat down, we spent many, many hours several times. What's going on? What do we need to know?","What do we need to do adjusting and what do we have to do? We've also taken actions, both Lal's and Bob's business taken actions and ensure we deliver the profitability with the uncertainty in case business does not come back for the second half. How do we deliver that profit margins?","In addition, we've also increased our -- what I would call, restructuring charges. We're going to go after areas that we feel that we can integrate faster and with a slowdown in the decision and focus on the most profitably. Both Lal and Bob continue to look at areas and Lal in particularly has already accelerated some areas and a lot around acquisitions we've made in recent years.","A couple of callouts, I want to call out. And I want to from call of the Final Control. Final Control had a very strong second quarter, both in sales, profitability, bookings, cash flow. They've continued to outperform their key North America competitors.","Also I will make a special call out to my Latin America team, who I abused for a couple of years and for the second quarter they had double-digit over 10% plus growth, that\u2019s more than 10% growth across their business. That's very good. And I guarantee these guys are focused very hard in delivering that for the whole year and it's very, very important. As I look at the cost actions that these guys are undertaking, Lal's business still going to grow, very strongly. He's still going to grow 5%, 6%, 7%. I see Bob's business coming back in the second half. But clearly, that 3% to 5% range was what we thought it will be the whole year. But with the miss, in particular, around international, it's clear that's not going to happen with the whole year. But we want to make sure we have our cost aligned as we leave in this year and as we move into that second half \u2013 in the first half of 2020. And I applaud the guys for taking these actions and even when you're growing, we got to take these actions and make sure we do the right things as we focus on what's right for the long-term cost structure of this company.","From the cash flow, we had a good second quarter. I think our balance sheet, and Frank would agree with that, the balance sheet Frank talked about this at the Board today. We're in a very good shape with the balance sheet. I think our working capital, we got in line, after the first quarter, it\u2019s a little bit high, but we got it back in line. And I feel very good about the cash flow for the year. If the business slows down a little bit more, it's easier for us from a working capital standpoint, but obviously, we lose the earnings side of that. So I feel good about approximately $3.2 billion. I feel good about the free cash flow around $2.5 billion, which is very important to us as we look at the total company from a capital allocation standpoint.","But as we look at that second half of the year, I think we haven't focused right now what's going in the marketplace. I think we have a cost structure in place. I think feel that we -- the organization globally is focused very hard on delivering the second half. We had a good start with April. And if you look at order trend chart, from the standpoint, Bob's business kicked back up a little bit in April. He went positive on a three-month roll.","Lal's business, as we expected in April, dipped down a little bit further. We're still right in that range where we were in the March three-month roll. We firmly believe that as we look at this forecast, we will be back in the 5% to 7% range on three-month roll as we leave June, and that's key. And from the standpoint of positioning ourselves for a stronger fourth quarter, a couple of things happened. Obviously, easier comparisons, but clearly, we see the pace of business picking back up. And that's what you're going to obviously watch as we look at the order trends and we communicate to you on the order trend charts. And that's what's so good about us doing this from that perspective.","But I want to thank the organization out there. It was a quarter that unfolded a lot different than anyone thought. These guys reacted very quickly. As you know, I also referred to this, I have my hands in the reigns right now. I put the horse up a little bit. I got to reigns a little tighter and I think Bob and Lal are reacting, his team are reacting to that. And we have made commitment to the Board. We've made commitments to our shareholders. And we are focused very hard in committing that second half to below the year we laid out. And I want to thank everyone for doing that.","I'm going to turn it over to Bob to go first, and then Lal will follow and then we'll do a Q&A. But again, I want to thank everyone for joining us today and I look forward to the Q&A and talk about what's happening. So, Bob, it's all yours.","Bob Sharp","All right. Thanks, Dave. You saw the derby over the weekend, Dave pulled the reign, but the stayed in the lane as well. As you've seen, the March underlying was around flat as well as underlying with our expectation, which is in mid-February in the investor conference, we thought we'd be moving up by now. As you did see with the margins, we reacted quickly to that on the cost side and now we got the sales play out.","Two key indicators to really watch, especially this time of year in these conditions. USAC was very strong, as expected. And the China recovery is playing out as expected. I'll show you that in the next chart. The key challenges we had were, as Dave mentioned, the rest of Asia, which a lot of our customers in the rest of Asia are then selling to the Middle East and a lot of it Middle East oriented. Yes, it stayed down in the 15% kind of territory, which we were not looking for. And we have some pockets of weakness, as Dave mentioned. In addition to some of the discrete products, some of the U. S. consumer-oriented stuff, disposers backs, some thermal disc kind of general product clearly saw both some inventory destocking dynamics playing out as well as some weather impact. So, again, that's really kind of what played out in March real quickly against us.","April, as Dave mentioned, has ticked back to the positive. We continue to expect upward movement to support that 3% to 5% sales in the second half that we talked about as well.","We look at chart 13, again the China update specifically I showed last time the verticals between heating and cooling, coal chain and tools own products because there are very different dynamics playing out.","Starting from the bottom, Tools & Home Products, not a big business in Asia for us, but a solid amount especially of disposers and Ridge pro tools and you can see a very strong quarter 77% on top of a very big one in the first quarter.","Cold chain, a little lighter, but there is some volatility here as you can see by the way the quarters go and still staying solidly positive. And we continue to have a good outlook for cold chain in total in Asia, especially in China as we continue to do more and solutions activity.","And then Heating and Cooling which is the big trend line driver here. We mentioned it was down 40 plus percent in the first quarter improved to a 20% in the second quarter. And is on the trend we're looking for. So, China in total Q1 was down 30, Q2 was down 16%, and we do see this playing out into the positive in this quarter, in Q3, and then continuing to play out. Q4 is going to be largely driven by what happens with the heating activity that comes out and so we'll be watching that as well.","If you go to chart 14, if you look across the key verticals in the geographies, again, overall some really solid strength and we're confident about the second half. First of all, North America, again, good dynamic high single-digit sales in the quarter. You hear our customers speaking very positively about how things are going and how it looks. It's always weather-dependent, of course, in the summertime, but right now, it's looking very solid.","North America Cold Chain, there is a little mixed activity here and I think again when you start getting into the general industrial activity and destocking and stuff we see some of that. But overall, solid activity and some good uplift continues from some of the acquisitions we did, especially the Cargo and now the Cooper-Atkins acquisition.","Global ProTools had another very solid quarter very strong quarter on 5% underlying for sales. It's quite broad. Europe was up around 7% and you saw the China numbers reflected in tools and home products very good. And -- so overall -- again some weather in labor kind of impacts in the U.S. and we'll continue to watch the construction indicators certainly.","China, as I mentioned in the previous chart, Cold Chain Tools & Home Products continued strong. AC and heating -- and again, we -- this is the time of the year when the AC products are developing. Last year the customers -- our OEM customers bought into that because they expected very rapid activity once the season started. Frankly, they got stuck with some inventory when that happened when the market turned. So, they're being more shy about that.","I'll say it right now; their quotation activity is substantially higher for their customers right now. It's just that they're not going to release anything until they've got the clear signal from their customers. So, this also relates to their financing capability right now.","Outside of Asia, again, first half did not develop as we're looking for. We are looking for improving trends. We'd like to get even territory in the second half. But certainly the Middle East in particular has continued to have some challenges, partly probably because some of the dynamics, competitive dynamics that are playing out because of challenges elsewhere and people looking at new spaces.","Europe again continues on a steady growth for us. It continues to be a story of our good solutions activity and programs in what is otherwise a relatively low growth market in Europe with the some of the dynamics.","Latin America I'll give a shout out to Rafael and the team. They did double-digit this quarter. We always say we'll give them a shout out if they did that. And Canada also for us was double-digit in the quarter. So again we are watching very closely, especially rest of Asia and Middle East and some of this inventory activity. But even April has turned out in line or I'd say a little above our expectations in orders. So we're confident about how the second half is going to play out.","Profit as Dave mentioned has developed as we said it would. We got in this very quick around late February and March when we saw what was going on. We saw the sequential margin. We're going to see that again in the second half. And we have a rather healthy tailwind in the second half on price, cost, which gives us some confidence.","I'll turn it over to Lal now for Automation Solutions.","Lal Karsanbhai","Thanks, Bob. Good afternoon. Let's turn to slide 15. As David said earlier, the investment thesis in Automation Solutions has not changed and the cycle is intact. The long-term KOB1 greenfield opportunities in front of our business continue to be very robust.","We have, however, experienced a slowdown in our short cycle business in a couple of markets that I will discuss on the next chart. So on chart 15, the KOB1 greenfield project funnel remained strong. It has actually increased to $7.7 billion, an additional $100 million since we met in February. So very robust.","We have booked an additional $100 million since February for total booked of $450 million and have an additional $850 million committed to Emerson. The funnel remains relatively intact with very few minor movements related to timing. The bulk of the major international oil company projects are holding as evidenced in their affirmation of capital plans in this quarter's earnings announcements.","Let's turn to slide 16. There are two fundamental market changes that from what we discussed in February both impacting that short cycle business. The North America upstream oil and gas markets, and the global discrete industrial distribution market.","Let's first talk about upstream oil and gas in North America and it's really related to three areas. First is the Permian basin, in which we continue to see good, well drilling activity. However, the wells are being capped and not completed. It is in this completion process of that our instrumentation and equipment is utilized.","There are three reasons for this. One there was a pause given to lower oil prices, sub $45 in December; two, a lack of takeaway capacity. The current pipeline capacity utilization is running north of 96%. Although this has been an area of significant investment in the construction and expansion of two key pipelines, Sunrise and the EPI crude we'll take capacity utilization down to 88% by our Q4; and thirdly, consolidation of players. They are less independents and more of the integrated oil companies that have better capital management and cost controls.","The second area on upstream oil and gas is the Bakken field in North Dakota, which has suffered from a very difficult winter in the Northern Midwest in which very little new activity took place.","And thirdly, Western Canada, which have suffered from both political hesitation around oil and gas infrastructure investment and multinationals exiting. The U.S. refineries on the Gulf Coast need the Canadian heavy oil, but there's a little takeaway capacity to get it there. And today, predominantly rail is being used.","There are needs for pipeline such as the Keystone XL. However, none \u2013 there's doesn't seem to be a whole lot of movement on any of these. So I believe that the second half will be very positive, more positive in two out of these three regions, as majors continue to support investment and takeaway capacity issues are solved.","The second impact in the margin was the global manufacturing end markets that slowed and have negatively impacted the industrial discrete distribution channels. The slowdown is predominantly the automotive and the semiconductor sectors. And the channel took aggressive restocking actions in the first calendar quarter with concerns over tariffs and price increases in January.","This above -- what I call, above normal levels of inventory in the channel has extended the burn rate and resulted in slower-than-expected distribution activity, which we expect to recover in this current quarter. We believe the discrete distribution channels have started to stabilize. And as we went \u2013 as go through the quarter and expect a relatively more stable second half.","A quick comment on the other world areas. Europe is stabilizing from an Industrial Automation perspective and the process automation activity in Europe remained strong, driven by KOB 3. Asia continues to be very strong, including China and India. The Middle East and Africa orders are strong, although we do have a concern around sales conversion as customers have pushed back some deliveries on key projects that we have won. And then, as Bob and David alluded to earlier, Latin America is very strong, driven by Mexico, pipeline and terminal investment and Argentina shale gas in the fields.","Let's turn to slide 17. The first half growth was -- underlying growth was 7%, which is 1 to 2 points lower than we planned coming into the year, in which we assume the 7% to 8% for the year and are looking in the 6% to 7% band. The first half EBIT margins were 14.7%. We do maintain our guidance for the full year EBIT in the 16% to 17% band as discussed in New York City in February.","The second half improvement is supported by volume leverage, driven by three factors. One, our backlog has increased by $400 million since August of 2018. The volume will be driven by backlog conversion in our longer cycle businesses, Final Control and systems.","A number of positives in these longer cycle businesses will continue to benefit from -- that have continued to benefit from greenfield and modernization activity and grew orders in the first half. The systems business run by Jim Nyquist continues to win, with first half orders above 10%, driven by large KOB1 projects in Asia and the Middle East, modernizations and systems upgrades around the world and our modular control product families, the PK and the OCC controller have booked $120 million since launch. And year-to-date bookings represent an annualized run rate of $180 million.","The Final Control business also grew orders over 10% in the first half, led by Ram Krishnan and his team and continues to outperform. We continue to invest in key capacity regionalization in North America and Asia and global service center infrastructure.","The business is outpacing competition, as David mentioned. Our first half goal was 8 points greater than our largest North America competitor. Secondly, we have modest -- we see modest improvement in North America growth in the short cycle businesses, recovering upstream. Well completions as well as takeaway issues are solved and improved weather conditions in the Bakken. And thirdly, we say we expect a strong turnaround season in the North America refineries and petrochemical complexes.","From a P&L standpoint, price\/cost will be more a favorable tailwind in the second half of the year. Spending was originally geared at a higher growth level and our management teams around the world have responded quickly to reset priorities and cost structure and keeping us in the 16% to 17% EBIT band for 2019.","Three specific set of actions: Cost-containment actions across the business, managing the pace of the remaining investments for the year and pulling up approximately $6 million of incremental restructuring in response to two opportunities, more quickly integrating the recent acquisitions and rightsizing our cost structure for 2020.","On a positive note, we're happy with how April came in from an orders perspective and we believe we are well set here to deliver the second half. Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Lal. With that, I'd like to open the floor for Q&A and take some questions from the participant there.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question for today will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Joe. Good to hear from you.","Joe Ritchie","Yes, thanks for getting me on. So, I guess, my first question, Dave. Maybe provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the channel. We heard a little bit around channel inventories being built up in Cold Chain, discrete automation. I'm assuming on the upstream side as well. I just wanted to get a bit more color about where you think we stand on that specifically and what gives you the confidence that we're going to get through that in the next quarter or two?","David Farr","Yes. For the standpoint, when we say I think most of the channel relative to the short-term products via discrete automation are Bob's business or -- and Lal's business relative to some -- for the small instrumentation that go through a channel. From my perspective, it built up late last year, as the market -- as our customer base slowed down in the short term, they had a certain burn rate, which did not -- has not happened yet. As we look at this model and talking to the channel because we spent a lot of time now talking to the channel, it looks to me like this burn rate will be done by the end of our, what I would say our third quarter, which will be the second calendar quarter.","So it's going to help us more in the fourth quarter. I mean we do the projection. What we see from the standpoint of our order pace and the demand out there based on the inventories. It looks to me like there will be more in our fourth quarter -- or the third calendar quarter, and that's how we built this quarter out. Clearly, a lot of assumptions relative to the business environment, but that's what it looks like and we've gone out and done a lot of channel checking to make sure we understand that, both in the tools standpoint or the consumer side and Lal's businesses, as you look at the distribution channel here. So that's how we see it right now, Joe. And by the way, I want to make a call, out to you. Your report on HVAC, the report was very good. I think you and your team did a good job there. It would have been nice if you would to talk to us. But you did a very good job there. I do understand that market. I do understand that market a little bit, Joe. We're going to talk to you. We'll give you a call. I just had to take a shot. I had to take a shot, come on.","Joe Ritchie","Hey, look, I appreciate the positive feedback, Dave. If I could follow-on maybe just one follow-on question just on. Look, it sounds like the project funnel still remains a good. It sounds like you're winning some awards, KOB1 awards. I guess maybe talk to us a little bit about what\u2019s pricing been like on the project side? And then also, as you're thinking about kind of mix for the rest of this year and into next year, should we just expect the project mix to be coming through in a little bit of lower margin on the ANS side?","David Farr","I'll answer first, and I'll let Lal. It's a big issue right now because that's where we are. Our backlog has been building on the project. The price of the project hasn't really changed or hasn't been an increase or a decrease from the standpoint of a competition standpoint. It depends on what the project going after, is it Yokogawa, is it Honeywell, is it Rockwell, or is it the ABB.","So, from that perspective, it hasn't really changed. The projects, I would say, are starting to shift a month or two relative -- not awarding, but what I would say execution around the projects.","And what we're seeing right now with the buildup of the backlog, we're going to start seeing some initial phases of projects these guys won late last year, early this year, and that will start coming through in that fourth quarter.","So, as Lal looks at his mix in the fourth quarter, he's banking on some of the short cycle stuff coming back. He's got some project work coming in that will hurt his margins. But that's also why he's accelerated some of his cost actions. Because he sees that the growth wasn't there in the KOB 3 to cover the initial phase here. So, now he's got to get the cost structure right.","So, let me -- I think we're in good shape. I'll let Lal comment on that, but that's moving dynamic we have right now, ignoring the distribution side, how we play this out as we move forward. Lal, do you have anything you want to add?","Lal Karsanbhai","Yes, thanks David. I think nothing fundamentally changed around pricing and margin expectations on projects from what we discussed in February. Clearly, project margins are dilutive to a total, but that puts the emphasis on driving the KOB 2 and 3 and adjusting the cost structure.","The functionality of pricing is really around the number of jobs available in the market and the EPC capacity. And as we see that increase, we'll see less tension on pricing. But at this point, clearly, at the beginning of the way, midway through -- at the beginning of the way, I say you call it the pricing is aligned with expectation that we've had and planned.","David Farr","Yes, I think Joe, I think one of the key things that Lal -- I want to call out Lal and his CFO, Dave Baker have done a great job is a team of trying to lay out as the sales unfold, the next six or next two quarters, how does that mix change? And I think they've got -- I think right now I look at it and they've got it pretty well balanced.","Now, obviously, something can change the assumption. But they laid it all out and that's where the cost actions came from. We said we need a little coverage here and you need to get the costs out. In fact you need to get a little bit more than extra out in case things don't come in a distribution channel. So, that's how we -- and I give a really special callout. A quick work on this because this is a midstream change for us, but that's Emerson, that's what we do.","Lal Karsanbhai","And then if I may David, Joe, one additional point. We look at all these jobs. We look at our success rate probability, our intimacy with customers where we can best place our technology and gain share will be three opportunities. All those go into the decision factor and our competitiveness on these of each jobs.","David Farr","Yes, good. Thank you very much Joe. Take care. Look forward talking to you.","Joe Ritchie","Make sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question will be from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe a first question just around margins. Margins have been flat in both businesses for three or four years now if we include the 2019 guidance.","So I just wondered when you're looking out at those goals for 2021 if you thought there was a need for a lot more urgency around extra restructuring perhaps to push those margins up in the medium term. I noticed the restructuring had gone up I think $7 million or $8 million for the current year. But wondered if you were kind of dusting off more aggressive restructuring perhaps to make sure the margins can move up next year.","David Farr","At this point in time, Julian we're not -- we still firmly believe you can get back to that 19% top arrange. I think clearly we have a -- getting back for a full year into that 16% to 17% range. I'm assuming you talk about Automation Solutions here. That's going to be very key.","At this point in time, we're looking at that. But if we see things not progressing from a business standpoint or mix standpoint, we can -- we have actions out there we can go after. But at this point in time, we still feel pretty good about that and we're going to go with the Board in June over the strategy both -- over the next couple of years through 2021 for both businesses and the total company and that will push us again to see what kind of restructuring we need to have. But if we have to restructure to get the margin we'll do it.","So right now I don't think we\u2019ll see fundamental change. We'll just do a little bit more this year because of the mix change and the slowdown to growth and we got ahead of spending. And so acquisitions are no different. We knew acquisitions are coming. And so I think that right now we feel good about. But three or four months, we might change that course again. ","Julian Mitchell","Understood. And maybe just following up. You mentioned that positions there and you've mentioned several times in the prepared remarks accelerated integration particularly of the ones in Lal's business, but also perhaps Tools & Test in Bob's. Maybe just give an update. If you look across Aventics, Tools & Test, GE Intelligent Platforms, how happy are you right now with the organic growth in those businesses and that pace of acquisition integration? ","David Farr","Bob do you want to comment on that?","Bob Sharp","Yeah. Let me start with Tools & Test. We are very happy with the way things are playing out. We have the North America sales organization together between electrical and plumbing. We are working now on the European, bringing that business close together, which is also a very big piece of business for us that will be playing out soon.","From a cost standpoint, now obviously there was a lot of group cost, the Tools & Test had as a group and -- that we basically didn't even come with the business by the time we were done. We talked at the time about getting away from some of the noncore stuff communications business out in California, some hand tools stuff in China that frankly was losing a lot of money.","And there's another piece right now that's playing out. So I would say everything we identify there's opportunities. We are running ahead of that right now. I think I mentioned ProTools was around 5% underlying growth in this quarter. So we're happy with the way the growth is playing out. And it's really strengthened on both sides. A lot of cost improvement of the Tools & Test side and healthy sales activity on the Ridge side, which is a good combination with Ridge profitability.","David Farr","I think as I look at Mike, as we had organization session with them Julian, I like the progress \u2013 they\u2019re ahead of plan. I don't see any acquisitions in Bob's business right now, in the near term \u2013 outlook. We were out looking, I don\u2019t see anything at this point in time. But he's got his team very highly focused and there are also unique growth opportunities within his business. I feel good about that side.","Bob Sharp","Yeah. I'll comment on three deals actually. Aventics, very happy with Aventics, Julian. Significant integration effort by the -- our business unit with that reports in, Manish Bhandari leads that business for us. And clearly impacted by the distribution channel comments that I made earlier in \u2013 on chart 16, as that slowed up and that forced us to drive some of the integration a little bit harder. But a lot of good work there. And I believe a fundamental part for our fluid power business in that discrete space.","And second, Machine Automation Solutions. A lot of work there. We've touched the entire global channel over the last 90 days as we've gone around the world and net that very important channel for us. I've been personally engaged with the team twice. I took David to Charlottesville to engage with that team. And we are now exploring multiple synergies around the KOB 1 waves what we see around the world, where the PLC can come in and add value to our offering.","David Farr","I would say that, that business is growing, better profitability. It\u2019s coming really good..","Bob Sharp","It looks very good early. And then last, I'll just, again, I mentioned it earlier, but the work that Ram Krishnan and the team have done around the VMV&C is just phenomenal and well ahead add of our plan and it continues to outperform.","David Farr"," The acquisitions we're looking at in Lal's business right now are very much \u2013 we took one to the Board this morning. It's around software. And so, another software acquisition. We've done a couple already this year. So nothing big. But again, these are coming in and adding some opportunities for us.","But so far, the integration of the GE business is doing really well and especially with the timing of the OCC and the PKS our own PLC, which has actually taken off and we're starting to utilize them across the board. So -- and Julian, I'm very pleased right now. The guys got their work cut out for them. Clearly, the downturn in Europe and the distribution of discrete business, automotive was not a great timing for us. But we also step back and get a chance to do things faster, so they will bounce back. And so I feel good about them right now from that perspective.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you. And thanks for the extra color in the slides like chart 10.","David Farr","Well, we try to help you guys out, just to make sure that you clearly understand Emerson. I understand it. I just want to make sure that you guys understand it so...","Julian Mitchell","All right.","David Farr","Next.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon. And are you getting double time today, because you\u2019re in different time zone here, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Good morning to you. Money never sleeps, Dave. Money never sleeps.","David Farr","Well, that\u2019s got to be quote of the day. Money never sleeps. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.","Steve Tusa","But on this final one, it gets kind of silly to kind of delve into quotation activity and orders. And going back, you guys put the $850 million in kind of committed but not booked number in there. I mean how did that compare to where you were last year? Is that number like at all relevant? Or is that pretty steady as she goes?","David Farr","It's relevant. It's relevant. Last \u2013 in February that number was 750, wasn\u2019t 750? 800?","Frank Dellaquila","$800 million, that should, stay pretty stable, about 800 in December basically about 12 million higher.","David Farr","It's up versus last year for sure. But that's the key number for us as look at it, because we know those bookings are coming at us and we know those bookings will either happen this quarter or next quarter. If that number keeps growing and stay steady that's a good sign for us, because that means the funnel is maturing and happening.","So the reason we track that and share that with you is it tells us the confidence, relative to our growth and opportunity in the second half of the year in bookings and more importantly for the first half of 2020 in sales. That's a relevant number for us and that's why we track it and give it to you.","Frank Dellaquila","And the KOB. Steve, sorry, go ahead. ","David Farr","Go ahead, Steve. ","Steve Tusa","Can those ANS bookings in at any point, over the course of the second half kind of migrate towards the double-digit range, or is that, you know, too high of a hurdle coming out of this lull?","Bob Sharp","Right. From my perspective, I'd say we stay within the band of that 6 to 8.","David Farr","Yes. And I mean it's possible you can have a three month roll with a couple of big bookings in the month and how we look at the three months roll, so it's possible. It t is going to definitely move back up towards 8%, 9% range. There are some big projects out there that are being worked on right now. They are definitely going to come. So, yes, I mean our booking pace, we like what it is right now. So I think the opportunities are still there.","Bob Sharp","We got a few other in that committed bucket, Steve, if they do trigger will pull us up into the double-digit.","Steve Tusa","Okay. And then one last one for you, Dave. So this kind of lull here? And I guess your outlook, is that enough to kind of knock you off your \u2013 off the long-term, 2021, I think it was like 450 or something like that. Does this trajectory or at least maybe this is like a flattening in trajectory or is \u2013 do you think that, that\u2019s still an achievable target in the out years.","David Farr","Right now, we're going to debate this. Because I still feel so very good about it. Frank and I haven't talked about that. It might come differently. There might be less acquisitions. There might be different capital allocation on it, Steve. But I still feel good about it because the cycle is still there for both -- for Lal's business and Bob's business is starting to come back. So I still feel good about that at this point in time. I'm not ready to come off that at this point, at all. And Frank and I are debating that because we've got to in front of the Board next month and talk about the next three years, which includes, obviously, 2021. So I still feel good about it.","Steve Tusa","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it.","David Farr","Steve, thanks for calling in from China. Good luck with Jamie tomorrow, okay, be nice to him.","Steve Tusa","Thanks. I\u2019ll tell him, you said, hi.","David Farr","Okay, appreciate it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from John Walsh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Walsh","Wanted to have a little conversation around the 5 to 7 underlying growth here for Automation Solutions, kind of what could put us at the lower end of that range and then, obviously, you kind of have already discussed the high end of the range.","David Farr","I will take a shot. I think the one key issue at the lower end of the range is the channel. If the distribution channel does not come back and it takes all the way to the end of fiscal year, they work off the inventory that would cause that lower range that would put a lot of pressure on us clearly. That's the one area that we see right now. I would also say that it could be some of the projects we have booked and won that we're building on right now, get pushed out a couple of months. So those are the two things, I would see that push us back out but it \u2013 we\u2019ve done a lot of work in this right now. We feel good about it, but we're going to push and shove around the world and make sure we stay within that range. Lal, anything you want?","Lal Karsanbhai","I agree, David. I think I have more confidence in the stabilization and improvement in the North America upstream market in the second half versus the first half. We could slip into the discrete channels. We're watching carefully. We miss that call, it slides to the lower range. I have confidence, however, in the strong turnaround season based on what I see today. That puts us \u2013 moves us to the upper end as well as the shippable backlog that we have in our longer cycle businesses that will impact the second half.","David Farr","Okay. John?","John Walsh","Yes. And then just thinking about the April orders commentary. In December, you kind of broke out a bunch of different markets for your automation business. Obviously, you've talked about upstream oil and gas. You've talked about discrete. But if we were to think about those other buckets is there kind of just the general deceleration? Or are parts of those you talked about the turnaround season and how you think that plays out? I mean is refinery accelerating? Is midstream accelerating? LNG kind of maybe some color on those submarkets there for us.","David Farr","Yes, we\u2019ll try the best we can. We did not do that same initial launch out there. I tell you, it\u2019s a lot of work to break it down that way. But if I look at it, definitely refining, we see the petrochemical guys picking back -- spending back up.","We now see the LNG products coming and being worked at this point in time. The early stages of some initially, they are brownfield expansion and the big projects will hit us more in 2020 and 2021. We're seeing a general pace of investments just from our companies. We see the power business which had a very strong lull in the first half. The upgrades -- their bookings have been better than their sales and so therefore, we're looking at better second have in the power area. So, we feel a little bit better pace of spending and just upgrading in the business we're seeing around the world. But that's about the only color we have at this point in time.","Tim Reeves","I'll add one, Dave, around the midstream reach we have seen an uplift in activity over the quarter versus the wellhead. Clearly, as the pipelines are being built, that takeaway capacity is being built we see that. Obviously, there's less of our instruments and equipment on that pipe than there is at the wellhead, but we have seen that midstream activity strength, particularly, in North America. But I echo Dave's comments. The LNG markets are strong. We see the projects moving into FID and we're working across the confidence right now very aggressively. ","David Farr","Thank you, Johnny.","John Walsh","Thank you for the color.","Operator","Your next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","David Farr","Hello Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon guys. How are you doing Dave?","David Farr","Not too bad.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Excellent, just a question probably for Bob. What do you think is going on in the Middle East market because oil prices only looked down for a brief period at the end of the last year? I think you mentioned competitive dynamics. If you could elaborate there and can you give us some more commentary on why you think the market along with Southeast Asia can come back over the next few months.","Bob Sharp","Okay. I think the big thing we see in Middle East especially if we get into Saudi. The spending activity is driven by the government releasing stuff and also the government paying for the projects.","And frankly that's kind of been tightened up pretty heavily to where our customers in the Middle East, they're kind of c aught in a little bit of a crunch, if you will. And then there's a lot of Chinese companies out there right now. The China market is very difficult. They're looking for aggressive places to find some business and they're going in. And with some other rotary and other kind of products and disrupting some of the, I would say, the normal space or the normal technologies and things.","So, it's a combination of those two. We were there back in January and frankly, I mean it felt like it was quite stabilized and everything and we were looking for it to start moving up. It just hasn't really started moving up.","In the Southeast, again, a lot of the Southeast Asia business we have is OEMs other than shipping in the Middle East. So, its -- I'd say the two are really quite closely connected. And we're not calling for any major upturn in the second half. It's really just a stability. And it's been down for awhile. So the comps just start getting easier in the second half more than anything.","David Farr","And we see the money starting to free up in the Middle East. And we're getting a lot of bookings as Lal said, but the question is now will they start spending it. And so I think that our initial feel right now that money seems to be freeing up and that's why we feel a little bit more positive about it being a reasonable better second half than the first half, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks for that Dave. And then I wanted to ask you about, you said you watched KOB 3 very closely in the past, obviously, a bit of a slowdown here. What do you think the slow down means for the cycle itself both in terms of the larger projects and actually margin mix for your businesses? Obviously, KOB1 is a little lower margin than KOB 3. How do you offset that mix impact? And do you worry that project can move to the right as you see that KOB3 start slowing down a bit?","David Farr","Yeah. I'll answer first and I'll let Bob. The KOB 3 from our perspective, clearly, we've had a very solid work. It\u2019s still very good. We had a very good month, again this month. I think the key issue for us is as they tap the break on spending in certain areas in particular in the U.S. and Canada. That's clearly hurt us from a profitability standpoint.","Therefore, that's why Lal has taken -- and his teams are taking the unique cost actions right now, to assume okay, guys, KOB 3 will not be as strong in the third quarter. We may have a weaker in the fourth quarter. So what does that mean relative, how do we protect our profitably and improve our profitability in the second half if KOB 3 does not come back to a level we want.","And, therefore, that's why we're taking the cost actions right now. And if it does change as we move into the first half of next year then we're going back to the question I think that Julian asked us, we're going to have to actually take additional cost actions because that means that mix is changing.","We don't believe the fundamentals story that we laid out, the strategy we laid out is changing. The fact that our Final Control business has been able to grow 10%, way above our competitors Final Control business in North America, tells me that we are still gaining and I still feel good about that.","But any quarter or two quarters you could have that tapping and that's what we're watching right now. That's why I'm still watching it. I'm going to watch it very closely how Lal\u2019s business unfolds in this third quarter, because if it doesn't come back a little bit then he's got a lot of pressures coming at him in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year. So Lal do want to?","Lal Karsanbhai","Yeah. No, just very quickly, watch that 50% number in KOB3 very, very aggressively; we work it with structured organization and programs around the world, around service MRO, service as \u2013 software as a business, service as a business for a models. But I also mentioned that the KOB 2 business is also equally important. The modernization, and we continue to see modernization programs moving forward. And those are very -- they're relatively margin accretive as well.","David Farr","I think going back to the project pushout, going back to this question you asked, Andrew and then also going back to what Steve asked. If you -- when we put our orders out again, of which we do from time-to-time, if you don't see a movement up towards the higher end of that 6% to 8% for Lal, that tells us that we're seeing a percent of KOB 1. And, therefore, that's going to be a concern for us. So watching the orders and our communication around that will tell you if it\u2019s unfolding or not unfolding. That's what we're going to be watching now. I think KOB 3 we have pretty well set. KOB1 now and the timing of that's going to be important. We'll watch it real hard.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Appreciate it guys.","David Farr","Thank you. Take care. All the best to you. Be safe.","Operator","The next question will be from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So maybe we could talk a little bit about the cost actions that you guys are taking. Is it possible to parse out what you're doing with respect to costs versus paring that growth investment? And how should we think about growth investments into 2020? It seems to me that this would probably be a push out investments rather than a cut of investments.","David Farr","Yeah. From our perspective, I don't want to break out too much information from a competitive standpoint. But it's -- we were clearly running our investments at a, say, a 7% 8% 9% underlying order pace and therefore we've had to dial it back to be more in that 6% to 7% range. And I think that -- to your timing is, yes. Priorities from the standpoint that will be -- push them back -- we'll push them out a little bit more into 2020.","I would not say, they'll go away, these are important programs, but we try not to get ahead of the growth curve and we clearly have in the last two quarters here. As you look at the acceleration of the investments that Lal's teams done. And therefore, we know are tracking to bring them back into line. We're not going to kill them, but it's just more of a timing of how this goes.","On the restructuring side, that's a little bit different. That just goes back to, okay, we know the cost structure, needs to be -- we need to do this restructuring. We were talking about doing it in 2020. We now feel like we need to get ahead of this and that's why we pulled about $10 million, both in Bob's business and Lal's business.","And that's how we are, Nicole. I don't want to break it out. But I think that you're reading is right. We're just slowing it down right now. We're pushing it, slowing it, so we get our growth investments in line with our actual growth. And I think that's what we do and that's what you've done with your team ","Lal Karsanbhai","That's right, David. And we look at this, as you know, this is how we run the business, aligning a point less, as we think around the top line today than we did back in February, required us to look at the investment pacing and pull back in a few spots, some of it will be timing. We'll see how the year develops.","David Farr","Yeah.","Lal Karsanbhai","And then, obviously, we do have opportunities around the acquisitions and around getting the cost structure for the -- right going forward on the restructuring side.","David Farr","If you can imagine, it's pretty significant numbers, given the size of this business.","Nicole DeBlase","Yeah. That was really helpful actually. Thank you for the color. And I guess just the second one on capital allocation. You guys finished with the $1 billion repurchases that you expected for the full year. Does that mean we're done? Or is there scope to increase that $1 billion target for 2019?","David Farr","At this point in time we are set at $1 billion. As the Finance Committee met last night, we did discuss if the situation arise or rose that we had to do it, we'd go back in. But right now we are set up to $1 billion and we're not going to move it at this point in time. But again, that will be a topic of our whole strategy review and capital allocation review with the full Board in early June. But I would say, right now, it's set at $1 billion unless something major happened.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","David Farr","Okay. Take care.","Operator","The next question will be from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Thank you very much. Hi, Dave. Hi, everybody.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Inch","Afternoon. So I wanted to ask you, if we get a trade deal with China depending on the form, do you think this leads to more orders for Emerson? I guess, in the corollary, if we don't get a trade deal, what do you think the implication is, specifically for Emerson?","David Farr","I think it's more \u2013 from our perspective, right now, we don't see any change relative to a growth investment opportunity. It would be more of a cost issue for us. We have a cost reductions and then, clearly, over time that would impact our pricing too. But we would, obviously, get an advantage. But I don't see any fundamental change. I think it would solidify confidence in some of the markets that Bob serves in China, so I would say, his business will get better, because we hear that, not as much on Lal's side.","Lal Karsanbhai","No. I think, definitely the consumer confidence, if you're in China, you \u2013 it's notable that people are more cautious right now on investing in homes or autos and other things. And I think the trade deal, depending on what shape it\u2019s in, or what form it\u2019s in, but with a positively viewed trade deal from China from a consumer side, I think definitely would help.","John Inch","Lal, you're pretty agnostic then as to whether we get a deal or we don't in terms of the way you're planning for the business, I suppose. Is that\u2026.","Lal Karsanbhai","Absolutely. John, from an order perspective, yes. From a cost perspective, as David stated, it will hurt us if we don't get a deal done. ","John Inch","Got it. And then, Dave, just as a follow-up here. Emerson, you're a pioneer in China, but you are still an American company. I'm just wondering given all of this, you can see the context of my question is, just trying to understand what's going on over there. Do you get a sense of any kind of a growing bias against US firms maybe on the part of the government or quasi- government customers or is there anything like that, and how are you dealing with that?","David Farr","Well, I was just there. And on the front page of this report, that's the number two person at Mascom, a couple of years she came to our grand opening, we have a new tech innovation center. I was in Beijing meeting with certain government officials and customers. From our perspective, we've had a long, long relationship. We're celebrating our 40th year there as an American company. We have not seen any. Does it mean we maybe had a few more checks by government officials and reviews and things like that, yes. But I have not seen anything from our perspective.","As you know, we are very, very localized, about 90% of what we sell in China, we design in China and we manufacture in China. So they treat, from that perspective, we're treated differently, but it's something we have our ears and eyes open. And just want to make sure. So I feel good about it right now. But again, the trade deal is something we do, all want to get done including from Chinese perspective, and the U.S. perspective. But I applaud our government. I'm sure to do what's right for us as a country. And I wish him well and same thing with the China as we talk with Chinese officials. There are working for the best of their constituents and I think we'll come out with an appropriate deal.","John Inch","Perfect. Good to hear. Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.","David Farr","Take care, John. All the best.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","David Farr","Hey, Jeff, how are you doing?","Jeffrey Sprague","Good afternoon, everyone. Good Dave. How are you doing?","David Farr","Not too bad. What time zone you are in right now? What time zone you in?","Jeffrey Sprague","In Munich.","David Farr","Munich, oh, that\u2019s good place.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, thing is that, they got a power business, so if you are interested.","David Farr","You know I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re trying to sell me Siemens power business.","Jeffrey Sprague","[indiscernible]","David Farr","Okay, get the questions, not the BS.","Jeffrey Sprague","Well, last quarter, Dave, you are looking for baseball players. You need a hockey player, right, with this Q4?","David Farr","I need some more bats right now, Jos\u00e9. I need some bats. I got some rally monkey out. I got the bats out. I'm probing everybody right now. It's a little bit more contact sport, as we say.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes. Can you help us a little bit, though, with the specifically what's going on in price\/cost for you in the fourth quarter and kind of the tariffs tailwinds that you're expecting to feel there in those results?","David Farr","It's going to be positive for us. I'll let Frank -- first half, obviously, was negative. And now as you look in the second half of the year, we -- both Bob's business and Lal's business have helped us. And so we're flipping over significantly in the second and the fourth quarter. In the first -- we have a little bit help in the third quarter, but really helps us a lot in the fourth quarter.","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, we would expect ... ","Jeffrey Sprague","Is that $0.08 mostly price\/cost, or is it evenly spread between those three buckets, that $0.08 delta in Q4? ","David Farr","We had an $0.08 on the bridge.","Frank Dellaquila","Yes. Yes, it's heavily price\/cost. I mean we expect to get a pretty \u2013 hi Jeff, this is Frank. We do expect to get a pretty good tailwind that accelerates out the third into the fourth quarter in price\/cost in both of the businesses.","David Farr","And we have pretty much all covered. If there's additional tariff -- not everything but pretty close to it. Lal's business, Bob has a little bit more. I think we are all still trying to work through that so if the President puts that additional tariff in there, we have some of that covered. We don't have it all covered and you don\u2019t have it all.","Bob Sharp","Yes, well, for total price cost, it's more than covered, but we've got -- for Commercial & Residential, it was pretty neutral in the first half in total and significantly positive in the second half. Yes.","David Farr","Yes, so, a big chunk of that $0.08 comes from this and it's set. I mean that's obviously -- the inventory work out there hurt us a little bit in the first two quarters or the second quarter in particular. But now we're starting to get the profit margin here in the second half.","Bob Sharp","Yes, from our perspective -- from our perspective the price\/cost impact is nearly 2x second half to first half.","Jeffrey Sprague","Okay, great. And Dave do you -- I mean you hit this KOB3 a couple times. Do you think KOB 3 spending is kind of being preemptively squeezed out by the wave of KOB 1 that's coming? And can your internal efforts like PK and other things offset that? Is that a factor?","David Farr","So, let me give you the way I think about it from a CEO perspective. Word comes out from top of the organization, \u201cGuys, we need to slow down. We need to tap the brakes on spending.\u201d The first place you go is you got a budget or a global budget say $100 billion and you\u2019re going to -- you got to take a little bit out of the first quarter and say, let\u2019s slow it down and see what happens.","The first place you go is in the United States because you can control United States. It's the same thing if you look at all cost reductions all cost actions. The first place you go in the United States because we have the flexibility in the organization.","So, what we saw in the last three months is as I talked about in February a little bit I was concerned about this. The word came out, let\u2019s slow things down a little bit and they tapped. And where they tap is that they tapped in the U.S. markets. So, if you look at other than Saudi Arabia, where we saw the biggest pullback in KOB 3 was in the United States and on top of the distribution.","So, my fundamental belief is, the capital allocation held in the communication in the quarter if it continues to hold that KOB 3 will build back up in the late summer early fall time period and that we\u2019ll benefit from that.","We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Asia. We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Europe. We're seeing KOB 3 strong in Latin America where we saw the back-off in the U.S. and that\u2019s typically how it unfolds. If you ever watch of this, we're more volatile in KOB 3 in the U.S. because that's how the CEO\u2019s control it for my customer base.","Bob Sharp","Right. It's going to be 3, because KOB 1 isn't going to be paying this year anyway.","David Farr","Yes. So exactly right.","Bob Sharp","It doesn't save money this year.","David Farr","Yes. That's how I see it Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks.","David Farr","Jeff, you take care. Be safe. And I do not want to buy Siemens Power business. I'll take their -- if they want to buy controls systems, I'll gladly do that, but that's ","Operator","The next question will be from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thanks good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon Gautam, how are you doing my friend?","Gautam Khanna","I am doing well. A lot of questions asked and answered. I wanted to just make sure I understood. Just putting it altogether on the Automation Solutions side, Do you still have confidence in kind of 30% plus incrementals in 2020-2021 as we move through given all the moving parts. Project timing KOB 3 what have you, integration opportunity with the recent acquisitions, do you still feel comfortable that we're going to net to 30% plus incrementals as we move through?","Lal Karsanbhai","Yeah. This is Lal, Gautam. Yes. Part of the rationale around the cost containment that we put in place during the second half and the incremental restructuring that we're executing in the businesses within the next four, five days, very important programs are a little bit of insurance policy around what's going on in the end markets and the recovery in the second half. And as we do -- as we execute those we get right in that 30% band that we've been talking about on EBIT leverage.","David Farr","We issue for us goes back to the question. I think Julian asked earlier, Gautam. If you don't see the margin come in the second half of the year, we're going to have to take action. And Lal knows that because we laid out a plan. We\u2019ve got a plan for acquisition. We got a plan for the core business to get back to profitability. And if we have to -- we can't get there then we're going to have to figure out how to adjust the cost structure.","Lal and his team understand that. They understand the margin business, but they also are working with the fluidity around the KOB 2 and 3 and 1 business. So I think we're pretty fluid here and understand our jobs. That's one thing we are good about. And this team sits here the same flow. We're all here together now. Lal\u2019s got his CFO and Head of HR as Bob does right here in the same floor with us and with Frank. So we can talk openly about what's going on. And we'll have to adjust if we can't get there. But I feel this guys have a focus right now with Lal and his team.","Lal Karsanbhai","And as you said David earlier on, we\u2019re having a good year. We're having good year as an organization as a business. It's shape of the year has changed a little bit on us, and the short cycle, the pressures we felt in the second quarter has pressured the margins. ","David Farr","Correct.","Lal Karsanbhai","And we took actions there. And we do have some second half recovery based on what we saw in the second quarter. And as that unfolds we'll be watching it month-by-month very, very careful. But at least based on what we saw in April that's positive. The fluid situation, Gautam, but we fully understand what we have to do as shareholders. ","Gautam Khanna","No, I get it. Just philosophically, Dave I\u2019m just curious how you and the Board think about that 450-ish target in a way out there, obviously, you could toggle up the buyback if you wanted to backfill. I'm just curious how you guys set the priority in terms of that financial target? Is it a goal come hell or high water? Or is it something that you'll be a little bit more flexible around. I'm just wondering if that\u2019s something you might \u2013 we consider as early as the June Board meeting?","David Farr","Well, yes, we're going to talk in the June Board meeting about it. But it's definitely going to unfold differently right now based -- let's say the underlying growth rate this year is a little bit less. If we see the underlying growth rate in 2020 and 2021 then obviously we adjust. If we don't see the acquisitions then we have to do a share repurchase on this.","From my perspective 450 was a realistic target when we said it last year or this year. I still believe that is the case. And the question is now as Frank and I, with the business leaders have to -- on a platform they just I have to look at this and say, okay what's a realistic being?","For me it's many ways we can get there. Acquisitions or no acquisitions, share repurchase, better margins. So we're going to look at that and we'll see that unfold. We know how important that 450 is relative to our long-term valuation and it's something that we take seriously as we unfold it. So we will see what happens as we build it up here the next 30 days.","Gautam Khanna","Appreciate it. Thank you guys.","David Farr","Thank you, Gautam. Good to see you and talking to you again.","Operator","The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Deane. How are you doing my friend?","Deane Dray","Very well. Thanks. Just I know we covered a lot of territory here. For Bob I had a follow-up. Just a clarification. When \u2013 Bob, you commented on the fourth quarter. A lot depends on heating activity in China. But aren't you facing a tough comp on the whole government heat pump program? And so, how do you think that plays out?","Bob Sharp","Well, for the fourth quarter, I guess, it's good now. But no, we don't have a tough comp. It was last spring, May, June kind of timeframe when the heating market really collapsed, for lack of a better word, in China. So the comparisons are not that difficult against that. And we're not \u2013 again, on AC and heating we're talking single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, not some dramatic recovery.","The last time we came out of a cycle, it grew 40% or so pretty quickly. So I'm not -- it's not reliant on something dramatic. It's really just more a matter of the normal project, the activity happening. There's still high emphasis on the Blue Sky initiative. This is more industrial oriented. So it's less about the government releasing neighborhoods like the residential stuff around Beijing was for a while.","So it really comes down to the companies having funding for this and in some cases a little nudging in some areas where the government will say, \u201cYou know, you're in a zone where you got to stop using a boiler.\u201d And if they're told that, then they either change to a heat pump or they don't have heat. It's pretty cut and dried.","Deane Dray","Got it.","Bob Sharp","And the problems. Again, the -- so there's \u2013 those customers or like the power companies in a region who are working with our OEMs, because they're doing a full implementation, a lot of times retrofitting a boiler investment. They are asking for heavy quotations right now from the OEMs. We see that. Again, the OEMs are just not going to buy a compressor until they know for sure that project's funded.","Deane Dray","Got it. Yeah. Just, Dave, I would be interesting in hearing your take on the latest turn in the trade negotiations. And just clarify the last update tariffs were going to hit you $125 million. Where does that stand today?","David Farr"," Tariff numbers, still good. As you well know, if you go back, already said this thing was going to take a little longer. I've always felt July, August was the appropriate timeframe. And so, I've never been the guy that said, this thing in May, as I publically said this and I said it on the call here.","I still believe we'll get a deal done. I think the issue really boils to I think both parties are testing each leader and \u2013 on the give-and-take. And I'm glad to hear the \u2013 they are going to be meet \u2013 go ahead and meet this week. But I think this is going to take -- go back and forth a couple more times.","And I still don\u2019t believe we'll -- anything will happen until the August time period. And so -- but I do believe that it will get done and I do believe that the cost will be passed through eventually. But it's something we have to manage. I can't sit here and cry and hold my breath. I got to deal with them. And so, I think, as a company, we\u2019ll be on with it and from a standpoint of the country, I'm glad we're addressing this issue now than \u2013 and waiting. We need to get on with this issue.","Deane Dray","Got it. Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you, Deane.","Operator","And the final question today will be from Robert McCarthy of Stevens. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert McCarthy","So I got two questions. One is of form and one is a substance. So I'll ask the one of substance first, maybe your business leaders could just walk through the opportunity, particularly in the context of a long-term target for EPS around cash conversion? And is there a way for you to just have superior cash conversion above what you are historically have been? And maybe talk about the acquisitions of the businesses, the opportunities. So that could support a very high-quality number even as you fall $0.10 to $0.15 short, you might have a really strong, high-quality cash number.","David Farr","You guys want to take a shot?","Bob Sharp","Well, I mean for the Commercial & Residential side from working capital standpoint, we run in the single digits. The margins are obviously very strong.","Robert McCarthy","Your acquisitions would be the place you work.","Bob Sharp","Acquisitions, I will say from a working capital standpoint with Tools & Test, we are well ahead of working capital right now. And that's a combination of payable terms more in line with what Emerson pays to buyers versus what Textron is paying. Inventory, significant change. DSO is not a dramatic change at this point. So I would say it's cash conversion, you would say for commercial\/residential has been outstanding and will continue to be outstanding.","David Farr","I think work in the acquisitions you've done in the recent years is your bullet point. I think Lal\u2019s got the one that\u2019s got the biggest opportunity.","Bob Sharp","No. I agree. But as we will be a run at very high levels of cash conversion across our automation. The acquisition do present us the opportunities to drive more of that, no doubt about it, Rob, as you pointed out and we continue to press those buttons.","Frank Dellaquila","Rob, this is Frank. We can always do better. But I mean we consistently run well above 100% of cash flow, free cash flow conversion, and we expect we'll continue to do that. We'll take advantage of the opportunities we get from the acquisitions. But I think we run that pretty efficiently right now and we'll just continue to look for ways to improve it.","Robert McCarthy","Well, thank you for that and thank you for all the substance on this call. I have a question on form, though. Obviously, Dave, this is a little different kind of call. You put your business leaders to the forefront. You put a lot of detail in about cost takeout, restructuring and then positioning for growth. Given its last season of Game of Thrones, are we seeing kind of a bake-off happening here, or how would you...","David Farr","No. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. There's no bake-off going on? Rob what kind of bull? I am not going anywhere, there no bake-off. No, there's no bake-off.","Robert McCarthy","But I guess in all seriousness, was this prompted by the environment and you felt you needed to get your leaders on the phone, or is this just something to raise the aggregate profile?","David Farr","No. There's two reasons we did this. One, I felt very importantly, given that what we were there in February talking to investors and talking to the sell side also and investors, we laid out a plan. And I felt the plan\u2019s changed. I thought it was very -- it's one thing I can sit here consider and communicate this, you know I can sit here and communicate this, but I think it\u2019s very important for the comfort of the investors to know that the business, the two platform leaders, Bob and Lal, are engaged and they're working this thing in unison with both Frank and myself to deliver what we're trying to deliver for the whole corporation, for the company and for their shareholders.","It's important for me to engage them. It's also important for me to give the -- everyone a chance that at a leadership level like Lal and Bob\u2019s at, they have a chance to interact and explain and have this experience that we go through, that we're sitting here under the microscope at both at the board level. I did the same thing with the Board today and then also from the standpoint of the investors These two guys have been operating businesses at Emerson. They don't need to be baked-off. I know how they perform. And they perform extremely well. So it was all about trying to help you all to have information to make a better decision on the value, long-term capabilities of Emerson. And by the way, it's not 2021 yet, Jos\u00e9. It's still ","2019.","Robert McCarthy","Understood.","A - David Farr","Take care my friend. And I want to thank everyone for joining us. I want to thanks Lal, I want to thank Bob, Frank, and Tim. It was a different approach and we wanted just, as I said earlier, just to give a chance \u2013 everyone have a chance to see what's going on and I want to thank the organization and I look forward to a very strong Q3 as we execute. So, thank you very much everybody.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 2, 2017.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Denise. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fiscal 2017 second quarter results. A conference call slide presentation will company my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days.","I will start with the second quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Sales in the second quarter were flat on both a net and underlying basis. The quarter results reflected a continued improvement in our served markets as evidenced by March orders which were up 4% on a consolidated trailing three-month basis. While the Automation Solutions platform remained down, power and life sciences markets remain favorable and trends in oil and glass MRO continue to strengthen. Mid-single-digit growth in the Commercial & Residential Solutions platform benefited from favorable HVAC, refrigeration, and construction-related markets. All profitability measures increased in the second quarter primarily due to savings from restructuring actions taken in 2016. Earnings per share from continuing operations increased 2% to $0.58. On April 28, we officially closed the acquisition of the valves and control business from Pentair.","Turning to slide three. Gross profit margin of 43.6% increased 50 basis points driven primarily by cost reductions while EBIT margin was up 30 basis points. Earnings per share included a $0.13 impact related to the discontinued operations of Network Power, Leroy-Somer, and Control Techniques.","Turning to slide four. Global demand conditions were similar to the first quarter as growth in the United States, China, and Europe was offset by declines in Canada, Middle East\/Africa, and Latin America.","Turning to slide five. Total segment margin was up 40 basis points primarily due to benefits from restructuring actions. Accounting methods, corporate and other, and interest expense were all lower than the prior year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations of $601 million was down 5% while trade working capital improved 50 basis points led by improvement in DSO metrics.","Turning to slide six. Automation Solutions sales decreased 3% on both a net and underlying basis as spending in process automation remained at low levels but continued to improve. General industrial markets were more favorable resulting in growth in our industrial solutions products. Power and life sciences markets continue their positive momentum and are expected to support growth in the second half of the year. Order rates continue to strengthen during the quarter which was evident in March orders which were up high teens on an underlying basis. MRO spending in energy-related markets continue to improve particularly in North America which was driven by shale and downstream customers. Margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.5% primarily due to deleverage on lower volume and $12 million of higher bad debt expense related to Venezuela. We expect the second half of the fiscal year to improve with underlying sales trends turning positive driven by MRO spending and small project orders.","Turning to slide seven. Commercial & Residential Solutions sales increased 5% on both a net and underlying basis reflecting strong demand in global air conditioning and refrigeration markets and favorable conditions in construction-related markets. North America, which was up 4%, was driven by solid growth in residential and commercial air conditioning as well as favorable demand for professional tools by oil and gas customers and do-it-yourself products from big box retailers. Sales growth of 13% in Asia was led by mid-teens growth in China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Margin improved 80 basis points to 23.7% primarily from leverage on higher volume and savings from prior year restructuring actions. A favorable outlook for global demand within our served markets supports our expectation for the platform to achieve mid-single-digit growth for fiscal 2017.","Turning to slide eight. Based upon our first half results and an expectation of continued improvement in second half order trends, we're raising our full year guidance as follows. Net sales are now expected to be approximately flat with underlying sales up approximately 1% excluding unfavorable currency translation. Within the platforms, Automation Solutions net sales are expected to be down 3% to 4% with underlying sales down 2% to 3% excluding unfavorable currency translation of 1%. Commercial & Residential Solutions sales are expected to be up 5% to 6% on both a net and underlying basis. Earnings per share are being raised to $2.55 to $2.65 from our previously guided range of $2.47 to $2.62. This guidance does not include the impact of the recently completed valves and controls acquisition. Our expectation for operating cash flow from continuing operations remains at approximately $2.5 billion.","And now, I will turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. First of all, I want to say that we did have a good recovery in the second quarter, and from the performance level based on what we discussed on the February conference call we did slightly beat what we'd discussed in that call. Orders for the three-month roll were 4.5% positive in the three-month roll for the quarter. Sales were flat, slightly above where we thought they'd be. Our GP, gross profit margin, our operating profit margin, our EBIT margins were all up and, yes, Automation Solutions margins were up underlying but we made the decision to clean up potentially future receivable issues primarily around Venezuela, and we wanted to make sure that we're perfectly clean coming out of this quarter given what's going on down in Venezuela. So we made that choice here in the corporate world to make sure that we had no risk relative to potential receivables in Venezuela. So we made that decision and we did hurt the margin by 50 basis points relative to that.","From the EPS standpoint, I said that the EPS would be most likely slightly down or, at best, flat. We did beat slightly our EPS last year. Our free cash flow was stronger and exceeded our earnings by over 100%. So a very good quarter and we have momentum. As we look at the current order pace, and you remember the blue band that we laid out in February in our presentations, from the standpoint of that blue band we're now running above the blue band. It doesn't mean we may not drop back down below the blue band or back in the blue band, and that was a chart that you did get \u2013 you did get that chart so don't accuse me of not giving you that chart, you did get that chart \u2013 we are now running as of this month, the current month, in the 5% to 6% level of underlying orders. So our order pace continues to do better. We're starting to see the mix change between shorter-term cycle orders and some medium cycle orders coming in. So it will mean that obviously we're going to start building some backlog as we go forward here in the coming months.","The other thing that you'll see in the third quarter, and I want to talk very openly about the third quarter, we would expect our underlying sales in the third quarter to be up, up 4% to 5%. We'd expect our operating margins, the performance at the operating levels at the operation businesses, up for the quarter. The big issue that we need to discuss so people don't get carried away is from the standpoint of the corporate cost this year, we had an artificially low corporate cost benefit last year by the tune of almost about $30 million from the standpoint of one-time benefits we got last year, from a Byrd Amendment benefit that we got \u2013 it's a dumping duty that we got a sudden payment from pension, from other actions.","This year, we're going to be having our corporate costs would be over, I think on the OID level, will be over $100 million. It will be higher so, therefore, we're going to lose a lot of money at the OIOD level primarily from last year's $40 million to over $100 million this year. And it's driven around a couple of areas. It's driven by that we now are booking some of the costs from the acquisition of Pentair Valves and Control. We will not have the benefit of the Byrd Amendment this time. We will have also the incentive comp because, other than today's stock price, the stock price has been doing pretty well, so because of the stock price rise we have a benefit of that. And with the pension accounting rules changed just last year, this year we have over $10 million of incremental makeup versus last year.","So from the corporate standpoint, we're going to lose some of the benefit from the operation running much higher. So underlying operations, we'll see sales up, profits up nicely, margins up. And we will, I'm telling you right now, we will be plus or minus flat $0.01 or $0.02, flat from last year's EPS. Our upside and reality based on the order pace we're seeing right now resides in the fourth quarter. We did slightly better than our plan in the first quarter. We did slightly better than our plan in the second quarter. We've always felt that we'd be kind of flat here in the third quarter, and I mean it because underlying sales will be up but the corporate costs are going to offset that.","And then the upside we see as we look at the fourth quarter, if underlying sales continue to move nicely and we continue to see that margin expansion we should see a pretty good EPS growth, earnings growth in the fourth quarter, giving that range that we talked about most likely in the $2.55 to $2.65 range, looking most likely around that $2.60 range plus or minus $2.62, $2.59. That's where we're looking at right now with a good fourth quarter.","And it's because of what we saw. We had a unique benefit last year in the third quarter around operations. But operations right now are starting to see good underlying growth in the 4% to 5% range. Good, where I'd say operating earnings growing up in the 9% to 10%, 11% range, and we have to get through this one quarter here relative to the corporate issues which we face. So underlying from our perspective right now, the operations are running well and I look for a strong operating quarter and then I look for a really good, strong operating quarter in the fourth quarter and a good close to finish the year.","So people may think that the numbers aren't moving as rapidly as they want to but they need to look at behind the curve, and if you see the underlying performance of the company right now it's clearly on a very good path. Our order pattern's very good and we're ahead of what we thought we'd be in February. We're ahead of what we've said in the conference call last time. And I feel very good about where we see right now as we go into the second half of the year, as we go into the last quarter of the calendar year and from that momentum standpoint.","So that's where we sit at this point in time. The only last comment I would make around the world, as I look at the world because then someone will ask me, I see right now our North America business has continued to improve and we see good growth coming in North America now. Order pattern in North America has been very good and continues to improve. I continue to see improvement in China and other parts of Asia. Very strong growth in that part based on the product lines and the customer base we have there. I see good momentum continuing in Western Europe. Eastern Europe and Russia has not really recovered much yet. I do not see much recovery at all and I still see negative in Middle East\/Africa. I still see concerns in Latin America. I do not see that recovery happening there at that point in time. I'm starting to see some benefit in the early stages of uptake in Canada. So most of the markets that I see right now, driven primarily by U.S., China, Asia, and Canada, and Western Europe. Those are the markets doing well at this point in time.","We'll talk a little bit about the valves and controls from the perspective of where we sit at this point in time. We've owned it now for three days. It's very good to get through. We're doing a lot of actions. It's very early to tell what we're going to see at this point in time. As we've said back in February, we were going to have some earnings dilution and, from that standpoint, we still believe there will still be slightly earnings dilution. We only have five months now versus we're planning on a little bit more time at that point in time. We're probably, at that point, we're probably talking about six or seven months so it's still earnings dilution. We will try to give more clarity around this as we start analyzing where they stand relative to sales, the profitability, and so forth. So there's still slightly earnings dilution around the incremental restructuring, some amortization, and that's not different than I've said before.","The one-time purchase accounting which we really are going to have to spend a lot of time on, that number is going to be less than we said before. I think we told you the price and the backlog, and we look at the purchase accounting it's going to be around $0.25 to $0.30 per share. It's probably most likely going to be half of that, maybe not quite half of that, but we need four or five months of work on that issue and to get that done and then we'll come back out and give you some clarity around that.","From a cash flow standpoint, given it's only five months, we might have a little bit of positive free cash flow. It's really relative around how much restructuring we can get done in the next five months, and we're just starting. So we have less cash and less earnings. So, therefore, restructuring might eat up some of the cash flow in the earnings there but hopefully we'll still have a positive free cash flow for the five months that we own the company. Fundamentally, long-term trend hasn't changed. It's just that we owned it for less. We have less time and we've got to get our arms around it. And as soon as I give you some more clarity or I feel I can give you more clarity around it, I will but it will be slightly dilutive in earnings per share, actual earnings with the incremental restructuring and the amortization. It will have a one-time hit because of the purchase accounting and then we'll set out the numbers as we go forward. But still a very good fundamental deal for us. We're acting on it and hopefully the cash flow will be slightly positive for the year when it's all said and done. But nothing different there except maybe probably another $0.01 or $0.02 dilutive in the year because we have less time demands from a restructuring standpoint and a benefit standpoint.","That's where we sit. Very excited about it. If any of the valves and controls people are on the phone, we're looking forward to working with you. It's an exciting acquisition, joining a very strong Automation Solutions business, and we look forward to working with you and with your customer base and our customer base, and really realizing both the growth synergies and some of the opportunity synergies. So really exciting opportunity for us from that perspective.","With that, I'll turn it over to the open line and let people ask questions, and feel free to make comments and any questions you want.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. At this time, we will open the floor for questions and answers. And your first question will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon. Before I'd make a comment, I'll also make a comment that this might be Rossman's last conference call because I'm looking for a position for him in some place out there. So if you guys have any ideas, please call me. But seriously, seriously, he has running his tape and with all the new positions. I'm serious on this. His name's in play right now so he may not be on the phone call ever again. I might be soloing it with Frank Dellaquila here. So that's a real scary thought that Frank and I are going to be doing investor relations with no one to cover for us. I forgot to make that comment. And Craig, I know he's laughing. He doesn't know it yet but his name's in play, and it's a fun situation. So it might be the last time he'll get to talk to me about this, my friend.","Okay. First question, go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Dave, we've got some opportunities for him so stay tuned.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You do? Good. Okay. He found one already.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","He found one? Sure. Thanks.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Can you give us a little more color on your Automation Solutions margin? Just to clarify, you don't see any more risk in South America. But even if we exclude that impact, your margin was down sequentially with rising sequential volume. I know you talked about it at the Analyst Day, higher inflation pressure versus price. Did you see that or any other impact...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, it's not to do with that. It's nothing to do with that. It's all about \u2013 that's a currency impact from the standpoint \u2013 in the first quarter, we got a benefit. We have long-term contracts with customers that are priced in dollars and projects and even though the business may not have a lot right now, but we still do, and the way the dollar moves and some of the pricing in these transactions, it's all function. We got a benefit and it went against us this quarter. Next quarter, it could be positive. That's why, sequentially, they had a problem. It's nothing to do with operations, not to do with price cost. So it's nothing to do with that. It's from a currency which as this business gets too slow from time to time. So that's all it is. It all works out by end of year typically. Within 12 to 14 months, it all flushes out. That's what the issue is. Operationally, the margins were up...","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","17.1%. We're at 18.6%.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. So it's a good margin for the quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Dave, do you think that the margins there can still do 17% to 18%? I think that's what you talked about at the Analyst Day for 2017.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I think, in fact, if profitability right now \u2013 so we gave right now from the standpoint \u2013 you're talking operating or EBIT margins? So you're talking EBIT margins?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","EBIT.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. So I think these businesses will beat the number. Yeah, it'll be the fourth quarter I think because there's businesses starting to tick up. They're going to have underlying growth in the third quarter. The margins come in so my fundamental belief right now is that margin will be better than we presented to you in the Analyst Meeting. So right now in the third quarter we're looking at over a point of margin improvement in Automations and probably the fourth quarter we're looking at close to 2.5 to 3 points of margin improvement. Overall, for the year we're looking at over a point. And so we're looking at slightly higher margin than we told you as we go forward here in the rest of this year. So they're starting to come forward. The tension will be for these guys is where they start investing and from my perspective I want to get back above a 17-plus percent EBIT margin as we finish the year in Automation Solutions. So my impression is try to get the midpoint of 17% by the final endpoint of this year for Automation Solutions.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So I would expect us to see continued improvement, sequential improvement, and year-over-year improvement in margin in the second half of the year for Automation Solutions.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Dave, underlying sales in North America were down 2% in your second quarter but orders were up in March. I think you said mid-teens in North America led by oil and gas MRO and turnarounds. It seems like you saw a decent inflection in North American in March. Have you seen that continue in April? And then the kind of book growth you saw in March could continue. Could you see some upside? When you look at the second half of the year I think you're guiding to modestly up organic sales in Automation Solutions. That's what's implied in your guidance anyway.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, and the answer is yes. In April, I did tell you that April was stronger orders. North America has continued on a very good pace and recovery. We're starting to see including Canada now, and so Canada has started to pick back up which is a good sign because Canada has been very negative. I still think they'll be negative for the year but that we're actually starting to see that. The points, again, I'll repeat. The place we see the improving strength is U.S., Western Europe, China, the rest of Asia including India, and a little bit of improvement in Canada I think I've said. But to the rest of places, Latin America, Middle East\/Africa, Eastern Europe, and Russia we're not seeing improvements yet but the key core markets have all started trend line very strong and half of the data points have been continued to map along.","Hence, when I made the comment we're above that blue bar that I presented in February, we now have, I think, three months in a row that we're above that blue bar. And including April which we haven't put out, but that's where I see it right now. So the trend line is good, the mix of business is good. But keep in mind, as I've said, in Automation Solutions, as these order pace goes into the 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10% range, you're starting see more medium-term and longer-term projects get into that mix. The MRO is still going to be good, but I still have project mix such that I'm building a good foundation for 2018 at this point in time. That's where we sit.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Have a good afternoon.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","You too.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You've got any opportunities for Craig Rossman at Barc, Scott?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, Craig. It's been a pleasure. I have no opportunities.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What? You don't want him to work for you, Scott?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","In fact, we're hiring. Maybe I'll come work for you.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll write Scott an offer now. Okay.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'll work for Craig. I'll answer his phones. How does that sound?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nice try.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","His career is still on the upper trajectory. I've got a flat line here but...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Don't give me that BS.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Well now that we have that going, let me bust your chops a little bit, Dave. Now that Pentair is closed, the valves business is closed, I mean, what's the playbook that's different from what the previous two owners did? I mean, neither one of them seemed to really be able to make much out of this business. You guys have probably more customers in common than they did for sure. But is it more of a cost issue? Is it marketing and sales? Is it all of the above? I mean, what's really, you think, the playbook that makes this work for you guys that didn't make it work for them?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's a couple of big differences here for us. One, we are the largest and broadest automation solutions house in the world as you all know right now from the standpoint of the systems, the flow, the measurement, and now the final control. We are also a business that's very, very global, where we have as much presence in every region in the world be it Asia, be it in the Americas, be it in Europe, be it in the Middle East and Africa. We are a business that actually had driven off of technology that we can pull into play into the new world somewhere on the digital work at that point in time. We're a business that actually have more mechanical and electrical leverage relative to procurement than anybody that's ever owned this business before.","We are a business that have a customer base and customer reach where they bring a different customer but we also bring a different customer and we are involved in larger projects where we can bid on big projects of $100 million and we can pull all the package along which they could not do before. So we actually have a lot more to do both from a cost standpoint. But the most exciting part is from our customer standpoint as we now will have a broader package to offer up in the projects, both medium and large, and then also we can do all the service in the aftermarket which they really didn't have enough critical mass.","They're having a good start and I have to give credit to Randy and his team. They started this but they just didn't have the critical mass that we have. I mean, if you look at the shift in our business and how we would able to protect our profitability in the downturn, I mean, our business went down just as hard as their business, maybe theirs is a little bit harder, but we protect our margins. Our EBIT margins in our automation business bottomed out in, what, in the 15% to 16% range. They got down single-digit and that's because our aftermarket, what we refer to our KOB 3 business, got up to over 50% of our sales in the downturn. That's the difference. That's our game plan.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And the customers, are they generally fired up to have a more, I guess, intimate player in the space own the asset?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. They're very fired up. There's a couple of reasons. One, is the function of that we actually can support them on the total project, so they have what I refer to as one throat to choke, so they have one player to go after which is Mike Train in the automation space. And secondly, the service thing and the technology and the on-time delivery. Those are all very important to us from the standpoint of how we manage our business, and we're much more regional. We play a regional strategy where we manufacture in the region versus more of a let's export-driven strategy. So, yeah, they're very excited about it.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good to know. Good luck with it, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And I'm pretty excited about it, too, if you haven't figured that out.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Well good luck. If you can make it work it's going to be a home run for you because you got a good price. So good luck to you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And if you can think of a good job for Craig, just give me a call, okay?","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I will. All right. Take care.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm looking hard, man. I'm trying hard. I'm out there raking the coals right now looking for him.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Dave, Craig. How are you?","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey, John.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey. Good afternoon.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Afternoon. So how much of the $30 million of Byrd and other things you talked about, Dave, were a compare issue for the second fiscal quarter or was that for the year? Or just a little more color there.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The third quarter was an unusual year. If you look at our historical other other income deduction at corporate costs, just look at corporate. That third quarter last year was very, very low. It was down in the $40 million range and, historically, we're more in the $60 million to $70 million range. And now this one's going to be higher because we're bringing the valves and control in and we have some of the stock price and things like that. So it's a weird comparison. Underlying performance of the company is very, very strong, and the margins are expanding and cash are expanding as we go into it. I have the big offset, $60 million we have to offset in the third quarter. It's a fact. I mean, I can't hold my breath and have it go away. It's there.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Maybe this is a question for Frank. Was any of this relevant to the second quarter as we look at the numbers year-over-year?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. No, not really.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Just the bad debt. No, but that's pushed back at the operation level. We pushed that back in there. That was the only \u2013 Frank?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","At corporate, there was no significant delta year-over-year in corporate in the second quarter.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","This is the first time I've ever had to tell you on this. I mean, I looked at the numbers. It's the biggest one I've ever seen.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. Can I ask you then about the sequential margin? You gave, I thought, a pretty good answer on sequential margins in Automation Solutions. I did want to ask though, if you look at the MRO you had said last quarter MRO was picking up and that seems to be evident based on growth rates especially in the U.S. MROs got to be really rich mix. Is there some reason that the EBIT margins, Dave, you put up in Automation Solutions weren't a little bit better in the second quarter given the follow-through of MRO and the associated rich mix or is that still more to come or what?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well I think that the North America sales, they hadn't really turned around yet for the whole quarter. And so we started seeing it significantly in March. The other issue people forgot, and if you remember we had a very, very strong fourth calendar quarter or first fiscal quarter this year in Automation Solutions, and a lot of that was that pent-up demand of MRO that came through and then it did drop off a little bit. And now it's starting to come back in a more flowing basis. So we just had a couple of months there that slowed down, and now the MRO is coming in. And the core profitability of the businesses is very good right now and I expect it to continue to be strong and sequentially get better. So we're in a sweet spot and the orders now are being fairly consistent from the global markets with five months of pretty good North America orders and things like that. I think that it's on a run. It's a good run.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Did you say in your commentary you thought the fourth quarter of Automation Solutions was going to be up, did you say, what, 2.5 to 3 points? So that gets it close to 20%?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Over last year, yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Over last year. So that's going to get it close to 20% in the fourth quarter. And that's based on all the...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not uncommon for us. I mean, we are a profitable company in Automation Solutions. We actually do run 20% margins.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. No, no. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, if you think about it the sales will be up but from the standpoint they're starting to kick in and how much additional cost we bring back in. We're going to time this. I want our profitability to get back to some good levels before we bring in too much additional cost. A lot of pressure on us right now to put money back in in some technology and things like that. I want to get the margins going the right way for our shareholders.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just lastly, Dave. This mid-teen order growth that you've put up in Automation Solutions, how to think about that? Because the MRO business ultimately didn't drop, say, as much as rig counts and stuff like that; it was dramatically less. Is that sort of a normal bounce you'd see and that's kind of a growth rate that's going to peak but hold or does it get better or are you a little surprised at the mid-teens type of number you've put up recently?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I think I've mentioned to people before on the road, out talking to people. I expect us to have some quarters just in 15%, 16%. I expect to have some months like that. I would expect us to see, even the rest of this fiscal year, some 10-plus, 15-plus type of orders in certain marketplaces on Automation Solutions. I mean, if the industry's truly starting to turn back into invest both in, first, the MRO and then into the small projects, then our order pattern should build. And, I mean, as someone asked me on the road a couple of weeks ago, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have underlying orders from Automation Solutions north of 10% by the time we get into that three-month roll, by the time we get to September. So it's not uncommon and it's coming off a hole. As you well know, we had a couple of quarters there, a couple of years during the up cycle last time where we were growing sales 12%, 15%. So I think it's possible.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. No, thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Just as possible to have a negative in a month. I mean, this is a volatile space right now relative to this market turnaround. So I think the trend line is good but don't be surprised with some volatility in a month-to-month type of stuff.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Because of projects? Is that why it would go all of the sudden negative?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, yes. Projects. Yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You win a project you book a price. I mean, yes, projects.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And the next question will come from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Hi. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Maybe just a question on capital deployment. Now that V&C has closed, you did a bit more of a buyback in the March quarter than you'd done in the second half of last year. And, obviously, looking around there was a discrete automation acquisition of some size elsewhere during the last few months as well. So I just wanted to see what your latest thoughts were on the scope for doing M&A over the balance of this year or if buybacks are more preferable near-term?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. We continue to aggressively bid and go after the Automation Solutions acquisitions and also Commercial & Residential. Obviously, we're not successful in one of them. The intention would be is we still would like to see if we can get $500 million, $0.5 billion of acquisitions. I'm not sure we can at this point in time. We've talked to the board about share repurchase being in the $300 million to $500 million level, and that's where we sit right now and there's nothing changed in that. We're out working acquisitions. The opportunities are there and the question will be around is there something that we can land in the next five to six months? If not, then we're going to probably be driving our share repurchase back into that $300 million to $500 million level. We've only got, I think, about $100 million this year, correct? $120 million this year so we have some upside there.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Understood. Thank you. And then just my second question would be around that notion of what sort of price leverage you think you can get now that volumes have started to come back. It sounds like you think volume growth will accelerate. How are you thinking about pricing and capacity in your industries? What your competitors are doing on price over the next sort of six months?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I still think we're in a price cost window right now that's not good as I've said in the last couple of quarters. I think underlying material inflation, a component to inflation, is the point that's increasing. Our pricing power will solidify as we go through this the next couple of quarters. But as I look at the first quarter we've done, I think we're probably pretty neutral, maybe slightly red. I don't know, Frank, what the final numbers were. I would expect as we've just closed this quarter out, we'll be slightly red. I would expect us to be slightly red again. This is between price cost in the third quarter. And we're pushing pretty hard and hopefully we can close that to neutral to slightly green by the fourth quarter and clear it by the first quarter.","So we're in that phase right now that we're pushing hard. Material costs are working against us, and so that price cost volume is working. But we've gone through this phase before and I expect by the time we get out of this calendar year our price cost range will be slightly green or neutral. So we're back into the sink. We've had to offset that pressure with other cost reductions across the company.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities","Understood. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","So just a follow-up on Julian's question. In the recent project bookings, have you seen much price erosion if you compare them to what you might've priced these at a year or two years ago? Or are these, in fact, accretive to kind of that view of price cost coming back two and three quarters from now or eventually?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's not a whole lot of big projects going on out there at this point. I mean, there's small and medium-sized projects and the pricing of those are in line with what we'd expected from a price cost standpoint or margin standpoint. There's nothing unusual here at this point in time. The bigger projects will be more late 2017, most likely into 2018, and that would be a more relative time period to really discuss what we see the pricing. Right now, people are looking for speed, they're looking for trying to execute. A lot of times, their projects have already been approved. It's already been specced out and awarded. Now they're going to dust it off. So it's a little bit early stages to see what the pricing is on the big projects.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just switching to C&RS. Very strong growth for a couple of quarters now in China. What's the duration of this kind of upturn we're seeing there and if you could just expand on what actually explains it?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Relative to China, historically I never look beyond 12 months on a surge of growth because then it has a tendency then it sort of swings back. What explains it is the new technologies we have around our cooling, our air conditioning, and around our refrigeration, and some of the new products and new technologies. And so they're trying to focus relative to the environment and trying to clean air and trying to get rid of some the coal-fired boilers and things like that. We have technology that we had worked with the Chinese government, and those projects are unfolding and we're one of the major suppliers. There's other suppliers but we're one of the major suppliers. And the China government has a big focus on this in particularly in the Northern China spot with trying to clean up the pollution and this is going to take a couple of years.","My gut tells me that we'll have a big year for 12 months this year, over a 12-month time period. It'll die back a little bit. First of all, the comparison will be tougher but the programs are not going to die when we get into 2018. There will be just less of an impact coming off obviously a higher base. But right now, it looks like the projects will continue but the growth rates will slow but it'll still be at high levels.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Just for clarification on the Venezuela write-off. Dave, you made it sound like it was discretionary or maybe the timing was. But could you just provide some color there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We had cleaned up some of the receivable base and asset base last year with the continued deterioration of what we saw in Venezuela, and this is before even things happened with the GM situation here. We got to assume we're not going to get anything back from these assets and we decided just to take care of it. Receivables?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","You see, this is just reserving the receivables, the remaining receivables we had on the books down there. In Venezuela.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, that's all there is.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then back on Automation Solutions. You don't often talk or call out especially in the same sentence power and life science markets continue to be positive. So what are the key drivers there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well the power industry is investing in upgrading from around, if you think about some of the gas industry, you think about using less coal, they're looking at some of the new technologies to allow the plants to run more efficiently with some of the changes coming out of the EPA. I think this will continue to work nicely for us in the North American marketplace. And we're seeing continued power investments throughout Asia Pacific, and even parts of Eastern Europe are seeing some power investments.","Now, life sciences have gone through a period here where, if you follow the life science marketplace, we're seeing and have been now for over 12 months an investment period where they're bringing new drugs in, they're bringing new facilities in and there we get, obviously, the control systems. We get some instrumentation and that's been one of the bigger project areas for us and we're doing quite well there. Now there's smaller type of projects but they're still good projects and so we're seeing that investment both in Europe, in North America, and we're seeing a lot of investments going on in Asia, both in India, Southeast Asia, and also China as they're all trying to create their own life science pharmaceutical industry.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then just last question from me would be we haven't heard any updates on this so I figured I would ask. Anything from the 15% stake in Network Power that you still own?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They've only had it for a little while. I mean, I don't think anything is going to happen there for a while. Historically, I would say it'd be a couple of years before anything happens there. I think something will happen relative to our Artisan investment before Network Power because that's been getting close to four or five years now. So nothing there. I mean, I wouldn't expect anything out of those guys yet.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, I was asking in terms of its contribution.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well we don't get any contribution. We don't get any earnings or sales off of that. Earnings, no.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not an ownership stake.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, it's just an upside stake.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Upside on the back end.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","If they do something well with it. Yeah.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","If they do well with the investment ultimately. Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave and everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Nice to see the MRO turning.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Dave, can you give us a little bit of color on actually how V&C performed in the quarter? I know it wasn't yours but any color on revenue...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I don't have any idea. I have no freaking idea.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Really? Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I mean, no.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, maybe you (43:03) but no. How they performed? Look, I mean, I know where they are relative to sales. I know a little bit of the orders. I know that profitability is down but they've been in disc ops now for, what, eight months. So from my perspective, I'm looking at from May 1 on, that's where I'm caring about and we're working it hard. So we'll talk about that. I think that the timing is going to be pretty good because I think within a couple of quarters we'll start seeing some improvement in orders and stuff like that because the marketplace is starting to turn.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just thinking about how this rolls through your P&L here. Your guide excludes it but, obviously, we're all going to have to kind of model trying to getting this in. The dilution that you're thinking about for fiscal 2017, I would assume we see a sizable hit here into Q3. And then, I don't know, does it end up being a little bit of accretion in Q4, getting you to the slight dilution? Or how do we just think about the staging of that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think it's going to be slightly dilutive for both quarters on just pure earnings basis, excluding the one-time accounting changes which we'll have to start booking in the third quarter. So most likely, we'll have a one-time booking in the third quarter. We might have to true it up a little bit in the fourth quarter as we get more knowledge on it. But the underlying earnings, I mean, it's going to be a little bit in the third and a little bit in the fourth.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, we'll do our best to estimate the one-time purchase accounting but it'll roll through the P&L over the balance of the year and potentially a little bit into next year as well and we'll call it out. But, I mean, it's basically the backlog and the inventory that has to move through.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, this is something that takes a little time and this is something we could not actually do that we had to stay away from it. And so it's really easy for us to look at earnings and look at what we have to charge from an interest cost or a charge from amortization and things like that or intangible. We can figure those things out pretty quickly. The inventory and the backlog will take us several months. I mean, we'll take an estimate in the third quarter and we'll take another estimate in the fourth. And hopefully by the time we get at the end of the calendar year, we'll get everything trued up.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So just to be clear then, this $100 million Q3 OIOD does not include Pentair one-offs?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Correct.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The OIOD we have in there for that piece, and we'll have some more, is basically deal costs. It's paying costs of doing this deal, legal fees, and banker fees, other things like that we've had tied to that. Now that we've closed the deal, we can run through the P&L and we'll have some more running in the fourth quarter, too. There is nothing in there other than what we have that we, Emerson, expended in getting this deal closed. We'll bring in...","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's what I'm trying to get at.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. That's true. So that's true.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Those bankers' fees and stuff don't repeat into next year so, I mean, just trying to think about what the real run rate is for OIOD ex the amortization step-up. Do you have an idea?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. I mean, we're working on it our self and we'll work on it for you, too. But the banking fees, we'll call out. I mean, we'll have some more in the fourth quarter. We'll do the same thing. But, I mean, I'm in the third quarter.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Third quarter.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Third quarter. So we'll keep you informed and they will be delta'd out obviously unless we have some other transaction going on. You won't have that impact next year.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one final unrelated one for me. I don't think you're suggesting this, but we've heard from some other companies that maybe there's been some over-restructuring in some places and now there's a bit of a scramble to kind of catch a demand inflection. Do you see anything like that in your business or any down a supplier or two, down a tier or two? Any issues?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nope.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","No? Okay. Great.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm not trying to wrap around anything. Nope.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. We'll see you in SLA in a couple of weeks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. Take care.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah.","Operator","The next question will come from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I guess the first question would be in terms of the information on Pentair. Should we expect, kind of following up on Jeff's point, should we expect something pretty definitive, an EPG kind of walking through some refinements of what you've seen and how you think it's going to stage out over the next 18 months?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, by telling you the EPG I'll have weeks. So I'll give a sense for a little bit of the business, okay? And so what's going on inside the business? And right now we have a lot of work going on trying to bring the two businesses together and that's far more important than pulling together stuff to put on a chart. Relative to the inventory, relative to the backlog, that information will take us several months, several quarters to finalize. Relative to what we see from the P&L, the sales, and the earnings, then I think we'll have a better feel. I can give you a little bit better range after three weeks. So that one we could do.","The big number which is the one-time accounting impact, we're going to take our first stab at that relative to the third fiscal quarter when we closed it, and I told you it's going to be a little bit less than I told you in the chart we gave you in February and, hopefully, we can get that down even further as we get through it. But it's a function of what the inventory looks like, a function of backlog, and those are things that we have to get in and do all evaluations on.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Following up on Scott's earlier question about kind of big customers or channel access. I mean, the obvious point here is, perhaps, in the past the valves and controls, the final controls business has been effectively blacklisted in some countries and, obviously, you're not. So can you talk about the opportunities on the revenue side, perhaps, in Saudi or the Middle East or Russia that are just probably more self-evident for you than Pentair?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","On the big projects we can work with, from the countries that struggled with and concerns with, you call it blacklist and I call it sometimes the customer is not quite accepting some of them, we can work that issue. We, obviously, have great relationships and we have a very strong Middle East business, we have a very strong Eastern European and Russian business. We have manufacturing on all of those sites. From our perspective right now, we're starting to bid. In fact, the Pentair team allowed us to bid on several large projects even before we owned them, and when we bid and won on the total package. So we're going to continue to bring them into market. They were not maybe very welcomed in or strong and our organization is very strong globally. We have better customer relationships and we have access to the big projects because of it being driven by systems or control or whatever it is, we can go in and talk to customers. So I think that's going to be something that we can work pretty quickly over a two-year time period and get them back and engage. But we need to work on the regionalization of manufacturing that supply base so they can make sure they can deliver quickly in support of the projects we're winning.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Following up on Julian's question around M&A, clearly and maybe expanding it beyond the initial kind of fiscal 2017, but suffice it to say some of the large properties in automation, it looks like the ship has probably sailed there at least in the near-term. But could you talk about maybe on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side? I think I was tantalized by some comments you made about maybe getting more into industrial compression and obviously there's some assets out there. But could you talk about what could be the M&A strategy on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side in terms of what kind of properties?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, I don't think the ship's completely sailed on the Automations Solutions. I think there are opportunities out there. We're always working on projects and maybe some of the big ones that won't happen. But there are projects out there all of the time that you can work on and we're working on several right now. The Commercial & Residential, I think that we'll continue to focus on the application, the software, and the measurement sensoring side of the business which really is core to us to deliver what we're calling the sort of the Plantweb of the Commercial & Residential area which is the industrial internet space. So there's some unique assets out there.","Nothing of what I would say are large. A large deal there could be $600 million, $700 million. But I think that we're going to continue to buy some software and sensor-based acquisitions there and continue to integrate. The business, as you well know, is doing well right now. We're in the mix of a major global upgrade, an upgrade in investment, in the capital and delivery capabilities of that business. We're starting to see some, as you could see from the profitability standpoint, Bob and his team are doing a good job of leveraging that new cost structure and I think we still have opportunities here for the rest of this year going into next year. I think the opportunities are out there for us; it's just a matter of finding the right ones and then getting them on board. There'll be typically less competition in that space.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Dave, I would pack a fleece for next week. It's still cold up here. See you soon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm glad to hear that. Where's Tusa? Who's got the fleece? Is it Tusa?","Operator","All right. The next question will come from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Happy afternoon, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So on...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Since you've got Wells Fargo, it's got a big position here in St. Louis, got any opportunity for Craig?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'll look. I'll scout our internet page.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd tell you what, I'm not getting a whole lot of warmth here for Craig. I mean, there's not a lot of love here for you. I mean, I might have to (53:11). I mean, I thought Rich liked you.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","I thought he did, too.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Lebron's looking for a backup shooting guard. So, I mean, or maybe not.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I thought he was looking for a beer man to hold the beer for him. I mean, I don't think I've ever seen that before in a game. I didn't believe I heard it at first. Go ahead, Rich. Fire away.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So on orders for Automation Solutions, you talked about a transition to mid-sized projects and eventually to larger projects. I know it's early, but as we think about the mix of the sales coming through, it should be pretty healthy I would imagine the rest of the fiscal year. As we can think about 2018 from an incremental margin standpoint, would you call out anything right now that we should consider from a mix of the projects within Automation Solutions?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Still a bit early there, Rich. I mean, as you know I watch this pretty closely and that's why I can give you sort of the background, the color into it. I'm already starting to see some of the projects that had been shelved and iced two or three years ago come back out, those medium, small projects. So in the early stages, as you saw the orders pick back up, we're starting to see the book-to-ship in that base business pretty quick. And so my feeling right now as I see that order mix, and that change is as we've shift into order, positive growth's going to be there. But let's say their order pattern is going to be around the 6%, 7% underlying growth rate. I think they're going to be more in the 3% to 4% real sales growth I think as they start building that backlog.","But give me another couple of months to watch this. So that's what I see right now and that tells me that then we'll go into some good medium-sized projects. The MRO is still going to be there but it's going to make up the core growth rate of, say, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, and then as we start getting stronger growth in Automation, that will be those medium projects. And the bigger projects will start booking in 2018, late 2017, and we'll start getting those sales late 2018, early 2019. So it's a little early to say the mix. I expect those guys to have a pretty good margin assuming the MRO and the order book leads the year like I think it could lead the year. We should have a pretty good margin in the first half of 2018 as we go into 2018.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on just a shorter-term question...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Keep asking the question because I'll get more visibility as I get into it. I mean, I won't get it in the next two or three weeks. But I'll tell you what, by the time I get into June I'll have a better visibility on this.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Will do.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I know you will.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then on Commercial & Residential Solutions, just shorter-term. Do you have a pretty easy comp this quarter? Then it gets much tougher in the September quarter? Should we kind of think of mid to high-single-digit organic growth? And then tailing off in the fourth quarter, low singles? Something like that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Last year's third quarter was not good. So we're going to have a very solid mid-single-digit, a higher than 5 mid-single-digit growth based on what I think is going to happen in the third quarter for the Commercial & Residential. It will then be lower for a couple of reasons in the fourth quarter. It'll still be good, in my opinion, in the fourth quarter. One, if you look at the fourth quarter last year, they grew a little bit over 4.5%, about 4.5% underlying sales. China started picking up at that point in time and we saw some pretty good U.S.-based business. So I would say we're going to have a very solid upper mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter and then we're going to have a solid lower than 5% growth in the fourth quarter. That's what I see right now. You're exactly right.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then last one. On restructuring, any change to the $25 million for this year core?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What are we seeing, $50 million?","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","$50 million.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","$50 million.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's $50 million. Okay. All right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$25 million Pentair, Rich.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","$25 million Pentair. $54 million. Okay","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You got it.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks. See you in a few.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. See you.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's my sweater vest guy. Where's my sweater vest guy here?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sweater vest? It's a Patagonia fleece.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See here, somebody said I had to bring a sweater vest to go someplace. I don't know where I'm going. I'm going to Boston. I mean, you're telling me is going to be cold up there. I need a sweater vest. And the only guy I know that has a sweater vest is Steve Tusa. Fleeces.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Speaking of Boston, I'm reading about some high profile, perhaps, executive opportunities up there if Craig is interested. Just reading that in The Journal, so that might be an idea.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Are they building a new headquarters up there?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm not sure what you're talking about. I think it might be a good idea for Craig. Anyway...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I kid you. I mean, I've heard there's a lot of headquarters being built up in that region up there. Tusa, that's a great idea. Note to self.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, me too. I'll keep that in mind. So on the climate side for next year, you made a kind of an ominous comment in the press release about investing now against those high margins. I mean, can you grow margins next year at climate? And then when we think about the revenue comps on the back of China, can growth there be more than low single digits on the top line? I'm just trying to kind of understand the profile because it is been a bit of an unusual year with very strong China and high margins and you made a comment about kind of investing those away. So maybe just a little bit of color on how that kind of progresses in the next year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I did not make the comment that we're investing those away. As you know, I still think we have margin ability to get this to 25% as we work the press (58:48) issues. I mean, the comment I want to throw in there is that as you know this industry, and you know this industry pretty well, Steve, there are some major changes coming in here, refrigerants and some efficiency standards relative to both in North America and in Europe that we need to make sure that we stay ahead of our customer base. And so we're making sure those investments are happening. You can't miss a quarter or two in that. I'm not talking about lowering our profitability margins. I just want to make sure that people, as they see the last couple of quarters or the last couple of years, they've seen pretty good margin improvement there. I just want to make sure that they realize that we're going to still have margin improvements in this business in the next couple of years but I've got to make sure we're also investing on this transition that's going to unfold in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We need to make sure that we take advantage of that and pick up some incremental business, incremental share, in that marketplace. That's our game plan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then just from an overall company perspective, it's good to see the Zorro jumping over the blue line there. Going forward is this kind of...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","He definitely barely made it over the blue line and he doesn't have a whole lot of hop-back. He's now the oldest King Charles Spaniel at 15 years in St. Louis. So he's doing well but, boy, I tell you what don't ask him to go up the steps anymore.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's almost as long as you've been CEO, Dave. Fifteen years, right? Sixteen years?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just on the order of trajectory here, anything moving around in the next couple of months? Can this mid-single digit you talked about in April continue to kind of migrate up into the high single digits over the next couple of months? Or is there some comps? You know just the comps and stuff like that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve, it's going to be Automation Solutions. As you well know, in the Commercial & Residential, the one wildcard we have here is heat in north in the U.S. It was a bad year last year, so comparisons will be pretty easy but there's an element of risk in that area. I think the underlying housing, the underlying basic core spending, Commercial & Residential is good around the world. So that's the one wildcard. I still think that they're going to have pretty good orders in the mid-single digits. The Automation Solutions will be the driver. I mean, as I've said, we put the blue band out and, obviously, we've now had three months above that blue band. I think we'll continue to move on, go through the mid-single digits, probably get into 6%, 7%, 8%, but it's going to be driven by Automation Solutions.","And so right now, as I look at North America, I look at Asia which is starting to recover, as I look at some of these marketplaces, I would not be surprised, as I've said earlier, that Automation Solutions orders are not 10-plus percent in the fourth quarter on a cumulative basis. That will pull all of these up unless there's a huge drop off of Commercial & Residential. We also start, as you well know, comparison in more challenging numbers in Commercial & Residential in that fourth quarter. But the trend line's pretty strong right now and if I look at the global GFI numbers, they're improving and have been improving. So the cycle's going right for us right now.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Seems that way. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And, Steve, thank you very much. And I hope you know I'm just kidding you on the sweater vest. I just like to pick on somebody and since you happen to be on the phone I had to pick on you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's fine. Better me than Scott. He's a little more sensitive to than I am so that's okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I know. You have hair, he doesn't.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I have grayed hair.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I didn't say that. See you later.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","To correct you. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Hi. Yes. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon. Good afternoon.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","So a question just going back to Automation. On the Middle East, we are getting quite a mixed message from a lot of your competitors and people in the value chain about what's happening there. So because your numbers were down but can you just talk about your geographical mix within Middle East and what areas in the Middle East are dragging the numbers down and which are actually strong?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, right now Saudi, from an order standpoint, is the best of the best. I think the rest of the marketplace is pretty weak.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Wow.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From Africa. So, I mean, we're very much project business-driven there. So I would say right now Saudi has the best light for us. Kuwait is doing well. That's another one that's doing well. But those are the two that we see right now. So from our business standpoint, there's not a lot of big activity going on. It's primarily MRO, small stuff, and the business is basically \u2013 They think they're going to go with flat; I think they're going to be down for the year. So that's what I see at this point in time.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Got you. And as the Middle East comes back, do you anticipate any problems with collections in terms of hit to working capital as you grow that business or is it just...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. Our Middle Eastern customers have always paid us. They pay us on time. Our business, our products are kind of instrumental to running the plants. And so if they can't turn the plant on because they didn't pay me, sometimes it's a problem for them.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","And just a different question. ABB bought B&R and we just got back from Hanover. And a lot of focus all of the sudden, industrial controls capability is very important to being this gateway to getting the data on the cloud. And I know I've asked this question before, but given how the cloud is evolving has it changed your view on the need to have more presence on the industrial side? And I know this question has been asked before, but it does seem that IoT is evolving in this direction.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The Europeans are driving it. It's being driven very hard by the Siemens (1:04:56) ABB in a big way. We have continued to expand on the hybrid and on the discrete side. So we'll continue to do that. I mean, that's why I show the charts. We show the charts that we move across that way. And we'll continue to buy. That was a very nice acquisition from New York. And so from that perspective, I understand where they're going from it and it's the same strategy we have ourselves.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So I'd like to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody for your time today. Appreciate the questions and, hopefully, I didn't upset too many people with having fun with them a little bit. But I am serious. Craig, as we're looking at Craig moving on to his next assignment and it will be inside Emerson, it will be something important. And then Frank and I will probably be covering for him because he did not do a good job at developing a successor which is something I'm really upset about but we'll take care of that in his bonus. But with that, I thank everybody and look forward to seeing everybody down at EPG. And I'll make sure I take a sweater when I go to Boston later this month. Thank you very much.

Welcome to Emerson's investor conference call. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2020.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Pete Lilly, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Pete Lilly","Thank you so much, and welcome, everyone, to Emerson's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Train, President; and of course, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations, Emeritus.","Timothy Reeves","Emeritus. I graduated.","Pete Lilly","I encourage you all to follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I'll start on Slide 4 with the results of the quarter. Underlying sales growth came in slightly below expectations, flat year-over-year, driven by softness in global discrete markets and North American upstream oil and gas activity. Despite lower sales, operations executed well to deliver adjusted EPS of $0.67, spot on the guidance we've provided in the fourth quarter call.","Automation Solutions underlying was up 1%, which was somewhat below management's expectations, primarily due to the aforementioned U.S. discrete and upstream market softness. Demand in other global process and hybrid markets remained stable. Importantly, we also saw several large LNG projects booked in the quarter after delays from the second half of the year -- of the last year.","Commercial & Residential Solutions was in line with expectations, down 1%, reflecting continued softness in global professional tools and cold chain markets, somewhat offset by stronger markets in Europe and Asia, Middle East, and Africa. ","The company initiated $97 million of restructuring actions in the quarter, well above the $70 million discussed on last quarter's call. These actions, combined with incremental actions from the second half of last year are expected to drive improved profitability in 2020. Cash flow performance was solid in the quarter with free cash flow, up significantly versus prior year, reflecting 94% conversion of net income.","Turning to Slide 5. We'll review the P&L. First quarter gross margin was roughly flat at 42.4% as favorable price\/cost was offset by unfavorable business and regional mix, primarily due to lower U.S. shale and highly profitable upstream and discrete markets. SG&A as a percent of sales increased 110 basis points to 27.1%. However, this includes 150 basis points of unfavorable impact from higher stock compensation due to a higher stock price. ","Adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins, which exclude restructuring and related costs, declined 180 basis points and 170 basis points, respectively. Importantly, these changes include 220 basis points of combined unfavorable impact from stock compensation, pension, and FX losses. Excluding these impacts, adjusted EBIT and EBITDA margins were up 40 and 50 basis points respectively, reflecting strong read-through of prior year restructuring actions. ","Turning to Slide 6. From a geographic perspective, we saw mixed underlying sales results in Q1. The Americas were down below expectations due to weak U.S. upstream oil and gas and discrete end markets. The United States and Canada were down 3% and 1%, respectively; and Latin America, up 4%. Europe was down slightly with 2% growth in Western Europe offset by sluggishness in Eastern Europe. Asia, Middle East, and Africa was up 6%, led by China up 6% and strong growth in the Middle East. ","Turning now to Slide 7. Total segment adjusted EBIT margin dropped 40 basis points to 15.4%, reflecting the negative impacts of foreign transaction losses as well as unfavorable business and regional mix. These items totaled 80 basis points unfavorable impact. As previously mentioned, stock compensation costs increased due to a higher stock price, and pension costs increased due to lower discount rates. Corporate and other costs, excluding restructuring and related costs, was favorable. Q1 cash flow performance was solid. Operating cash flow increased by over 30% to $424 million, and free cash flow of $310 million represented 94% conversion.","Turning to Slide 8. We will bridge first quarter EPS. Tax, stock compensation, pension, and foreign exchange transactions totaled $0.13 headwind for the quarter, which was in line with guidance. Operations, share repurchases and lower interest costs delivered $0.05, also in line with guidance to net $0.67 of EPS on an adjusted basis. In summary, operations and balance sheet delivered our target EPS contribution on lower-than-expected sales. ","We will now review business platforms, turning to Slide 10. Automation Solutions underlying sales came in somewhat below expectations at 1% growth for the quarter. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were up 2%, driven by several large LNG bookings that had been delayed from the second half of last year. Of note, backlog grew by 7% to nearly $5 billion on a sequential basis compared to last quarter.","The Americas underlying sales were down 1% as discrete and upstream markets continued to soften. Europe sales were also down 1% as low-single-digit growth in Western Europe was more than offset by weakness in Eastern Europe. Asia, Middle East, and Africa grew 6% led by China and the Middle East.","Our long-cycle businesses continued steady growth with both Systems and Final Control, up mid-single digits. Adjusted EBITDA margin was down 60 basis points, reflecting 50 basis points unfavorable impact of FX transaction losses as well as unfavorable mix resulting from the year-over-year decline in the more profitable North American upstream and discrete markets. Excluding these impacts, the business delivered improved adjusted segment EBITDA margins on lower-than-expected sales, reflecting the benefit of 2019 restructuring actions.","In the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $83 million across the platform. These actions, together with approximately $30 million of incremental actions in the second half of 2019, are expected to support improved adjusted segment margins on flat to slightly positive underlying sales for the year.","Now turning to Slide 11. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales were down 1%. December trailing 3-month underlying orders were also down 1%. The Americas underlying sales were down 3% as North American residential HVAC markets remained soft, and slower industrial markets weighed on professional tools and cold chain demand. Latin America grew by 6%. Asia, Middle East, and Africa grew 5% with mid-single-digit growth across China, the rest of Asia, and the Middle East.","Commercial & Residential Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin increased 90 basis points, primarily reflecting favorable price cost and the benefit of prior year restructuring actions. For the quarter, restructuring actions totaled $10 million. Combined with approximately $5 million of incremental actions from the second half of 2019, we expect improved profitability for the year on slightly negative underlying sales. Turning to Slide 13, we'll cover the updated guidance. Despite some progress toward trade resolution, we continue to expect geopolitical tensions, pending elections, and corporate focus on cost-cutting to drive a no -- a low to no growth environment in 2020. On the full year, there is no change to our expectations for underlying sales. Of note, this outlook does not include any potential impacts from the unfolding coronavirus, which will be discussed later in the call. ","As highlighted on the last call, Emerson has managed multiple economic slowdowns in our history. And in the current environment, we have shifted our management investment focus from a growth mindset to a cost mindset. We initiated this process last year, increasing restructuring investments $35 million in the second half of 2019. Today, we announced the next phase of that plan. For fiscal year 2020, we expect total restructuring spend to be approximately $215 million, of which $175 million will happen within the Automation Solutions platform. Commercial & Residential Solutions and Corporate will each take $35 million and $5 million of actions, respectively.","Of note, during our upcoming investor conference, we expect to present an additional detail of the outcome of the Board's review announced on October 1 as well as update the longer-term guidance framework beyond 2020. We now expect adjusted EPS in the range of $3.55 to $3.80, an increase of $0.07 at the midpoint, reflecting the benefit of 2020 cost actions. We expect minimal net cash impact from restructuring actions. Operating cash flow is now expected to be $3.15 billion, and CapEx spending has increased to $650 million, leaving our free cash flow target unchanged at $2.5 billion.","Please turn to Slide 14. This slide bridges our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance. The starting point for the bridge is 2019 GAAP EPS of $3.71. Walking across to the right, we have adjusted 2019 EPS of $3.69, which excludes $0.14 of favorable discrete tax items and adds back $0.12 of restructuring charges. Continuing from $3.69, we expect a total of $0.26 of headwind this year for tax, FX, stock comp and pension. Largely offsetting these headwinds, we now expect $0.15 of operational improvement on flat to slightly down sales, up from $0.08 discussed in our prior guidance, reflecting the benefit of 2020 restructuring actions. We also expect $0.09 of EPS from improved debt cost structure and a strong balance sheet with $1.5 billion of planned share repurchases. This gets us to a full year adjusted EPS midpoint of $3.67.","Please turn to Slide 15. This slide lays out our second quarter 2020 guidance. The underlying sales outlook for the quarter is flat, reflecting continued headwinds in North American upstream and global discrete markets. Note that this outlook does not include any potential impact of the coronavirus. Despite continued North America mix headwinds, we expect total segment adjusted EBIT margin up 20 basis points and EBITDA margin up 60 basis points, driven by the benefit of prior year restructuring actions. We expect adjusted EPS of $0.81, which excludes $50 million of planned restructuring actions in the quarter. Please turn to Slide 16. This slide lays out the first and second half adjusted EBITDA margin progression for our business, assuming the midpoint of their respective underlying sales guidance. We expect first half restructuring spend totaling approximately $145 million across both platforms. These investments, together with easing mix headwinds and favorable price cost, drive significant margin improvement in the second half, with Automation Solutions adjusted EBITDA margin up approximately 150 basis points and Commercial & Residential Solutions up approximately 100 basis points.","We plan to exit 2020 with an improved cost structure that yields stronger earnings and cash as we go forward, and we look forward to laying out our long-term plans at the investor conference on February 13. ","And now please turn to Slide 18. And with that, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much. I want to welcome all the Emerson investors this afternoon and the analysts that follow Emerson in our markets we serve as we discuss our first quarter results and what we expect for the full year. I also want to thank all the Emerson leaders around the world and for all the Emerson employees that make this -- made this quarter happen and are implementing the total aggressive cost resetting programs to make Emerson stronger, more competitive as we deal with this challenging and uncertain global industrial and commercial markets. Thank you very much for your efforts.","As you can see for the first quarter press release, it's been a busy, busy first quarter executing around our 2.5-year cost resetting efforts. As you know, we accelerated the fourth quarter cost resetting by about $35 million. That money and those savings are flowed into this year, built into the plan originally and from a savings dollar for dollar, maybe a little bit more than a dollar per dollar based on the -- it was a headcount reduction program. In the first quarter, we did $97 million. Part of that includes corporate, where we took down the Emerson plane fleet to 5, and we sold the helicopter. We are expecting, for the total year, around $215 million of restructuring. And in total, you'll see next week well over $420 million, $425 million of cost reductions during this time period, over this 2.5 year time period, with savings well north of $425 million. And we're expecting incremental savings on the first quarter restructurings around $50 million. The big issue now is we're starting to attack and go after the access facilities and the higher cost structures will pay back more in '21 and '22. But we're going to continue to drive -- and you could see well into the second half this year and well into 2021.","We will have over dollar for dollar savings when it's all said and done, and the execution is going pretty well at this point in time. I'm pleased with it. We reviewed with it at great detail yesterday with the Board. Well more than 3.5 hours of details with the Board as they understood what we're doing to make sure we're taking permanent cost actions, permanent cost setting and not damaging the core quality of investments, the technology and the customer service support that we have out there, not damage the long-term viability and franchise businesses that we have at Emerson. ","As you know, we have our annual investors conference next week in New York City on February 13. It's going to be -- not be on Valentine's Day. It's unusual for me. So you guys get -- make sure you do everything special for your spouse that evening, but we're going to be doing our call -- our investors conference in the morning. ","Details around the global cost resetting to drive the new peak margins, where we laid out very detailed with a lot of growth -- the very little growth environment. You'll see what we're trying to undertake and how we're trying to do it, the timing, the annual savings when they're flowing in, when we're going to reach those margins from an EBIT basis, in an EBITDA basis.","At the same time, we're taking very significant actions around the corporate headquarter structure not only here in St. Louis but around the world as we look at best ways to optimize our cost structure, looking between the Automation Solutions and the Commercial & Residential.","This is driven internally by the key leaders, the business leaders and the corporate leaders, but also with the support of McKinsey as we looked at how we could optimize Emerson's efficiency, effectiveness and profitability to drive record levels of margins by each of the major business units. Lal, Bob and I will put more color on this next Thursday, but we have very good progress. ","As you can see, in the second half of this year, Automation Solutions margins are starting to pop up. Bob took after this last year, Bob and his team, Bob Sharp, and they're already seeing improvement in the underlying profitability of the businesses. So the actions are taking hold, and they're doing a good job, and we'll talk a lot more about that as we go forward.","But as the global Emerson employees know and know full well, we are fast in the execution mode right now. And we cannot depend on the fact that there's no growth out there. We are figuring out how to grow our profitability, how to grow our earnings and grow our cash flow in a no growth, low growth or maybe a negative growth environment.","I'm ignoring the coronavirus right now. Both Mike Train and I will talk a little bit about this and what we see at this point in time. But it's definitely, definitely going to have an impact in the near term, medium term, and potentially, long term as we look at this. ","As you could see, our total orders are trending in the plus 2, minus 2 range right now, trending right now towards the 0 as we look at the current month in the current quarter. It tells me that we are trending very tightly in the range that we've laid out for underlying sales.","We continue to look for those catalysts that drive up in North America and other markets of the world. But as I look at the world order pace, I look at the sales pace right now, North America is weak, weaker than we thought. Western Europe is about in line, 2% to 3%. Eastern Europe's down, primarily driven by Russia and Turkey. The Middle East and Africa, which we were just in, was -- is doing better, and several large projects are happening underway. In Asia Pacific, as of the middle of January, was trending pretty well and had pretty good growth in the first quarter, and we still look at pretty good growth for the full year there.","My concern as I look at the next couple of quarters is, I don't see the catalyst that drive the fundamental pick back up in the U.S. at this point in time. I don't see Canada, nor have I seen Mexico and other parts of Latin America. What we're trying to do right now is control our destiny through our costs and cost resetting to figure out how to drive better earnings and cash flow through this cost reset. If growth comes and we get it, so be it, but we're going to have to fight, I believe, all year long for incremental pockets of growth and things are continuing to happen to us.","As you could see, the global markets are not easy at this time. They're definitely not easy. I do see opportunities for growth out there. But I don't see how and when we will get to those levels at this point in time. I know people believe there will be a stronger second half. But from my standpoint, right now, I'm not betting on that. This company is betting on very low growth, moderate growth or no growth, and we're driving the actions necessary around that. ","Operating cash flow will be good. You saw the first quarter. We had very good operating cash flow for the first quarter. Some of that was trapped, in my opinion, working capital on the balance sheet. We also had some cash flow based on taxes. Frank had done some restructuring, Frank and his team, restructuring taxes that flowed through in that first quarter. That should continue to help us as we go into the first half of this year. ","Overall, I think our cash flow is going to be up nicely in the $3.15 billion to $3.2 billion. Right now, as we reviewed with the Board, and how we see this, assuming no significant acquisitions, we're going to pay back $1.2 billion in dividends. We're working on our 64th year of increased dividends. Our dividend ratio, as you look at free cash flow, is dropping down below 50. Our share repurchase somewhere around 1.5, assuming no significant acquisitions at this point in time. So close to 85% of our cash flow should be repaid back to shareholders in support of what we're trying to do with our shareholders. ","Again, if we have the opportunities for acquisitions, we'll take them. We're also assuming higher capital spending this year. We've raised capital spending up to that $650 million range, $650 million range, in support of the actions we're taking as we build new best cost locations around the world, as we've continued to reset our facility structure and our cost structure. ","Our acquisition funnel right now is pretty small. People are very nervous about selling assets at this point in time with the uncertainty around the cycle now with China situation. We have, in the process, we're in the process right now of closing 2 nice little bolt-on acquisitions worth about $120 million of sales -- or not sales, $125 million of value purchase price, both -- one in Automation Solutions, one in Commercial Residential Solutions, both in the control element part of the pyramid that we always talk about. ","While Mike and I are joined -- and we're going to tag team a little bit on China, give you some insights to this. Let me give a brief overview. I'm going to turn over to Mike, and we'll go back and forth here. ","The China situation first, I want to say something to all my employees. We have 11,000 employees here. We are in constant touch with them. We have the ability to communicate to 80,000 of our employees on an ongoing basis, every minute, every day.","Our hearts are going out with all the people that are locked up in their apartments right now. Fortunately, we are all safe at this point in time. But clearly, they're in their apartments. They're working, communicating, obviously, by phone, by e-mail, as they try to figure out how do we get ready to get going as we come out of this? But our thoughts are with them at this point in time, and it's a concern that we have relative to all our employees, not only there, but also around the world. ","As I look at this right now, it will be a negative impact, and I'll let Mike go through some points here. But from my perspective, assuming that they do allow us to start manufacturing again, and we started, you can see in the supply chain, again, on February 10, I still believe we'll have somewhere between $50 million and $100 million of sales impact. ","Now folks I'm giving you my feel for knowing China and my feel for what I think is going to happen. If this extends, that number will go up, but I'm just giving you my feel. As I look at the sourcing situation we'll show you, I am concerned about the start-up of this, and Mike will give you some numbers around that. I'm concerned about the customers and how fast they'll come back up in lot.","We also have a lot of our customers that do a lot of manufacturing and shipping out of there, and we have components here and there, and I'm concerned about some of that work going on. My perspective is, as I look at the number of $50 million to $100 million right now, some of that will be permanently lost, depending on Bob Sharp's business and the heating system marketplace. Once the heating system is gone, you're going to wait for the next year. ","I firmly believe that Automation Solutions, assuming this doesn't go too long, should make it up before the fiscal year is done or within the calendar year. But again, what I'm looking at right now is the feel that we have based on how long we're going to be shut down and our sort of estimate of how quick this thing will start up.","So Mike, why don't you give them a couple of facts, and we'll go back and forth and talk a little bit more?","Michael Train","All right. Great. David, great to be with everybody this afternoon. Thank you very much. First of all, I also want to share my thanks to our China team, our 11,000 employees. We recently celebrated our 40th anniversary in China. Today, we have a terrific business in China, nearly $2 billion in size, and again, almost 11,000 employees. And we had a solid Q1 in both platforms in that mid-single digits that Pete talked to. ","Secondly, January 15, we saw the signing of the U.S.-China trade deal, which was pretty important. That Phase 1 deal is pretty important to us. I think it also -- there were announcements on both sides, which would be Phase 2 discussions commencing shortly. We're excited by that. It's going to take some time, but we're excited about that. So I wanted to highlight that. But just about that, that same time is when people were recognizing that we have this coronavirus issue. Our employees went out on January 24 for their Chinese New Year holiday. They've been out now for 11 or 12 days. And currently, under the government regulations and guidance, we intend to start -- restart our facilities next Monday, on February 10. ","But we need to make sure that happens. And we'll be watching that. And I think we can report on that a little bit next week...","David Farr","Yes, we can.","Michael Train","I think some of the issues that we're going to face are going to be around as you restart these facilities. Obviously, we're going to have to manage our facilities. We have the temperature monitoring. We have travel restrictions. We're doing everything we need to manage. But our supply chain, I think, will be suffering that -- despite best efforts. It's just going to be a rocky start. The logistics, the supply chain, sub-suppliers and all those kinds of things. So...","David Farr","How much do we have in our supply chain right now, both for China, Mike?","Michael Train","So our supply chain in China's about $750 million. $500 million stays in China, $250 million actually goes out to the global business. So have impacts in China, we'll have impacts beyond China, in terms of that. ","And again, as you were highlight, we have several global customers that use China to build their projects, their modules, that kind of thing. And we're going to see some impacts there that would impact business in other regions beyond China as well. ","So we're starting off with kind of the view of what's going to happen here. I think next week will be a big important week. We'll learn some more things as we go forward. And then maybe we could comment. Again, there's no saying what's going to happen there.","David Farr","We'll do that. Thanks. Thank you, Mike. As I look at this, I referred to the Board yesterday and today, for the people -- I'm aging myself here, the Apollo space programs, in the 5 or 6 minutes, we have their reentry blackouts. We are in that reentry blackout period for China right now. We do not know what we don't know at this point in time. But clearly, the organization for China, who I know are listening on this phone or will be listening on this phone when they get -- wake up, are doing everything they possibly can to get ready right now. ","I just know that the supply chain, the uncertainty, logistics, all these different things, there's a lot of moving parts, the sub-supply chains, the feeders to our supply chain, there's a lot of components here. So for people not to think that it would not be a negative short term, I don't think they're thinking straight. It will be a negative. It will be a negative for the global economy. It will be, potentially, bigger, if it doesn't get started. This thing drags on long time. But right now, our feeling is right, it's not going to drag on. But we're just getting ready for it, and we're trying to get -- we're planning everything around this, so we can execute and make sure they have the resources they need to get the job done. ","They're all geared up to come back to work. We'll give you an update on the 14th as we look at -- on the 13th, I'm sorry, as we look at what happens at 10th, 11th and 12th because we'll get a good feel for this. My gut tells me, it will be a slow recovery, and they'll get their act together and things will happen. But again, we are in that Apollo space program reentry, 5 to 6 minutes, where no one knows what's going on. And when I talk to you on the 13th, you'll give me, \"Houston, we're live.\" and we'll talk about that. ","So again, that's how we see at this point in time. I don't want to scare people. But it's the facts. We do a very major business in China. We're very strong in China. We have a good sense of China. I have -- Mike and I both managed and worked in China for many years together as a team, and we spent a lot of time there. And we're supporting our employees, we're supporting the government, we're supporting our government as we try to work through this. But that's where we sit at this point in time. And we'll keep you informed. ","So I want to thank all the employees. I want to thank the Board's engagement. And I also want to thank the shareholders engagements that I've been having in the last several months, and I will continue to have with our shareholders.","With that, we'll open the lines and we'll take some Q&A to see if we can get some clarity around the concerns and questions people have out there. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. ","John Walsh","So thank you for all that color around China. I guess, just maybe a point of clarification, you kind of detailed what you think the impact could be, but then I guess going through the prepared remarks and looking at the release, you have some comments that the guidance excludes any impact from the coronavirus?","David Farr","Correct. Correct.","John Walsh","Just trying to -- so how do we kind of sensitize that? Is it in the plus the $0.02 minus that you call around next quarter or would it actually be greater than or lower than...?","David Farr","I would say it's in the plus or minus $0.02 right now in that quarter, John, to be honest. Now, we're assuming that we're going to have starting up in the 10th, February 10, and we have a slow ramp. So I see some potential impact to the year at $50 million to $100 million, that plus or minus $0.02, I would say, covers that right now based on what we're seeing on slow start. ","Now if we're sitting there in New York next week and I'm saying, \"Hey, this thing is really grinding and having a hard time both with our customer standpoint and also our supply chain standpoint, we'll have to reconfigure that.\" But right now, that's how we have this factored into play, that plus or minus $0.02. You're exactly right.","John Walsh","Okay. Great. And then just thinking about the margins for the quarter in Automation Solutions, you called out a couple of things in the prepared remarks. I'm just -- as I'm looking at mix for the balance of the year, thinking about North America, about discrete, about maybe some OE greater than aftermarket at some point here. How are you thinking about the cadence of seeing mix be, I guess, maybe less negative as we go through the year? Or how are you thinking about that?","David Farr","So we are -- what we would like to see happen in the cadence of the year, obviously, the first quarter flow. North America was really very negative for us. The discrete business is very negative for us relative to our discrete around the world, so very high profit business, both of those. So the cadence will be expect -- I think we're going to continue to see strong KOB 3, which does help us. I think our cadence is that we see some stability within the oil and gas market space in North America, not growing, but stabilizing.","So as we look at the channels, as we look at our customer base, we'll see some improvement in the flow and discrete business, which will help us a little bit on the margin pressure. And then the rest of the help is going to come from all the restructuring. But you called it right, the flow in discrete right now in North America is a very challenging issue for us. It was very difficult in the last two quarters.","And as we look at this right now, our plan is we see some stability, some improvement, which will help put a little margin win to our back as we get into that second half, and that's where we see it right now. And obviously, you'll be able to tell on our order releases and our comments, basically, how we're seeing it. If you start seeing us say, \"Hey, things have stabilized. Things have improved.\" You'll know, John, that we're seeing a little bit better improvement around that flow business, which is very important to us.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz at Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So, I know you don't want to give us too much color or more color around the $425 million program before the Analyst Day. But as your Board and the consultants reviewed your cost, that opportunity from, what it looks like in FY '20 for the initial $215 million? It looks like the majority is focused on AS versus C&RS or Corporate. So when all said and done, how much confidence does the program give you to get AS margin back up to the 19% margin that you've previously talked about?","David Farr","Yes. So I mean, my confidence level and the Board; as I said, the Board spent 3.5 hours on these actions. We're talking about the Board confidence, my confidence is extremely high at this point in time, extremely. We are taking serious actions.","Bob's business started, you well know, Bob's on his sixth quarter of negative sales. Bob started his cost out 7 quarters ago. So if you look back at his major restructuring, it actually started in late '18 throughout 2019. So what he's working on right now are actions around fixed facilities to try to take some fixed facilities offline and consolidate. So his are a little bit different. That's why you haven't seen a lot with Bob right now, his business over the next couple of years, and he'll be doing a fixed savings, and he's starting to get that. ","I feel very, very confident. Now I'm involved in reviewing the work with Lal and Ram, the Board and I looked at in detail, and we look at the costs, I feel very good about those savings. I feel very good about the bridge chart that we're showing you from the second half. I think the question -- the previous caller, John, asked is very relevant relative to that mix issue, which needed stability.","But as I look at the actions, they're doing right now in the short term, because it's very much people oriented and then we're starting to take some of the longer-term facilities, so I feel very confident we'll start seeing that margin move up in the second half. Anything you want to add to that, Frank?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes. I think we've got a good plan going forward. We're looking for a significant margin improvement in the second half. And a lot of it does depend on the pace of business in the mix. The restructuring actions will kick in, and we're pretty confident in the margin development as we go through the year.","David Farr","And McKinsey reported to the Board yesterday in the work that we did between the two business units and Corporate, and we have additional actions that we can deal with probably starting in another couple of years. We want some backup stuff and some other opportunity, but let's put it this way, our hands are pretty -- our plate's pretty full right now with actions we've got going on. And -- but we're going to study and lay them out and see how we can start flowing some or maybe later this year, early next year to give us some protection in case -- I'm not supposed to swear, but I'm going to swear, \"Oh, [indiscernible] happened.\" ","But from my perspective, we're trying to cover that. McKinsey did a good job explaining how we're protecting what makes Emerson unique, our franchises and the corporation culture, but at the same time, look how we could be more efficient and more effective. It was a very good discussion around from the Board perspective as they pulled back the sheets.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And then you mentioned when you released December orders that they did display some signs of picking up in AS, really in LNG. You said that again today, AS backlog increased 7% sequentially. So did you see a bit of an uptick in project releases by customers? Do you think they become more cautious again as the coronavirus continues to spread? ","And maybe stepping back, it's been a little while since you updated us on the large project funnel, do you still have $1 billion of projects that you've been told you've won but haven't booked? And is your project funnel improving, decreasing or roughly stable?","David Farr","So I mean, you've hit a nail in the head here. The issue right now, I think the North America projects we're starting to see release, I'm very worried as I'm sure my customers are worried about because a lot of that business is going to be shipped -- production will be shipped to China. And so my concern is if this coronavirus goes longer, it could delay those projects, and it could slow down some of the projects we think that should be released here in the next couple of months. ","So the coronavirus has an impact on many, many things relative to our business base. So therefore, that's why we are still convinced that the second half could be a challenge for us, and that's how we're banking at that 0 growth because of things like that. Now the projects we see releasing, and I still believe will release, are the Middle East and India. Those projects are separate from the work been going on in China. But I would say the Middle East, Mike, you and I were just there. China, I mean, the India projects. So I feel good about those. And I think that will help us as we fill up that pipeline for the second half of the year and then as we move into 2021.","But we've got to get some settlements, some resolution on the corona. We've got to get some traveling. And if we don't, then that's going to clearly slow down some of the North America projects.","Operator","The next question is from Gautam Khanna at Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. I was just curious, what is your expectation this year for KOB 1 as a percentage of Automation Solutions revenue?","David Farr","Okay. I'm rubbing my rally monkey's head here a little bit, Gautam. So I can see if -- okay. So I'll give you my feeling right now, okay? I think we're going to be around 25% for KOB 1. I think we will be 57% -- 57%, 58% for KOB 3, and so what's that mean for the -- 18% for KOB 2. That's where I think we're going to be right now. And I don't have any crystal ball more than you, but that's where I see -- I look at the pipelines, I look at the things we're talking about right now. We are -- we shared with the Board we're not backing off any of the KOB 3 investments. We have the organization highly motivated to try to take some market share on installed base. We're focusing other things that cut our costs around. But that area right now is ripe for us to continue to take share. And we want to build that KOB 3 up strongly because those projects will start flowing, and it'll help us offset the margin dilution from the projects.","Gautam Khanna","Got it. And not to steal thunder from next week, but how far out do you anticipate providing long-term financial targets? This is a fiscal '22? Or what are you thinking? Like how long are you right now projecting?","David Farr","I think we're going '23. We're going to go '23. We will bridge -- we will bridge the $450 million. And what we see -- I mean, as you know, I try to be honest and transparent, sort of like the Iowa caucus. I will try to bridge for the 2021 numbers. These guys are all -- they can't handle this -- they can't handle the truth. They could not be in any movies like me. But they -- we'll bridge that, so you can see what -- the $450 million we talked about, and then we'll talk about what we see going on going forward.","You're going to see a much lower sales forecast as we manage the growth to keep it -- we're focusing on the cost and until I see some really strength in what's going to happen to underlying growth, we're going to keep that growth rate down and manage around costs. So we'll give you that bridge. But think '23, but also -- I'll tell you what I think about '21 and what we told you last year. I always try to bridge what I committed to.","Operator","The next question is from John Inch at Gordon Haskett.","John Inch","Okay. So I just want to be clear. So the $215 million of restructuring, the $95 million that we did last year, Dave, you talked about reviewing this with the Board. Does this mean on the 13th when you talk about the Board's review or you present it, that there is no new restructuring on top of that? The restructuring basically is now confined to what you've articulated? Or is there more still potential?","David Farr","No. What I just laid out for this year is locked and -- okay, is it going to $210 million? Is it going to be $220 million? Yes, that's what we're talking about right there at this point in time. We are and -- but we're going to show you '21 and what we're going for, as you well know, we wanted to try to get everything done within a 24-month time period best we could. So we're going to -- we did a little bit last quarter.","I mean, in the fourth fiscal quarter last year. We're doing a lot right now in this period right here in '20. We're going to be doing a pretty busy '21. But when we get out of '21, I want to move back towards our stability run rate of restructuring, which typically is around $50 million. So you're going to see how we go up to over $400 million total in the cycle and how we're focusing that. But what we told you this year, that number ain't changing unless I have -- okay, I shouldn't say ain't because it could change. ","But if we had something happen to the world relative to a major change, and we have to refocus, something happens in China, something happens with the business, but right now, that's what we locked and loaded. And I would say that's going to keep our hands full for the year.","John Inch","So what we're going to hear then on the 13th other than the traditional analyst review, the Board -- you guys have McKinsey in there. You've done this, obviously, top to bottom look through. You're going to be talking about the strategy or the payback? Or -- so if there's no more new restructuring, what should we expect? Like...","David Farr","We're going to talk about macro restructuring. We're going to talk about outcome is on the review of our businesses. We're going to talk about the cash flow generation and how we're going to allocate that cash flow generation for the next couple of years, and some fundamental strategies. You're going to see a presentation on digital transformation coming out from one of Lal's key new platform leaders, which we built. Or yes, not platform, but business level units presence. And then we'll also -- we're going to give you an update on what -- on the Final Control work that Ram's doing. Ram's going to give a presentation on where he's taking this to the next level. So there's a lot -- there's going to be a lot of strategy, the company insights, what we're doing and how we're going to drive. ","But fundamentally, I want you to walk away with the strategies in place, and we're driving cost, and we're going to drive around that business. We're also going to give you an update after 18 months of owning the Textron Tools business. We're going to give you an update around the professional tools and how that program is going. Both B&C and the professional tool ones are going very well, and they're a key part of our repositioning effort to drive value. ","And Tim's down here in the room, down here he's real happy because he's going to be part of that, maybe. And we're thinking about -- there's a couple of positions open like HR and maybe plant management and we're going to put him in there and see if he's going to do anything different.","Operator","The next question is from Deepa Raghavan at Wells Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Just a quick question on the -- clarification on the EPS range that you are maintaining. We understand the coronavirus impacts are not easy to assess. But how does the $3.67 guidance at midpoint feel given what we know now? It looks like there's a virus impact, your North American region is trending below your expectations. Just curious, do these newer headwinds just put the upper part of the sales range, but keep the midpoint -- sorry, upper part of the EPS guide range intact -- but sorry, risk is to the upper part of the EPS range, but keeps the midpoint impact? Or is there any risk to the midpoint also at this point in time?","David Farr","No, we wouldn't put a guidance out there. I didn't think -- I mean, we can believe we can hit both ends of this, both the top and the bottom, the middle. But our feeling right now, based on the trend lines is that the midpoint is the most likely. The upper point even with the coronavirus because we're assuming that they'll get -- it will come back, and production will start coming back up. And we'll start calling back some of that -- the $50 million to $100 million of sales.","So we fundamentally believe that, that range is still viable, even with everything we face around the world at this point in time. The cost actions are happening. We get a little bit more cost out. From the timing issue, it's always a lot of timing in there. It can help our margins, and obviously, help the EPS. So at this point in time, that range is very -- we're very comfortable in that range. And we feel -- I mean, my highest probability, clearly, is at that 0, but I also see -- I still see some potential on the positive side, too.","Deepa Raghavan","All right. Another clarification question is on China, again. Can you ring-fence what percent of your China sales or profits are in the affected areas versus your overall China exposure? I know you gave us a supply chain number, and the impact is...","David Farr","No, I think we can't do that. That China sales are -- we saw across all of the markets depending on where the -- which customer is going on right now, the customers are going to be further west, east north. Now we -- there's no way we can break that down at this point in time.","I mean, it's going to be a -- this one is going to be kind of fluid as we see things moving back up. And I know our sales force are going to try to figure out how they can claw some of those back. So these -- they're going to be pretty energized to figure out how to get that business back. It may come in a different location. So I -- it's -- there's nothing says at this point in time.","Operator","Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe a first question on Slide 13, the restructuring costs and earnings tailwinds. So you have the restructuring costs of $0.26, the benefit this year of $0.07. So that balance is sort of $0.19. Do we assume that, that's a mix of what's recognized in 2021? And also, what's kind of reinvested in 2020 and things like the service network? Just wondered how we thought about that drop through?","David Farr","So now we will share with you how the savings are going to flow up in '21 and '22, and I'm not sharing that with you yet. But we'll share that out with you. ","So you're trying to see, I mean, say that again, Julian? Say that one more time?","Julian Mitchell","Sure. So it's just that on that Slide 13, you're spending about $0.26 worth of restructuring this year, and you're recognizing $0.07 as the benefit. So I just wondered that balance of $0.19, is it all coming next year? Or a portion of that $0.19 is just -- is reinvested into the business?","David Farr","No. No. No. So a big chunk of our savings will come next year of the delta, the spend from the standpoint. The area that we'll still have some delay out is going to be around the facility restructuring in the facilities because that may not start falling until early '22 or late '21. But what we see there is there's -- the reinvestments built into our core plan, we took the cost out. And we've netted that out already. There's nothing else going on here from that standpoint.","Those savings will flow, and there'll be a -- there should be a significant increase in savings as we move into '21, and you'll see that and as Lal talks about his repositioning effort. And as you know, there's very little cash being impacted here because we're pretty -- we've been pretty good about managing that cash flow and trying to keep it cash neutral.","So those savings and multiple, I would say, 90% of those savings will flow back into '21, and we'll still have a little tail hanging over us in '22 from this restructuring right there you're talking about.","Julian Mitchell","That helps. And then my second question, just on the top line outlook in Automation Solutions. Maybe just focused on the sort of chemicals and petrochem piece of Automation Solutions. Some companies last week like AspenTech sounded pretty negative on chemical spending. Some of the customers in petrochem like Chevron or ExxonMobil are under some pressure. So I know you had good orders growth in your chemicals and petrochem piece in calendar Q4. Do you think that can continue through this year? Or it's more likely to get sort of lumpier?","David Farr","Right now, we still feel pretty good about it. Now I don't think -- I think the first quarter number was a little bit stronger than I thought it would be. We had some project business come in there. But Julian, I don't -- we're not too worried about that at this point in time. Now I'd like to see another quarter of what's going on there. But that business, that petrochemical, the chemical businesses, and as we know, we serve a lot broader group of that customer base than an AspenTech will serve.","Frank Dellaquila","And our KOB 3, first of all.","David Farr","Yes. And we've got strong KOB 3 going on right there. So I don't feel concerned about that. I'm more worried about the upstream side and the new oil and gas investments. I think what I see coming down the downstream right now, I feel better about it. And that's a very high KOB 3 marketplace. And as I said earlier, when some of the guys asked me, I firmly believe we'll continue to see some improvement in KOB 1. So I'm more optimistic about that.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague at Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","I guess this kind of dovetails off an earlier question, but just kind of thinking about incrementals. So obviously, if we're in a no-growth environment, incrementals is kind of a non-constant, I guess, right? But are you suggesting to us though that we should assume you do some kind of normal 30% or so incremental on growth, and we can drop at the end of this 2 or 3 year period of time, $425 million of savings on top of that?","David Farr","Yes. That's what we're talking about doing here. I mean, if we -- we're going to have the incremental growth in sales. We'll show that to you as we lay out our plan, and then obviously, the restructuring that we're going to flow through. And as someone -- I think Julian has asked me about the reinvestments. So we'll lay that detail. We went through that with the Board because they want -- the Board is very, very interested in making sure we don't cut key programs long term. But we're trying to structurally make some changes here so that -- that it does flow through. The key thing right now is we're banking on very little growth here for the next 12 to 18 months. That's the key issue.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes. And that 30% to 35%, is that kind of the ZIP code you're comfortable with for incremental?","David Farr","I think we're building on 30% from that standpoint. That's what we're building it on, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then on the LNG stuff, so it was good to see some of the orders come through. Just wondering two things. Was the stuff that was released and hit your order book deliverable from a revenue standpoint for 2020 as it currently stood? And...","David Farr","I don't think we'll see any deliveries on that. I think you could have some progress payments and some of the stuff...","Frank Dellaquila","Yes. Stuff that went to orders, and we'll start working on it. And what we've...","David Farr","Yes. And so what we -- we probably -- we will probably have some progress payments in the latter part of 2020. It'll be more falling into '21. As you well know that where these bookings will go, you'll see more coming. It goes -- obviously, the compressors and the big LNG projects, our systems, then the control valves, then instrumentation. So we are in the early stages of this 4 way right now. So we should -- we're anticipating here in the next 2, 3, 4 months a continuation of booking some stuff. And I wouldn't see that we'll book money sales this year to be more than 2021, but I guarantee we'll have some progress payments probably in the Systems in late this year.","Jeffrey Sprague","So if you thought of your total scope on these projects, kind of total Emerson scope like what have you booked so far? We're talking like only 10% or 20% of the project value so far?","Frank Dellaquila","We expect are very small.","David Farr","Very small. Very small. Very small. And that's one of the concerns, I think, I can't remember which of you guys mentioned this, my concern is this whole book. Coronavirus, could that slow down the process here a little bit again, as we've got it going again with trade deal that Mike mentioned. There was the trade -- first, Phase 1, and now the coronavirus, will that slow things down again? That's always a concern of mine. That's why we need to get through this, and so we can get a little bit more visibility on what everyone's going to do. But right now, we should have a lot more bookings around those major projects.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","Patrick Baumann","This is actually Pat Baumann on for Steve Tusa. So yes, so he gave me an opportunity to harass you. Hey, on the restructuring, can you explain why you're seeing minimal net cash impacts from the actions you're taking? And then what was the comment on the cash flow based taxes you made about healthy results?","David Farr","Yes. So go ahead.","Frank Dellaquila","This is Frank. There's a lag on the spend versus when we book the expense that's pretty significant as we get out of the gate here. And then a not insignificant portion of the restructuring is noncash. It's facilities, it's asset write-downs and things of that nature. So when we wash it all through, we think the net impact in 2020 will probably be not terribly significant, less than $50 million.","David Farr","Yes. I mean, a lot of times, and the people, which was our front-load late last year, early this year, there's cash upfront, but you get -- eventually you get some of that cash back because you're not paying. So it washes out and right now -- and cash generation is pretty good. So I mean net's going to be pretty neutral. The taxes, just basically some work that Frank's been doing relative to some are international subs as we go through this process...","Frank Dellaquila","Yes. It's just ongoing reorganizations that we've been doing. We've had several discrete tax benefits last year. I don't expect them to be the same magnitude this year, but we will have a little bit here and there, and we had a -- we get to know the cash tax savings that actually went through into the cash flow in the first quarter.","Patrick Baumann","What will be the net cash out for the $425 million you mentioned?","David Farr","Oh, I don't have the number off the top of my head. It's -- Frank, do you have a number, a rough number?","Frank Dellaquila","I have, I would say, in the end, 80%, 85% of it is probably going to be cash...","David Farr","Over time. Yes.","Frank Dellaquila","It's lumpy. I mean, the timing is the key.","David Farr","And the key issue there is that the sooner you get some of the cash impact once done, the faster you get the cash payback, because it takes off quickly. The facility one's are the hardest part because they -- the cash goes out, and then you don't get the savings for a long time.","Patrick Baumann","Okay. Maybe switching gears, just -- can you give us an update on what you're seeing in resi, a few markets in North America. What did the business do for sales in the quarter? And kind of what's your outlook there for this year?","David Farr","I mean, North America is still in a tough zone right now. We're in sort of the middle of winter here, flat to slightly down. Don't -- I mean, it's hard to say how fast. I mean, the one thing I'd like is a residential marketplace truck. Construction's doing good. That's a good sign. Typically, we start seeing some payback and some improvement here as we get into that March time period. So that's not going to be -- it's not going to be much of a change until we get into a little bit warm weather.","We had a good quarter in Asia and China. That was before everything happened there that bothers me. And so I'm a little bit concerned about that now as we come out of it. We hear from President Xi, he's going to try and pump up the financing and try to get some spending going to get the economy going, a strong stimulus, which could -- typically, that goes after the market, the commercial residential guys go after versus the auto solution guys done. ","But right now, our HVAC business in North America is weak. And we're forecasting probably our sixth down quarter in total for commercial residence, globally. And then the question is, can we see some improvement as we move into the second half of the year.","Patrick Baumann","Did you see anything in the orders in January out of China that made you -- makes you concerned at all about the business there? Or is there more just like -- what do you expect?","David Farr","They were -- they were pretty much what we expected. It's slightly negative. It was not that good. Again, it's a short month because it's the Chinese New Year. And so from that perspective, it's a pretty small month. But I'm really worried about what we -- we're trying to take orders over the phone right now. We're still alive, but there's not much business going on. So I'm really worried about as we get into this post February 10 as we start seeing what people do, what happens in that? And that -- so it's certainly live here after that February 10 time period comes in for the next 2 or 3 weeks to see if there's any slowdown or pick back up, we'll see.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie at Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie","So just focused on Automation Solutions for a second, and really first. And really just trying to think about the margin step-up expected in your fiscal second quarter. So clearly, there's definitely some headwinds out there. We talked about coronavirus. I'm just curious, like, are things expected to get better, much better, in fiscal 2Q versus fiscal 1Q from a mix standpoint? And then, secondly, clearly, you guys took a lot of restructuring actions here in the first quarter. And so do we start seeing a pretty sizable benefit from those actions in fiscal 2Q?","David Farr","Yes. Okay. So did you back into Auto Sol's margins in the second quarter? Is that what you did?","Joseph Ritchie","Yes, I backed in as well -- I mean, you have margins up.","David Farr","Yes, you could back into them. Yes. So there's two things. One, auto sales, if you think about progression, our second quarter sales typically are seasonally higher and that, obviously, in the second quarter. And we are expecting some stability around the mix of business around that flow in the discrete business. So that is not -- that's normal for us. So -- and then we've obviously started to get some savings, some of the $35 million that we spend aggressively in the fourth quarter. Most of that was around Auto Sol. And obviously, a lot of the $97 million over -- almost, I think, $85 million of it was around Auto Sol in the first quarter. ","And so you're seeing -- those guys are going to start seeing that benefit more and more about that as they go into that second quarter and clearly ramps up into the third and fourth quarters. But that's how we see it right now, and the savings are happening because these are really near-term cost actions that are taken.","Joseph Ritchie","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then, I guess, just my one follow-up. I saw that there's no change to the buyback portion of the bridge. I guess the question I have is, like, look, your balance sheet is in great shape. You guys have the opportunity to toggle it up if you want to and be a little bit more aggressive with the buyback. I guess at this juncture, like, what's holding you back from potentially doing a little bit more?","David Farr","I mean, first of all, I think if you look at our history, we buy back substantially more stock than most people. And secondly, we also continue to want to work on the acquisition front, an investment company. If we feel that we don't have the opportunities, we'll continue to take that buyback up. But right now, if I look at what we've bought back the last several years, there's been a pretty high pace, and I don't see any reason to take it any higher at this point in time. ","Now the Board always reviews that if we see the acquisition front state is very moderate, then we're going to have the situation coming forth that we're going to have to increase the leverage and the balance sheet. But keep in mind, I've said it again, we're already paying back shareholders 85% of our cash flow in 2020. 85%. That is a good number.","Operator","Our last question comes from Robert McCarthy at Stephens.","Robert McCarthy","I guess the first question, have you had any contact with the Chinese authorities about the nature of the response, what they need to do, any kind of comfort around that? Because, obviously, it seems to be there's definitely a credibility gap that seems to be emerging over the last couple of days? And any thoughts around that just given the fact that you have substantial tendrils in China.","David Farr","Our organization, we have a leadership there. The team's in constant contact with the Chinese government, and we get a -- Mike and I and the top OC get a daily report back out from what they're being told by the government, both at the national level and the local level. ","I mean, I disagree that the Chinese government are misleading people. I feel they've been very open to us. Now everyone wants a hard answer, but you can't get a hard answer in something that's moving like this. ","But as I look at the consistent information I'm getting from the government and to the regional governments to my people and my leadership team that reports into Mike, I feel very good about it. So my comfort level right now is pretty high.","But key issue for me is can they get the plant there -- a lot of the people go back to work if nothing else major happens here. And then can the supply chain start mobilizing, because logistics could be a problem as things start flowing around. But it's just a matter of getting planning. And I know Mike and all the guys and gals across China are working this pretty hard right now. So I feel -- my comfort level is pretty good, assuming they can hold that tent. Or if it goes to 11% to 12%, that does a big deal. Within that, a couple of days, that's -- Rob. ","So I feel -- I think we're ready at this point in time. But again, it goes back to the Apollo moon shots when it comes back in the United States, we're in that blackout period right now, the reentry blackout period for about the next 5 or 6 days.","Robert McCarthy","Yes. I mean, to that point, it's almost -- it seems like your guidance outlook could have two very almost binary outcomes or trajectories because, one, you could see global synchronous downturn, real problems with supply chain, demand destruction in oil impacting your projects to a material degree. But then, obviously, high visibility on you in terms of your cost actions.","Conversely, if we do have a quicker than expected resolution to this, you could see a pronounced rebound in oil, which would probably be broadly stimulative of upstream projects. You could see the -- an upside to growth, overall, which -- and obviously, maybe attentively, M&A, but that obviously puts a lot more pressure on you to deliver the restructuring in what would be fundamentally a different demand environment. How do you square the circle in terms of where we could be?","David Farr","Yes. I don't -- first of all, I'm not in the Pandora's box, which is your first thing, where you might as well throw in a couple of locus to tax and maybe some ships going down and claims going down at the same time there. And I'm not in that side of the equation. I think that -- and I -- there are -- I could say that there could be some positives as this thing recovers pretty quickly, I feel that. But I'm more in the status right now that this thing slowly recovers and regrowth comes back. ","We probably lose a couple of points of the high-single-digit growth that we were talking about for China, which takes a little bit away from us a little bit. So I'm more the glass half full than the glass empty or glass awful, we see this one.","Frank Dellaquila","Even if they're doing stimulus, it's going to really be more than that, make it to next year, even.","David Farr","Yes. I think we get -- let's -- I know everyone's trying to guess, second guess this. I think you've got to wait -- those dates, the 10th, and they've been holding here pretty consistent. If those things hold in let's say, the 10th or 11th, going back to work and we start seeing the plants up and running, then I feel good about that. Now If the plants start starting up and they start failing, and that could be a good thing for us because it's obviously business. But I think we've got to watch that. So you've got to listen to all your -- all the people you follow and listen to them and see how things are starting. And I think that will be the key indication. Are they starting up or not starting up? Where they getting the supplies? I think you're going to hear people communicate that pretty loud and clear.","David Farr","I want to thank everybody. Again, I want to thank the global organization. I want to thank the investors and the shareholders for supporting us as we go through this process. Thank you very much now. Bye.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"7702":["Emerson Electric Co.

(Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, May 6, 2014.","Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead sir.","Patrick Fitzgerald - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Vince. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize Emerson\u2019s second quarter 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson\u2019s website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.","I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 2% to $5.8 billion, with underwriting sales up 2%. Sales were lower than expected primarily due to harsh winter weather and weak GDP growth in the U.S. as well as a slowdown of the global project execution in the process industry. At the same time, process customers proceeded with plans for future investments helping drive total Emerson orders of 9% in the quarter with strong acceleration in March.","Gross profit margin expanded 140 basis points to 41.2%, while EBIT margin was unchanged from the prior year as currency volatility affected comparisons by $35 million and the Artesyn Technologies equity investment reported a loss of $34 million. EBIT margin improved 60 basis points excluding the equity loss. GAAP earning per share of $0.77 equaled the prior year. Cash generation was strong overcoming lost cash flow from Artesyn divestiture. Operationally, there is a strong execution in the quarter despite the economic weakness in non-operating items.","Moving to Slide 3, P&L summary, as I stated, sales declined 2% and the Artesyn divestiture deducted 5% and acquisitions added 1%, just as underlying sales grew 2%. 140 basis points of gross profit margin improvement is driven by portfolio changes and cost containment. SG&A expense declined in large part due to lower stock compensation expense. Significant restructuring costs in the Artesyn investment contributed to an equity loss and other deductions of $34 million. Additionally, currency volatility swung from gains in the prior year, but losses in the second quarter for a change of $35 million. Reported EBIT margin was flat or up 16 basis points due to an equity loss. 3.3 million shares were repurchased for $214 million, such that earnings per share of $0.77 was unchanged from prior year.","Next slide, sales by geography. By region, underlying sales grew in the U.S. by 3%, Europe by 1%, Asia by 4% which includes China growth of 9%, Latin America by 3% and Canada by 2%. Middle East and Africa declined 9% affected by robust growth in the prior year quarter. Total underlying sales increased 2%. Strong momentum continued in China where all business segments grew for the third consecutive quarter.","Moving to Slide 5, business segment earnings and cash flow, a 2% decline in business segment EBIT includes $35 million unfavorable impact from currency volatility. Corporate expense reflects the Artesyn equity loss partially offset by lower stock compensation expense. Looking down to cash flow, flat reported results overcame lost operating cash from Artesyn divestiture. Higher capital expenditures reflected ongoing growth and productivity investments. Trade working capital improvement improved due to strong inventory and payables performance.","Next slide Process Management, Process Management underlying sales grew 1% with North America up 6%, Asia down 1% which includes China up 5%, Europe up 4%, Latin America down 3% and Middle East and Africa down 14%. Acquisitions added 4% and currency translation deducted 1%, but net sales growth up 4%. Growth momentum continued in energy and chemical industries with more cautious project implementations by customers slowed sales growth. U.S. strength drove growth in North America with growth in Europe led by North Sea project activity. Asia declined as softness and difficult comparisons in India and Australia offset 5% growth in China. Middle East and Africa witnessed reflected ongoing political instability in the region. The decline in margin was primarily due to currency volatility that lowered earnings by $31 million. Orders increased 12% led by unconventional upstream oil and gas projects. The robust orders growth reinforced continued strength in process automation markets particularly in North America.","Moving to Slide 7, Industrial Automation, Industrial Automation net and underlying sales grew 2% with North America up 1%, Asia up 6% including China up 18%, Europe flat, Latin America up 7% and Middle East and Africa up 1%. Demand improved for capital goods especially in emerging markets. Asia growth was led by China where mature markets were slower. Modest growth in the fluid automation, motors and drives, electrical distribution and hermetic motors businesses offset modest declines in the mechanical power transmission and power generating alternators businesses. Orders growth accelerated to a high single digit rate in the quarter led by double digit growth in power generating alternators. The order strength supports the expectation for improved growth in the second half with acceleration in the U.S. and Europe.","Next slide, Network Power, Network Power underlying sales increased 1% with the U.S. up 2%, Asia up 4% including China up 6%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 8% and Middle East and Africa flat. The Artesyn divestiture deducted 21% and currency translation deducted 1% where net sales declined 21%. Growth was solid in telecommunications markets led by U.S. and Europe with China and India also up. Demand for datacenter technologies remained slow overall as growth in Asia and North America was offset by weakness in Europe and Latin America. The margin expansion reflects the Artesyn divestiture benefit partially offset by strategic investment programs. High-single digit orders growth reflects improving global market conditions especially in Europe. Gradual recovery in datacenter markets is expected to continue with the outlook for modest growth unchanged.","Next slide, Climate Technologies, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 6% with North America up 2%, Asia up 11% including China up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America up 46% and Middle East and Africa down 4%. The global refrigeration business was strong particularly in transportation along with modest growth in air conditioning markets. U.S. sales were strongest in the temperature sensors business, up double digits with the residential air conditioning up mid single digits and commercial up low single digits. Strong demand in China drove Asia led by the refrigeration solutions and sensors businesses. Europe market conditions continued to improve. Order trends remain steady led by strong growth in Europe, global refrigeration markets are expected to remain strong along with improving market conditions in the U.S.","Moving to Slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions, Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales increased 1% with North America down 1%, Asia up 18%, including China up 23%; Europe, up 10%; Latin America, down 7%; and Middle East and Africa, up 23%. The strong growth in international markets offset weakness in the U.S. related to the harsh winter weather. Growth was led by the professional tools, wet\/dry vacuums and food waste disposers businesses. Profitability in the segment remains very strong. Orders growth acceleration in the quarter reflects recovery from the weather impact. U.S. residential and commercial construction markets are expected to improve supporting stronger growth in the second half.","Next slide, 2014 outlook, robust orders growth in the quarter reflects continued improvement in the global macroeconomic environment. Large multi-year industrial projects and recovering demand for capital goods helped drive order strength. At the same time, uncertainty persisted in some markets as reflected in the anemic U.S. GDP growth in the first calendar quarter. Recovery appears underway based on March orders with preliminary trailing three-month orders growth in April are approximately 8%.","Based on current market, the 2014 outlook is unchanged with underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%, reported sales change of minus 1% to 1% reflecting the embedded computing and power divestiture, completed acquisitions and currency translation, margin expansion of approximately 0.5%, excluding charges in the prior year and equity loss in the current year, and reported earnings per share of $3.60 to $3.80, up 4% to 7% excluding impairment and repatriation charges in the prior year.","And with that, I will turn over to David Farr.","David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Pat. Thank you everybody for joining us today. I appreciate it. First, I want to also thank (Technical Difficulty) this quarter with solid margin improvement, strong cash flow making up for the cash we lost from the sale of embedded and then also pressing forward on the strong internal growth initiatives, both in the service area, solutions areas and technology to try to drive longer term growth across our Emerson businesses. Yes, the quarter sales were much weaker than we anticipated in February as we met in Boston, snowy Boston based primarily on a much weaker U.S. residential marketplace for us.","As I look at the various markets from what we saw in February to what actually finished at the end of the March quarter, Europe was stronger, China was stronger, India weaker, Middle East weaker, Latin America weaker, primarily because of Brazil and a little bit slowdown in Mexico with the election and the changes in the energy programs. In addition, we saw with the quarter of being much weaker, just from the general economics view around the world, we saw some of our large \u2013 our large process industrial customers really start slowing down with the execution of the projects that we have underway, not canceling, but just slowing them down and pushing them out. In fact, orders have continued to be strong, so that the confidence is there in our customer base, they are just slowing it down.","As we look at the late March and April orders on a per day basis, because there are several days moving back and forth with the Easter and the Easter holiday and the various holidays this year. On average right now, we are growing underlying orders around this 8%, 9% high single-digit basis. So, we had April again looking at pretty good orders. Again, this is the third month as I look at orders trending upwards. And so I think that the key thing for us right now is orders have turned. We now clearly need to continue to execute and delivering at the high level backlog we have right now and drive down the backlog and deliver those sales in the second half of the year.","Again, just stepping back and thinking about the markets that we have faced today versus February when we talked about them the one real negative is that U.S. residential marketplace is much, much weaker than we saw back in February. On the positive side, non-residential continues to solidify and we are actually seeing that look stronger in the second half of this year both here in the United States and other markets around the world. In Europe, I feel better about it, except for the unfortunate situation between the Russia-Ukraine situation and Eastern Europe and potential slowdown impact on Europe, but right now, Europe continues to look better than it did originally in trending the way you want to trend.","And if you look at the world, it has been a very, very muted global economic recovery coming out 2008, 2009 recovery. Not much of the typical recovery from business or the consumer or the investment profile. As we talked about in February, we are going against this and we are pushing hard both internally. We make it internal investments in technologies. We are making investments right now in our capacity capabilities, our productivity capabilities our new product initiatives. We are pushing our money that we have generated record level of the cash flow into the company to drive higher levels of growth. We have also stepped up our acquisitions in the first couple of months of this year already spending $1.2 billion targeted $1.5 billion and we will continue to push pretty hard that how we can emphasize and increase our acquisitions for external growth going forward here in the next couple of years. Clearly our balance sheet, our operational performance, our cash flow is at the level that we can invest more aggressively to drive growth and push away through this what I call is globally muted recovery as this continues to happen around is from month-to-month.","Overall cash flow very good, we are increasing our capital spending this year as you know we are up \u2013 we will be driving close to $800 million of capital, up from less than $700 million last year. Investing in our new products, our innovation, our global capacity utilization areas, investing in productivity and focusing on how we can make the company stronger and drive a more profitable business and try to drive little bit faster growth. So overall, the quarter clearly disappointing from the top line growth, I was pleased with the execution with the operations from profitability and cash flow. And the recovery rather will continue to move forward but at a very, very slow pace. I would not take much. Unfortunately did not back some of the economic recovery and particularly in Europe if we saw situation emerge relative to Russia, Ukraine and whole Eastern Europe. So concerns but at this point in time we are pushing forward our investments and we will continue to push forward our investments to drive better growth, better always the profitability and better returns for our shareholders.","We are still targeting to deliver back to our shareholders this year at least 60% of our operating cash flow right now our trend probably is a little bit above 60% unless we see external investments that we see the opportunity coming back, we will keep at that level and so we see the money needed to grow the company faster.","With that, we will open the phones for questions and answers.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) The first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi, good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Dave you mentioned in your comments this have been a different type or recovery and that I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think we would all agree with that, but based on the order book that you have it seems pretty strong and just the backlog and then you look at it things like process where there is some pretty big projects coming down the pipe, does it feel like to you that we are at the tipping point here where that investments spend is getting ready to really kicking to re-offer the cycle or do you still you feel like that\u2019s vulnerable?","David Farr","My discussions with the customer based, the CEOs out there is that we are all starting to push forward and spending more money. I am not alone if you look at our spending pace right now we made the decision a little bit earlier than some of our customers to push forward. Scott, I feel is that that tipping point the one big negative give is also as you saw the situation really unfold in Europe where the European economies really starting to stall again. Then I think you would see the CEOs around the world will be a very cautious again and pull back. But right now I feel significantly more positive about that tipping points coming and that\u2019s for \u2013 therefore we are going to push forward. We are seeing the desire that we would see the core pace but people still will be concerned about the world things happening. And today people can react so much faster than ever before I became CEO back in 2000.","Scott Davis - Barclays","So I guess the natural and these are all high class problems I suppose but good natural follow-up on that is just specifically in process, I mean if you look at the projects that have been announced in chemicals and oil and gas, refinery, etcetera. I mean there is a lot, lot of project in that 2015 to 2018 timeframe I mean how do you balance between having a natural level skepticism that a big chunk of them might get cancelled, to the other side of it where you really need to invest pretty heavily to make sure you are there because there could be some \u2013 I would imagine some capacity constraints when you get to that time period, if not in products but in just engineering talent and man power, I mean how do you think about that Dave?","David Farr","Right now based on the code activity which is \u2013 continues to be at record levels both in the process world and some of our industrial space too, we are pushing forward. We are going to make \u2013 we are making the investments because I see the order book, I see the projects we are winning. I saw the projects coming down the pipe down this \u2013 again this month. And I feel very confident that these projects will go forward. They may take rather than 18 months to be unfold they might take 24 months, I feel quite strongly they are going to happen because the capacity is needed. I know where this product is going, so I feel they will happen and we have to get out in front of that because we are winning clearly a strong fair share of those orders, well if you look at the order pace coming out of process and the improving industrial for us too. So we have to be ahead of it and that\u2019s what we are doing we are investing.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Okay, good. Good luck Dave. I will pass it on.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Scott thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - Citi","Thank you. Good morning everyone or good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi","Dave can we go back to you are reaffirming the guidance, but we are well into the second half and you are baking in some second half ramp and especially in process maybe just talk a bit more about within the segments what sort of upside you are expecting how that ramps, is it a question of easier comps or are there some opportunities that are in baked in the second half assumptions?","David Farr","On the early cycle businesses the Climate Technology business and the Residential Solutions business some of our early cycle industrial businesses, we are seeing the activity to start picking back up again. So we are expecting them to get a little bit stronger in the second half of the year. Right now, Climate Technologies is still looking at a very good year on a global basis. They have had a good first half. I think we will have \u2013 I think they personally will have a better second half. On the industrial space, the process guys, the Industrial Automation guys, the Network Power guys have the orders. It\u2019s a matter of getting execution around those orders and getting some what I would call incremental book to ship type businesses. Our backlog right now has the capability to deliver in the second half of the year.","We need to execute around that backlog and we need some of the early cycle guys, which we are starting to see as we have seen in the last I would say the last 45 days of orders we need to see if those orders go into \u2013 being booked and shipped. And I think that\u2019s where we are coming from right now. Profitability wise, we have the capability right now our cost structure is in good shape, the price costs is in good shape, it\u2019s just the matter of getting that sales booked, which we are and taking the backlog down and then getting out the door. And then I firmly believe going back to the question from the previous person asking based on what I see right now if things are stepping up we are going to see going into 2015 with a strong pace of business for us.","Deane Dray - Citi","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. And just to go back on one of the comment you have made on process particularly and maybe just reconcile because it seems a bit contradictory. One, you said some of the customers are pushing out projects, but project implementation is slowing them down. Meanwhile you have seen a pickup in what you call robust order growth are these separate parts, separate end markets within process or it would seem that you wouldn\u2019t see the same customers making both actions?","David Farr","Well, you have \u2013 yes, you do it because some of these projects are getting much larger and then more complex and they are not \u2013 I mean obviously we have more than two customers in process. So from our perspective we are seeing customers around the world some will slow it down and try \u2013 spread their capital around a little longer to make sure that they don\u2019t get ahead of what they from a capacity standpoint. And secondly you will start seeing also from the standpoint of customers have long-term projects they want to get them going. They want to get the engineering work done and get in the queue. So you are seeing both. The activity level and the global process world by industry is sitting at record levels and we have not seen that curtail that much, it maybe a slower growth rate this year but it\u2019s still a pretty good, it\u2019s still running at pretty high levels. So there is \u2013 yes they got one foot on the gas pedal, one foot tapping the brake and they are doing both right now and which is un-incumbent for us.","Deane Dray - Citi","Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks ","David Farr","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","I just wanted to follow up on the sort of 8% to 9% run rate you talked about on orders, I mean, I guess is that a run-rate that you expect to continue for some time or is that 8%, 9% really just reflecting the one-off big boost you had in the March sort of standalone month or do you think you can see 8% to 9% as a daily orders increase for some time?","David Farr","I would \u2013 the word some time is a long time. I would say that Julian as I look to the last six weeks is growing this 8%, 9%, I think you could see a couple months of that at this point, my visibility from that standpoint. If you saw a solidification of the residential marketplace and start seeing that pick backup, which some people are saying it\u2019s going to improve as the year progresses on a calendar year basis and you continue to see the European recovery continuing not have a hit from what\u2019s going on in Russia or Eastern Europe. But I think you could see this go on for several more months after that. But right now, I think I am a little bit nervous in saying is that residential going to come back after how much of weekend and also what is the side effect of what\u2019s going on in Russia, Ukraine, and Eastern Europe. So, I think that I am looking right now I see at least two months of pretty good underlying daily run rate of orders. And if I see things continuing to improve in residential and Europe, then that could go out for couple more months.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks. And then in the Network Power, the margin was about 8%. I think you are looking at over 10% for the year, so you got a decent jump up in the back half. Is there any \u2013 is that sort of just a leverage game of year-on-year growth or is it just a release of a lot of kind of cost savings coming through at the same time?","David Farr","It\u2019s a function of our growth. We have \u2013 if you look at our Network Power business historically, we have a stronger second half and then also some of the cost savings are starting to come through, but we typically \u2013 we have built quite a good backlog the last couple of months here. And it\u2019s a matter of just executing the sales level there, that\u2019s our normal second half, Network Power is usually a better margin if you look back over time.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then lastly very quickly, Middle East, Africa had a very big swing from kind of December quarter organic growth to what happened in March. Just wondered what you are thinking for kind of June or the next six months in that region for organic sales?","David Farr","I am more nervous about Middle East at this point in time given the turmoil going on the Middle East. We have a lot of projects underway in the Middle East. We have a lot of orders going on in the Middle East right now, but I am a little bit nervous as the general business environment. If you look what\u2019s going on in the Middle East, I am a little bit concerned about that both through Middle East and Africa. So, we have \u2013 we expect it to be positive second half of the year. I think when we get going, the other regions will be better and the Middle East will be not as good. That\u2019s my general feel right now.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Dave, was just wondering with the pronounced orders surge of process if you had a sense, what sort of concentration of large projects drove that and what was \u2013 in what part maybe was it a general broad acceleration and pickup in activity?","David Farr","We\u2019re seeing \u2013 we are seeing the pickup in orders coming out of our \u2013 what I call downstream business in our North America. We are seeing some of that. We are also seeing some very, very large projects happening around the world right now, that we have been working on for a while and we saw the last couple of months we have seen them book. But it\u2019s a very broad group of orders right now it\u2019s not focused one or two customer. It\u2019s a very broad based and a lot of large projects coming around Asia, coming out of the United States and some downstream. So, from my standpoint, I look at that, that\u2019s why I feel pretty good about the second half and going into 2015 in process, because they are building the backlog, they are building the order base to be able to deliver that. The question is will we see more confidence in what I\u2019d call the OEM or the MRO type of business early on here. So, I like the mix of the large projects, medium projects in process right now. It\u2019s a good mix.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then just looking at the 2016 Network Power target of 12% to 14% margin, what would it take to enter the bottom of the range in fiscal \u201815 in terms of how much is volume dependent versus realizing some of your self help?","David Farr","Right now, I would say most of the volume will be volume dependent, because we are investing right now in Network Power to get through some of the next generation technology, some innovation in the service area. So, if we could see continued good improvement in our orders in particular right now we are seeing a recovery in orders in Europe. We have seen recovery in Asia what we need to see is recovery in North America so we see very much stronger North America and you will see that profitability coming faster. North America is a key one to watch.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay and then just lastly on the cooling side, you have weathered a mix down in that space to what extent do you think that\u2019s run it\u2019s course or remains dynamic to contend with?","David Farr","Our Network Power side or the Climate Technologies side?","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Network Power.","David Farr","I think from the standpoint of what we are seeing right now the mix and our faith that we have the complete offering I think we have weathered that and we are starting to see that trend upwards. I feel good about where we are right there now.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Thank you.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks. Good morning guys. Sorry good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","I just want to pickup \u2013 I just want to pickup on the process orders and I think I know the answer, just want to clarify, so you are talking about are we \u2013 do you think that from here on we see larger orders hitting the backlog and sort of longer duration orders, so therefore we should expect to see a bit more volatility in the order pace going forward. And perhaps it\u2019s a correlation between order growth and revenue growth gets a bit more extended?","David Farr","I think the answer to that is yes the projects are definitely as you know I have talked about are definitely much larger, they are more complex, we are booking them sooner and we are having to manage those over time. So I would say based on the type of the businesses and the type of projects we are doing they are much larger projects there will be a lot more volatility within that both from the sales standpoint and the profitability standpoint within a quarter of a year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. And again you talked about the some of these projects getting pushed out a little bit and what\u2019s \u2013 is your sense that maybe there is some sensitivity on the macro volatility maybe Ukraine, etcetera, Middle East or do you think it\u2019s just a bit more of a push towards capital efficiency from the majors?","David Farr","There is two things going on. One, my large customer base is being asked to slowdown some of their expenditures and redirect some of that money towards I would say shareholders both on a broad basis the big capital projects guys. They are not stopping the project they may just rather than a project taking 14 months it\u2019s going to take 16 months. And so there will be \u2013 they are having pressure on them to spread their cash and to allocate more cash back to the shareholders and put the projects still at very high paybacks they are going to do them. And then from a standpoint of just projects because of some of the large complexity projects it just takes \u2013 sometimes it takes longer than anticipated and with the uncertainty and certain things around the world both the Middle East turmoil, like you said Eastern Europe turmoil some of the questions coming in say Australia they have said okay let\u2019s slow this down a little bit and take a little longer. So you got two things going on right now working on our large customer base. The projects are going, they are just going to take their time and use that cash a little bit longer.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful Dave. And then just one more on Artesyn we had $0.03 this quarter, I think a lot of that was restructuring, I think you have got about $70 million for the full year which would suggest another $35 million in the second half of the year, is that correct and is that more restructuring or was that more a run rate going forward?","David Farr","I think for the whole year, aren\u2019t we doing \u2013 Frank we are doing $70 million - $80 million?","Frank Dellaquila","No, no you are looking at \u2013 he is looking at our reconciliation probably. Where are you seeing?","David Farr","From the restructuring.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","The 30 bps in the appendix, 30 bps margins?","Frank Dellaquila","Okay. So that if you look at the reconciliation at the back of the slide, the 34, 35 that we took this quarter should be all there is. We are not expecting any more for the year. It\u2019s really 1.4 points and both the Artesyn and whatever rounding is in there is a result of us using ranges for those estimates all got jammed into that 30 bps. So the answer is, no there is no behind it.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","I see. Thank you very much.","David Farr","So if you look at the answer \u2013 what I will answer the question is if you look at internal restructuring which we do on an ongoing basis yes, we are talking first of all on $30 million, $35 million for that.","Frank Dellaquila","Absolutely I thought your question that was strictly on the Artesyn piece.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the answer for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Good afternoon everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Hi, Dave. On the gross margins, up 140 basis points I mean you have the benefit there from the exit of embedded, but maybe break that out if you could and what other factors drove the gross margin improvement and then are there any headwinds coming in the second half to that?","David Farr","From the standpoint of our GP margin we there is \u2013 obviously Artesyn did help us. And as you know, we talk about 50 basis points at the EBIT line is probably about 50, 70 points, 90 basis points at the GP line. So the rest is just operational improvement and mix going on. So I expect our GP margin to be pretty good for the year. We actually forecast a pretty good GP margin for the year and then we are looking for underlying operating performance, mild underlying operating performance with investing more into the company. So that\u2019s why you are seeing now as much spread improvement between GP and OP you normally would see, but we are investing internally right now.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then you have mentioned a couple of times about executing against elevated backlog, I mean, is that unusually backed up because of some of these project delays or what\u2019s sort of behind that comment, how soon do you think that will get released?","David Farr","The comments, one, it\u2019s both for you guys, but also my own operating people are on the phone right now, they all listen to what I say. So, I mean, the key issue is our backlog is sitting at very high levels, with the orders the last say 45, 60 days we have been building backlog. So, the key issue for us is to execute as much as we can in that backlog. Clearly, some of this in the process world, the Network Power world and the industrial world is a little bit longer lead time, but anything that we can work on execution. Our operations are fine. It\u2019s just a matter of what can we execute with our customer base, if we got how to get done and work that backlog back down. I don\u2019t like carrying that much backlog.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay, thanks.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good afternoon gents.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","On the gross margin point, just following that up and given what I think this is the highest gross margin ever for this quarter, right?","David Farr","From my knowledge, yes.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","What\u2019s the price cost dynamic and can you give us a sense of the green versus red comfort level you have there as you are looking forward?","David Farr","Yes, right now, Steve, let\u2019s go back, let\u2019s step at February. We thought from a price cost standpoint that we have been pretty much neutral this year, maybe slightly plus or minus 0.1, just very much neutral. Right now, we are doing pretty well. What\u2019s happened is our net material inflation as the economy has been weaker or actually our net material inflation has got more negative. And so right now, we are definitely green from a slightly positive green. So, we are probably going above the line. We expect that, that will hold for the rest of this year and then we will start going into it. If net material inflation continues to let\u2019s say become more negative because of the weakness around the world and the excess capacity, then you will see us have more pricing pressures next year. But right now, we are in pretty good shape from a price cost standpoint finished this year and going into 2015. So, I like where we are right now.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","It sounds like a sweet spot actually on that front?","David Farr","It is a sweet spot right now, but you get sweet spot for about three months and then you get whacked.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And on the acquisition point that you made, well actually acquisition and CapEx, on the acquisition point you made about your spending level, I mean, you are looking at an environment where it feels like some of the prices being paid are moving into frothy territory, particularly in some of your end markets. I mean, how are you \u2013 how is that impacting your placeholder for that?","David Farr","For this year, we got pretty close. We may not quite get to 125, but we are going to be pretty close. From my perspective right now, we are actively working trying to figure out how to build our pipeline of acquisitions. I\u2019d like us to see us do more acquisitions given our strength of cash and our profitability state and our capabilities globally, but at the same time, we have to be very, very careful that we don\u2019t obviously get too aggressive on the pricing and pay too higher price, but right now, my operations from the standpoint of places we want to go, I like where we are and I think we are ready to handle some more, but nothing say imminent, but I really turning up the heat internally both of our operations and corporate people to safely identify more, but you are right, the pricing is a key issue, you can\u2019t get carried away.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And just lastly on CapEx, that $800 million number, how much of that is sort of growth CapEx versus maintenance versus maybe you can even think about productivity, I am not sure where you put that one?","David Farr","I would say the big increase this year for us is twofold, productivity. So if you look at the $100 million plus they were putting I would say a third of that is probably productivity increase as we are trying to drive our plans more efficiently and then the rest will be capacity. We are adding capacity around the world. And we have continued to expand. We did a lot of capacity offline in the last downturn and before the last downturn. And now, we are replacing that capacity in what I would call in more appropriate areas, in areas I want it. And it\u2019s going to be much more efficient capacity. So we are adding capacity and getting geared up for the continued growth of our customer base around the world.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And is that in process this capacity or multiple places?","David Farr","It\u2019s across the board, it\u2019s both in process, it\u2019s industrial, it\u2019s also in sort of a residential solutions area, so it\u2019s around the world. We are seeing this around our basis, all the companies.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Hey, good afternoon everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Just, Dave, your comments on residential, what are you seeing \u2013 new construction was weak in the first quarter and most people expect that to come back, what are you seeing on the replacement side that would give you more cause for concern, because it seems like you are a little more cautious that some of this should come back due to its weather related, but just a little more color on there?","David Farr","I would say the underlying just the demand, the numbers coming out are very concern to me and the fact if you look at the \u2013 if you really start cutting down the employment numbers and looking where the jobs are being created and lack of employment and lack of hours, I am very, very nervous about what people spend. I mean, the residential recovery has been very, very short-lived, bam, like what, five quarters. And so I am a little bit nervous about the fact will people get concerned about their incomes, spending, their cost of living has gone up and so how much more money are they going to reallocate towards the houses. Will they move and then refurbish? That\u2019s a key issue for us. Will they refurbish? Will they upgrade? And right now, I think people being very cautious relative to that. And my concern is we see it should be a little bit better in the second half, but it doesn\u2019t, that will be a problem.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay.","David Farr","It\u2019s not a good sign out there right now. Those job numbers last week were not good.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then on Network Power, just with chloride in Europe, the orders are picking up here, how much of this is improvement in underlying demand versus just the comparables are favorable and they continue to be favorable? How confident are you in the European piece?","David Farr","We are seeing, we have got our act together from through the integration. So we have made a lot of changes both from an operational standpoint and a leadership standpoint. And so I am seeing better execution within the leadership and within the space that we had actually lost. And secondly, I am seeing some of our core markets actually do a little bit better where they have underinvested for quite some time, particularly UK, which we are very strong in the UK and they are starting to see some good improvement in the UK. So, from my perspective, I think we are seeing the momentum and the question is now can we keep that going as the European economy continues to progress. Our programs are continuing to kick in. I feel better about Europe as we go forward here.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. And then just the last one for me on process, with the project activity picking up how should we think about incrementals, because that would seem to have a dampening impact on incrementals beyond this year?","David Farr","It will hold them down. It will hold it down. Our process is going to run high levels of profitability in any quarter. As I talked about earlier, you can get some good MRO type of business or small what I call brown type, brown expansions versus a greenfield. So right now, we are running at this on an average about 20% operating margins or EBIT margins within process. And I think we are going to stay around that level, but because the big projects will hold us back leveraging that a whole lot.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo","Okay. Right, thank you.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Thank you. Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Jeremie.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","China, clearly 9% growth, third consecutive quarter of pretty good growth there and this despite weaker macro indicators, could you give us some color on what you are seeing in that country?","David Farr","In the market space we are serving right now, we are seeing pretty good continued investment. The process world, the industrial productivity world, some of the refrigeration stuff we are working on, some of the core spaces, a lot of investment going on again in their telecommunication infrastructure in China, right now. These are the markets we play in. We are not into the big infrastructure type of projects, which has slowed down. So we continue to see pretty good opportunity here. I would expect for us to see pretty good high single-digit growth this year throughout this year. I am actually watching it very, very closely relative to the business pace and both Ed and I are spending time there, because it\u2019s an important marketplace for us, but we have now seen several good quarters and I expect to go forward. I do not expect to see an acceleration, and I do not see a deceleration at this point in time. I see pretty good high single-digit growth for us and all coming off a pretty good base.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Okay. So, when you look at your order intake in March and so far in April, are you seeing the same trend unfolding?","David Farr","Yes, in China, yes.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA","Great, thanks very much.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. You take care.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to management for any closing remarks.","David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Good. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I appreciate your support and look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks and hopefully things will continue to prove around the world. And we want to have any more shocks to the world be it from Eastern Europe or be it from Middle East or wherever it\u2019s going to come from. So, I wish you all well. Thank you very much. Bye.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, November 4, 2014.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Patrick Fitzgerald","Thank you, Danny. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Craig Rossman, who will be succeeding me as Director of Investor Relations in the coming weeks.","Today's call summarizes Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 3 months.","We'll start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales were unchanged in the quarter at $6.8 billion, with underlying sales up 4%, reflecting increases in all segments, with Climate Technologies strongest. Growth was strong in North America and modest in Asia, while Europe was flat. Emerging markets improved to 5% growth after 2% growth in the third quarter, but remain mixed across regions.","Profitability improvement continued, with a gross profit margin of 42.4%, up 120 basis points and secular margin up 70 basis points to 20.2%. An impairment charge of $508 million was recognized in the Chloride business, which has been impacted by protracted economic weakness since its acquisition in 2010 and a deteriorating outlook in Europe and Middle East\/Africa over the next 2 to 3 years. Earnings per share of $1.30 increased 10%, excluding charges in both years. It was a strong close in fiscal 2014 with margin, earnings and cash generation exceeding expectations.","Slide 3, P&L summary. As previously stated, net sales were flat, while underlying sales grew 4%, reflecting the impact of currency translation and divestitures. Gross profit margin expansion benefited from improved business and technology mix, which enabled funding of strategic investments as reflected in higher SG&A expense. The decrease in other deductions was primarily driven by cyclical currency comparisons of $43 million. Excluding charges, EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points to 20.1% with a strong contribution from segment margins and favorable stock compensation expense. Share repurchase of $267 million contributed to EPS of $1.30, up 10%.","Next slide, sales by geography. In the fourth quarter, sales growth was led by the United States, up 8%, while Europe was flat, Asia grew 2%, including unchanged sales in China on challenging comparisons, Latin America increased 3%, Canada was up 10% and Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Total underlying sales increased 4% and acquisitions added 2%, while divestitures deducted 5% and currency translation deducted 1% for flat reported sales.","For fiscal 2014, 4% growth in the U.S. and 7% growth in China drove the majority of the underlying sales increase. Europe and Canada were up 1%, Latin America was up 2% and Middle East and Africa declined 1%. Full year underlying sales grew 3% and acquisitions contributed 1%, while divestitures deducted 5%, for reported sales in 2014 down 1%. Strong market conditions in the U.S. and improvement in emerging markets drove higher accelerated -- excuse me, drove growth acceleration in the fourth quarter, the highest quarterly rate of growth of the year.","Slide 5, segment earnings and cash flow. Segment margin expansion of 70 basis points led by strong improvement in Process Management and Industrial Automation. Lower corporate expense was primarily driven by cyclical flat comp comparisons of $54 million. Reported pretax earnings reflected the previously mentioned charge. Cash generation exceeded expectations with strong conversion and working capital management to finish the year. Trade working capital improved by 10 basis points.","Next slide, Process Management. Process Management underlying sales grew 5% in the fourth quarter, with North America up 13%, Asia up 1%, Europe flat, Latin America up 3% and Middle East and Africa up 5%. Acquisitions added 4% and currency translation deducted 1% for net sales growth of 8%. Momentum continued in global energy and chemical industries with growth strongest in North America driven by robust investment in oil and gas production and processing projects. Asia was slow, as strength in Southeast Asia and India was offset by challenging comparisons in China and Australia. Europe reflected improvement in Russia, offset by lumpy project timing in the North Sea region. Market conditions in Latin America and Middle East and Africa were mixed. Margin remained strong, up 130 basis points in Q4, driving 20.9% margin for the full year. Robust order trends have resulted in double-digit year-end backlog growth providing strong momentum into 2015.","Slide 7, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net and underlying sales increased 5% in the fourth quarter, with North America up 12%, Asia up 5%, Europe and Latin America down 2%, and Middle East and Africa down 9%. Demand for our capital goods continued to improve with mixed trends across markets and geographies. All businesses grew except for motors and drives, reflecting short-cycle economic weakness in Europe.","Strength in North America was led to over 20% growth in hermetic motors business. Asia benefited from continued strength in China, particularly in the power transmission and electrical distribution businesses. Strong interest has been received in the power transmission business, and a decision is expected by end of calendar year. Very good market conditions are expected in the near term with favorable momentum in North America and Asia and soft demand in Europe.","Next slide, Network Power. Network Power underlying sales increased 1%, with North America up 1%, Asia down 3%, Europe up 7%, Latin America down 2% and Middle East and Africa up 9%. The divested Artesyn and Connectivity Solutions businesses deducted 20% and currency translation deducted another 1%, for a reported sales decrease of 20%.","Data center markets have gradually improved globally. Strong growth in Europe benefited from a large project in Sweden, along with better market conditions in North America and modest growth in Asia. Telecommunications infrastructure investment slowed in all geographies, declining at a double-digit rate after strong growth in the third quarter.","It was a solid finish to the year on margin for the segment, up 400 basis points sequentially. As mentioned previously, we have taken that cautious economic outlook in Europe and Middle East and Africa during the next 2 to 3 years. And as a result, we have recognized an impairment charge in the Chloride business that is not reflected in the segment results. Business conditions are expected to remain mixed, with gradual improvement in the data center business, and inconsistent demand in telecommunications markets in the near term.","Slide 9, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales increased 7% with North America up 7%, Asia up 8%, Europe down 3%, Latin America up 17%, and Middle East and Africa up 25%. Growth was strong globally in the air conditioning business, led by strength in the U.S., with residential up over 20%, reflecting demand driven by upcoming regulatory changes.","U.S. commercial markets improved as well. International air conditioning demand was mixed, with strength in Asia, Middle East\/Africa and Latin America, partially offset by declines in Europe. The refrigeration business grew moderately, led by continued strength in transportation markets. Demand for sensors and controls declined moderately. Segment margin declined with an unfavorable mix, higher investment spending and customer accommodation expense related to a manufacturing process improvement. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable with growth momentum in North America and Asia, while regulatory demand will slow.","Commercial & Residential Solutions on Slide 10. Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales grew 5%, with North America up 7%, Asia up 3%, Europe down 2%, Latin America down 5% and Middle East and Africa down 22%. Strong demand in North America more than offset the slight decline in international markets. The growth was led by the professional tools, wet\/dry vacuums and food waste disposer businesses. Sales increased slightly in the storage business. Segment margin remained strong at 23.2%. Solid trends in residential and commercial construction markets in North America are expected to continue, supporting a moderate growth outlook for the next year.","Next slide, 2014 summary. Fiscal 2014 net sales declined 1% and underlying sales increased 3% with emerging markets up 4% and mature markets up 3%. Gross profit margin, again, reached a record level and EBIT margin of 16.5% expanded 50 basis points. EPS, excluding charges of $3.75, came in above previously communicated expectations on the strong year-end close. Emerson completed the 58th year of consecutive dividend increase supported [ph] record operating cash flow, with a payout ratio over 60% for the fourth consecutive year.","Next slide, 2014 performance versus plan. Most financial targets were achieved or exceeded in the year, with gross profit margin and operating cash flow ahead of plan, EBIT margin [indiscernible] plan, and earnings per share just above the midpoint of the range. The solid operational execution of return [ph] , lower-than-expected macroeconomic growth as emerging markets, excluding China, struggled to maintain economic momentum falling short of expectations.","Next slide, 2015 outlook. Underlying orders growth of 9% in the fourth quarter drove year-end backlog to a record $6.7 billion. The global macroeconomic trends mixed, but gradually improving. There continues to be solid momentum in the NAFTA region and China, with balance of increasing uncertainty in Europe and some other emerging markets. We're planning cautiously for global gross fixed investment of 3% to 4% growth next year.","Based on current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015: underlying sales growth of 4% to 5%; reported sales change of 0% to 1%; reflecting a 2% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from the potential power transmission divestiture. Modest profitability improvement is expected as well. Business segment and other financial metric forecasts will be provided at our Annual Investor Conference in February 2015. Additionally, the first quarter 2015 dividend has been increased 9% to $0.47 a share, equivalent to an annual rate of $1.88 and representing 44% of 2014 free cash flow.","With that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much. First, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We truly appreciate your interest and your support, as we continue to invest, grow and enhance the value of Emerson's long-term sustainable value. And as you all know, I have a strong focus at this company on giving money back to our shareholders. In 2014, we ended up passing back to our shareholders almost $2.3 billion, $1.2 billion of dividend and $1.1 billion in share repurchase. A focus on this Corporation to generate cash, invest that cash for growth and give the money back to the shareholders that we do not need.","Today, the board did increase our dividends per share, as Pat just stated, to an annual run rate of $1.88 versus last year's $1.72. We had a very strong cash flow year. And as our targets are set up for dividends, we look at 40% to 50% of our dividend payment coming out of free cash flow and last year's free cash flow almost an all-time record, we made the decision to pass back more money to our shareholders and increase dividends to $1.88, starting our 59th straight year of dividend increases for our shareholders.","As I look at -- I want to thank the operations for their strong operational performance across the board. As in any company of this size and complexity, you have some pluses, you have some minuses, but in total, the team worked hard, and they delivered. They delivered a very strong sales growth. They delivered a very strong orders growth, strong cash flow and conversion relative to their programs that we've been investing in, in the last couple of years. So we see good momentum, as we move into 2015, which we'll talk about. But the business leaders, the presidents, the global operational leaders and the corporate executives that make things happen here at Emerson got the job done, and I believe in a very uncertain environment -- global economic environment, delivered record levels of profits and earnings and cash for our shareholders.","As Pat mentioned, he has given up on me, and he will be stepping aside here at the end of this calendar year, moving to Asia, working for Climate Technology. Pat has been a lot of fun to work with. Pat's had the joy of going through ups and downs of this marketplace, and my mood's up and downs and managing shareholders. And we truly appreciate what he's done for us and his insights, and we wish him well as he moves on to his next role with Climate Technology located in Asia.","With that, we're bringing a senior-level player in, a relief pitcher, Craig Rossman, almost 20 years with the corporation. Craig worked for me at one time in the process world, then moved him over somewhere else, a couple of other divisions, came out of Therm-O-Disc. He's coming in from a business leader -- a business perspective. So he'll have a lot of background in business. He's not quite used to the corporate people here, and he'll have a fun time learning what it's like to work in St. Louis. But we'll welcome Craig, and he'll do a great job, and he'll bring a different perspective to the business world, given all the businesses he's been involved with in his job at Emerson for the last 20 years.","As I mentioned -- as we look at the company and look at the performance this year, obviously, we can always say there's some good things, and I can equally say there's some bad things. And I know my shareholders out there, and investors are out there will gladly point out the goods and the bads. They're real good at that. But I look at the company today from where we are and where we started. And I say the company is in a stronger position today than when we started this fiscal year. We grew orders nicely. We made strategic investments. We did a couple of strong acquisitions, got a couple of divestitures done, we're in the middle of one right now, and hopefully we'll get it done sometime in the second fiscal quarter of 2015 in Power Transmission Solutions.","We've improved the order run rate. We've improved our margins. We improved our profitability. We had a -- without the Chloride charge, we had [indiscernible] the return on total capital over 20% after-tax. We had a record level operating cash flow, and we had a near record in free cash flow. So operationally, yes, some good, some bad, but in total, they got it done, and they did a great job in creating a stronger company, as we go into 2015.","2015 is going to be an interesting year. We go in with a record level backlog. We go in with strong orders. We go in with record levels of profitability. We go in with strong investments. We have a very good U.S., Canada and Mexico marketplace. The NAFTA region looks very solid right now. However, this year, versus last year, we're going into a situation where Europe is weakening. Europe is clearly heading down potentially for its third recession since the 2008 peak, which is a concerning issue for global companies like Emerson and global leaders like myself. One of the reasons why, as I looked at the Chloride acquisition we made several years ago, it was hard to justify the good will out there, given the fact that I'm really concerned about the European environment for the next several years. So concerned about Europe.","Well, the concern about the Eastern Europe, Middle East\/Africa, they have a lot of issues going on in those regions right now, and I would say the wind has turned from our back to our face in the last 6 months, and I would expect those to be in our face for the next 6 to 12 months.","In South America, I'm concerned, driven by my concern over Brazil and Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, concerns there. I think those economies are still struggling and will not give us a whole lot of growth in 2015, but will give us some growth, but not to a level I would expect in a normal economic cycle down there.","Asia Pacific, in general, we had a decent year. China was very strong for us. China, we grew 7%. I would expect China to grow again next year, but not at the same level, probably closer to 5%. I expect Southeast Asia, India -- in India, India and then also Australia, to have a decent year for us in growth. But net-net, a slightly more positive global economic environment for us to operate in, though there is also more uncertainty, as I look at today's economic environment than we faced as we started this fiscal 2014.","I look at underlying sales to be up slightly, in the 4% to 5% range. I see improvement in our profitability, and I see probably most likely cash flow being flat, more function around what happens with our growth rates and also what happens relative to just the overall performance of the growth around the company around the world. But clearly, running at record levels, high levels of cash flow.","We'll clearly give a lot more color in the markets, as we always do in February, where we break down and give you a different underlying growth rates, what we see out there. But in general, total, I see a little bit better growth. I see a lot more concern than I did last year at this point in time. But I feel good about where we're going into with our programs, investments, and I feel good that we'll start 2015 on a good, positive foot. And clearly, we'll talk about that, as we get into February time period.","We will clearly give you a lot more inputs in February. We don't always give guidance in November, contrary to what people believe. We sometimes give you pieces of the action of what's going on, but clearly, with the uncertainty that we see around the world, in particular right now in Europe, Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa, we're being cautious. We're being concerned, and we're being careful about what we're going to say. We'll get better clarity as we move into the next calendar year, as we move into that February time frame.","Albeit, we seek better underlying growth at the top, we see margin improvement, therefore, we'll see some improvement in earnings, and we'll talk about that in February. But in the end, a solid year. Got there a little bit differently than I -- we originally thought. But it the end, it finished very nicely, very strong, good earnings per share, good cash flow. And you also noticed on the cash flow conversion, free cash earnings, we did 110% this year on top of last year's 115%. So good, high-quality earnings and from a cash flow generation and a net earnings standpoint.","So I feel good about what the operations delivered. I want to thank them one more time, and we'll turn it over, to the call -- to the shareholders out there, I'm sure they have questions. They always do. And I'm sure they'll have questions that I'm not going to answer, but we'll obviously talk a little bit about those.","So with that, I want to thank everybody for delivering a strong finish to 2014, and looking forward to a strong start to 2015. Thank you very much.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So first -- I guess, first and foremost, on the correction in oil prices that we've seen. Obviously, you guys are carrying high levels of backlog. Order intake remains strong. What kind of feedback are you getting from your customers on any sensitivity to some of these projects, if oil stays down and what kind of duration would it need to stay down before you see risk or your customers see risk to some of these bigger projects?","David N. Farr","It's -- I mean, clearly, there's not one simple answer here in this, Josh. It is a concern to us. It's a concern from our customer base, when I talk to them. There is not just one number. But clearly, as this price of oil drops down into the 70s, there's a concern that they will start slowing down some of the incremental new projects from the standpoint of what they do next. So my concern will be, as their concern is, that the price of oil continues to slip down into the 60s, into the 50s, and it goes that low, that clearly, that would cause them to really start pulling back on their spending, which will obviously impact us in a significant way. We'll see it -- we'll start seeing this in the, I would say, early 2015 calendar quarter, if the price of oil stays down. I think it needs to stay down for at least 30 days to 60 days, depending on the type of -- the oil and gas, which they're going after. But clearly right now, with this downward slope in the price of oil, it is a concern relative to our core businesses and where the money is being spent. So a little bit nervous about that at this point in time, and a lot of volatility. So flags are up and we're going to watch it very carefully. And if we have to modulate our spending and things like that, we'll obviously, clearly, start doing that. But it won't take long. We'll know early on in that first calendar quarter where things are trending.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Got you. That's helpful. And then, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about capital return to shareholders. I guess, one thing that you guys have always wrestled with is some of the trapped cash. Been discussion that if certain things go right politically tonight, that maybe there's some tax holidays and repatriation. Have you guys thought about what you might do if you get better access to the international cash?","David N. Farr","We'd bring it back, and I would say the number would have a 2 in front with a B in the back side of it. And so we take that money, we bring over $2 billion back into the United States. And we invest it here in the United States. I would give some back to our shareholders and we, internally, we invest it. And so clearly, that would be a positive, positive source of cash for U.S. companies, if we're able to bring that back at a reasonable tax rate. Let's say they have a 5%, 6%, 7% -- 7% tax rate on that, you'd see that money come back in into the United States and get invested in this country and passed back to our shareholders.","Joshua Charles Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You think bulk goes to internal investment? Or back to shareholders? Or is that a nebulous question still?","David N. Farr","That's a nebulous -- yes, yes, that's a nebulous question. I'll be very, it's -- some of it will go internally. I mean, obviously, what we see right now is the stronger North America, which means there's going to be more investments. And so if I had that cash versus going to a commercial paper market, clearly, I'd use that cash to invest. It's not going to drive incremental investment per se, but it will obviously -- we know that money will go to use here in the United States because of the strong U.S. environment we see right now, for both growth and investment. So it would be a good thing for the U.S. economy because you invest the dollars into capital, it's going to create jobs.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On Process, what's the profile of the order base at this point between upstream, midstream, downstream? How would you characterize that?","David N. Farr","I couldn't give you the number off the top of my head. I -- it's not a number I'd see. I mean, clearly, we're involved in all aspects of that, but I don't have the number off the top of my head. I mean, some of the large projects, obviously, are upstream, from an investment standpoint, relative to go in and get the gas and go in and get the oil. But right now, let's say, we're still predominantly downstream across the board.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then, when you look at CapEx, the -- almost $770 million this year, I mean, are you expecting a slight increase next year? How are you thinking about spending?","David N. Farr","We're looking at -- right now, our target all year long was going to be somewhere around $775 million to $800 million. We got a little bit under $800 million at $776 million. I would say, next year, the target is going to be somewhere in the $800 million, $825 million. We still have some investments we're making on our global reach and other investments. So at this point in time, we're looking to spend around $800 million to $825 million. That's about as close as I can call it.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, on Climate, with the pull-forward here with the regulatory stuff, I assume that's going to hit mostly in the fiscal Q1, maybe a little bit in the calendar Q1. But how would you characterize the growth rate here? I would assume you'd see a pretty strong growth number here in the fiscal Q1 number -- quarter?","David N. Farr","The pull-up due to the efficiency change is going to place on January 1. The production has to be produced by our customer, the carriers, the terrains, the [indiscernible]. It has to be produced by 12\/31\/14. So we'll see all -- our pull-up impact will be done within -- by the end of November, early December. So it will be all finished. And then, we'll start seeing the payback in some of that -- the drop-off in our second quarter and our third quarter, as we go into 2015, which would be the first and second calendar quarter. And that's how we're going to see it at this point in time. And the overall growth rate, I think -- we'll talk about it. But the overall growth rate right now we're looking at, I mean, if you look through the cycle, it looks to me -- I think it's going to be mid to upper single-digit for North America this year. It's the best I can tell. It's a function of what happens to some of the housing, but right now, it's a, 5% to 10% type of range.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then helps your leverage here in fiscal Q1, if I -- in terms of climate, right? You should get some pretty good operating leverage.","David N. Farr","Yes, that would clearly help us from our -- yes, the cost absorption standpoint, we're usually -- at this point in time, our plants are at the lowest level. And then, we're starting -- now we're going to be running at the highest level. And then, unfortunately, will give some of that back in the second, third quarter because of what happens as demand goes down. But that's what's going to happen. It's going to be a little bit different forecast in our view of Climate Technology in 2015.","Operator","Our next question is from Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","[indiscernible] years of starting -- what's that?","David N. Farr","No, go head. I'm sorry, I didn't know. I thought I might have lost you, but go ahead.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. After a couple of years of starting the year thinking we're going to go one direction and then it tends to slow, you said in your prepared remarks that your 3% to 4% GFI growth is considered conservative. I mean, in light of what we've been seeing and your comments on Europe, it doesn't feel particularly conservative. Can you kind of square that circle a little bit?","David N. Farr","I mean, if you look at -- [indiscernible] forecasts out there are still higher than those numbers. And so I -- we've been trying to figure out how to make adjustments. So I mean, if you look at our forecast right now for, what I would say the fixed investment around the world, it's still -- the number would still be higher than that number. So that's where I'm coming from. And obviously, Europe is definitely weakening and I'm concerned about that, but just the underlying forecast that I see right now is a little bit lower than the economists would say.","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. Looking at Process and the margins, a couple of things. On the acquisitions, Virgo, Enardo, were they dilutive in the year? And if so, by how much? And then, next year, qualitatively, do you think your investment spending keeps pace with sales growth? Or would we expect at least a little bit of margin expansion?","David N. Farr","We'll let Frank -- Frank's got it.","Frank J. Dellaquila","Mark, the acquisitions were not dilutive. They actually were slightly accretive even after the purchase accounting charges that we took when we first acquired them. So they were good high-margin companies that we bought.","David N. Farr","And what was the second part of that question, the capital spend, you said?","Mark Douglass - Longbow Research LLC","No, no, no. On your investment spending, within Process, would you allow Process margins to expand next year? Or do you think investment -- you've had a lot of investment spending in Process and...","David N. Farr","Yes, I would say, right now -- Process is running, they're running at pretty good margin level. We're going to -- we'll look at, obviously, the mix comes into play a lot here. What markets are up and down, but their growth investments were going to be pretty well -- I would say a little -- their growth investments going to be a little less than the sales growth. And then, a function of the margin, slightly plus or minus, about the same, there's not going to be much change there. It's really a function of what mix is -- is North America, good? You have a couple of big projects. So it's always hard to dial in the margin for Process, but Process is going to be running at higher levels of margins with their growth investments trending down just a little bit slower than the underlying sales growth.","Operator","Our next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I wanted to say thank you to Pat for all the help. In terms of the overall kind of incremental margins, you've said before that at 4% organic sales growth, you should get a very good operating leverage. And I guess, your guidance for the year ahead is for 4% to 5% organic growth, but the leverage, it doesn't sound as if it's quite there. So maybe just explain what's happening there to drive only kind of modest earnings improvement?","David N. Farr","One, we're looking at continuing to invest in the businesses across the company. And secondly, right now, when I talk about stronger leverages, you get a little bit as you get forward and you get, obviously, greater as you go up towards 5-plus percent. So right now, Julian, I'm a little bit nervous going back to the questions we've had about some of the mix around the world and some of the oil and gas investments. So we're being -- we're just being very cautious about what type or level of profitability we see at this point in time and not make commitments on the profitability that we don't feel we can deliver. It's just a cautious outlook and concern about and what we're seeing out there, as we go into 2015, which is a completely different world, in my opinion, than we -- when we saw -- when we saw going into 2014.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And in terms of the overall incremental investment, 6 to 12 months ago, you talked about $110 million step-up company-wide in 2014. Just wondered where did that number end up for the year as a whole, and what are you initially thinking for fiscal '15 on that extra spend?","David N. Farr","It was within a couple of million dollars of that. I mean, we don't track it that tightly. It's about the same level, when I look at where the money was spent, and I would say that, that number is going to go up pretty much in line with what we're seeing right now for sales. So if sales are going up 4% or 5%, we're looking at probably increasing that number 4% to 5% next year, incrementally. We're looking at some key programs, which are multiple-year programs, to make sure that we invest in those programs at this point in time. And we move it around the various businesses to make sure we're making the right investments.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, lastly, just thinking about the earnings growth year-on-year, you've given us sort of an indication of where you're thinking for the year as a whole. But is it fair to say that you'll start the year at a much stronger rate than for the full year? And then you're kind of embedding some tail off in the second half?","David N. Farr","I would expect -- right now, we're expecting the year to be -- I would hope to see in the first half that it would be a little bit better than the total year, but I do expect a slowdown in some of the businesses. I'm a little bit nervous relative to some of the longer-cycle business if the price of oil continues to weak -- go down, and we start seeing the knock-on effect of some of the economies around the world continue to weaken. So my concern is that we will have a better growth rate in the first half and it will definitely weaken in the second half.","Operator","Next, we have Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a question. So you outlined how 2014 played out versus plan by geography. And I was just wondering, given that you're repositioning the company to sort of focus on new areas of growth, the fact that U.S. continues to be one of the fastest-growing areas, does that accelerate anything internally in terms of how you're thinking spending money internally and which businesses to push forward?","David N. Farr","It did last year. We started accelerating North America spending about 18 months ago, and we'll continue to do -- we'll continue to invest more in North America. That's therefore -- if we were able to bring some cash back in, you'd see a lot of that cash get invested in North America. So I would say -- but I see right now, the NAFTA region looks very good here for the next couple of years. And so we're continuing to increase our investments in the NAFTA region. And some regions, we're actually scaling back, installing those growth rates down or maybe what I'd say disinvesting a little bit.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But the question on North America, are you thinking about accelerating versus the original plan? Or are we still on track versus what we thought?","David N. Farr","We're pretty well on track. I don't think North America is -- North America is trending pretty much like we thought it would trend. I mean, we saw this coming, and I'd still think it's going to keep trending that way. So from our perspective, we're not going to accelerate any faster than we already had laid out the last couple of years. So we're pretty well right there.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Can you -- I don't know if you can talk about it, but what's your underlying assumption about the run rate of business in Russia over the next year? I was assuming it's -- and I'm not asking you to comment on what's happening in Russia, but what's built into your forecast?","David N. Farr","Our forecast is Russia will be down next year. We've had a decent run, but obviously -- clearly, our business will be impacted by what's going on from all of the restrictions being put on Russia. So our forecast right now is Russia will be down in 2015.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But do you make any assumptions about the run rate of the projects in Russia? Or this is just your compliance with the sanctions? Or maybe we can just simply take it offline, it's getting too complex? But any more color beyond that?","David N. Farr","No, we just -- we just look at where the money investment is going and what's going to happen, and we know what projects we're involved with. It's not -- we can figure that out. It's nothing to do necessary -- it's just, we see what's happening in our customer base and the lack of cash and it reached some of the restrictions and sanctions. And so we have a feel for what our business is going to do next year, and it's going to be lower.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremie Capron with CLSA.","Grace Lee - CLSA Limited, Research Division","This is Grace Lee sitting in for Jeremie Capron. I have a -- we have a question for Network Power. It seems that Network Power seems to have the weakest outlook for 2015, not so surprisingly. So I'm wondering whether you could tell us how you think about the attractiveness of that asset in going-forward basis? And also, it would be great if you can share some of the metrics that you track in order to evaluate that business?","David N. Farr","We track the same metrics we track that business. We track all businesses. Growth, profitability, cash and returns. So those metrics are the same ones. And from my expectations right now, Network Power has continued to make progress. It's clearly not as much progress as we would like to see. We have certain markets which are struggling and particularly, I'm very concerned about the European and Eastern Europe and Middle East. So yes, I'm concerned about it. I look for decent growth next year, and I look for improvement in profitability. So right now, I have solid expectations. And as I've told the outside world, we continuously evaluate that. And at this point in time, I still believe, over the next couple of years, we can create incremental value for our shareholders from where we are. So that's where we sit.","Grace Lee - CLSA Limited, Research Division","I see. Just one follow-up. If the business doesn't pan out in a way that you expected at this point, would you consider some aggressive changes in the portfolio structure?","David N. Farr","The answer is yes, we do that -- yes we do that at Emerson. We do look at businesses -- getting out of businesses, and if we feel like they cannot create the value for our shareholders, Emerson is not reluctant to do that, and we've divested a lot of businesses under my 14 years of CEO leadership. And I guarantee you that we will continue to evaluate that, and we'll continue to evaluate all businesses, if they're not going to create value for our shoulders, we'll get out of them. It's a part of doing business.","Operator","Next, we have Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just first on Climate. What -- could you just describe what you mean by customer accommodation expense?","David N. Farr","Yes. Very easy. We changed a coating on our motor to reduce rust inside the compressor. And by doing that, we created a chemical reaction within the new refrigerant and the new process and with a new electronic expansion valves. It created a clogging. So they had some failures out in the marketplace. And so we've had to work with our customer base to figure out how to compensate them, and so that's what we do. And we had to take a charge in the fourth quarter to -- in anticipation of what that's going to cost. But while it's not around, actually, a quality improvement in the product end, it clearly -- it backfired a little bit with the new expansion valve, electronic expansion valves, and also the new refrigerant chemicals. So it's one of the things we tested for and we missed it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, that's a resi dynamic?","David N. Farr","Yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Resi related?","David N. Farr","Oh, yes.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then, just on the geographic guide. I mean, you talked about China being a little bit weaker, Southeast Asia being a little bit better, Europe being weaker. I mean, it looks like that incrementally, there are not too many geographies that are actually getting better this year. So to get from the 3% to the 4% to 5% underlying, is that just backlog conversion? I'm just trying to reconcile that.","David N. Farr","I think the NAFTA region, which last time I saw North America was still our largest market. I'm actually having a little bit faster growth rate next year. So that's how I square the circle.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got it. And then, one last question, just on the -- on kind of the order flow here. You talked about Process potentially slowing down. You're obviously going to have the tougher comps in Climate. I mean, is it possible that the orders have been pretty strong up kind of the high single-digits here? Is it possible that in the second quarter, that those orders could go negative because of those comps? Or is there enough going on in the rest of the business where the orders can kind of hold up here, in a reasonable way?","David N. Farr","I mean, it's always possible -- Steve, it's hard for us to map out the trend line of orders, but if you look at the order trend last year, I would say that there is a chance that we can have a negative 3-month roll or negative quarter. I'd say the answer is always positive, Steve. I mean, always, potentially yes. I haven't mapped them out per se, but if I look at the trend line knowing where it came up, I would say there's a chance you could see that, just like you potentially could see it in the -- you could see it in the -- the next fourth quarter could have a problem, too.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One last quickie. You gave an EPS range last year of 4% to 7%, the margin comment is slight improvement. Could you maybe just provide a little bit of context around kind of EPS dynamics and if there's some moving parts here around pension and there's a little bit of share count benefit all that kind of stuff...","David N. Farr","It will grow next year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Earnings will grow next year?","David N. Farr","Earnings will grow next year. I'm not going to give any more, Steve. Earnings will grow next year.","Operator","Our next question is from John Baliotti from Janney Capital Markets.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I just had a -- if we kind of go up in altitude, I was just -- if you take a step back, I know we, as a practice, take out onetime charges, nonrecurring events to look at the underlying business. But as you pointed out being CEO for 14 years, there's been a number of these, I guess, events, over the last couple of years, deals that were done before you were CEO. And I'm just curious, in terms of going forward, what kind of governors have you been able to put in place? So, to mitigate the risk. Obviously, global things change, there's not a lot you can do about that. Currency moves around, but given what you've learned over the last 14 years, what have you added to the due diligence process as you look to deploy capital going forward?","David N. Farr","I think a couple of issues from the standpoint of, I would say, from different technologies. I think we're looking today at more of an industry that will be, obviously, less volatile and from a technology standpoint. There's always been a trade-off of how we tried to figure out how to drive a little bit faster growth and sometimes you take a little bit more risk. And so I think we spent a lot more time around that issue, John, after the impact of the charges which have been very painful for the management team, including myself and the board. So I -- we spent a lot more time around that risk and the volatility and the reward or the downside from that standpoint on the charge. And secondly, I would say that if you look at where we've been making acquisitions the last several years, we've been focusing more on the industrial, the Climate and the Process sides. So I think we've changed our profile a little bit to where we've been making our acquisitions.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And just as a follow-up. On -- obviously, currency is beyond your control, but what kind of, just academically, what do you think on a reported revenue base, if we used the context of modest improvement in margins, what would you see as a, let's say, as an inflection point in reported growth that would -- given the investments you've made in the businesses over the years that would kind of step that up? In terms of the [indiscernible]...","David N. Farr","Not from a currency standpoint. You just take an underlying margin profitability standpoint...","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Yes, so if you're saying 4% to 5% core growth. Obviously, currency is nothing you can control, so you lose a couple of points there. You're going to lose a couple of points in divestitures. But if including those things, you were able to have a reported growth of a of couple points higher, how much higher do you think -- would you need to get to the 4% to 5% on a reported basis to get a nice -- a more significant improvement in profitability? Or could it be a little bit less?","David N. Farr","It's gonna to be more in the 5% range before to get that type of leverage point from the standpoint of what we see at this point, given where we are. Given we're running at profit margins that, I would say, last time I saw were record levels. And so I would say that we have to get above that 5% range to really have a nice leverage point, but it's -- just from the standpoint of -- unless I wanted to dial back the long term investments, which we have not done because we feel quite strongly that over the long term making those investments will strengthen our position in the market leadership, which we are today. We're a stronger company than -- today in the short term, thinking I could cut, I could cut, I could cut, and I think, then, I would have a much weaker company and then you have a whole different situation in your hands.","John Anthony Baliotti - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Right. And so obviously, the working capital comes down through that, your cash flow, all those things are -- positively benefit from that?","David N. Farr","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Peter Lennox-King","This is Peter Lennox-King on for Steve. Just a couple of questions. The first one being on -- could you talk about the release of your backlog and in terms of timing across the segments and how that links to expectations for revenue growth given that you were talking about H1 probably being a bit stronger than H2 in 2015?","David N. Farr","I -- from the perspective of Network Power backlog, it's historically within -- we expect that backlog to come out in the first and second quarter. I mean, obviously we also expect the order rate to keep growing, too. So -- and we see it Network Power growing next year. And if the order rate keeps growing, I wouldn't be surprised that the backlog doesn't keep growing because backlog will grow with your orders if you have a vibrant business. On the process side, historically, you would start seeing that backlog be eaten away here in the first half. [indiscernible] would expect that to happen this year. And then, again, it will start building back up as the order pace picks back up in second half of the year. Those are the 2 big backlog players. I mean, Industrial Automation and Climate are smaller backlog and those typically will come out within -- Climate comes out within 2 or 3 months and Industrial Automation usually within 3 to 4 months, 5 months.","Peter Lennox-King","Great. And could you talk about -- have you been seeing any changing in pricing -- price versus [indiscernible] in the order book?","David N. Farr","No. Pricing has pretty been -- pretty consistent all year long. From the standpoint, our price cost has been pretty consistent all year long, our net material inflation. And that tells you that the marketplace is not growing all that rapidly. And I would say with the -- on the flip side, the oil price dropping, that'll obviously put -- help our net material inflations. And so, right now, we're slightly positive in price and slightly negative on net material inflation, so we're doing okay. So the price cost is fine. And we haven't seen any changes there.","Peter Lennox-King","And then, finally, could you -- do you have any early returns on order trending by segment through October that you could share with us?","David N. Farr","No. Nothing yet. Nothing at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","This is Jiayan, filling in for Nigel. One, just quickly, on the power transmission divestiture, would you guys use the proceeds to buy back shares, that what you usually do? And if so, do you effectively offset a dilution by year-end '15?","David N. Farr","The answer is yes. We are expecting to do that, and it will -- based on what we're -- based on the expectations that we will -- we want to make those dilutions by the time we finish the fourth quarter. So yes and yes.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And a second one, just a quick follow-up, on climate margins. So in the press release you called out some unfavorable mix impact. Just wondering if that's related to the [indiscernible] previewed? And if so, should we expect this headwind to continue into 1Q '15?","David N. Farr","No, I think -- there are 2 things that are going on in the margin in the fourth quarter. We had -- our Asia business was very strong, and it is slightly lower-margin. And our North America, obviously, with the customer accommodation, that hurt us from a margin standpoint. So that's been -- that's assuming we've got everything sized like we believe we have it sized. That's behind us now in the fourth quarter. And so I think from a profitability standpoint for Climate next year, we'll probably look at getting back to where we were trending on a positive way and so we should be fine. Maybe a slight improvement in profitability at Climate, based on a total year number.","Jiayan Zhou - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Just lastly, can you share some initial thoughts on gross investment and restructuring spending for fiscal '15?","David N. Farr","The growth investments will probably be up from the -- up, I think, it was 110 last year, it will probably be about like 4% or 5%. Restructuring spending will be down slightly. I'm talking about -- I mean, nuance. What did we finally spent last year, Frank?","Frank J. Dellaquila","$52 million.","David N. Farr","$52 million?","Frank J. Dellaquila","Yes.","David N. Farr","So I would look at -- if I pick a number, I'd pick $50 million, nice round number. The restructuring next year would be $50 million. I mean, it could be -- if we had something pop-up, it may go to $60 million. And so right now, maybe $50 million to $55 million, something right around there. So was it $63 million?","Frank J. Dellaquila","No, it was at $50 million.","David N. Farr","Okay, $50 million, okay. [indiscernible] $55 million. Okay.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Wright with Nomura Securities.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So in the release you called out a significant favorable currency comparisons in the Process Management segment. I was wondering how much of the 130 basis points of margin improvement there was from the currency?","Frank J. Dellaquila","It was a pretty significant portion of that in the quarter. We had a lot of current -- transactional currency inside of the businesses. So it was a significant portion of that improvement.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Was that related to the weaker euro? What's -- what drives that?","Frank J. Dellaquila","Partially, it relates to the euro, but it has to do with various contracts they have in place with customers. So it's really a number of currencies, not even predominantly the euro, but the A dollar, the Sing dollar, the Brazil, it's a number of currencies where they have contracts denominated into third currencies. It's kind of a complicated accounting thing, but it is -- it just flushed through to be a positive in the fourth quarter.","David N. Farr","If you go back and look at it -- if you go back and look at the quarter, Q2 was a big negative. So it moves around and it's almost impossible to forecast.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And that's a one-off impact then we shouldn't expect stronger U.S. dollar over the first 3 quarters of next year to have a similar impact on Process margins?","David N. Farr","I don't think so. We don't plan on it. It really is a function, as Frank was saying, it's a function of where we get the contracts and which currencies move against us or are positive both ways. And sometimes, some years, it hurts us, some years that help us, some quarters that helps us, it hurts us, it's -- it just had to be one of those quarters where the contracts flipped the right way for us. And it's almost impossible to forecast.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, on the corporate line, the first half of 2014, you had a number of one-off items in there. The acquisition costs in Process, for the Process acquisitions. The others and restructuring charge, is there any reason or is there any offsets to a sort of a $50 million reduction in corporate, in 2015?","Frank J. Dellaquila","Yes. We'll have some headwinds that partially offset that in '15. Pension will be slightly higher, we'll have equity comp, which will be slightly higher. So we wouldn't expect to see all of that flow through in '15 versus '14.","Jonathan Wright - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And if I just squeeze one more in, if you don't mind. On Industrial Automation, you called up the hermetic motors business up 20% plus, but overall motors and drives down. Is there any -- I know that business is more levered to Europe, but is there anything else going on there, any sort of competitive dynamics sort of weighing on motors and drives as a whole?","David N. Farr","No. It's primarily driven via the Middle East and Western Europe. They have a very strong presence there. It was a very difficult marketplace for them. And that's what caused them.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions in our queue. I'd like to turn it over to our speakers for any closing and additional remarks.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, thanks, Pat, for the last several years working with us, and I'm looking forward to working with Ross. And appreciate everyone joining us, and thank all the operational people out there delivering '14 and looking forward to have another strong 2015.

Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. The conference is being recorded today, November 1, 2016.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual effects to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, William. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson, and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days.","In the fourth quarter results for the Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses were reported in discontinued operations. Considering this, and to aid in comparisons to prior quarters, we have provided results both on a continuing operations basis and on an adjusted basis, which includes these discontinued operations and excludes such items as separation cost for consistency. A further explanation of the reporting formats can be found on slide 2. Detailed bridges can also be found in the appendix to this presentation. Please turn to slide 3 for a summary of the fiscal year results.","Fiscal year sales of $20.2 billion decreased 9% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 6%. The fiscal year results reflected a more challenging economic environment than we expected as we entered the year, as the company has faced difficult conditions in its key served markets for seven consecutive quarters. Within our industrial businesses, the most significant factors have been the impact on energy-related customer spending from persistently low oil and gas prices as well as weak general industrial and emerging market spending.","Across our other businesses, we did find bright spots related to generally more favorable market conditions in U.S. construction; data center spending, particularly cloud-based and co-location customers; telecommunications infrastructure; and global air-conditioning and refrigeration.","Adjusted earnings per share decreased 6% to $2.98. As a result of the continuation of difficult market conditions, restructuring spending totaled $112 million for the fiscal year, exceeding our previous guidance of $90 million to $100 million. The completion of the actions also positions us for what we expect to be a challenging 2017.","Finally, solid earnings, conversion and improved trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating cash flow generation of $2.9 billion, or $3.1 billion, which was 15.1% of sales, excluding $179 million of separation costs.","Turning to slide 4, net sales of $5.5 billion were down 6%, with underlying sales down 5% in the quarter. Served market conditions in the fourth quarter remained generally consistent to previous quarters, with weak oil and gas and general industrial spending outweighing favorable data center, telecommunications, air conditioning and refrigeration spend. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.96 increased 3%. For the quarter, working capital improvement drove operating cash flow generation of $957 million.","Turning to slide 5, favorable materials cost containment, restructuring benefits and solid operational execution led to gross profit of 41.7%, which was up 100 basis points, and EBIT margin of 16.8%, up 60 basis points versus the prior year.","Turning to slide 6, the continuation of a low-growth environment led to underlying sales decreases in all geographies for the fiscal year. Fourth quarter underlying sales were generally representative of the full year but improved in some regions such as Asia, China and the United States.","Turning to slide 7, total segment margin was up 140 basis points to 17.1%, primarily driven by benefits from restructuring actions and operational execution. Capital spending was held to $169 million, equal to the prior year.","Turning to slide 8, Process Management sales decreased 11% as spending levels in energy-related markets remained low for both capital and operational expenditures, while power and life sciences customers continued to provide growth opportunities.","Restructuring spending in the quarter was $54 million, slightly above the prior year. Segment margin decreased 280 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. The Automation businesses will remain under pressure through the majority of fiscal 2017, with the possibility of orders recovery in the second half assuming stability in oil and gas prices.","Turning to slide 9, Industrial Automation sales decreased 7% resulting from a continuation of low levels of spending in upstream oil and gas and weak but slightly improving conditions in general industrial markets. Segment margin increased 190 basis points to 16.3%, primarily due to business mix, benefits from restructuring actions and lower restructuring spend in the quarter. The divestitures of the Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses remain on track to close by the end of the calendar year.","Looking ahead to 2017, general industrial markets will remain challenging, with slightly improving conditions as the year progresses.","Turning to slide 10, Network Power underlying sales were flat in the quarter supported by favorable demand in power products, thermal management and service. Strong growth in North America was led by cloud-based and co-location data center customers as well as telecommunication spending by mobile and broadband providers. Segment margin improved 650 basis points to 13.1%, benefiting from favorable mix, savings from restructuring actions and gross profit improvement programs. The Network Power divestiture also remains on track for completion by the end of the calendar year.","Turning to slide 11, Climate Technologies' sales increased 6%, driven by strong growth in U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning as well as refrigeration and residential air conditioning markets in China. Segment margin increased 320 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to volume leverage, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The 2017 outlook for global demand in air conditioning and refrigeration markets supports our expectation for low-single-digit growth for our Climate businesses.","Turning to slide 12, Commercial and Residential Solutions' underlying sales were equal to the prior year as growth in food waste disposers and wet-dry vacuums offset declines in other businesses. Segment margin improved 370 basis points to 25.9% from the benefits of restructuring actions and the impact of the InterMetro divestiture. Favorable conditions in U.S. construction markets are expected to support our outlook for low-single-digit growth in fiscal 2017.","Turning to slide 13, fiscal year 2016 was more difficult than we had expected, impacted by a significant and unprecedentedly long global industrial downturn that we expect to continue into 2017. Our automation businesses will remain under pressure from these market headwinds while our commercial businesses will benefit from favorable conditions in global air conditioning and refrigeration and from construction markets in the United States and Asia.","Considering these factors, we provide the following guidance for fiscal year 2017. Net and underlying sales will be down 1% to 3%, with the Automation Solutions platform down 4% to 7% and the Commercial and Residential Solutions platform up 2% to 4%. The Automation Solutions platform will be comprised of our current Process Management segment and the remaining businesses from the Industrial Automation segment, while the Commercial and Residential Solutions platform will be comprised of the businesses within our current Climate Technology and Commercial and Residential Solutions segments.","Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.50, which compares to earnings per share on a continuing basis and excluding divestiture gains of $2.45 in 2016 and $2.81 in 2015. The 2017 EPS guidance also excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Pentair's valves and controls business.","And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Craig. And in case you guys don't realize, Craig is rooting for the Cleveland Indians tonight to win and take the World Series, so he's not totally paying attention right now. He's focused on the Cleveland Indians.","I want to thank everybody for joining us today. Again, it's a good way to finish a very challenging global industrial world that was not an easy year, but a very challenging year nonetheless. And I think we continue to execute and get our position in the right condition for better growth in the future.","I want to thank all the employees, the corporate leaders, the OC members for their support and your effort this year. We got a lot done in a very tough global business environment, which has been challenging for us for the last two years. And with a good finish on the fiscal 2016 in the fourth quarter, even though sales were down, margins were close to record levels from last year. We had strong cash flow, we had good conversion. In the quarter we also announced the cash sale for Network Power, cash sale for Leroy-Somer CT, generating over $5.2 billion of cash, and an agreement to purchase the Pentair valves and control business for $3.15 billion.","As Craig mentioned, most likely we'll get the divestiture done by the end of this quarter. We clearly are driving, trying to get the valves control business closed by the end of this quarter. We still have to get global government approvals on that acquisition, and we're moving forward with that. That acquisition is uniquely strategic to us relative to our end markets, our solutions package and our ability to really integrate that and fit it well within our broad global customer offering. And so we're very excited about the opportunity there to generate future growth, earnings and cash flow.","We executed for the second year on restructuring. Restructuring, remember, was down from the prior year because we had very high levels of restructuring in fiscal 2015, but still over $100 million of restructuring throughout the year in 2016, and the savings are flowing through. We nearly maintained a 17% operating profit this year despite sales being down 9%, which is quite a major task given a big drop-off that we saw in the Automation Solutions business.","We had strong cash flow again this year, better than last year when you take out the cost of doing the repositioning, excellent conversion. So we're exiting the year with two strategic divestitures, one unique strategic acquisition, strong balance sheet, good cash position, and we have a very good vision where we see things unfolding here for the next 12 months.","You now have the new GAAP P&L and balance sheet for Emerson. I'm sure you'll have a lot of questions about it. We will supply five years of history in the end report. We'll also give you a very good 2014, too, and I think three-year details. And it will give you a chance to start to understand the new Emerson. Also we'll start giving out the sales and orders relative to our platform, the two platforms, Automation Solutions and then also the Commercial Residential Solutions. So we'll start giving some information, Craig has the information, he'll start feeding it out to you, and we'll get more to you as we go forward here in the 10-K, and then also we'll give more as we report our first quarter in fiscal 2017.","We made a decision to give you a little bit more insight into what we see for next year given what the new company is structured, what the new P&L looks like, what the new balance sheet looks like. Right now we see underlying sales down 1% to 3% with Automation Solutions being still in a challenging mode down 4% to 7%, which will be a third year in a row that Automation Solutions is down. Our Commercial Residential business has turned the corner and has grown, and we expect that will continue to grow 2% to 4% next year. Both will deliver solid operating margins and both will be better. Restructuring around the Automation Solutions will continue but at a little lower level, excluding our integration of Pentair valves and control.","Some minor restructuring going on underneath the Commercial Residential Solutions, but primarily we're making significant increased investments in the infrastructure to create best cost locations, to create a more efficient structure within the new Commercial Residential underneath Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann. A lot of integration work going on there. And then eventually when we get clearance from the governments we'll get integration work under Pentair valves and control. We're ready to go. We already have our day one through six month plans ready to implement and working very, very hard on it, so a lot underway relative to our execution around this acquisition. So we feel good about how we finish the year, feel good about how we're going into our position relative to our repositioning effort.","With EPS it's all about how do we maintain or have a slight increase in EPS next year. We gave you the range of $2.35 to $2.50 but we're very much focused, can we deliver some moderate, low-single, negative-single growth in underlying sales and execute better margins and deliver a little bit better earnings per share. We're very much focused on running this business now that we have the repositioning effort underway.","It's been a tough market. There's not a lot of growth out there. It's a challenging market, but we know where we have to go. From our perspective, from the management team, we downsized around the world, both in the operating units and also the corporate units. We have a very solid team ready to execute around our plan for 2017 and 2018 and beyond. Restructuring, our cost position is in pretty good shape right now. There's always more restructuring to do, but we've got the majority of the big heavy lifting behind us, when you exclude the Pentair valves and control, but we've really got our position from our perspective in good shape.","We're very much focused on trying to, again, bring in some additional acquisitions in 2017. We will end from the positioning and the acquisition, we'll end up with over $4.5 billion of cash positioned in the right place to invest, and so we'll continue to look on at the small bolt-ons, strategic-type acquisitions, to rebuild our base as we've talked about back to $20 billion within this five-year time period, getting our operating cash flow back to over $3.2 billion, which will allow us to drive a modest increase in dividends and get that free cash flow to \u2013 dividend payout ratio back under 50%. We've showed that plan, we did that in the Morgan Stanley conference a couple weeks ago, a couple months ago. We are on course to make sure we execute around that vision, so that's what we're all about.","I want to thank the organization for the work they've done the last 12 months. We have changed a lot in Emerson in the last 12 months, from the change in the businesses, from the restructuring, to delivering very solid earnings and cash in a very challenging year, to improving our cost structure, to making a big acquisition hopefully we'll get finalized at the end of this calendar year, and then moving forward in a new company. Yes, it's a smaller company. It's a very profitable company, but a company that's well-positioned I think to grow and recover as global investments start happening again. So I like where we are right now. We had a good session with the board today, talking about how we wrapped up the year and where we're going to go forward, but I think we're in really good shape.","We have a very, very difficult first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year. The Automation Solutions business is looking at probably down 10% sales in the first quarter. If you've been watching this, the orders for the last several, six or eight months, the orders have been down around the 10%, 12%, 13% range. They've got to get through that, and so we have a very difficult first quarter from Automation Solutions, and we know that and we're built for that. We'll try to get some more restructuring done, but that's the facts at this point in time. That's built into our forecast, and the year will get better as we go forward.","But clearly we've got to get through the next two or three months here, finish the divestitures, make the acquisition, and then move forward with the new company.","So with that, I'll open up the door and the windows and the phone lines and let people talk. Ask any questions you want. No one gave me the questions ahead of time. I tried to call CNN, but unfortunately they didn't return my phone call. So I don't have the questions ahead of time. And Craig was so focused on reading the damn box score from the baseball game, which they lost the other night, that he didn't give me any questions, either.","So with that, we'll open up the phone lines and take questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You up first, Julian?","Operator","And the first question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You didn't send me the question, did you, Julian?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, no, no, not intentionally, that's for sure. On the guidance of sort of margins to be I think up in both platforms in 2017, maybe just give some color on what the incremental savings are this year in your continuing business. And also maybe expand a little bit on the restructuring spend. As you said, it was about $96 million continuing last year. Is it sort of more like $60 million, $70 million this year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's going to be \u2013 on an incremental savings standpoint, I mean, the numbers we laid out, and we have those; we laid them out \u2013 let me give you the numbers, Julian. We'll give you the numbers before we get off this call here, but we laid out \u2013 I can't the exact numbers the restructuring saved, I don't have them on a piece of paper right in front of me, but I can give you the delta year-to-year.","On the restructuring number that we're going to turn around $50 million in the core company and somewhere between $50 million to $70 million once we start getting the valves and controls business approval and integrated. So go ahead, Frank. You can go ahead and tell him.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","So built into the plan next year is about $100 million \u2013 this year, I should say \u2013 of op savings. A lot of that is carryover from actions already taken, and we've got, as Dave said, about $50 million of new spend in the plan. And given the timing and the nature of the actions, we'll see about half of that flow through the end of the year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And then just on the top line, so your continuing sales, organic guidance is a decline of about 2% at the midpoint. The orders on a continuing basis are falling in September about 8% to 9% organically. So maybe just give us some help around when you think those orders may level out, and particularly in that Process Automation piece.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, the key here, Julian, is Automation Solutions. I mean, clearly, right now as we look at the early stage of October, they were slightly better in orders in October. Automation Solutions were pretty much in line to what they were last month that we put out there \u2013 I mean, I'm sorry, Commercial and Residential Solutions, I apologize.","I mean, right now we're saying late third quarter we'll start seeing a positive Automation Solutions, and so they'll start bottoming out and coming up in the new calendar year. That will be the key issue to watch.","And I mean from our perspective right now we're hoping to have obviously positive Automation Solution orders by that number above the line by the time we get out of this year, and that's where the bet is here right now, and that's how we see everything laying out basically from our customers and our initial reactions. So that's the $15 billion question right there is where does that number turn up? Right now, we're saying it's going to start getting better in the early calendar year of 2017 but will not go positive until late, on the Automation Solutions standpoint, until late 2017. That's what it is.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Is that true of the sort of the MRO piece within Process?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. MRO has got to lead us up. I mean, small projects, what we call brownfield projects, additions into a current facility, they will come but that will come later. We've got to start seeing some turnaround. We're starting to see some early indication right now in some of the international markets. The market we have not seen stabilize right now is North America. And so that's the marketplace that we have to see that stability and we have to see them starting to spend some MRO in this North America market.","And how long can they keep deferring that? I think we will not get clarity until that first calendar quarter from our major investors as they finish out their fiscal year, as they see their cost structure. So that's why I think the first fiscal quarter, which is the fourth calendar quarter, will be very difficult because I think our customer base will be tight, tight, tight with cash and be concerned. So that's where I see it right now, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Dave, Good afternoon. How you doing?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, my friend.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So China, I mean it looks like it turned a bit for you in the quarter, especially in Climate markets. Did you see an end to inventory destocking in Climate? Or did business just simply get better there? And what do you think for 2017 in China?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's not one simple \u2013 I mean China's a big country, big market. Clearly what we see right now are some of the investments around the environment, some of the investments around energy efficiency, we're seeing the Climate Technology investments or the Automated Solutions \u2013 I mean Commercial Residential Solutions, those markets are picking back up for us. They've continued here early on in this fiscal quarter, first quarter. So we see that market turning.","Now obviously, after being down real negative for a while, you get a nice bounce. And that's where we are right now. So we're expecting moderate growth in China in our Commercial Residential Solutions business for 2017. Our orders in Automation Solutions have stabilized in China. Again, you keep in mind the markets we serve in China are not necessarily in the big oil and gas new fields and things like that. We're looking at efficiency. We're looking at power plants. We're looking at programs to help incremental capacity and save energy and things like that. Those markets are actually starting to solidify in China. So we are cautiously optimistic about China, that we will see low-single-digit positive growth in 2017.","Now ask me that question in February, I might give you a different answer. But right now that's what we're seeing based on our indication of orders the last couple of months and our customers. So I feel good about that. The other market I feel good about will be Europe. If you look at the new Emerson, the Automation Solutions, the Commercial Residential, Europe grew last year and I think will grow again this year. Those are the two positive markets. And then it gets real short after that.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's helpful, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Look, you've obviously done a lot of restructuring in the last couple of years. You've done a great job of holding margin, as you said. At some point as you know you start cutting into the bone a bit. So how much low-hanging fruit do you have if markets don't improve? How much more can you hold margin? I mean, you've got that again for 2017 where you've got the clientele (26:45) and it looks like you're going to hold margins again. So can you talk about that, Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I can talk about that. The key issue, let's break it down in two pieces and I'll give you a total perspective from a CEO industry perspective, okay? On the Commercial Residential Solutions, Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann laid out a plan. They're integrating these businesses today. And we see some opportunities in between the creases, let's say, to improve plant efficiency, plant costs, distribution, things like that. So we see the ability to basically get a point out of cost structure and improve the profitability by a point over the next couple of years, get some working capital out, take some of that money, invest it, try to continue to grow that business but also let some of that money flow through.","So there we're looking at by emerging, putting the business together, some inefficiencies that we have today by separate business, by putting them together. But once that's done we've got to grow because the cost structure will be very, very, very, very good. On the Automation Solutions standpoint, we probably have $40 million, $50 million of the core company left. And then you've got some very, very difficult issues there. From the \u2013 just starting to go after things you don't want to go after because it jeopardize the future technology innovation and the value base of this company.","The acquisition of Pentair valves and controls gives us a chance to go after even more. And that's why we're going to be looking at $50 million to $75 million in the first year, depending on when we get this done, on the restructuring. And there's potentially we'll do even more than that in the next two years. So the acquisition of Pentair valves and controls gives us a chance to refresh opportunities for us to integrate again a much larger business. You take the $7 billion Automation Solutions business today, you add $1.6 billion in there, you have a chance to do things.","Now if the economy doesn't grow and we continue to struggle for growth, hence you're going to continue to see acquisitions. That's why you're seeing acquisitions. U.S. companies have been going through a lot of restructuring, taking costs out. We're running at pretty high levels of profitability for the level of sales we have, and hence that's why you're seeing acquisitions. That's why you're going to see that continue I think in the short term, unless there's some kind of growth in 2017 which I don't see at this point in time.","So if this thing keeps going and gets sloppy, then we're going to have to add to our acquisition pool, and that's why we're going to be looking at an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of acquisitions over the next two or three years to continue to feed our chance to reposition and restructure and derive top-line growth through acquisitions, because the core economic growth we do not see coming through for the next couple of years. That's what this CEO sees from a cost perspective and growth perspective.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's great, Dave. Thanks very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hey, Dave. How's it going?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Not too bad.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I did send my questions to Craig. He's lying, he's got them.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, he's working that box score, Nigel, you know that. He's working that box score. He's got some kind of voodoo baby down there he's playing around with trying to make sure they win tonight.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I'm sure, I'm sure. So all's fair in love and war. So Automation Solutions is down 4% to 7%. Obviously, how do we think about \u2013 the legacy sort of industrial automation stuff flat this quarter. You've got some components of that segment performing very well. Process I'm assuming will be below the 4% to 7%. So how do we think about the various moving pieces within that portfolio? And then valves and controls obviously comes in as an acquisition line, but is the kind of down 4% to 7% the same for that portfolio...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","... or was that a bit later cycle?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, Nigel, think about the chart that we showed you, that I gave you when we did the Pentair valves and control chart, the $260 billion market we broke down in three pieces. You had the Process, you had the high grade and then you had the discrete. You think about \u2013 remember that chart we handed out?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The Process side will be worse than negative 4% to 7% and our Hybrid\/Discrete business will basically be flat growth next year. And therefore that's how we get the 4% to 7% combined, okay? We're looking at the marketplace, that $260 billion marketplace that we showed you when we did the valves and control acquisition. The Process piece will be down more than 4% to 7% and the other Hybrid piece will be flat or slightly up, maybe 1%, plus or minus 1%. And that's why the Process business will be a little bit more negative than we said, the 4% to 7%, to your point.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then the Pentair portfolio, does that come in at a similar kind of organic decline as the Emerson Process business or...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think, as I said when we did the acquisition, I have a little bit more pessimistic view of what that business is going to look like for the next 12 to 18 months. One, the order pace has not been very good. Secondly, there's going to be a lot of disruption and integration work going on I think that will negatively impact this business for 12 to 18 months. Once it comes on board, it will be the same growth rate as the overall Process business, but I think as you look at 2017 and 2018, I think they're going to be a little bit less than the underlying what we call Process Automation business. And we're going to be creating that problem ourselves probably.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then a quick one, Dave. The comments on acquisitions are obviously very interesting. You've made it very clear that you're done with the portfolio disposals, you've got one more coming up. But looking at the tools markets, there's been a fair amount of consolidation talked about in the tools market. You've got a great plumbing tools business, high multiples are getting paid. Does that make you kind of re-think about your portfolio as maybe perhaps one or two more sales to accelerate your acquisitions into Automation?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I think that from within our tool business base right now there's some good leverage across some of the other core Automation and Solutions businesses. There's some good leverage there so if there's no strategic lever between on the Commercial Residential and Automation Solutions, we will get out of that business. But right now the portfolio that's remaining, other than the one storage business, there's some good leverage of channel, leverage of technologies, leverage of things that we can do that we will stay pat.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Understood. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care, Nigel.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Steven Winoker from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, just maybe starting you talked about margins up in 2017. You just walked through the restructuring side of that story, but maybe complete that bridge in terms of how you're thinking about it. Assuming that you do get that 1% to 3% low organic growth, what about price versus cost? Material costs? What about other productivity? What about other puts and takes that get you to stay positive next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You want me to give you all the answers?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Well, Dave, it simplifies everybody's life right now.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You know me, I'll give you my interpretation. I'll give you what I feel, okay, Steve?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yep. Yeah, that's good.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll give you the best feel I have at this point in time. I fundamentally believe right now we are about as close as we've been for a while relative to this price cost pressures, being pricing has been, as you know, has been basically flat for us I think last year, last two years basically slightly up, slightly down, 0.1%, 0.2%. Now we've been able to offset that with stronger net material inflation.","What I see coming into us right now, either this quarter or next quarter, is our price-cost ratio pressures are going to build. And so we're factoring into higher cost reduction efforts within the company because I wouldn't be surprised if we do not go red for one or two quarters on our price-cost ratios in 2017. I've told people at the Fed this same issue. There is inflation brewing relative to specific skill set, material deflation is slowing down if not starting to come up, and our pricing capability is not that strong right now because there's plenty of capacity out there and there's not a lot of demand.","So the pressure is building on this whole price-cost scenario. So what we're building in right now in our plan is basically to stay neutral because I think if you let it run its course we're going to be slightly red on a price-cost situation. We have to increase our cost reductions, and it's going to be primarily around cost reduction. Productivity is going to be tough. We'll probably be 1% or 2% next year on productivity. We're better than the U.S. economy, but there's not a lot of growth out there. So it's extremely hard to get a lot more productivity without some additional growth.","So right now we're having to ramp up our cost reductions around sort of discretionary things and keep the place kind of tight. So that's how I see the unfolding next year. We're going to get \u2013 we've got the savings from the restructuring we did last year, early this year. But in order to hold our margins and improve our profitability next year, we're going to have to come up with more stronger discretionary cost savings because I think price-cost will be working against us. That's my call. I'm sure you've not heard that from anybody, but that's my call","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","No, and since you're being so generous answering questions, let me ask you one more here, which is \u2013 and this one, you continue to get in advance because we ask it every time. So you talk about Pentair valves and controls...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Are you telling me you gave me this question ahead of time? Is that what you're telling me?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm telling you we ask you the same question over and over again.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So it's good. So...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm a slow learner.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Pentair valves and controls, you talk about it being uniquely strategic to generate future growth for the company. Clearly there are a lot of people in the market who are having more skepticism about understanding that. Since you've had more time with it, is there anything in there that you can kind of point to that sort of provides a little more encouragement to you and maybe to investors that, hey, this is something that people should appreciate more than they do?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We've now had the opportunity to talk to our customer base about this. I mean the most strategic opportunity for us is that we can get them into a lot bigger customers that they couldn't get into themselves. We can get them on to large projects which we win, which they never won because they don't have the control system or the whole package. We can now offer a much larger service package. We can service a whole host of product for our customers so now we can be this sort of the core service organization for them.","The leverage across the total portfolio, now people, all they want to do is think about that's a dumb valve, then that's very narrow thinking. You could say, oh yeah, that's not that strategic. But what we're talking about is, when we go out and bid for projects, when we go out for the type of packages we get with our large global customer base, we now will be able to offer them a much larger solution both up front and the service and tie that technology together.","So we see a lot more growth synergies from that leverage of our organization on a global basis than a person who only thinks, only thinks about a valve company standalone operation. And I think in five years people will look back and say, hey, you did get a lot more growth than we thought you would. But that's what I see right now.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Fantastic. Thanks, Dave. Good luck.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You take care, Steve.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey. So a couple of questions. First, I just wanted to maybe better understand the comment on lower pricing at Climate Tech in the quarter. Was this just surcharge-related linked to material cost? Or was it actual incremental price pressure or something we should be concerned about?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No, Gautam. It's not. It's not incremental price pressure. Again, it relates back again to \u2013 again, we talked about this before. Most of the OEMs are on some kind of contractual matrix-type pricing. So as commodities go up or down, pricing is adjusted. So in this environment when commodities are low, pricing goes down to match that. So there's a bit of a lag occasionally, but that's what the impact is.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just to follow on Nigel's question about the split at the remaining Industrial Automation business. Can you remind us of how much of the remaining business is linked directly to oil and gas? If I recall, it was pretty small, something like 10%, 15%, but I want to make sure of that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's pretty small. Yeah, I mean, I would say we're \u2013 by the way, when we report a new segments or new \u2013 it's going to be one. It's going to be called Automation Solutions.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, no, I hear you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're going to get one number, Automation Solutions. So I was all of you guys' thinking right now. We gave you a chart relative to our total Process business, Automation Solutions, Hybrid and Discrete. You may want to learn those numbers because that's how we're going to be talking about this business, Automation Solutions. So I was being nice to whoever asked me that question. But from my perspective we are looking at one company as being integrated, period.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. But in the splits in terms of the growth rates, I guess the point is at the legacy Remainco Industrial Automation business, most of that is not related \u2013 it's not linked to the same markets, the legacy process businesses, and that's why...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There are some crossovers. There's some crossovers. They sell the chemical business. Yeah, they sell the Hybrid space, the pharmaceuticals. So there are some crossover spaces there. And so you have to \u2013 so that if you think about we gave the chart and so you can see how that breaks down across those three entities. And some of those businesses do a small piece. Small piece will go into the core process marketplace. It's a small piece of that.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not going to...","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not going to wag the tail, as you say.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. Understood.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And then just below the line, could you calibrate us on items like corporate expense this year, what we should put in there for buybacks this year and maybe any other moving pieces below the line?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I think the corporate number, I mean I'm just talking about a corporate number. I don't have a number. I mean the corporate number, we'll give it to you later. I don't have that. We're still going through this. Let's get through all the closures and stuff like that and divestitures as we get into the year. So we'll give you a better feel for that in February at the Investors conference. You dial in about $500 million of share repurchase. We'll have some pension headwind this year. Interest rates did go down, if you didn't notice. They went down. And so we'll have, what, what's the pension headwind is what...","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","$40 million. $40 million to $50 million.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$40 million to $50 million headwind for us as a corporation. Those are the two issues right there. Currency right now is kind of neutral. And so the two headwinds for us are really going to be that, and then we'll see how things settle down from a corporate standpoint once we get all the divestitures and acquisitions done. And we'll give that number to you in February.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Robert McCarthy from Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. How you doing today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","How you doing, Rob? You got those kids buying Emerson stock yet, I hope?","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","We're levering up. Hope the SEC is not listening. Okay. In any event. Moving on, earning...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You know I'm just kidding, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Earnings is earnings but cash is cash, okay? So from that standpoint, could you talk, Dave, about your cadence for operating cash and free cash flow generation over the next couple of years? And kind of what are your \u2013 given what you're planning for a difficult environment, can you give investors some confidence that the dividend remains sacrosanct in the context of this transitional period?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Do I need to like break my left leg, rip it off and give it to you or something like that, or my right leg? Or \u2013 so go back, seriously. And by the way, I was being facetious. People on the phone listening, I did not tell Rob to buy stock for his kids. All those people, since the SEC has no humor.","For 2017 there's two numbers you need to think about for 2017. This was driven into our heads across the organization: $2.5 billion operating cash flow and $2 billion free cash flow, a number that's pretty tight to our modeling and we're going to manage according \u2013 as the organization is talking about it. So if we can beat it, we can beat it, but that would put us at 62% of dividend to free cash flow cover, okay?","Then as we move into 2018 and 2019, we're not assuming any big breakout or anything like that, but we're trying to get back into adding about $100 million of cash to $150 million of operating cash flow per year. Now our plan is to continue to keep the dividend going up modestly, as I told the people, you know, two pennies. We'll have share repurchase of around $500 million per year. That allows us to basically keep the dividend \u2013 the actual payments flat or slightly down. And so we'll see as we get into right now 2020, 2021, we'll be back down toward that 50% level. If we do not make any more additional acquisitions, that's what's going to happen.","If we make additional acquisitions on top of Pentair, our game plan is to get that number back \u2013 our operating cash flow back up to $3.2 billion, spending around $600 million of capital. That gets us back into the high-40%s free cash flow to dividends from that perspective.","So our model right now says that we'll continue to make acquisitions, we'll continue to integrate them, generate cash from those. We'll continue to buy stock back and continue to increase our dividend modestly, so that's what we're looking at right now. And our model looks at do we do nothing other than Pentair, and if it does that, we'll get closer to 50%. If we do some additional deals, which we want to do, then we'll obviously get back under 50% in the next five years.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then just as a follow up, I mean, obviously Julian asked kind of a line-in-the-sand question for Automation Solutions in terms of the order trends, the cadence for the year. But usually kind of how you lay out the year is basically you guide fiscal 1Q and then get a peek into next year kind of for your full-year guidance. You've given us the full-year guidance now, given all the puts and takes.","I guess, looking at kind of known-unknowns going into February, Dave, I mean, what are the three or four key things that you want to come in hat in hand in February to have a better sense of kind of the macro variables so that you can have a better sense of whether you're going to actually grow earnings next year? What are the kind of three or four things we should be looking for, given your increased line of sight, February versus now?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The number one issue, the number two issue, and one, two and three will be the trend line of Process \u2013 or Automation Solutions orders, in particular North America orders. We need that chart \u2013 we need that line coming up, like I thought it was going to do last year. I made the call, and I was wrong. We need that line coming up towards that flat line, that zero line, and that's going to be very \u2013 that's number one, two and three.","And so I haven't totally mapped it out yet. I want to see how the next couple months \u2013 right now, when a lot of things happen, as we close out our fiscal year, the first couple months are tough with our customer base, so I want to see what happens here October, November, December and January in order pace. That will give me a clear idea how much has flushed through the system, and then we need to see that trend line coming up.","If we do not see a pretty good slope of those orders in particular in North America, then we'll have a hard, hard time growing earnings next year. But that's the top couple of issues right there.","The second issue from our perspective will be \u2013 or the third or fourth issue will be I'm watching the Commercial Residential in Asia. As Asia continues to grow for us in the Commercial Residential, and then we \u2013 because I think we'll see a pretty good transitional growth in North America. I think we'll still see pretty good growth there. If Asia continues to grow for us in Commercial Residential Solutions, then I'll feel good about that segment holding up throughout 2017.","So that will be the key thing I'm watching for those guys. And then clearly Automation Solutions' order trending line up and the lines pointing towards hitting that cross point sometime late in our fiscal 2017. And that's what we'll be watching like a hawk. You know we're (48:02) too so...","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Donna Brazile signing off.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. That's good. That's really good.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Hey. How's it going, Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Pretty good.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good. Good. Hey. Two questions. The first one, just back to Process and I don't know, just trying to kind of figure out the secret decoder ring here for what the turn might look like. Are you seeing MRO turning in other regions outside the U.S., so is there something to glean from the pace of activity in other areas that give us a little bit of roadmap to think about how North America and the U.S. market could play out?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't think the other markets really have anything to do with North America. MRO in Europe, MRO in Asia Pacific has been decent, trending \u2013 Europe's been positive and Asia Pacific's starting to trend the right way. They don't really drive North America. I mean, that's the wild card we've got to watch and when we start saying North America Automation Solutions, so get the phrase right there, Automation Solutions trending the right way, it's going to be the key phrase for us. If you don't see us saying that, then we're really going to start struggling and we will not be able to deliver what we laid out in that range earlier this year.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","But I really think we will.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, I was thinking a handoff from CapEx to MRO...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah...","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And how that played out in other areas is maybe...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, it's a different game plan here. North America, the way the multinationals going to do, because they have a lot more control, in North America they cut here deeper, and it's just the way that it is. When you think about labor and restructuring, there's always more in North America because we have a lot more flexibility. That's the same thing here. So around MRO, there's no decoder rings relative to, you say, relative to what happens in Europe or what happens in Latin America or what happens in Asia Pacific. It's a whole different game, okay?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the M&A side, Dave, do you see a relatively active pipeline? Are there chunky things that you might do? There's a big water asset that's for sale, filtration asset that's for sale now for example.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We never got into that business because there was a good reason for it, so I'll pass on that one. A lot of hype around water filtration. No, I think there are opportunities out there. I think you're going to see opportunities for us emerge and I think we have capabilities that will emerge as we get into the new calendar year. We're highly focused right now on trying to get all the approvals for \u2013 when you think about, we've got two major divestitures and a major acquisition underway. There are a massive number of approvals we have to get around the world on three of those capabilities. So right now, we've sort of got our tools down and there are opportunities out there, we're working them, but we'll really gear back up once we get all these approvals done. But there are...","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Are there any...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","... opportunities out there. I wouldn't worry about that.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Are there any particular snags on those approvals that you're seeing?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. It just takes time.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, all right. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, it takes time. And I mean have you heard of any approvals flying through quickly?","Operator","Our next question today comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Dave. Going back to the trajectory of Process turning in the second half of fiscal 2017...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Automation Solutions. I will not be using the word Process today. Sorry.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Automation Solutions, sorry.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Automation Solutions, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, I got it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Two platforms. Automation Solutions and Commercial Residential Solutions.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I've got the tags in front of me.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Check, Automation Solutions. Okay.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But going back to the trajectory of Automation Solutions, the line crossing, I guess, in orders and then the results in the second half of 2017 per what you're aspiring, is there a threshold level of oil prices that you think have to sustain itself or maybe move to a certain level to kind of get the...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Customers that you've been talking with to kind of stimulate it here, or no?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's stability here. I think it's stability between the mid-$40s up to the mid-$50s right now. I think that's what \u2013 they just need to see where they are. Our customer needs to see where they are from a cash flow standpoint, a cost structure standpoint. This industry \u2013 our end customer in this industry has been going through a lot of restructuring also for the last 18 months, and so they're trying to get stabilized like we're trying to get stabilized.","So I think the key issue for me, John, is stability. And we've seen a little bit of stability, though it's drifted back down again on the oil side, but I mean the key thing for us is to see some stability around that, not some high-level mark. And I think that way these guys can plan their cash flow, they can plan their capital allocation from a dividend standpoint or share repurchase, whatever they're trying to do, and then allocate back to capital. And I'm hoping that we'll see some more capital reallocate back to MRO versus some finishing off of projects like they had last year. Okay?","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And so is there a way to then sort of drill down into ultimately the reasons that you feel that \u2013 sort of going back to February, right, when we thought that things were going to turn and they ultimately didn't, why is it that things are going to turn in the second half of 2017? Is it just because we've been in a downturn for much longer or you actually are seeing more stability? Or what is it? Obviously, the comparison issues I get. But I think you're talking more on the fundamental side. So I'm just trying to go...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Back to what are the reasons for the progress in your confidence?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","John, you've got to go back and think about where the price of oil was. It was not \u2013 it was trending. It was in the $50s and they made a call that it was go in the $20s. And it went down into $30. And the oil, our customer base did a quick reevaluation in the spring, summer about, oh, my God, how do I protect my capital structure? How do I protect all these things with a much lower oil price? So they cut capital much deeper than they said originally; they had told us in January, February, we get the early indications from them. So that's what happened there.","Now we go forward here. Now we're out here sitting in late in the year, we're sitting here in the November time period, oil pricing and the gas prices have been stabilizing here for several months. And the trend line has been a little bit better. It does go up and down. They have now got a year behind them relative to their whole capital structure, some of the big projects had to get done. They cut really heavily on the day-to-day spending, and I think you're going to see that stability in the pricing if it stays that way and within a range, then you'll see some more money go back into the day-to-day capital. And that's the difference.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, perfectly clear. Dave, you're sounding reasonably constructive on the European markets. And I know you're a steward of geopolitical events. Are you not \u2013 I mean a couple of companies have called out European softening even of late. Are you not a little bit concerned about Brexit now actually moving forward, possibly causing a European improvement scenario to fizzle? Or...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, if you listened to me talk the last couple of times, I said Europe is weaker.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yep.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All I said, Europe will grow. We grew this year. I think it will grow less in 2017 than it did in 2016.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","But I've been openly been telling people \u2013 and if anyone's hear me talk, they've heard me say Europe has definitely weakened. Europe is definitely growing. The euro is weaker, so again it's going to help our European operation. The euro went back down into the $1.09 to $1.10. If it gets back up to $1.15, it'll make it tougher. But it's definitely going to weaken. And I think the hoopla around Brexit is hoopla. And so I think from my perspective Europe will grow next year but it won't be as much growth as this year.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And just lastly, do you feel that China in terms of the levels it's achieved, is it sustainable? Or is it \u2013 because some are sort of concerned, is this just a function of Chinese stimulus that then goes away? I'm just \u2013 it sounds like you've got a little more conviction in the China market right now.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think based on what we're seeing in order patterns, based on our customer inputs, based on what we started seeing the last couple of months, as I've said earlier, I think China will grow low single digit, from zero to 2%, 3%. And that's where I see it right now. And if someone asked me the question a couple of calls back about in February, what would make me feel better relative to your forecast, I think that's \u2013 China, Asia Pacific is the number two thing I would say, after one, two and three were our Automation Solutions orders. But China order pace and sales pace will be the number two thing in that case.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, and low single digits seems like a pretty reasonable hurdle. So thank you much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's better than shrinking.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Exactly. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, John.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Deane Dray from RBC. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Could we go back to your free cash flow targets for 2017? It looks like you've got a $500 million CapEx plan that's embedded in that. That looks like it's up 12% year-over-year, but I'm not sure that...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, it's not. We did $523 million last year, John \u2013 or sorry \u2013 Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, no, no. I meant for looking for 2016, I'm not sure that's a comparable number. It looks like a $447 million number.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$447 million is the new Emerson. We'll be flat basically on a comparable basis there. We have an obligation. We still own the \u2013 accounting, we had the disc ops, but we still own the businesses, so I'm actually still getting cash and I'm having to spend money. Contrary to what the county told me, I still own these businesses and I've still got the deed of control. Yes, there's been discontinued operations. I will get the cash and we have some capital spending obligations, so it's going to be around $500 million next year with that, from that perspective. Okay?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Where's that money being spent? If you had just kind of big buckets, how would you describe that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Incrementally the biggest pockets is we're freeing up capital to go into the Commercial Residential Solutions business, relative to the whole efficiency thing that I was talking about earlier. So we basically have several new facilities being built in best-cost locations. We're re-laying out some facilities, we're going to consolidate some facilities. So of that core business, $50 million is going to go to the discontinued operations business around that number, and then we'll have $450 million going to the Emerson remaining businesses, and a big chunk of that will be going into that work around \u2013 that Jim Lindemann and Bob Sharp are doing relative to the Commercial Residential organization.","We also have some capacity going in for our compressor business in some best-cost locations. And then the other big chunk, there's nothing really big in Automation Solutions from the standpoint of it's just restructuring. And when you do restructuring and you do plant moves and stuff like that, you have to spend capital. So that's where the big chunks are, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So you did not get the memo that everyone got, that everyone's supposed to be cutting CapEx next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We've cut it pretty hard the last 18 months, and we actually generate pretty good cash flow too, Deane. You didn't get that memo?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, it's fabulous cash flow. I just think it's impressive that you're adding capacity in this environment and that's a pretty bullish sign.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, the key issue, Deane, and I think you and I have talked about this, if we do not spend some money, you will not get productivity. And that's one of the signs it's a nasty loop right now, people in the industry. If you do not spend, you will not drive productivity. And that's where we're spending money, and we are growing some of our businesses and so they need capacity.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Exactly. Thank you.","David N.

Are you rooting for the Indians or are you rooting for the Cubs?","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My friend, Mr. Rossman, I know, has got a vested interest in this, so...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, that's why I didn't get any of the questions, because he was working the line score again.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I know he is. He's emailing Francona as we speak, I'm sure, so...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","He's got the new lineup for him.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Rich, it's all about dedication. I had a ticket for tonight's game, let me just tell you that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh, my God. Rich, you got any Kleenex because I'm out of Kleenex this year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Two quick ones. On Commercial & Residential Solutions, so a number of...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All right. You get the ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. You win the prize.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A number of building product companies have kind of squishy numbers, outlooks for particularly as it relates to more of the residential side of things here going into year-end. Just curious, I mean the order growth was decent in September on a trailing three-quarter basis. It seems like maybe you saw something different, but just curious underlying, particularly in North American market, how you characterize the state of the market right now in terms of order momentum and what you're seeing as you're going into year-end right now.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It really breaks down in different segments. But clearly inventories within what I'd call our sort of air conditioning, both the commercial and the residential channel, is pretty tight right now; they had late heat. And so that channel has gotten pretty tight, so some work going on there, so I would expect us to have a good first fiscal quarter there as they get the channel to where they need it, Rich.","The other thing that's going on right now is there's a lot of changes relative to the efficiencies, to the refrigerants, and new products coming out from our customer base, so there's a lot of work being done on that which is driving some incremental growth for us. We're seeing that both in efficiency stuff going on in China, we see that across Asia and we're seeing that in Europe. So when any time you start seeing a lot of changes and some of the new targets coming out relative to the HSEs and the efficiencies, we get a benefit from that a little bit earlier than most people because they have to build up ahead of time. So we've see a decent pattern of growth. And then our housing business has held up reasonably well, but it's definitely stalled where it was. The growth rate has definitely stalled.","And then a couple of our businesses within the Commercial Residential Solutions business actually get benefit from what I would call environmental problems like flooding and bad weather and stuff like that, and there's been some across North America here the last couple of months. And so things have gone our way there for a change. And so I think Bob and his team have got a great cost structure right now with all the restructuring, so they're driving very good margins. They've got a couple \u2013 the environmental things, the trend is going their way right now, so hopefully they make hay for this quarter because who knows what's going to happen next quarter there. So that's where we are right now.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And does the global summit a few weeks ago with the changes, the Montreal Protocol, I mean, does that have any tangible benefit the next couple of years or is that more out toward the beginning of next decade?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","In Europe and U.S., and we reviewed that with the board today, in fact, U.S. and Europe is definitely the next two years we'll start seeing some benefit there. The good thing about it is they now come down on what they would \u2013 they've agreed to certain standards and certain targets. So now our customer base, including us, can work a solution to get there. And so that's a good sign. That will help us, and we've been, as you know, one of the reasons we made the Helix investment the last couple of years up there in Dayton is because we know we're going to have to help drive some of these solutions, and that will help us probably late 2017 but more 2018 and 2019.","The Asia ones, if you look at the standards, they're still out another 10 years. So our gut right there, they'll stay with old technologies. It will just drive the older technologies, not the newer technologies. But that definitely helps us because it's getting them set into the right direction for us.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on valves and controls with the portfolio there, from an intelligence standpoint, you kind of talked a little bit about this earlier in the call. You did a pervasive sensing acquisition I think early or late September, early October, and I know that's an area of focus for you. How quickly can you increase the intelligence in the valves and controls portfolio?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think it will take us two to three years to really have an impact. But there's a lot of things around their actuation stuff. There's a lot of things around some of their safety in the Crosby area. There are areas that we can bring in some technology which we have, we can port over to them, so it will take us \u2013 there's a lot of things, you have standards you have to meet and pass, so it's going to take two or three years. But within this planning cycle, we'll start getting some benefit from that.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. Have fun.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Rich.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can you list another 10 factors that you're going to watch for next year's trend line order rate?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","10 factors? I don't have that many...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just giving Rob a little bit of a...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I know you're kidding. You can get me in trouble with the SEC if I give you 10 factors.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the free cash flow, so I guess if CapEx is not adjusting out the disc ops, how much of the free cash flow is coming from the disc ops? And then I assume that basically whatever cash you're going to lose there for the year forward would be replaced by the kind of solid cash accretion you're getting from Pentair, which I think is around $100 million to start for this year. Is that kind of the right equation?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I think to cut it through simple, Frank and I, because first of all we don't own Pentair valves and controls, as you well know.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we're going to be slightly north, when you push and shove everything back and forth, slightly north of $2.5 billion with Pentair. I think we can hold capital $500 million with Pentair-type stuff in there, with pluses and minuses across the whole company. So there's not much cash flow coming from the companies we're selling in the stub period, but we do have capital spending obligations.","So I think overall I feel good that we will meet or slightly exceed the $2.5 billion operating cash flow. I have a lot of control over capital, as you can imagine, and so the $2 billion next year is a number that we've got locked in stone. And I told the board we're going to be monitoring that on a monthly basis and we'll be keeping the board informed and therefore we'll keep you guys informed, because that's a very important number to us. We want to make the 62% dividend to free cash flow ratio the worse that we see in my tenure, and then we'll start driving that back down in 2019.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on Process, how much of that do you think is \u2013 you mentioned North America MRO, et cetera. How much of that do you think is kind of pulled along with the chain of U.S. land rig count? I don't know how you \u2013 maybe you don't classify it that way. But obviously that's an area that people are a lot more optimistic on for next year. How much of a variable is that in the trend in the Automation \u2013 I didn't say Process Automation \u2013 the Industrial Automation business.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Automation Solutions.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Automation Solutions, sorry.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve, I think that for me the way our business mix up because we're not really down-well stuff. We have some stuff, but that's not going to drive our sales. What you really want to watch for us is the stability around the pricing of oil and the pricing of gas and within this range in the $45 to $55 range for oil and the equivalent level to gas. That number is very, very important to my customer base. Rig count is more down the road for us, and that means the overall health of the industry, that will help us, too.","But in the near term, if I'm thinking 2017, stability in the price of oil and gas is pretty important relative to what I see our end customers will spend. And when they do their capital allocations, Steve, from based on, okay, I have to spend this much money for share repurchase, this much for dividend, this much for capital. How much do I have left over? That's how they're going to be calculating it. And I think that those are the numbers I'm watching right now and that stability's critical to me.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Congrats on the good execution and the cash. And obviously a pretty choppy and volatile year, so kudos to you guys for the execution there.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Steve. All the best to you.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yep.","Operator","Our next questioner today is Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities. Please go ahead.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for waiting.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Eli. I was just thinking about cutting you off, so you're lucky.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","I knew I wouldn't get my line in if you set up an Indian summer with the 80 degrees.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","If it wasn't that you're a St. Louis boy, I probably would have cut you off. But go Cards. Oh, we're not in the World Series, are we? Oh, shoot. Go ahead, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Two quick questions. One, with all the changes below the line, is there any structural change in what the tax rate is going to look like for the company as we go through all the shenanigans?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. If I was a good guy I'd put 31% down next year.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, but the structural doesn't change. Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Eli, I'm going to give you \u2013 I'm going be honest with you, right? We will have some benefits as we go forward here in probably the first six months, or maybe the first quarter, on some things that we're going to get benefits for. So it might drive the tax rate down as real cash coming back for us. But the underlying tax rate, 31% is a good number.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, it was really the structural I'm looking at.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I know that.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And with all the difficulties in the first half in Process \u2013 well, excuse me \u2013 Automation Solutions...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All right, Eli.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah, okay. Real question. How tough will holding profitability in that sector to fourth quarter levels, given the declines that we're looking at? I mean it's going to be a tale of two halves. First half's tough and hopefully you get bailed out in the second half. How tough is holding the profitability in the first half in Automation Solutions as we go through it?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Ain't going to happen. It's going to come down the first half. Restructuring, we've got more restructuring. Mike Train got a lot more restructuring done in the last three or four months in Automation Solutions. As you notice, our restructuring number went up. But his volume's going to be down 10% in the first quarter. And Mike's a good business leader, but he ain't that \u2013 he can't work miracles. So it's going to come down. And then we should start seeing that come back up as we move into the second quarter.","So we're all hands on deck in this first quarter right now because Automation Solutions has got a very difficult \u2013 the order pattern's been weak for a while and we know the mix is not going to be good. So Bob's businesses are trying hard as possible, but that Automation Solutions going to be a tough number. So I think that's going to be the big issue for us. We're going to be definitely very weak in the first quarter in profitability, and we'll start coming back, because the restructuring's getting done. And we just \u2013 the volume's dropping so hard in this first quarter.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","But you should still be a double-digit-teen kind of number, I suspect.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Good.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're talking about margins, Frank.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, yeah.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","The operating profitability, yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, it's not \u2013 yes. It's still going to be \u2013 it'll still be better than most people would make in Automation Solutions but it's not an Emerson standard, you know.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And they've got the restructuring done so the savings are flowing through. But it's going to be definitely the second half because of the way the sales will flow for that business, anyway.","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You take care. All the best, Eli. We'll see you around town, okay, friend?","Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Absolutely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And with that, we're going to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody. Appreciate the \u2013 asked you a couple of jokes here and there. And sorry if I picked on you too much, Rossman, but you've been so enamored with those Cleveland Indians, I haven't gotten a lot of Q&A out of you lately. So thank you, everybody.

Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, May 1, 2018.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2018 results. The accompanying slide presentation is available on our website.","I'll start on slide 3 with the second quarter summary. Sales in the second quarter of $4.2 billion increased 19% with underlying sales up 8% and strong growth across both of our business platforms. Demand conditions remained favorable and were consistent with our first quarter. The U.S. and China led growth and trends were favorable across all world areas.","Underlying orders have trended in the 5% to 10% range that we expect to continue through the year. Profitability continues to be strong. In the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, EBIT margin was up 170 basis points on solid incremental margins.","Price cost remain neutral in the quarter. GAAP EPS increased 31% to $0.76. We continue to buy back shares. In Q2, we repurchased 3.6 million shares. And in the first half we've repurchased over 11.4 million shares and returned almost $1.4 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Q2 wraps up a strong first half for Emerson. And overall, the quarter was stronger operationally than we had anticipated a few months ago.","Turning to slide 4. Second quarter gross margin was up 40 basis points, excluding Valves & Controls and EBIT margin was up 170 basis points.","A quick note on our first half profitability. In the first half, gross margin excluding Valves & Controls was up 100 basis points and EBIT margin was up 130 basis points driven by operating leverage, the benefits from prior-period restructuring actions and execution around normal ongoing cost reduction efforts. Price cost in the first half was approximately flat and we continue to expect a neutral price cost impact in the full year.","Turning now to slide 5. From a geographic perspective, the momentum we've seen over the past few quarters continued in the second quarter with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Mature markets were up high-single digits led by North America. Europe was flat in Q2 and in the first half, but order trends here are favorable and we expect solid growth here in the second half.","Emerging markets were up high-single digits in the second quarter led by China, which continued to deliver robust growth across both business platforms. In the first half, total Emerson underlying sales were up 8%.","Turning to slide 6. Total segment margins excluding Valves & Controls was up 130 basis points in Q2. And in the first half, the segment margin was up 100 basis points again excluding Valves & Controls. The acceleration of growth across our businesses has resulted in modestly higher working capital levels and we expect strong free cash flow conversion in the second half.","Turning to slide 7. Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 10% in the quarter and 10% in the first half. Favorable trends continued with strong demand across process, hybrid and discrete end-markets led by North America and China. Strength in oil and gas was driven by MRO, small and midsized projects and turnaround activity. Demand in chemicals markets were supported by petrochemical and specialty chem upgrade and optimization projects.","Our global power business whose markets have seen a steep decline grew net sales and orders in the first half, reflecting strong participation in plant retrofit and Greenfield investment activity.","Automation Solutions segment margin was up 20 basis points and was up 240 basis points, excluding Valves & Controls. Improvement was driven by operational leverage and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions.","Our Final Control team continues to hit key milestones and the Valves & Controls business is integrating very quickly into the broader Final Control business. With Valves & Controls we are on track with synergy plans and we are seeing the margin improvement read through.","Turning now to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Underlying sales grew 4% in the quarter and 4% in the first half. In China and in broader Asia, strong demand continued in air-conditioning and refrigeration markets. Growth in North America reflected strong demand for professional tools, while air-conditioning demand slowed due to cooler weather and timing of channel inventory stocking. However, the underlying economics for air-conditioning markets remains positive and we expect solid growth in the second half.","Margin decreased 10 basis points as material inflation and mix was partially offset by operational leverage, higher price realization and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions, and aided by the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business which was sold on October of 2017.","Let's turn now to slide 9, which outlines our updated full-year guidance. Please note that this framework does not include the impact of the recently announced Tools & Test acquisition. We will provide and update the guidance after the transaction close which is expected in the fiscal fourth quarter.","We expect total Emerson underlying sales to grow 7% at the high end of the previous guidance range with Automation Solutions up 8% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 5%.","The GAAP EPS range is increased $0.05 at the midpoint to a new range of $3.10 to $3.20 or growth of 22% to 26% compared with the prior year. This guidance assumes a neutral price cost impact as we continue to offset material inflation with price realization and cost reduction efforts. The expected effective tax rate for 2018 is 25% to 27%.","And now, please turn with me to slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Tim. I appreciate it. And, first of all, before I talk about the slide, I want to welcome everybody. And I want to thank everybody across Emerson for a tremendous quarter, the Emerson people around the world, including our new acquisitions from the Valves & Controls and the Paradigm and the Cooper-Atkins, I want to thank all those people as they've integrated very quickly and understand the core principles of Emerson. We had a very strong quarter and a very strong first half of our fiscal year.","I also want to let you know that with me today I have a brand new Stan Musial autograph bat from a longtime friend and also a shareholder who figured I needed a new baseball bat given that Tim's been taking the brunt of the other baseball bats for a while and he keeps breaking them. But I do have a new Stan Musial bat with my rally monkey holding on to the handle for good luck.","Now, back to the chart on Tools & Test, I wasn't here for this acquisition, but you have to understand these are two unique brands Greenlee tool and Klauke that we've wanted to acquire for many, many, many years.","As you all know, I ran Ridge Tool at one time and we used to talk to the folks at Textron about these two acquisitions. These are unbelievable unique brands, very powerful brands. And like the Valves & Controls acquisition, we see unique capability of integration, unique capability of taking these brands and along with our core brands in this area here and making it much stronger and creating significant value for our shareholders.","Yeah, some people might say it was an expensive acquisition, but there's not many assets like this out there. You can count on one hand, the brand recognition of assets in this space, be it Ridge Tool, be it Milwaukee, be it Greenlee, be it Klauke, be it \u2013 you can go work a couple more but there're not many brands like it. And that's why we're so unique about it.","And I'm really glad that the CEO of Textron made a decision to really focus on other businesses like we did when we made our decision a couple of years ago. But very strong opportunities and growth and we really look at the leverage opportunities between some very powerful brands and creating a strong business for our customers, but also for our shareholders.","And I was not able to join the phone call because I've been on the road. I was around the road \u2013 around the world for 13 days, seeing what's going on in the world of Emerson and it is going well. And I'll talk a little bit about that in a second.","But first of all, I want to again say strong execution by both platforms. The emerging markets is emerging to \u2013 as we talked about it in February, I think they take a stronger role in growth in the second half of this year and going into 2019 and 2020. As I see it unfold right now I like what I see relative to some of the emerging markets. The only emerging market that we have not seen really kick into growth at this point in time is Latin America. It's been sporadic one quarter up, one quarter down.","But I think that will kick in. But the world of Asia, the world of Middle East, Africa, the world of Eastern Europe all kicked in very strongly, and I see good strong growth opportunities for the next several years.","As I went out and talked to customers as I was in Germany and Italy, the Middle East, Singapore, and then also the Philippines, the project business is building. As we've been talking about the small, medium-sized projects are the first one on the shoot and they continue to build along those lines, which is very, very good. And I'm really glad to see that. But now I'm starting to hear about larger projects, which are being formed and starting to be bid on, which will really solidify our growth opportunities as we move into 2019 and 2020.","But the shape of the recovery is good with the U.S. clearly leading this right now. But from my perspective, we're going to see the emerging markets come in and drive faster growth versus the mature markets as we get into 2019 and 2020.","Overall, both businesses are executing around the profitability, around the investments. I feel very good about the growth rates. We're separating ourselves from the pack in many, many markets like China, like the Middle East and a couple other key markets like India around the world. And I like what's happening at this point in time.","Cash flow is still on track to deliver around $2.9 billion for the year. Clearly, right now our growth rate is running a tad higher than we said originally. Therefore, we have a little bit of working capital primarily around receivables as the growth has kicked in, but from my perspective nothing of a concern yet.","As I look at the total year, I mean \u2013 and Tim had mentioned already in the slide, we see our growth rate around the 7% plus or minus a little bit there. We like where we are at this point in time. As I look at the Automation Solutions business, it looks like it has some upside. Commercial Res really depends on getting a stronger weather pattern, which we're starting to get right now relative to some mort and some better weather from construction. But overall, we're shaping up to have 7%, good solid 7%-plus type of underlying sales growth for the year with a good solid earnings per share in this $3.10 to $3.20 range at this point in time, excluding any of the impact of the acquisitions.","For the third quarter, as we said, we see a very good underlying growth rates, somewhere in the 7% to 7.5% range. We're looking at earnings per share. And I'm telling you \u2013 I'm giving you the range but as you guys try to map out the year as we raise the guidance for the year, we see right now $0.85 plus or minus a couple of pennies, along with that 7% to 7.5% range of underlying growth.","Another good progression, another good quarter. And, clearly, we're obviously seeing a pretty good fourth quarter coming at. We'll see what happens as the cycle continues in the Automation Solutions. But that's what we see at this point in time.","But I'll open the floor up for questions. Overall, again, I feel I want to thank everybody for the strong execution around the world and the both platforms and the integration of the businesses we made acquisition-wise, a very good job. And we're looking forward to another solid quarter as we move into this third quarter and our fiscal year 2018.","So with that, I'll open the floor up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and answer session. Your first question will come from Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good day, everyone. Hello, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Jeff. Good to hear from you. And hopefully, you're having a good weather. It's beautiful here in the Midwest.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sun has finally come out. I think spring has finally arrived here on May 1, a month later.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","God, it's been a long cold wet spring here, or I guess you can't call it spring, I guess a pre-spring.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, I ask this question almost kind of tongue in cheek but there's a lot of people out there that are kind of saying the cycle is over and this is as good as things get.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You must have listened to catcall. You must have listened to Caterpillar phone call.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. No, catcalls on this call right?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No catcalls, this call.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So how do you feel about the longevity of the activity that's unfolding in front of you? And is there any particular thing that you are concerned about from a macro standpoint?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, I don't think the cycle is any different than I've been talking about over the last 6 to 12 months. I think that 2018 is going to be a good year for us. I think 2019 for the automation space could be slightly better depending where we finish, Jeff. Because you know, I've always talked about, if we have a stronger 2018, that will take a little bit away from 2019, but I still see a very good 2019 based on the project business at this point in time.","I'm always worried about any type of trade wars. I'm always worried about any type of confrontation in the Middle East or something like that. But right now, the customer base has the money. The pricing is staying up relative to the commodities and they need to invest.","So I feel good about it. And we have a lot of great new technology coming out. The timing and the integration of Valves & Controls and that support of that organization as they've come in and leverage across what we're seeing across Emerson right now has been very, very positive for us. So I'm very optimistic. I've said that I thought that Automation Solutions could have a stronger growth year in 2019 than 2018. I still believe that. The cycle has not peaked.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Interesting. Thanks. And then just on V&C. Obviously, you gave us the margin progression ex-V&C and we've got the acquisitive effect on sales. But there is a little bit of other M&A going through Automation, now like Paradigm and the like. Could you just put a little bit of finer point on the underlying V&C margin execution in the quarter, kind of where it's at and where it's at at this point?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll let Tim answer that. I'll let Tim answer it because he thought this would come up and he's got the numbers here. He talked to Ram up in \u2013 but it's progressing like we thought it would. The orders are extremely strong. I just saw some orders from Europe and they're doing well. But Tim, why don't you tell him where they are progressing?","Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","So the history since we closed on the business last April, it's been in the sort of 4% to 5% range and that excludes restructuring and the amortization. And so what we saw through this first quarter was kind of still in that range and we expected Q2 to be up and start to track toward the double-digit margins in Q4. And we did see that. So it was up. It's high-single digits in Q2. We expect high single digits Q3, and then we should be into those double digits Q4.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's getting harder and harder for us to be able to manage it. I mean well, we're going to try to give you an indication where it's going. It's definitely moving that way, but the integration is going and it's getting tougher and tougher. But it's progressing. Well, I mean, if you look at the overall profitability of the Automation business, if we were having problems with V&C, it's big enough to move it. The Paradigm is not big enough to move it. But right now I like, from a working capital standpoint, a sales standpoint and the profitability standpoint, we're making great progress. We got to visit a lot of sites around the world. Frank was with me. And so we got to spend some time with them. So Jeff, I think we're in the slot there right now and the business has picked back up. So our timing is pretty good in this one.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. Very solid, appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All the best to you, Jeff. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Take care.","Operator","The next question will be from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Scott. Where are you hanging out today, New York or somewhere? Where are you going?","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","New York. It's where I hang my hat. But, no comment. Anyways, Dave, you said you were...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There is nothing wrong with New York. I'm from New York and Frank's from New York.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Why don't you pay our taxes?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I don't. I can't change \u2013 I pay my fair share.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Aren't you one of those states that pay half the taxes and collect more than you pay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's really tough when you cross the 50% pay level. I know that, it's a hard one for all of us to handle. I'm not quite there. You might want to move to a lower tax state.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Well, I would take 50% of what you make Dave, but 50% of what I make may not do much for you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What is this? Get live.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","All right. I'll focus on work here for a sec.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Let's focus on this. Okay.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","You said you were just in the Mideast and your orders were, or your sales actually were pretty darn strong. And have we officially seen a turn? Do they have any money over there for projects?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. They have turned. And it's been turning now for three or four months. And I was little bit more cautious late last year it's turned. The money is coming. You got money in Saudi, you've got money in Kuwait. We're seeing money coming out of Africa now, even the North Africa. They're having to put money back in. For them to get the revenue, they have to invest and get the oil and the gas out. We're seeing Qatar starting to put some money back in.","So the answer is, yes, and our KOB3 and then KOB2 business right now is very good. So they're putting the money back into repairing and upgrading and trying to get little bit more out from productivity. And the bigger projects are coming, and the bidding, then that will again be coming down the road, but very active right now. And I think that we have a good couple of years here, I think, at this point in time.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay. And, Dave, one of the things that got us more positive on your story, it was just the utility market and Ovation. You'd made some positive comments about utility, but give us a sense, I mean it feels like that market's been dead for many, many years. Is there some real legs behind an upgrade cycle, automation side and the utility side globally?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So when you break it down globally, if you look at the emerging markets, there's a lot of new capacity and upgrades going on and so we're seeing that. But in the mature markets, primarily North America, what we're seeing is enhancement investments into the current capacity.","There's not a lot of new capacity going into the U.S. right now, but they're investing in trying to make their facilities more productive. And given our installed base in North America of all the power plants, we have a very good inside run there. And then also, with our new embedded PLC, which we're going after, that's a very active products \u2013 project for us inside the utility marketplace too.","So right now, we're seeing positive orders, as we did last year in North America and on a global basis. We have continued to invest in this space. We have continued to make the necessary new product investments. And I think that a lot of our competitors have been backing off. And I think they're giving us an opportunity here that \u2013 and you know me, Scott. You've known me for a long time. I seize opportunities.","And we're \u2013 I was up in Pittsburgh last week and spent a whole day with them. And we're looking at how we continue to widen the gap of our penetration around the world. And I think that \u2013 I feel good about the next couple of years in our power industry. And it's a very \u2013 it drives a lot of other core products at the same. So every \u2013 I mean, from a transmitters to control valve and instrumentation, it really drives other good businesses for us. So I'm more optimistic than you are.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Good. Good luck, Dave. I'll pass it on.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, Dave. How are you?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","It's good to hear your conviction to the cycle. That's great. Hopefully, you offset the negativity.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I've been around a while and I've been through three cycles. This cycle has not ended. Period.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Right, I get a brand new baseball bat.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Now, I'm not trying to talk to you on numbers or anything. I'd just say, it's not ended.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Dave, on the cash flow side, so you obviously addressed it in your comments, but I want to maybe hone in there a little bit on your conviction around hitting that $1.5 billion plus, I guess, it's $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion in the second half. You took the guidance on cash flow down just a little bit, a tick. It's growth related. You got the working capital moves. You guys are great on cash normally. I guess, any risks that we should be aware of in you making that number?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I mean, not at all. I think that the conversion rate will move around based on the growth of earnings coming up and what we're seeing. If we're going to have, as we took the growth rate up a tad for the whole corporation, as I've talked and I openly talk about it, once we start crossing around at 6.8%-plus range, it's a tougher line for us to continue to take \u2013 keep that working capital totally, totally in check.","So from my perspective, we can deliver the hard cash and yet the commercial rate is going to be a little lower, because the earnings, it's just the way the cycle is going to be and the timing of say, the September sales. So I don't have a \u2013 I'm not less convicted \u2013 I feel good about the cash flow.","If I grow faster \u2013 let's say, we grew 7.5% for the whole year that will \u2013 puts a lot more pressure on us. But I'll take the growth in the sales, I'll take the growth in earnings and we'll get the cash off \u2013 we'll get the working capital off the balance sheet when things slow down a little bit.","So it's \u2013 we're in that cusp right now Steve, of these growth rates where we actually have to put some money on the balance sheet versus when we take it off. So that's \u2013 we're in that fine line right now, but I wouldn't worry about our cash flow. I mean, the cash is good. It's just \u2013 we're growing a little faster, which is good.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Right, a good problem to have.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll give you a choice, more cash or less growth. What do you want? Give me a choice.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Dave I want both. All right? Come one, you know that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Do you really want to run a business? I agree, because I want both too. But I also have to be realistic.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah. Well, just you're hitting it out of the park right? So pricing versus inflation...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","My new bat.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","...you've been worried about this? Pricing versus inflation, you've been worried about that. Are you less worried...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't worry about them.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","...these days or are you going to be green?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that right now we're under control. We're under control. I would say right now we're probably flat. I mean, as we said all year long, we're flat. I always felt that it'd be slightly plus or minus a couple of million dollars in this, we're flat.","The whole issue around the tariffs, around the disruption, around the steel pricing, the prices ran up, they've drifted back down. We're all out there working. It's part of the reason we're probably moving products around the world a little bit right now trying to get position for this. I worry about it more in 2019, Steve than I do now. Because I think we have to make sure we understand where things are trending and then we're going to have to get the pricing action in place.","In certain cases, we're putting double prices in this year. We're having to tweak because of material costs. But I think we've been waiting for this upturn in inflation for about four years, after having five years of negative. And so now we're moving pretty quickly. So I think we got this under control. I mean, we're going to be plus or minus a couple of million dollars. I'm not too worried about it. But there's a wildcard out there. And all of a sudden tariffs come in and we start seeing kind of knock-on effect on tariffs. That could cause problems for all of us in the industrial world. But right now, it's under control, but it's a wildcard that I worried about, to be honest.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's my two questions. I'll hand it on.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All the best to you, Steve. You take care my friend.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","You too. Yeah, you too.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I've got my rally monkey here, so don't be mean Tusa.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not going to be mean. I'm not. I'm not that kind of guy just calling as I see it, Dave. I always just try and call it as I see it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I'm thinking about getting a new dog to just keeping you at bay.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So just to be clear on that power commentary, you talked about you're taking market share. I mean the big installed base of market share...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I didn't say taking market share. I said, I think people have walked away from the marketplace. I didn't say \u2013 but I think we're doing pretty well, yeah.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Well, obviously, if they're walking away from the marketplace and you guys are winning business, that means you're taking share. And it's \u2013 I mean, my understanding that most of the controls are kind of like OEM related. I mean this is not something that Rockwell necessarily has a huge presence in especially in the U.S. So like I would assume that the share gains are coming from some of the legacy OEM controllers here in North America, at least that's what we've seen in the channel from meeting with your guys at power gen. Is that the correct assumption?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, that is correct assumption. But the other thing out there the aisle into automation and power plants are out there and so we're going after that. And so we have parts of a power plant where it's been a PLC-type structure and a skid. We now have our OCC 100, which we're able to embed and hook up to our control system.","We're bringing a lot more cyber security into play here. So there's a lot places that the power companies are investing. And we've been positioning ourselves from just being a control system to have a much broader product offering. So therefore, we can serve these power plants.","And we're actually investing in our organization to go out to power plants where a lot of companies are backing away from that. And on a global basis, you're still seeing power \u2013 original power going in. You're seeing power plants. You're going to see enormous amount of power plants going in, in Asia over the next five to 10 years. So right now, in North America, we're winning in a good way.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. It's good to be the control systems guy in that scenario. On climate, what's going on in the U.S.? I mean, all these guys put up pretty good numbers all the OEMs. I think they talked down a bit the second quarter given weather comps. How are you kind of explaining the channel dynamics there? Is this kind of \u2013 Goodman is the only one we really haven't seen this quarter. Is that kind of a customer-specific timing dynamic reflected in your numbers?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's more of a timing. And when them ramping up the new production on the A\/C unit system and versus the heating. It was a very cold wet Spring early cycle. And so we didn't have an early ramp up like we had a little bit more last year. So I mean it's more of a timing issue for us.","As you know, we're not always in sync with the OEMs, the manufacturers here. So right now, the function for us is we need some good production and we need some good building going on in the housing markets or our residential piece will be kind of low-single digits this year.","But I'm not too worried about it right now. I think that a lot of it is \u2013 will keep coming. If I get into May and we get down to EPG and I'm starting to see that things are still weak on it, then we're going to have a tough year in North America.","Fortunately, our European business, fortunately our Asia business is still going well. Fortunately our other \u2013 the other markets, the refrigeration market, the client \u2013 those markets are going well. But the one market that has been weak over the last couple of months has been our North America A\/C. And so hopefully we'll see a little heat come in here and a little dry weather and we'll see some orders pop in. But that's what we see right now. I'm not too concerned about it. We've had this before Steve. You know that.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Okay. Take care. See you at EPG, I guess.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you at EPG. Yeah, thank you very much, Steve.","Operator","The next question will be from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Two questions. One just in terms of the cycle, particularly on process, could you just kind of walk through kind of what you thought the trough was? Just give us a little bit of a history lesson. And how long this cycle could really go here, just given what we're seeing in underlying oil prices and demand? I mean is it fair to say that we could see this go for several years beyond what may be more early mid-cycle for an underlying economy?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So it peaked globally around 2014. It troughed in mid\/early 2017. It was \u2013 as you all know, we had a very good run. It went on for several, several years. We had very high levels and then it dropped pretty hard as people cut way back.","What's different in the cycle is because I think people are going to be very, very cautious about committing new capital for new production from the oil and gas and areas like that. But they're going to invest in the core business they already have if they already have some wells out there how to expand that without going out and spending for the big, big finds and things like that.","And what I see right now is people are being much more cautious and they're going to try and incrementalize this a little bit, adding a little bit of a time to the point that one of them may break and say okay, I've got to put more money into it. But it's \u2013 I mean, that's why I think that we can have a good solid two years here with 2019 being pretty good. But right now, my visibility in the cycle is solid at least three to four years. And from the perspective I think there's been some underinvestment and the question is, does the demand stay there in the world area for the energy? And does the price of energy stay at a good price like it is right now?","So it's hard to go beyond three years, Rob. But I see two solid years and I see a good third year. And that's about as far as I can see at this point in time. The key thing for me is going back to the large projects are starting to form. So as I see these large projects starting to build out around the world that gives me a little bit more indication where the cycle is going to go to.","So we'll know more about this as they get out towards the end of the calendar year this year as I look at the project business we have going out and I see bigger and bigger projects coming at us. But right now, I like what I see, and it's shaping up. It's good for us because the small and medium ones are easier to execute on and they're typically better profitability.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","On that note, with the integration of Valves & Controls, could you just talk about how the progress has been particularly on two specific things? One is the trade working capital and the intended cash and what the trajectory is there? And then further the potential revenue synergies from getting back into Kingdom and some others in the world where perhaps you were under-penetrated or under-indexed when it was in Pentair's hands? And what the opportunity and the trajectory could be there as kind of a sweetener to the integration?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The working capital is happening. I mean, on the Final Control business, and its Ram and his team, right now, they're doing extremely well with this integration. I would say a couple of places we've had in the Automation where we've had tougher working capital challenges, but Ram's team is doing very good job of getting this out and cleaning it up. And we feel good about that.","The integration is going well. We're very deep in the process right now of exiting a business we had in Europe, which we knew we're always going to exit. It's going to cost us some money. We're in the process of getting that done. Hopefully, we'll get it done before this fiscal year and maybe before the end of this quarter.","Relative to the project work and relative to the integration of sales that is actually going much faster than we anticipated. And as we've said in February, I think that's been one of the pleasant surprises of the organizations of the Pentair Valves & Controls business and then our Automation business coming together. And we're getting acceptance and we're hiring people to start working jointly together.","So I thought that maybe we would have a little bit more of a pause this year on growth and I think we're going to have a better growth mode out of this \u2013 the Final Control business seriously than I thought. And I think a lot of that's going to be tied around the co-selling and the synergies.","Relative to the Kingdom and Aramco, we've been \u2013 the Aramco to their credit has been working extremely hard to get \u2013 they have to go visit all the facilities and they have to sign off on all the facilities. As I look at the progress because I'm going to try to meet with the CEO of Aramco next week. They pretty much have visited every facility now. And we're now getting down to anything they've asked us to clean up and do like that. So we're starting to get bids.","So I think we're going to see more of an impact on that in 2019, which again is a little bit faster because Aramco historically is pretty slow at getting back out. So net-net, great integration on the costs, working capital, but pleasantly positively surprised on underlying growth rate in orders, which is great to see from the perspective of Ram and his whole team around the world. I'm very pleased with that.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for the answer. See you at EPG.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Julian. How are you doing?","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very good. Thank you. Maybe just a first question on Europe. Yeah, that have been sluggish for you and many others in terms of fixed asset investment for a while. The soft data there looked a lot better for 12 months. Now that's started to slow in your own numbers in terms of orders in Automation for example are pretty sluggish still. So I just wondered, do you still believe there will be a fixed asset investment recovery in Europe, or are you're still going to think maybe that is pushed out.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I feel very strongly. Julian, I feel very strong that we will deliver 5% growth in Europe this year, underlying sales growth this year. I see the projects. I see the winning going on. It took a while. I think that on the commercial res sides, we've been doing pretty well there and they're doing well. They're pretty well in line for that. The Automation \u2013 and we were there and Frank was with me and we were talking about this. We had a European review.","We see the projects. And so I firmly believe that the orders are coming and we're going to see this, around a 5% underlying growth rate in Europe. It just, it took them longer for it to gear back up. They had some very strong first half 2017 Eastern Europe projects that we won and did well on and it's just taking longer for us to get geared back up in the Western Europe part.","I agree that the overall economy, the numbers are slowing down a little bit. But I don't think it's going to impact what we see going for both 2018 and 2019. I think the investments are starting to happen. The money is starting to flow. And so I think the industrial world in particular has struggled this quarter in Europe, in Western Europe, but I think it's going to start \u2013 the investments are going to start flowing back out, and I feel good about the orders and sales at this point in time. I could eat my words on this, but that's, after meeting with this team and going through a battle with them for about a day and a half, I feel good about it.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Understood. And then my follow-up would just be around the, I guess the sort of orders trajectory within Automation. I mean, is most of the strength you're seeing in that March figure for example, that's still MRO related, I guess. When you're trying to think about the larger projects, what's your latest view on when you think those might start to hit the orders rate rather than just being part of conversations and quotations activity?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We'll start seeing some happen this quarter. We'll start having some bookings coming in on some good sized projects, which will create a lumpiness in our order pattern. The reason our order pattern has been pretty stable for the Automation business for the last several months is because we're still booking the small\/medium-sized projects which are good, but we're starting to book our bid and win and also lose larger projects which I think we'll start seeing them being booked in the third quarter, some in the fourth quarter. Again, most of that is not going to help us this year, but it's going to help us build the 2019 which builds a stronger 2019, which I feel will be there.","The other thing I see in 2019 is I see the emerging markets playing a key role for us and that's why I feel good about 2019 in the Automation business. But you're going to start seeing some \u2013 I wouldn't be surprised if you don't seeing some spikes in some orders and some project wins here in this quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Julian.","Operator","The next question will be from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks. Good quarter.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Gautam. Thank you very much. Boy, two quarters in a row I get to talk to you.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. So in fiscal 2019, I know you're not guiding fiscal 2019, but.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Definitely not guiding fiscal 2019.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. But just to be clear.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm still kind of one of these crazy CEOs that will talk about even more than two quarters or two months.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","No, that's right. I appreciate that actually. 2019, obviously you're going to have some lift in margins at the Valves & Controls business. But you are facing this mix dynamic with more project activity growing presumably at Automation.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","So just wanted, should we expect incremental margins at Automation Solutions to dip down? Or do you think they can stay in the mid 30s as we transition the mix?","Unknown Speaker","(41:26)","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Doing the logic, and connecting the dots, you just put out there Gautam, which are very relevant dots for this connection. I firmly believe the margin pressure will be in this 30% to 35% range. This year, I think we're going to be probably a little, around closer to 35%. So I think that what's going to happen is the pressure will be to push that margin down because of the project business. And then what we have to make sure is that we manage the incremental investments as we grow. And that's what the challenge is going to be for 2019, because the projects will be kicking in. Some of the MRO business will probably slowing down.","I'm hoping we'll have some, still some good mix in North America investments going on. So we maybe have a better mix going our way. But that's going to be the pressure point we have. And then clearly, we're going to be pushing real hard on V&C to get that double-digit margin that we exit 2018 with to move it up quickly as possible so it help offset some of that dilution. But that's the game we're going to be facing there. But I still feel good about the margin progression that we laid out getting to that 19% that we, I think it was 2020, 2021? I still feel good about that. But the gain next year is exactly what you said, the projects come in, we got to start figuring out how we squeeze as best as we can to maintain the margin improvement record as we go forward.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. But north of 30% incremental, is it still kind of stable for next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. For all the Automation guys out on the phone or listening to this call, Mike Train and team north of 30%. Gautam says it. You have to deliver.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right, right. Of course. And then -","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Ignore the CEO of Emerson, but talk to Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right, right. I was going to say Latin America's still lagging. I was wondering, maybe if you could parse which \u2013 I thought we were getting some strength in Mexico and else in Brazil. But I wanted to know like what specifically is kind of holding that region back? Are you seeing any pockets of strength within Latin America? And what sort of is the last one to come back.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we are. We actually, last quarter, we saw good progress in Mexico, down in Chile and Argentina. This quarter, Brazil kicked in and Mexico dropped off. Our Mexican customer base has struggled a little bit relative to some projects and some business and small projects. So this quarter Mexico hurt us. So I've gone from \u2013 I was a believer they were going to come through to now I'm starting to doubt it again for a while here until this election gets done. But right now, it's Mexico's the one that held us back. The rest of the region, be it Brazil, be it Chile, be it Argentina, they're doing much better.","So if we can get Mexico back online and growing again, right now, I'd say maybe fourth quarter we'll see some growth return to that marketplace. But that's the last of the global region, although our emerging markets turned back up. Fortunately, it's not the largest. I mean, we have other markets much larger than they are now. But it's still, I'd like to see them all come back into sync. And I think it will because there's been under investments down there.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Gautam. All the best to you.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane. Good to hear from you.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, and I like the choice of the Stan Musial bat too. Stan the Man.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","He was a very nice investor and I won't mention his name. I've known him from a long, long, long time. He is a close friend. And he knows I love baseball bat. He also knows I like Stan Musial a lot. And I have lot of autographed stuff from Stan. And it's sitting here with my rally monkey and he is swinging it hard right now. So I appreciate that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What can I do for you today, Deane?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So hopefully, you can expand on the comments on China being robust for Automation. And so to see and hear the comment strong across process that's not surprising given the context of everything on this call and even hybrid. But in your answer, you can also touch on where strength is in discrete markets. We don't often hear you talk about that. So maybe some color, or maybe some applications if you could?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So from our perspective in the downturn, we worked \u2013 in the sort of a global downturn, we worked very, very hard to go after \u2013 continue to go after the mid-tier Chinese customers in the chemical area, the refining area, the pharmaceutical area and the natural gas area. And we are seeing them investing in a big way at this point in time. So when we're going in we're selling \u2013 and also the power area from the standpoint they're upgrading their power systems, to make them cleaner.","So we're seeing broad investments in our marketplace around \u2013 the markets we have chemical area, the mid-tier markets and they're taking our total package, be it systems, instrumentation, they're taking discrete products with them. We're seeing investments going on in the pharmaceutical right now as China is investing in their own pharmaceutical industry. And we are continuing to see very strong investments in refining as China is trying to become more of a self-sufficient on refining the finished product and for their own marketplace.","But across the board, if you look at the industries and we just had a review in Singapore on what's going on in China right now and Dominic and he is doing a great job. He is the Head of \u2013 President for us in China. Most of the markets are very strong across everything we serve at this point in time. And it's a lot of the smaller emerging players and our end-customer base that are investing in the space. And they're investing in smaller type of projects, but we're winning on broad-based projects, which is good. And the reason that discrete is coming through is because pharmaceutical, some of the chemical and some of the power area, we're starting to see some of our efforts of new product generation is starting to have a pretty good penetration. So when you grow 20% in a quarter in China in both businesses, you know you're doing something right. And that's what we did in the last quarter.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good to hear.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And I think we're going to have a very good \u2013 I think \u2013 I talked about having growth this year, most likely around 10% to 12%. I'm now looking at China being very strong this year, being north of 15% for Emerson. And because we have \u2013 we've really invested in people, we've invested in innovation and we're really pushing hard in this market space right now and our customers are liking what they see from us. So we're in a good zone and I'm sure people are going to start gunning for us here real soon. But I like where we are at this point in time.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And that 15% is for fiscal 2018?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Correct.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. And then, just a follow-up on the Valves & Controls question. You hinted that there is a divestiture coming and I know you can't give a lot of specifics, but I'd be interested in, kind of, directionally how material is that business to the overall Valves & Controls? And will you benefit from this addition by a subtraction? Is it a lower margin business? So will that help you get to your double-digit target?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It will help us more next year. Let's put it that way. It is a small business. You're talking less than $20 million in size, and you're talking about business that breaks even. And it's \u2013 and we've had \u2013 this has been in the market from day one, and the technology and product line, it's not interested \u2013 in the marketplace, we're not interested.","We have a couple more that we've been working on where we're trying to sell them. And \u2013 so this one will be done. And we'll probably get a little bit of help this year, all honestly, Deane, but it's going to help us more next year from the standpoint as we start running the year into 2019, it will help give us a nice margin, because we won't have that dilutive impact in there. But it's \u2013 that's very \u2013 it's very small. It's not that big.","But, overall, what I'm really hoping to see is, when it clears, and see the business is growing this year, when I thought we might not grow this year, we may actually go backwards. So that's the good sign right now of the integration process. But small divestitures that we have to deal with and we're hopefully getting them all done this year or early first \u2013 the first quarter of next year. But Frank and his team are working hard on it right now.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. See you in Sarasota.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much. Thank you, Deane.","Operator","The next question will be from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich. How are you doing? You're in St. Louise today, you're in the Midwest? Where are you hanging out today?","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I'm in Baltimore.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Baltimore.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Still in Baltimore, yeah. Yeah. Hanging in here, wearing my armor suit, so.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Question on cash from V&C, unlocking it, so referencing some of Rob's question earlier. So couple hundred million dollars was kind of the target over a multi-year timeframe. But where are you right now? How do you feel about that in terms of pulling out any sooner? And any thoughts around timing around it, pulling that in?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't think \u2013 I mean, I think our goal is north of $200 million in this by 2020. I don't think we're going be able to go any faster, Rich, because, right, we're going through right now is, I have a lot of pressure on Ram and his team. I think we're going to get over $50 million this year.","The goal for me is really to get their manufacturing regionalized and globalized, which is a new concept for them. And that's important to me. So I want to be able to manufacture. Our business in Asia right now, and China has taken off, and they don't manufacture the product in Asia. They ship it around the world. So my focus right now is, okay, guys, give me the manufacturing strategy with investments we have to make for the next couple of years, so we can localize. And that allows me then to get \u2013 to be a little more aggressive on the working capital.","I mean, we'll get the $200 million out of it by 2020, but the issue really \u2013 the gold mine for me is to be more regionally located, manufacturing located, which allows me to run with less working capital. And that would make a much bigger number on a combined basis down the road, which is that's my goal from that statement, from a cost and just the working capital basis. But I feel good about it.","I mean, we're going to end up getting north of $200 million off this and we're going to do it in a very systematic approach. And I think we're getting to cost structure and the competitive nature and the sales force is working hard. And now we're talking \u2013 we talked in Italy, Frank was with us, we're talking about new products and innovation for the first time in a long time with these guys. And so we're working to help each other try to accelerate innovation, which is something that you know that's a mantra of with inside Emerson. We work very, very hard at innovation. And so this is something I -they're exciting me with the concepts and opportunities for me right now and not just from working capital, but just from growth opportunities, which will be great to see.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. So it sounds like there's some tail, even some tail opportunity beyond 2020 with regards to working capital though. It's just going to be kind of grind it out.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I think so Rich. From my perspective, they are running around 50%. I want to get them down to 30%. In reality, I think that Ram's business should be thinking about low 20s.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And so \u2013 but this was going to take a more regional manufacturing approach and that will take time. But that's a lot of dollars when you start thinking about it. You take that percentage of sales. And so that's the way I think of the model I see for these guys, if they want investment, this is why I want back from them. But I know it's going to take me capital, which I'm willing to put in. But if I can run that business in the low 20s would trade working capital on a global basis with better margins, I'm going to create value for our shareholders and our customers too.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. And then early returns on Paradigm; I saw some interesting stuff then at OTC and with regards to some of the software and folding that into the system and whatnot. What's been \u2013 has it expanded share of wallet early on here or what's the early read?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Not much has changed. I think this one's probably 12 months out. This one is, you do need to \u2013 going back to my comment on one of the earlier questions about the bigger projects, this is where you need bigger projects where they start investing in bigger chunks of software and those are still to come. I mean, what they're going on right now is they're looking at existing fields, existing investments. So that's only small amounts of investments going on. What we're looking for is to gear up, and it's okay, let's go look at a new location and really do some more software work.","So I would say that one is going to be more helpful for us in 2019 and 2020 when the bigger projects come, but still doing okay. And then it gives us time to get integration underway. And we had an organization session last week, talking about some new teams and some new ways we want to manage this business. So Paradigm, the timing is good. And we'll make good money in this one over the long-term.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. See you in a few weeks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks very much, Rick. I look forward to seeing you at EPG.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from Simon Toennessen of Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Simon.","Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","My first question is on Automation Solutions in Asia. Obviously, very strong China numbers, you had again there. But it seems, Asia grew 7%, which is probably mostly China. So can you talk a bit, what's holding you back in Asia ex-China, and how you see that panning out in the second half?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Our Asia businesses grew a solid single digit outside of China. And I mean, China is important, but I mean, it's still \u2013 it's not \u2013 it's probably only half of our business if that all right now. I mean, I couldn't tell at the top of my head.","Historically, it's around anywhere between 45% and 52%. So they're grabbing numbers for me Simon, so I can make sure I'm not \u2013 yeah so \u2013 we had good \u2013 first half growth is single-digit type of business for us good growth. What's holding us back primarily is the initial investments are just starting to happen in Southeast Asia and Australia.","So Australia had gone through a very difficult time period and they're just starting to invest. So that's \u2013 the two weaker markets we're seeing right now are Southeast Asia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Australia\/New Zealand.","And so what we're starting to see is that's starting to pick back up. And I would expect us to see that moving into a solid single digit, which is normal for a mature \u2013 the more mature emerging market for us. So that's what's holding us back right now but the projects, the business is starting to happen. And I would say they're going to see a stronger second half than they did in the first half. And I expect China to hold in there very nicely for us Simon.","Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Got it, Dave. And the second question on C&RS in China. Obviously, again a strong quarter. Can you maybe give us a bit more color on the development of the heat pumps business and how you're seeing that for fiscal 2018?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The heat pump markets it's pretty strong. I think we're now on our seventh or eighth double-digit growth China business for Commercial Residential. That is a good record for us where you have seven straight quarters. And I think that will probably have eight or nine.","So what's going on right now? What we're starting to see is it's starting to move over into the industrial marketplace, the heat pump versus the coal or versus the gas and starting to move into what I'd call the commercial marketplace. So the first wave has been around homes or the consumer marketplace. Now, it's starting to move into the industrial space and it's starting to move into the commercial space.","And we're also starting to see where some potentially some hot water space where they're heating water for the industrial applications or restaurants. So we're starting to see the application of the government is trying to encourage companies to get away from coal, try to get away from heating oil to either to heat or warm water. And we're now starting to see growth starting to happen outside the residential market.","So that's why this is sustained a little bit longer and we're encouraged by that. And we're hoping this will take hold as we leave this year so we can have growth in 2019. Because clearly after eight or nine good solid double-digit growth quarters in Asia, or China for these guys we're going to have some really difficult comparisons. So we're trying to drive a broader marketplace right now Simon. And we're the only one that can do this because of the size of our compression and our sizes, electronics and scale capabilities here.","So, so far, it's going well. I'm going to be there in June. I'm going to a couple of sites and I'm going to do a site review in Xuzhou. I'm hoping to see some of these new products and some of those market expansion going well and (59:00) and his team are doing a great job in trying to get this to the new markets. We've got to get away from just the consumer, the individual homes to the industrial and to the commercial space, which is starting to happen.","Simon Toennessen - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Very helpful. Thanks a lot, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Simon. All the best. Hope to see you soon.","Operator","The next question will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So Dave, maybe just talk about capital deployment a little bit. When tax reform got passed you were one of the few CEOs to talk about additional CapEx investment, so I was curious to see if there was any update there on internal projects?","And then secondly just on the M&A side, obviously there Greenlee-Klauke acquisition recently. Be curious like how the pipeline is going today, what you're seeing perhaps on the process side, whether there's any opportunities there. Any color there would be great.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good. So as we talked about, I did come out and I've talked to my board about this a lot on the capital allocation. Given our balance sheet, given the cash flow generation and the benefit of the tax rate for us as we get into 2019 and 2020, we have obviously tremendous flexibility here. So from our perspective right now, our share repurchase program, we're going to be looking at $1 billion this year in our fiscal year.","From a capital spending standpoint, we took it up and we're targeting to get up towards \u2013 what is it Frank? $575 million. I think that no more increase to that. I mean, I think that's right now, that's where we are at this point in time. It could slip a quarter or two, but we're ramping up. And as I talked earlier, we're trying to encourage investments relative to our globalization standpoint. So we want to invest capital to become more productive and faster and more efficient. So we're going to keep doing this in the next couple years. At the same time, this year, I mean right now, Frank are we close to $2 billion? Where are we sitting on acquisitions at this point in time? We have $1.4 billion, $1.5 billion?","I firmly believe that we have opportunities this year Joe to get over $2 billion. We do have a couple we're working on it right now in the automation space. So we're trying to frontload this. As we talked about trying to get certain amount of acquisitions done incremental, bolt-on acquisitions done within the couple years, the first three years, we're trying to get them as close as possible to give us a chance to work them.","We are seeing opportunities for companies like the Textron situation where their boards make the decision to refocus the company. We're seeing more and more opportunities like that out there. And we're starting to see some initial assets being shown within the Baker Hughes GE business. And so I think the opportunities are out there for us. We're going to have a couple good years of acquisitions, but they're very much focused on bolt-ons and I would say majority of them will still be in the automation space, even though we've made two good acquisitions in the commercial residential space.","But our best opportunities right now continue to be in the automation and our allocation. As we talked about it, I'd like to put as much acquisition to work and the bolt-ons and the incremental acquisition opportunities versus just share repurchase.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that's super helpful, Dave. I guess my one follow on. If you go back to the Textron acquisition, I had some familiarity with that asset. And right now, like clearly the margins aren't where they need to be. And I'm just curious, when you think about maybe Greenlee specifically, what is it about your channel or your go to market, maybe footprint optimization that's going to allow you to get the margins to be at a much more sustainable and higher level?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We are much more of intense company relative to footprint optimization than Textron was. And from our standpoint, I mean I'm running this business and being internally involved with this, the business internally right now. There's no reason why the Greenlee and Klauke couldn't run better. I just think they need to optimize the manufacturing. They need to optimize the investments that are already there. It's not going to be necessarily the channel per se. We do have some channel leverage. I just feel that we can run this business a much better way than they ran it from an operational standpoint and it's right into our wheelhouse, which is what we're good at. I also think they have some businesses in there they should not be in and they're not the leaders in and we're going to quickly evaluate what we're going to do with those businesses.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That makes sense.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We've got Frank over here worried about that because, but I'm just telling you what I think. I mean, I know what's inside that and I think we have some opportunities to tune it better and make them \u2013 I mean, make sure they're worth being in. That's what I'm saying.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Makes sense. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Joe.","Operator","The next question will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave. Thanks for running longer. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay Andy, you're my last question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for running a little longer today. I appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well I went just to make sure could I harass you Andrew. That's why I mean, I saw in the queue and said I got to get up and harass Andrew a little bit, because he doesn't like me right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I understand. I welcome it. I welcome it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So let me ask you about Commercial & Residential Solutions in the context of your margin performance. You had mentioned for the company relatively flat price versus cost. Margins were down, slight bad year over year, but you had the cause of the divestitures, a tailwind. So maybe talk about what was the impact from inflation or mix. You talked about slightly weaker U.S. residential. Are you investing more in the business? And how should we think about margin moving forward?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We are definitely investing more in the business right now. We are investing in some next generation technologies that are going to be hitting here in the U.S. and also hitting very heavily in Europe in the next couple years. So we've ramped up some investments around technology, some innovation.","As you know, the space from the commercial standpoint, there's going to be some new regulations coming to play and we have to be ahead of that from the standpoint of offering a solution to our customer. And if we do that, then we win that space. And then we win that space for quite some time and we're trying to add more value to that. So the actual value proposition is higher for us.","On the price cost business within the commercial, residential, we're basically off a quarter or two right now, so. And this space we're being squeezed a little bit, but I know that we will, within two quarters we'll get that back and back in line. We trade back and forth with \u2013 from our customer base. We go back and forth on this issue.","So I think that we're getting closer, but we'll be under the pressure for the next quarter in this space too, it's hurt us a little bit. But it's not a big number but I just know it's a negative pressure not a positive pressure and so \u2013 from that perspective.","And the other thing is just from the mix within our global businesses where Asia is a good business, but it's not nearly as profitable let's say our U.S. business or our European business. So we have a lot of \u2013 some also mix going on. But I'm not going to complain at the level of profitably. We're still going to raise this margin up over the next couple of years, but it's going to come from the investments and the growth of these new technologies not by driving a ton of cost out. We're continuing to optimize it but I really want to drive a little bit faster growth and drive a faster mix towards that profitability.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, that's helpful, Dave. And then Automation Solutions orders, you talked about March has still been good. You told us not to be concerned last quarter when they do slow a little. But you told us on this call that large projects could start to kick in sooner rather than later. So are you still thinking about 5% to 10% range is sort of right for the year? And any indication on how April looks at this point?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't have any April numbers at this point. But the Automation Solutions numbers is really holding in there solid \u2013 a very solid 7% right now. And I would expect a couple of months. I mean, if we start getting larger projects as I mentioned earlier that could pop up towards that 10% range. Again, starting to get tougher comps, but the orders are holding in there such we feel very good about this 7% range for the whole year for all of Emerson. But I like where we sit right now. The trend lines are ticking up a little bit and on both businesses which is a good sign. And so as we get into EPG, I'm going to try to give you guys a little bit more color down at EPG of what I see after \u2013 we'll have April on-board, we'll have the early indication in May and we'll see what's going on here in the U.S. But, right now, the trend lines are going the right way and that's why we felt good about taking that number up to 7% underlying growth at the high end. And I'm hoping that Automation Solutions does a little bit better too in the second half this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Appreciate it, Dave. See you at EPG.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. With that, I'm going to wrap up. I want to thank everybody. Again, I want to thank all the Emerson people, all employees around the world for their effort. And I also want to thank the shareholders joining us today for this call. Again, a very good second quarter, a very solid first half this year. And now we just have to deliver the second half of this year. But as we look at the third quarter, we're looking somewhere \u2013 again, I'll repeat it, 7% to 7.5% underlying sales growth. We're looking at our earnings of around $0.85, plus or minus a couple of pennies. That's what it looks like to us right now. And I really can't call it any closer than that. But it's again another good solid quarter for us. And hopefully that will continue as we move into the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you Mr. Farr.

Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 6, 2019.","Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the Company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Tim Reeves","Thank you, Allison. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Welcome to Emerson\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Please follow along in the slide presentation, which is available on our website. I\u2019ll start with the third quarter summary on Slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $4.7 billion increased 5%, and underlying sales were up 2%. Growth was below our guidance across both businesses. Underlying orders were up 2% in June, also below the 5% to 7% expectation we discussed during the second quarter earnings conference call on May 7.","Automation Solutions\u2019 underlying sales were up 3% and orders up 4% in the quarter. We had expected global discrete channel inventories to clear and demand to recover, but instead discrete end markets further decelerated in the quarter. North American upstream oil and gas demand have yet to improve. Demand in process and hybrid end markets, however was stable in North America and continued to be robust elsewhere.","Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales and orders were down 1% in the quarter, primarily driven by cooler wet weather conditions in North America. GAAP EPS was $0.97 and was $0.94 up 7%, excluding discrete tax items in the current and prior year. Through the third quarter, we\u2019ve returned $1.9 billion to shareholders and completed our $1 billion 2019 share repurchase target. Today, we announced an additional $250 million of share repurchases that we will target to complete in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 4, third quarter gross margin was down 90 basis points and EBIT margin was down 80 basis points. EBIT margin was up 50 basis points excluding the Aventics, Tools & Test and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. Tax rate in both years benefited from several favorable discrete items in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 5, third quarter underlying sales growth was led by Asia, Middle East and Africa, which accelerated from flat in Q2 to up 3% in Q3, primarily driven by sequential improvement in the Commercial & Residential Solutions business. However, the Automation Solutions business also ticked up sequentially. The Americas was up 1% and remained positive across both businesses but with slower compared to the second quarter growth of 7%. Europe was up 1% and remained positive across both platforms.","Turning now to Slide 6, total segment margin was down 160 basis points and was down 30 basis points excluding recent acquisitions. Segment margin of 18.1% was approximately in line with our expectations as our business is executed well to deliver strong profitability on lower sales growth. We guided sequential core leverage in the mid-40s and our businesses together delivered over 70% on $120 million higher sales.","As we discussed last year, we\u2019ve accelerated certain restructuring programs in the second half of 2019 to position the business for a slower near-term growth environment. In Q2, we identified approximately $10 million of restructuring investments to accelerate in this fiscal year. And this quarter, we\u2019ve added another $20 million. Our total expected restructuring spend and other actions is now $100 million for 2019, which is up from approximately $70 million at our February Investor Conference. These investments will help position the company for improving profitability in early 2020.","Operating cash flow performance with solid, up 2% and free cash flow was \u2013 conversion was 135% in the quarter. Our year-to-date free cash flow conversion is 88% and we continue to expect strong cash flow performance in the fourth quarter and greater than 100% full year cash flow conversion. Trade working capital is an opportunity for us in the fourth quarter. TWC performance was worse by 80 basis points driven entirely by inventory, which was higher in June, as sales soften late in the quarter. We expect to recover this in the fourth quarter, which will benefit cash performance.","Turning onto Slide 7, Automation Solutions\u2019 underlying sales were up 3% and orders were up 4% in the quarter. Underlying sales trend in the quarter remained broadly stable as follows. We saw continued strong demand across our three kinds of business; MRO spending, brownfield, and greenfield projects. All world areas remained positive.","And we continue to see healthy progress in our long cycle project outlook, a strong project funnel, systems orders growth, and a growing backlog. There were few areas that missed our expectations. First, North America upstream oil and gas did not recover as we expected. Customers in the Permian and other key regions continue to focus their CapEx budgets and maximize free cash flow, also limited pipeline capacity continued to constrain investment activity.","Second, global discrete manufacturing end markets decelerated. The short cycle weakness was particularly sales in automotive and semiconductor end markets. And finally, although our project funnel remains healthy, our customers are more cautious around capital spending. Geopolitical and trade tensions have created a more cautious investment \u2013 business investment climate. As a result, we\u2019ve seen some projects push out of the year. This has impacted our orders and sales growth expectations in 2019. However, we\u2019ve not had any project cancellations and we continue to have confidence that projects in the funnel will be executed.","For the full year, we expect underlying sales growth of approximately 5%, which is at the low end of our prior guidance. This implies a fourth quarter underlying sales growth rates of approximately 5% a bit stronger than Q3, which is supported by steady orders growth and backlog conversion.","Segment margin decreased 150 basis points and was down 10 basis points excluding the Aventics and GE Intelligent Platforms acquisitions. The business delivered sequential leverage above our guidance as the management team executed well on lower growth. As mentioned, we have pulled in additional restructuring actions that we are targeting and complete this year. Including the full year segment margin is expected to be approximately 15%.","Turning to Slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales and orders were down 1% in the quarter. Growth in the Americas decelerated from 4% in Q2 to 1% this quarter, due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions, cooler, wet weather in key regions late in the quarter that\u2019s flowed residential, air conditioning and construction markets. Europe also decelerated late in the quarter due to weather, but preliminary July orders trended positively.","The Asia, Middle East and Africa region improved from down 15% in Q2 to down 6% this quarter. And we expect improvement to continue with underlying sales growth turning positive as we head into 2020. And the preliminary trailing three months underlying orders in July were up slightly a good sign.","For the full year, we expect Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying growth to be approximately flat compared to up 2% in our prior guidance. This implies a slightly positive Q4 growth rate, which is supported by expected improvement in North America air conditioning markets and continued improvement in Asia, Middle East and Africa region.","Margin decreased 70 basis points excluding the Tools & Test acquisition. The businesses delivered over 40%, I\u2019m sorry, the business delivered over 40% sequential leverage on incremental sales, which was in line with our guidance. We expect full year segment margins to be approximately 21% including additional restructuring actions pulled into the fourth quarter.","Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 9. Our 2019 guidance framework is updated to reflect underlying sales growth of approximately 3%, including lower than expected third quarter growth in a reduced near-term growth outlook for global discrete markets. Fourth quarter underlying growth is expected to be approximately 3.5%. The EPS guidance range is maintained at $3360 to $3.70 and we expect fourth quarter earnings per share of approximately $1.10, which is the midpoint of the full year range.","Updated full year segment margin targets reflect reduced growth and increased restructuring spend. The fourth quarter total reported segment leverage is expected to be approximately 30% year-over-year and almost 40% sequentially, compared with the third quarter. Reduced segment profit contribution is offset by lower corporate costs and a lower full year tax rate to hold the prior 2019 EPS guidance range.","We expect fourth quarter corporate cost to be approximately $150 million. The fourth quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 21%, including a $0.05 discrete tax benefits. And the 2019 full year tax rate is also expected to be approximately 21%. We\u2019ve updated our estimated ongoing operational tax rate, which includes improvements from platform reorganization actions. We now expect our operational tax rate to be approximately 23.5% going forward, as we continue to optimize our global two-platform operating structure. Expected operating cash flow is $3.1 billion and free cash flow is unchanged at $2.5 billion.","Please turn now to Slide 10, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Tim. I want to welcome everybody. Thanks for joining us. I\u2019d say also want to let you know that, this is Tim\u2019s next as last earnings call. I go through this process of training semi-professional Investor Relations people.","Tim Reeves","They never get there.","David Farr","They never quite get there. But Tim has a unique opportunity that we can\u2019t talk about, but he\u2019s going to be going to it later this year. And I have breaking in another person, by the time, we get into the November timeframe. But Tim most likely will join us for that call.","And I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I want to give you an update and what we see. I want to thank the employees for joining us today. Also want to remind everybody, we actually have an extensive number of people in the queue close to 20 people in the queue to ask questions.","So I definitely need to keep you to holding to the two questions rules, we\u2019ll extend the call a little bit maybe a minute or hour, 15:20 to try to get as many questions as possible. Clearly, as you can tell from my communications that we put out our communications we put out last Monday and the communications today, I have sensed and continuous sense of change in the underlying business environment, which I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be talking about here for a few minutes. And then you\u2019ll be asking a lot of questions around it.","I also want to thank all the employees for their support over the last three months in this challenging third quarter we just went through and for the year-to-date numbers and as we drive to finish out this fiscal year in 2019 and moving into 2020.","As I look at the year, it\u2019s a good year. We have good growth in sales, we have good growth in earnings, we have good growth in cash flow, but it\u2019s happened on folded much differently than we thought going back 9 months or 10 months ago. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re having to deal with right now.","But as you can see in the orders chart on Page 10, two things. First, we have new pop called Doon, after Doon bag, one of our favorite golf places in Ireland and Doon is a black and tan. Next to rocket, rocket birthday, today is one-year old, birthday is today. You can see the order trend did improve slightly for automation solutions. It ticked up a little bit, pulled us up a little bit. On the Commercial & Residential Solutions for the month of July, orders were a little bit better, but still slightly negative overall in a specific turn positive and ends \u2013 the month of July, which is good.","We\u2019re now three or four months behind what we said, more or like four months behind what we said, but it\u2019s good to see that happening. You could see the industries we see \u2013 we\u2019ve been seeing pretty good strength in the third quarter, between the midstream, downstream, lots of caution around the upstream area right now. Chemical, we\u2019ve got a very good quarter and power our orders in the PWS power business is, it close to 40% up for the quarter around the world as we continue to upgrade the power facilities around the world. Automotive and semiconductor and discrete really had a tough quarter.","But overall, a softening in key marketplaces, but the trend lines are still positive over, but definitely slowed to way below we thought when we started this year. Go forward, we\u2019ve updated the \u2013 what we call our large project pipeline funnel, Including, we actually did an upgraded the total size of the funnel, when we give this funnel out two, three times a year.","In February, it was around $7.6 billion, 195 projects, today it\u2019s 221 projects, $8.3 billion, it did increase a little bit. Clearly, another sign of things slowing down a little bit of push out is that are committed one, but not booked is now slightly over $1 billion in projects. Projects that are basically sitting out there that we\u2019ve won an there, we\u2019re still waiting for the final documentation in order to be placed. So we can start booking and then obviously, start doing some shipments against it.","The other key thing you\u2019ll see in this is that, on down the bottom, we talk about what\u2019s been shifted out of 2019 and 2020, based on what we\u2019ve seen about $350 million of projects we\u2019re working on for the last couple of \u2013 6 to 8, 12 months has been shifted from 2019 to 2020 and we basically have seen about $450 million, other pipeline shifted out of 2020 into 2021.","Clearly, this tells you we have, what I call, a dynamic pipe and some things moving in, some things moving out, but clearly a slow down. I fundamentally believe in discussions with our customer base, our organization around the world, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on this last couple of months is, this cycle is not ended. This cycle is in a pause mode, because of the disruption that\u2019s going on relative to the trade negotiations, the trade discussions and it\u2019s clearly causing a slowdown in some key markets, primarily the USA, a little bit of Europe and we\u2019ve seen some pushback in a couple of places around the world.","But our international markets have continued to held up from an automation standpoint, U.S. markets pushed out a little bit. The Canada market pushed out a little bit and a little bit of push out and actually sales are going out in the Middle East, but overall, still going in. And I firmly believe, if we do get resolution to, trade discussions at some point in time here between now and the next 12, 18 months. The cycle will move back up.","There\u2019s not been an excessive amount of capital spent and build out in the cycle yet. It\u2019s way too early. I just look at what\u2019s going on inside our company as we reallocate. But I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ll have a lot of questions around this issue. As I look at what\u2019s going on, I am a little concerned from the standpoint of how long the slowdown will happen. Hence, the OCE got together over the last 30 days and looked at some incremental restructuring. We\u2019ve looked at where we need to slow down investments, where we need to pullback investments. We\u2019ve looked at where we can accelerate restructuring that we had planned in 2021 and to deal with protecting and improving our profitability in a slower growth environment.","Clearly, we laid in a structure of costs from people standpoint organization back in 2018 and the end of 2018 running through 2019, look at much faster growth. This year, for instance, we had thought we\u2019d grow around the 6% to 6.5%, we\u2019re now growing around that 3% to 3.5% range. You look at what we see going next year. I look at a very gradual growth environment at this point in time, but I also want to build in the flexibility if that doesn\u2019t happen that we could still protect our profitability and our cash flow and deliver some results for our shareholders.","At this point in time, I see the slow down lasting well into 2020. And so I see some resolution on around what\u2019s going to happen with the trade discussions that we all face. And from my perspective, that could last easily well past the election at the November of 2020. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it.","It is a different perspective than I did discuss, say, electrical products group in May and even when the phone call in early May, but I\u2019ve come to the realization and watching our customer base and talking to our customer base is they\u2019re going to be cautious. And therefore from my perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to invest strategically, where we can gain market share or market penetration. And then we\u2019re going to back down and protect our profitability and cash flow where necessary.","We\u2019re also going through a whole prioritization on our capital projects. From this year, we\u2019ve pulled it back a little bit as we go through this process. Next year, we\u2019re prioritizing where we need to spend capital. I have commitments that we have to do in capital over the next couple years. And I\u2019m trying to set with Frank and you\u2019ll see, those priorities of where we need to spend money.","I have some actions, I have to take some additional manufacturing capacity in the best cost locations that we have around the world. But I need to prioritize those to make sure we\u2019re dealing the right way as we go forward here in 2020 and as we come back into 2021. Again, we\u2019re being proactive, we\u2019re trying to be a little bit more aggressive and hence our restructuring and we\u2019ll be looking at that pretty hard between now and year end. And if we see we have other opportunities, we will take those opportunities on.","It\u2019s all about getting our cost structure in line for slower growth, improve our profitability, deliver the incremental margins that we\u2019ve been committing in a different growth environment and also positioning ourselves for one of recovery does happen in our capital base, which I believe will happen.","So overall, again, I want to say it\u2019s been a good year from my perspective, it\u2019s not happened like we thought would happen. We totally happy about it. No. We\u2019ve been dealt a hand in a little bit more challenging environment relative to trade and relative to the investment environment. My customer base is being cautious, but we\u2019re not rolling up the tent and going home. We\u2019re going to be attacking and aggressive going after things. But we\u2019re also bringing our cost structure line to be able to serve ourselves and also serve our customers and also build the profitability that we want to deal with.","So I want to thank everybody from the Emerson team as we wrap up this year. We\u2019ve got a couple more months left. And I want to thank the team as we get ready for 2020 and 2021.","With that, we\u2019ll open the line, again I want to remind everybody we have a lot of people in line close to 20 or maybe more than 20 people now. And so I need to hold you the two questions and we\u2019ll take as much time up to about an hour, 15:20 to get through the questions.","So with that, Tim, let\u2019s open it up.","Tim Reeves","Okay.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good afternoon, guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","This \u2013 so how do we think about the longer-term roadmap for you guys in the more difficult macro and particularly as we go into Slide 20, it might be difficult obviously to achieve the target in 2021 of $450 m. But if we are in this longer prolonged slowdown, can you still grow double-digits in EPS off the 2019 base. If not, that stabilize a bit here given a high level of restructuring and repurchases, how should we think about that?","David Farr","From the perspective, our underlying growth rate based on the model we presented in February, it was close to 5%, $4.5% to 5%, I believe the cycle here. If that number is going to be closer to 2% to 3% because of the slowdown, we\u2019re going to have to have bolt \u2013 more bolt-on acquisitions to allow us to be able to get that tougher earnings growth. It\u2019ll be very \u2013 it\u2019ll be challenging for us.","But that the key issue for me is, can we drive to make amount of roll through penetration, if that\u2019s possible and we\u2019ll try to do that while also going to have to be a little aggressive on the bolt-on acquisitions that allow us to integrate some more sales and profits to get that number up. But that\u2019s the game plan is going to have to be is where do we get that top line growth.","If we lose about a point or two from underlying from this core business, then the acquisition games can be even more important to us on the \u2013 from the bolt-on standpoint. And then we\u2019re going to have to be aggressive on the integrating those acquisitions. That will be the key issue for us is as we look in the next couple of years and that target we laid out in February because of, as you said, it\u2019s a much different macro environment. Let something happen relative the trade early on in 2020, we spend what accelerate growth potentially in 2021 that would be another scenario, but I\u2019m not banking on that right now. We\u2019re looking at an environment that\u2019s going to be a little bit less growth in rapid deal with that.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. And then obviously, in Automation Solutions, you\u2019ve talked about 30% incremental as the target. How should we think about underlying instrumentals? If we do have this slower growth environment, given all the restructuring you\u2019re doing, could we still do 30% plus on lower growth?","David Farr","That\u2019s the game plan. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going after the incremental restructuring now Andrew. We\u2019ve made a commitment to get that profit margin back up. These are quality assets. We\u2019ve made a lot of acquisitions within this asset space and we need to make sure from our shareholders standpoint that we get those margins back up to eyesight are that reasonable range.","It might take us a little longer to get back to that what I think the appropriate number is now in this combination of companies that run 19% even, but we\u2019re not backing off that number incrementally, that\u2019s our number for next year and Lal and his team understand that. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re going after from a restructuring standpoint, from the perspective of what we\u2019re trying to get done. And if we need to, we\u2019ll do it more incremental restructuring in early part of 2020.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, Dave. Appreciate it.","David Farr","All the best, Andrew. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steve Tusa","Congrats to Tim, unless you\u2019re like sending them to some God for sake in part of the world like, I don\u2019t know where you send these people, but hopefully its going more nice.","David Farr","Tusa, I can willing to \u2013 I\u2019m open for suggestions. I mean you might have to talk to his wife a little bit about this. She is the St. Louis girl. But you might \u2013 if you got an idea, it\u2019s not going to be gut to Georgia. I can tell you that right now.","Steve Tusa","No. I\u2019m just going to say that you stole that one. I\u2019m just going to say that.","David Farr","Not going to be a gut to Georgia. Most likely, it could be like, so what the tough place in Nevada? We get some get valley or something like this. Now he is going to be going most likely in the Northeast somewhere.","Steve Tusa","Got it, got it. I love the red exclamation points on the order trends. I think that, that really pops stands out. But how bad was kind of your discrete business on order rate or revenues either one like are those down double-digit. And then as a follow-up to that, within power specifically and then a little bit less in LNG, how do you think you\u2019re doing share wise, because power, I would assume that\u2019s more kind of attacking competitor installed base and selling digital and that kind of stuff. So it seems like there\u2019s a bit of a share gain there in power.","David Farr","So on the discrete side, we\u2019re not down double-digit. I mean it\u2019s a solid single-digit, but\u2026","Steve Tusa","Okay.","David Farr","I mean I would say, Tim and I are going back for the somewhere between 5% to 8% mid-single digit down in the discrete side. The inventory has not come out of the system at all. Obviously, the demand slowed down as you\u2019ve seen Steve, and therefore it\u2019s going to take a little longer. It could last all the way to the calendar year now to get that out. But that\u2019s where we see at that point in time. The process side where it\u2019s been pretty good within the channel, but just right now its oil and gas related down around Texas and the Permian has been pretty tough.","On the power side, we are very committed to this space. And we\u2019ve continued to bring out the next generation control system ovation. We continued to bring out new services. We\u2019ve continued to be highly committed to supporting the power generation both renewable, primary power, all different types of power, particularly around colder gas. So based on what we\u2019re seeing right now, I would say we are winning against our key competitors out there. But obviously, we\u2019re not going to back down. I think there\u2019s a unique window of opportunity as we look at this.","And overall this year, year-to-date, we\u2019re up a solid single-digit in orders. And I think we\u2019re going to have a good fourth quarter and good start to next year. The industry needs to go through some reinvestments and upgrading systems, taking old systems down and bringing out the new power plants, bringing up new gas, get rid of coal. These are all opportunities for us and we\u2019re out there fighting for it. And I would say we\u2019re doing pretty well at this point in time. And again, I don\u2019t look at a quarter per share. I mean, let\u2019s wrap it up as we finished this calendar year, but I feel good at the trend line as I look at the last 12 months to 18 months versus our primary competitors in the space.","Steve Tusa","Right. But that\u2019s the OEM installed base, correct, that you\u2019re going after?","David Farr","Correct.","Steve Tusa","Yes. And then one last one just on the macro, you seemed confident that this isn\u2019t getting worse, but then you said things extend, I mean, through the election next year. I mean how are your customers and you guys going to not at least pause a little bit before all the uncertainty around the election and let you just have, I\u2019m sure you have confidence in the outcome, but like how are you going to integrate that into your kind of plans and your thinking?","David Farr","From our perspective, we\u2019re going to work multiple plans here from my perspective. I think we\u2019re going to look at an environment where there\u2019s very little growth in environment. There\u2019s some moderate growth. Clearly, we still see our international business doing better than the U.S. at this point in time. And that\u2019s going to allow us to see a little bit better growth. But we\u2019re going to factor in that. We could be in a slugfest with real low-single digit growth for the next 12 months and therefore you got to get that cost line in line and really prioritize we\u2019re going to spend money.","It\u2019s not going to be \u2013 in my opinion, I\u2019m being very, very, let\u2019s say cautious or negative, but I\u2019m very concerned about business was like you said, keep pausing and they keep reevaluating their investment and that\u2019s going to drag the business investment to a weaker environment. If it doesn\u2019t happen that way and things get better, we\u2019ll be okay. But I\u2019m more worried about that it will happen and they\u2019re fine, we\u2019re structuring the company to be in that environment.","Steve Tusa","Got it, okay. Thanks a lot.","Tim Reeves","Thank you.","David Farr","Thanks, Steve. All the best. If you\u2019ve got ideas, we\u2019re going to send Tim, send him to me.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you doing?","Jeff Sprague","I\u2019m doing well. Thank you. Fighting through it all so.","David Farr","Good. It\u2019s always fun at slugfest system. You get to meet, he gets boring.","Jeff Sprague","No, exactly. Well, hey, I want to just to pick up on your last point. You\u2019re \u2013 you kind of indicated you didn\u2019t use the term, but maybe kind of the risk of just stall speed. And if we get there, what really kind of keeps us from kind of tip in lower. I guess no one has a crystal ball, right. But how would you handicap kind of a worse outlook than what you portrayed in your opening comments there?","David Farr","The key issue there is, I think there\u2019s a good chance of economy, next year it gets the global economy gets real close to that stall speed. And I think that, as we finished the rest of this calendar year, which I think will be okay relative to investment then people then really start reevaluating in 2020. We have to \u2013 if we sense we\u2019re going to get pretty close that stall speed which we\u2019ve seen the economy before, then we got to think about, okay, do we have the right things done relative to our restructuring and our position the company.","Right now I mean I think we\u2019re going to get close to that stall speed, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go all that way. We also, as you understand around the world, we have the every Fed \u2013 Federal Reserve around the world really pushing accommodation to make sure the economies do not get to that stall speed. So I think that\u2019s one thing we have gone for us. That the European, the Japanese, the Chinese, the American, Federal Reserve banks where they\u2019re called around the world are working very, very hard to make sure we don\u2019t go into that stall speed. But I think there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll get real close to it. And hopefully the financial reserves out there can figure out how to make sure we don\u2019t go in there, because that\u2019s a little bit different environment and it gets pretty ugly for a lot of companies at that point in time.","Jeff Sprague","Yes. And then just separately, just thinking about the automation margins, right, so it actually ended up being kind of peculiar looking quarter, right. Your actual OP dollars are down, right. So we\u2019re not just talking mixed effects of deals on margins, but OP dollars down. So now as we look into Q4, right, we need to see a pretty significant step up in the OP dollars to get to that forecast.","You had talked on the last call about some of the sweet things on price cost and other levers. Could you just give us a little bit more visibility on how we bridge to that Q4 automation margin number?","David Farr","Yes. I think there\u2019s a couple of things going on from the perspective we have, obviously the price cost continues to move our way in that fourth quarter in a positive way. They did have a pretty good sequential margins improvement in the third quarter. The other thing is the restructuring actions that we took back a couple months ago. I believe in April and April, May and also some of the core restructuring that we started in the beginning of year, our start up flow through.","So the automation business is things slowed down. As you remember, we started taking actions earlier on with that business, so some of those benefits are coming true. In the last couple months close and even June, which was a tough month for Automation Solutions from a sales standpoint, they did very well with leverage and in profitability. The month of July, which we\u2019re starting to see right now the same things flowing through again.","So my gut tells me right now, I feel pretty good about where they flow. The key issue there is do they \u2013 can they continue to get some of that the backlog out that\u2019s been built over the year and\/or do the customer start pushing that out. But right now I think they\u2019ve got the cost structure in line for where they sit in for this calendar year. Jeff, and I feel pretty good about the margins in the fourth quarter for these guys.","Jeff Sprague","Great. Thanks, Dave. I\u2019ll pass it.","David Farr","All the best to Jeff. Thank you very much. Have a good rest on that.","Operator","The next question will come from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, may be a good place to start, Dave would be the game plan where you would augment slowing growth with bolt-on acquisitions. And when I hear you say that, it kind of suggests that there\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re still willing to play offense here and which is a good sign. But just how do you do you marry the idea of going after acquisitions during a period of high uncertainty and clearly a pause and closer to stall speed.","David Farr","From the perspective of some of the bolt-on acquisitions, which we worked pretty aggressively all the time, fundamentally we believe as we go into this time period, as we move into 2020, early 2021. Some of the companies that we\u2019re interested in, we\u2019ll want to \u2013 we\u2019ll got \u2013 we\u2019ll want to get out and we\u2019ll have the opportunity to do those bolt-on acquisitions. Historically and times that things like this slowdown, things that gets kind of sloppy, near that sloppy, we see some of these product lines pop out.","And so, we\u2019re bank yet, we\u2019re going to try and push the pressure point up on this thing. And see if we can get a couple of these pop and give us some incremental growth, the top line. Obviously work on the cash flow and obviously work with the earnings, but it\u2019s just going to be one of these gains that we know where we\u2019re going to go and we\u2019re nowhere pushing right now and does our \u2013 the place we\u2019re going to, are they willing to now to sell because of the sloppiness in the marketplace from their perspective.","So that\u2019s how the game is going to work. What is put a little bit more tension on it and from the top level down and I know every company is going to be going through a repositioning, restructuring and hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to convince them of our sellers. They\u2019ll let a couple of these small product lines grow. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to work.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then as a follow-up, but just to continue along the lines of this pause versus an end of a cycle, can you comment on the power or the influence of this negative feedback loop, because you\u2019re saying right now you\u2019re slowing down your investments, you\u2019re pulling back, you\u2019re seeing customers push out projects. How does that not feed on itself and become a more of a power slower, faster? And to a certain extent, can you share with us how much you\u2019re seeing from your customer and being influenced by what your customers are doing versus what you are hearing from Washington, because you are privy to a lot more specifics than anyone on this phone gets to hear. But maybe share with us some of that, that insight that you\u2019re getting from those channels.","David Farr","So a lot of projects we see in particular on the LNG world, from the perspective of these LNG investments need to go forward. There\u2019s been major commitments made from a lot of our customer base relative to around gas versus coal versus oil. From the standpoint of what we call less carbon, the carbon \u2013 they\u2019d been commitment. So from my perspective, these projects are going to go, they just a matter of what time they\u2019re going to go and when things get resolved.","And I firmly believe we will get things resolved relative to discussions to China. It could take a lot longer than my initial comments were always around August, September time period and now that\u2019s obviously off the table based on what we\u2019re seeing at this point in time. And so I firmly look at the projects, the under investment in the gas side, leaving the under investment in the liquids and some of the under investments in some of the downstream work that needs to be done because we definitely need that downstream product.","I see that those have to go forward. The question is when they get my customer base or our customer base gets visibility relative to where they can do these transactions and where they can sell and not sell, and you\u2019ll see these projects gone. Now, the other issue is if the projects in United States stall, then you\u2019ll start seeing some acceleration in projects in the Middle East, because of the demand for gas.","China\u2019s still going to grow. China is going to need gas or they\u2019re going to get it from the Middle East. They\u2019re going to get it from other parts of the world or they\u2019re going to get it from the United States. So as I look at right now, as I look out the next 12 months, I think as a customer base, we\u2019re all fine tuning a little bit. But if this thing dragged on for a long time, and let\u2019s say the long time being 12 months to 18 months, then I think you start seeing what you talked about this that self fulfilling prophecy.","And then we start whining backwards. But I think it\u2019s way too early to see that at this point in time. And maybe from my perspective things do get resolved sooner than we think. But at this point in time, it\u2019s prudent for me from the perspective where I\u2019m in the \u2013 we, Emerson on the pipeline, we need to dial things back after three quarters of very moderate growth in the automation business. We need to dial back and reset for a little bit growth in different of growth environment and look and see what happens rather than waiting, because we\u2019ve been waiting now for a couple of quarters and now it\u2019s time to ask.","That\u2019s where we sit. I\u2019m still, again, I\u2019ll say it, I\u2019m still optimistic. I still believe that the world needs it the energy, they need this type of products. The question is the timing of it more than anything else at this point in time.","Deane Dray","And can you add anything about the color from Washington?","David Farr","Yes. Right now nothing at all. I can\u2019t add anything other than what\u2019s going on is obviously very challenging negotiations and a lot of pushing back and forth. Again, I still believe this is something that\u2019s important and I do support it. It creates a lot of pain for me, and obviously for our company. But from my perspective, it\u2019s \u2013 I do support 100% of what we\u2019re trying to get done in Washington on the long-term trade benefits. But we\u2019ve got to get this thing done. We can\u2019t let this thing sit out there for another 12 months, 18 months dragging around, because it will definitely do what you talked about with some negative self fulfilling prophecies.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good afternoon, guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Dave, can you talk a little bit about this ballooning funnel of projects or I guess stuff that has been committed but not booked. How long do those typically stay out in that state? Is there any kind of leakage in that closed process where it\u2019s something where you think there\u2019s a commitment, but until the ink dries, it tends to back down. So how confident are you in that booking over the next few months, quarters, whatever?","David Farr","So if we look at the funnel where their funnel growing is growing right now, it\u2019s growing outside United States. So we\u2019re starting to see, we had not seen a lot of growth of the bigger projects outside the United States, primarily in North America driven large funnel project business. So we\u2019re now starting to see some of the international be at Asia, be at the Middle East, be in Latin America, where some of the larger projects are now starting to come into the funnel enhanced. That\u2019s why that funnel is getting a little bit bigger.","Now going back to the one but not both situations, the big issue for us is, it is like product that\u2019s been \u2013 food has been picked and put in the shelf. There is a shelf life. And from my \u2013 historically when we see this grow like this, we have seen it before. Typically that shelf life, you\u2019re looking at 12 months to 18 months on these projects, these are massive projects. These are projects typically they are going to last three, four, five, six years. So if they get delayed, 6 months to 12 months, if not unusual.","From my perspective, if you get out there past the 12 months, 14 months, 16 months and these things really start changing and nothing happens, then you\u2019re going to see so reconfigure. It\u2019s way too early to say that, because this number until recently it was pretty normal. And now with this number getting up or more $1.1 billion, close to $1.1 billion, it\u2019s starting to get to a number that\u2019s got my attention. And so I think the key issue for me is watch them and see what these customers start doing. These are a lot of gas projects and a lot of U.S.-based projects at this point in time. And so I think we got to watch it is nothing that don\u2019t get overreact to, but it \u2013 from my perspective, these things sit out there for 12 months, 14 months, 16 months, then you\u2019re going to start seeing a reevaluation of what\u2019s the magnitude of this project do we want to downsize it.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. So it sounds like we need to stay on top of that as a number to talk about. And then just looking at the projects that have shifted out of the pipeline, and I know that there\u2019s difference between orders and sales, but if I think about that $350 million shifting from 2019 to 2020 and the $450 million to 2021. You were already kind of losing maybe a point or two of sales as it pertains to that. You talked about kind of a two or three-point downshift. It seems like on the shorter cycle into that or some of the projects that are in this pipeline that, that doesn\u2019t assume a very a whole lot more downside. Does that just speak to no excess in the system or the absence of destocking or I guess why couldn\u2019t we decelerate more given that the project piece already speaks to maybe half of the deceleration you\u2019ve talked about?","David Farr","Yes. I think it\u2019s hard to measure on a couple of months on projects moving in and out, because they move a lot. Historically, we never gave that number and there was always a lot of moving, anyway, there\u2019s always a couple of hundred million dollar projects moving around. So I would say the number is a little bit higher than normal. To be honest, Josh, but there was always a number that moved in and out of a couple of hundred million dollar.","So now \u2013 so I think I would definitely say the movement higher than normal. So therefore I would say does adds taken about a 1, 1.5 off the underlying growth rate of the cycle right now. And that\u2019s the number we\u2019re going to watch and see if there\u2019s been a bigger movement from the next time we talk as we close out this calendar year that\u2019d be a good feel for it. I think you got to wait till the end of the calendar year if you get a good feel. But right now there\u2019s always noise and I would say it is about a point that\u2019s been taken off the underlying growth. And it\u2019s moved up a tad, but I wouldn\u2019t panic, yes, because there\u2019s always that number sitting in there.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Got it. That\u2019s good perspective. Thanks, Dave.","David Farr","Okay, good. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good afternoon, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So I just want to start with Commercial & Residential. So you guys have kind of guided for flat organic growth for the year. It implies a little bit above flat, maybe like 1% in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s a step up. Now I know you saw a little bit of improvement in July, which is encouraging. But I guess how much confidence do you have in that outcome and could there still be some risk to the downside there, particularly since the comp \u2013 beyond your comp does get a little bit harder in the fourth quarter.","David Farr","Yes. Definitely it gets harder because of our U.S. base last year. So there are a couple of things that we\u2019re watching very closely. One that the fact that China now and Asia-Pacific now has stabilized and come above the line that\u2019s a good sign for us. So my concern would not be there. My concern would be in the USA. If all of a sudden, this \u2013 we\u2019ve had a pretty good, what I would call heat wave, humidity wave go through, that would be my concern right now. Not in the AC side, but more on the retail side.","But we\u2019ve got it pretty, pretty well dialed down. I feel pretty comfortable about that. Europe seems to be coming back. Europe had a very challenging June, because it\u2019s extremely hot there, but it\u2019s bounced back nicely in July. So I feel pretty good that we\u2019re going to be around the 0% to 1% growth rate in Bob\u2019s business in the fourth \u2013 our fourth quarter, which is the third fiscal or third calendar quarter.","I think we\u2019ve got a doubt pretty close to where we see it right now. And the fact that July came in decently and the orders came in decently. Even I think that was the one month order pace positive, the one month order pace was positive. So its positive real close to that 1% I think. And so I think we\u2019re okay there, but we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ll people \u2013 we\u2019ll put our 8-K at orders and we\u2019ll keep a communication around those three things, Asia, China and North America and as you\u2019re keep holding in there for us. So those are the three things I\u2019m watching right now in Commercial and Res.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. Thanks, Dave. And then just on Automation Solutions, you talked about things getting a little bit better in July. I mean, maybe it\u2019s my eyesight, but the charges doesn\u2019t show a lot of improvement. If you could just talk a little bit more about the early stages of July and then what\u2019s driving that better result.","David Farr","I tell you what, after a tough June, if it goes ticks up a notch, it\u2019s better. And so I think what we were underlying with what 4.5% goes last quarter.","Tim Reeves","Right, 4, yes.","David Farr","4, so it picked up a little bit. You can\u2019t see that in a chart, because I probably had younger eyes, Nicole, come on. So it\u2019s a little bit better. What\u2019s interesting, it\u2019s not the U.S. We saw Asia, we saw China as probably the ones that something about China that\u2019s interesting. We saw a pretty good impact in China. We saw a good impact in Latin America. So our international markets actually grew order wise, I think double-digit.","And in North America, the U.S. business \u2013 Canadian business was still the weakness point. So our international held up nicely. And therefore that right now we see that holding up for the year. That will give us a little bit of momentum as we go into this. And I think we\u2019re going to bounce somewhere between 4% to 5% in this \u2013 in orders in this fourth quarter. So and July was not a short month, I think it was a fairly long month for us normally. And this month, and so it\u2019s a good representation of what \u2013 I think, what\u2019s going on in the marketplace. So I feel reasonably well about that 4.5% now. Given the fact, I thought we\u2019d be at 6% or 7%. I don\u2019t feel that exciting, but it\u2019s better than going to the other way, let\u2019s put that.","Nicole DeBlase","Definitely. Thanks, Dave.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Nicole. See you soon.","Operator","And our next question will come from John Inch of Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Afternoon, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Inch","Afternoon. So hey, the \u2013 I wonder if you could comment on the profitability of the large project pipeline. Is it accretive to the 16% AS margin run rate here?","David Farr","Typically large project will be 10% lower than that. And so what we do obviously a hybrid. Now you\u2019re talking about large. Now if you look at the, what I would call the smaller circles in there, the medium and small sized circles those typically are \u2013 those are accretive to us. So it\u2019s a bigger ones that are typically will be the lower-double digit or 10 \u2013 tied 10 times number there. So right now given the fact that projects have slowed down, the bigger projects does help us a little bit.","But I want to get those projects going, so we can get the installed base. But the mix of funnel right now, it looks pretty decent, because I look at that funnel, I mean if you look at that funnel we put out there, if you can see it. You can see there\u2019s a lot of small, medium size projects. The bigger projects, there\u2019s only one big project left in this year. And so that\u2019s a good mix. As I finish off the fourth quarter, going back to our comments on profitability and a good start for 2020. So based in that funnel that tells me I like the mix.","John Inch","So these deferrals aren\u2019t necessarily putting incremental price pressure on kind of the bid quote, that sort of thing. It\u2019s just a pure deferral, right?","David Farr","Yes, correct. Typically, if you have the chart in front of me, on Chart 11, if you look at the bigger bubbles, you probably even black or white, but I\u2019m looking at that big bubble sitting at the end of 2019. That\u2019s a fairly large project. That would typically be a price pressure type environment. When I look at the smaller, medium sized ones, typically those are going to be KOB2 \u2013 KOB2 type projects and typically those are projects you already have the install base. And therefore the profitability is going to be around that our margin or normal margin.","John Inch","And then Dave, just as a follow-up, your comments around doing some more bolt-ons, here to maybe supplement some of the earnings. Can you remind us what percent of your sales are, say embedded software. What percent might be standalone software? And would you be looking to kind of software \u2013 industrial software types of companies as part of your frame for doing more bolt-ons?","David Farr","Well, if you look at the acquisitions we\u2019ve done this year, a lot of them were software companies. And so the answer is, yes. So we\u2019re looking at \u2013 we did a lot of smaller \u2013 we\u2019re doing a lot of smaller deals this year and most of them have been tied around software, standalone software, embedded software. Again, that is a key issue for us. And we\u2019re trying to find the type of deals that we\u2019re doing for the [indiscernible]","Tim Reeves","We should slide at our investor conference $400 million standalone software on the As side and that doesn\u2019t include the embedded piece.","David Farr","It doesn\u2019t included. Yes. So we did $400 million. The standalone is about $400 million and then we have a lot of embedded, which we don\u2019t break out the systems business. But yes, if you look at the deals we\u2019re doing right now, there are lot less products, but they\u2019re more software based. And I think that\u2019s a common trend within this automation space as we drive into the control and drive it into the \u2013 to our customer base, around specific industries.","Again, it\u2019s not a lot of them out there. So you have to quarter for a long time. And we\u2019ve done quite a few this year. They\u2019re smaller. And the acquisitions to me are important relative to gives us opportunities to add sales, profits and as Frank points out, operations have to deliver the earnings and as soon as you plan to make them creative, but that\u2019s going to be a key issue for us to drive, we can get top line organically. We\u2019ve got to get them through bolt-ons and they\u2019ve got to deliver the profit.","John Inch","But it sounds like those deals would be more of the strategic nature, right, versus trying to find stuff that would supplement the earnings that\u2026","David Farr","Yes. Yes. Yes. When I talk about \u2013 okay, yes. Yes. Okay, I hope you\u2019ll take that. I\u2019m not talking about going out, I\u2019m talking about bolt-ons within our core business, within the core business of automation, within the core mix. I\u2019m not looking at going out and to do any type of acquisition to get sales, earnings and cash flow or EPS. Now these are within the core \u2013 clearly from my perspective, things really get slow, get to that stall speed. I think we\u2019re going to see opportunities for more of these smaller bolt-on deals coming forward. And we\u2019ve got to be very aggressive and going after them and figuring out how to integrate them pretty quickly to get little bit more growth in that 2021 time period, going back to the first question, somebody asked me early on, do we have a path to get the EPS closer to what we said back in February. Because the sales aren\u2019t going to be there right now, organically unless we have a big pop in 2021, so we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to \u2013 in bolt-on deals within our core space to that.","John Inch","That\u2019s a good point. Thank you. And I sent him to Canada.","David Farr","Calgary, Alberta, where\u2019s the worst mosquito problem.","John Inch","I think, it\u2019s everywhere.","Operator","Our next question today will come from John Walsh, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon.","John Walsh","I guess, maybe a first question around the hybrid markets. We\u2019ve heard a little bit of mixed commentary out of that market. Sounds like you\u2019re still doing very well there. Do you think it\u2019s because of your mix, because you\u2019re taking share just hybrid covers a couple of different end markets there maybe what we\u2019re seeing.","David Farr","Yes, exactly. So from our perspective, our hybrid business clearly, we\u2019re pretty strong into the life science. And so we\u2019ve had a pretty good run in the life sciences. From the perspective, I\u2019m not \u2013 in that hybrid space, we don\u2019t have automotive, we don\u2019t have semiconductor, we have the life sciences, we have some food and beverages. We have some mining in that. And so that\u2019s been doing pretty good for us. The food and beverage has not been that strong for us, but it\u2019s primarily been the life sciences and the mining area that has been good for us relative to our hybrid business.","John Walsh","Got you. And then maybe just as a follow on, I think in maybe to Jeff\u2019s question earlier around margin levers. I think you said, price cost will be positive again in the fiscal Q4, but how do you think about that kind of price cost balance, as you run it forward?","David Farr","Right now, the key issue for us is, commodities have come down, excluding any additional aggressive tariff action other than the 10%, which is not primarily aimed at us, industry is more of a consumer care approach. I think, our price cost balance going into 2020 right now is pretty good. It\u2019s green. Now those things could change and those are the things we have to deal with. But last year at this time, you thought about tariffs were coming in, we had material still going up. People thought we\u2019re going to see faster growth. And so we are looking at a little bit different type of place in our environments. So this time, it\u2019s moving in the opposite way. And the key issue for us is to keep our costs in line and obviously make sure we have price discipline around the price cost. But right now as we look at the early stages of 2020, it\u2019s green and we feel good about it and should be okay as we start the year out.","John Walsh","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","David Farr","All the best, John.","Operator","Our next question will come from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Maybe a first question on Automation Solutions in China. You\u2019re coming up to the end of what\u2019s been a very good three year up turn. Historically, my guess this industry in China tends to have three or four year up turns and 18 month downturn. So just wondered how you\u2019re assessing the market outlook in China, in terms of that risk of turning down next year. And whether you\u2019d seen any more evidence of U.S. companies, perhaps being pushed down the priority list on orders, which is something I think you\u2019d mentioned back at EPG.","David Farr","Yes. So on the cycle through this month, the cycle is still pretty good. We\u2019re looking at a very solid 8% to 10% Automation Solutions orders growth and sales growth. As I look at the industries, we\u2019re serving, there\u2019s a lot of industries that Chinese customer base is trying to become more self sufficient and so obviously less imports of final goods. So that\u2019s where they\u2019re aiming their investments. I do not see that changing as we move into 2020. As my initial look at 2020 right now for Asia or for China is, the 8% to 10% most likely is going to turn into, let\u2019s say, six to eight, maybe five to eight type of growth.","So we\u2019re looking at a slower growth to your point, Julian. But I\u2019m not looking for that drop off yet, because they have not, they really haven\u2019t finished building out what they need to build out relative to the infrastructure. They\u2019re trying to become more self sufficient in the industries we serve. Relative to \u2013 what I called nationalistic tendencies for the Chinese relative to foreigners. It\u2019s not just U.S. companies, it\u2019s all companies. I mean, it could be European companies too.","The trend has continued for the standpoint we\u2019ve seen some pressure points relative to some of our customers being pushed about, you need to look at alternative sources not just foreign companies sources via European or American. I think that trend will continue as long as trade discussions are underway. And hopefully, the trade discussions will be finalized before, the foreign companies are really pushed to a smaller piece of the marketplace. Right now, obviously, we\u2019re still okay, but it\u2019s something that we spend a lot of time. We have people going in and supporting our customer organization \u2013 our sales organization, our customer\u2019s organization. Lal Karsanbhai was just here, Mike is going in next week.","And I\u2019ll be going in about within a less of the month. So we\u2019re spending a lot of time with our sales and with our customers. Because we\u2019re very concerned about the negative trends of nationalism and clearly it\u2019s something we\u2019re fighting. Right now, I haven\u2019t seen anything, I mean, there\u2019s a little bit more, but not astronomical more or we would not be growing as we\u2019re growing right now.","Julian Mitchell","Very helpful, thanks. And then my quick follow-up would just be around your assessment of inventory levels among your channel partners and customers. How much destock do you think is needed across automation and CNRS?","David Farr","It\u2019s still too high. Given the fact that \u2013 if look at Emerson\u2019s inventory, with the slower June, our inventory did not come down as it normally would in June. So we\u2019re a good indication of that. Julian, I mean \u2013 there\u2019s a balance sheet out there. So you could see, our inventory level did not drop like normal from quarter-to-quarter. And \u2013 from my perspective, as I look at the channel right now, I think \u2013 I thought the channel would be done by the end of this third calendar quarter. I think, we\u2019re going to be well into the fourth calendar quarter before that destocking is done.","And we sense that, people are being very cautious and so I think, it\u2019s going to take a little longer. Because the demand is weaker, therefore the demand is not going to drive the destock and it\u2019s going to have to take it down very slowly. That\u2019s how it looks to me.","Julian Mitchell","Great, thank you.","David Farr","All the best to you, Julian.","Operator","And our next question today will come from Robert McCarthy of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Robert McCarthy","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for fitting me in.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Robert. Clearly may the cut offline, I mean\u2026","Robert McCarthy","I guess, we\u2019ll see in Arkansas a little bit later in the month, right, in any event. The first question, Dave, obviously you\u2019ve been focused on niche and bolt-ons, particularly in discrete side and kind of make your number over the longer term. But the question remains in a down cycle, you might have opportunities to look at other larger properties. How do you think of the state of the balance sheet from your ability to do a larger deal absent the use of equity? What is your outer bound at this point?","David Farr","From the perspective of deals we\u2019re looking at right now and we show the board, obviously, we made the decision to do a little bit more share repurchase. From the standpoint, our deals, our acquisitions this year, where it\u2019s not going to be as high there. First say the, first six months, we didn\u2019t see the pipeline being strong. So we\u2019ve made the decision to a little bit more share repurchase. Now, clearly we started this process before the stock get whacked in all the trade discussions, but if I look at our leverage point, we can do a $4 billion or $5 billion type of transaction and completely around that debt to EBITDA margin of up a little bit over that. So we have plenty of room and there\u2019s not a lot of $5 billion, $6 billion, $7 billion, $8 billion deals out there. So I think we could get through the key issue is, Frank knows, as we\u2019ve got to obviously dial back share repurchase a little bit. And then we had actually demonstrate to the rating agencies that we\u2019re going to get our ratios back now, which we have in the past.","Frank Dellaquila","Yes. I mean, Rob, there\u2019s nothing that we can reasonably foresee that would cause us to contemplate issuing equity. We can do everything within the balance sheet that we can foresee.","David Farr","The type of deals we see \u2013 the biggest type of level deal, we\u2019d see as a $4 billion, $5 billion. So we show the board that ratio as we go through this whole process of capital allocation, which we did last month, our last June \u2013 in June. And also we did today and we did in the finance committee this morning with Frank. And we are comfortably well within the brand of acquisitions we see an ability to continue to do pretty good level with the share repurchase and have the opportunity to do the deals if necessary.","Robert McCarthy","Two smaller questions, if you\u2019ll forgive me. One, CapEx assumptions going forward, have we put a cap on that or a modest reduction on that given what you\u2019re seeing in the prevailing environment. And then number two, any sideways look at kind of the midstream and refiners intentions around IMO and whether they\u2019re going to look to build capacity for the low sulfur distillate or what is the intentions for spending there if you could share any.","David Farr","Yes. Relative to capital, we\u2019ve scaled capital back this year. We\u2019ve asked, we\u2019ve had sessions here the last 60 days. So capital this year is going to be around $600 million. From the standpoint of next year, we have to take capital up. We have, as I\u2019ve said, I think in 8-K and also in the press release. We have some issues from our standpoint of \u2013 as we\u2019ve now had some on the acquisitions for two or three years. We are now doing the optimization of where we want to do some best cost manufacturing.","So we have some investments that we need to make in 2020 getting ready for actions we want to take in 2021 and 2022. So from my perspective right now, our capital spending for the next couple of years are probably up around the 3.5%, 3.6% level, as we prepare for this move into this \u2013 sort of better manufacturing locations and then allows us to move as we go into 2021 and 2022. So, we\u2019re evaluating everything around the capital structure right now. Do we need to do it in 2020 or can we push it out. But I \u2013 if I look at the numbers right now, because of what we see the needed for 2021 and 2022, we will be taking capital back up in 2020 little bit higher than it as this year.","And I think same thing will happen 2022. So we try to balance this. We spend money all the time, as you well know, but I\u2019m shaving it now and then we\u2019re going to have to put some money back in next year.","Robert McCarthy","And then the on IMO real quick.","David Farr","I don\u2019t have, I can\u2019t give you more insights. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talk in recently about that. I do know by look at the project investments on the refineries today and KOB2. It\u2019s still pretty high on the list of projects we\u2019re going after and projects we\u2019re winning. But I\u2019ve never \u2013 I can\u2019t give you a specific number to say, these guys, yes, they\u2019re going to keep doing it, they\u2019re going to take it up. But I can tell you right now, my folks that tell me the field refining bidding is still going on. So they appear to me moving forward and spending in the space. That\u2019s what I see at this point in time now. Will that be something they scale back if they really start scaling capital back later this year, as they move to 2020. But if I look at the project list right now, there\u2019s a lot of good refining type of projects out there.","Robert McCarthy","Thanks for your time, David.","David Farr","Okay. Take care. You\u2019re forgiven for ask them two and half questions.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Farr","Hey, Joe. How you doing? I was trying to Rob, before you got off and tell me \u2013 you tell her \u2013 tell Hail Mary\u2019s couple of hours prayers. But Rob ran off to the church too quickly.","Joe Ritchie","He\u2019s already doing them, Dave.","David Farr","Yes. How you doing, Joe?","Joe Ritchie","Doing great. Great. Thanks for fitting me in. So obviously, you look the backdrop is challenging or it\u2019s been a little bit more challenging than we all expected. I guess, at what point do you guys think about revisiting your longer term targets for 2021. I know, it\u2019s still ways away and lot can happen between now and then. But how are you thinking about that now just in light of the backdrop being a little bit more challenging?","David Farr","As we told the board \u2013 we had a board meeting today as we told the board today, we\u2019ll, grind 2020 here for the next three months. And during that process, we\u2019ll grind 2021 at the same time, because of this very issue of \u2013 the things slowdown is a bump \u2013 could it be bump in 2021, as we grind what we hear from our customers as they finish their calendar year. So we\u2019re going to be going through a two year window here basically, because of that issue. Going back to question, it\u2019s just a pause and then acceleration or is this going to be a grind in stall speed and then things really slip away as we go into later 2020 into 2021. We\u2019ll be doing that here as we finish this year out. And then we have a very good view by the time we finished the calendar year 2020 or 2019. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to go at right now. I want to get a feel for my customers. Am I being too cautious or am I being realistic. And so we\u2019ll get a feel for it.","Joe Ritchie","Yes. I mean it sounds like potentially maybe an update then by the Investor Day next year.","David Farr","For sure. For sure. I will not lose \u2013 leave this calendar year without myself have an update and communicate my board. So I have a sense, because I do go out and talk and I want to make sure I\u2019m not looking at some crazy thing for 2021, that doesn\u2019t make sense. I got new Investor Relations guy and I can pin the other guy and blame him for all that crap and so, there works job, you\u2019ve see some Investor Relations guy. Never to be surface to get. It seems better good one, seems better good one, I have to tell you, he is a good guy.","Joe Ritchie","If I could fit maybe one more in, I thought your comment\u2026","David Farr","You could fit one more in.","Joe Ritchie","I thought your commentary Dave earlier on, seeing a slower like U.S. Gas\/Canada Gas environment was interesting. I\u2019m just wondering like, do you think the trade environment is impacting off take agreements from happening with Asian partners and that\u2019s impacting LNG investment. Or what is it that you see that\u2019s kind of driving that slower gas investment here in the U.S. and Canada.","David Farr","100% trade discussions, 100%, because that\u2019s once will not move forward in North America. And I\u2019ve told the White House there, I\u2019ve told anybody in Washington is that they will not move forward. Because the \u2013 our Asia in particular, China need these \u2013 needed to off take, the processing, semi-process stuff. And without some agreement, these investments will sit there. Now they can move forward pretty quickly, because of where they sit, but without the agreements going forward in some clarity around the trade discussions between the United States and China. These natural gas investments will not move forward. Because even if 50% of that investment is going to be for exporting, 50% internally, your whole process is going to change.","So that\u2019s very important. So I think what I see in Southern Texas and Southern Louisiana, and it goes back to my comment about, they\u2019re going to sit there for a while for 12 to 14 or where that number is and then they\u2019ll make that call relative to we reevaluate or do we go back to the drawing board?","Joe Ritchie","That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Hi, how are you? Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on your investment strategy, because I know part of the strategy was to investment service capability, flow control capability, also discrete investments to sort of update the product. So how should we think about your internal investment product processes given to slow down?","David Farr","We\u2019re going through a very serious prioritization of where we\u2019re going to go on the investment and the discrete through the investment around the GE bolt-on acquisition and invest between our process side and the ovation side, the power side. That\u2019s very important to us. And we\u2019re going to try \u2013 we\u2019re going to figure out how we get that done over the next two years, as we planned originally. On the service side, given the opportunity we\u2019ve been seeing in KOB3 and I think KOB3 will come in at a very good number this year, because we\u2019re trying to keep that number well above 50% in that cycle. We\u2019re going to figure out how we can continue those investments going and that stopped them. But again, it goes back to a reprioritization of what we can do and we cannot do.","And I would say in my discussions will allow and my discussions will run, the OC members. That\u2019s one area that I would say, we need to figure out how to protect. Now we may modulate a little bit Andrew, but that\u2019s an area I think we continue to have opportunities for growth and penetration for the long-term. And I don\u2019t want to be short cycle, blinded and missed this opportunity. So I think you\u2019re going to see us continue to modulate and continue to move forward in that area. It\u2019s been very good for us so far.","Andrew Obin","Thanks. And just a follow-up question, you always have a very good sense of what Global Macro is doing, what Global GFI doing, et cetera. Just looking at the world today, what would you guess as U.S. GDP and China GDP are growing at right now?","David Farr","U.S. right now is growing low-2s. I think there\u2019s \u2013 I think, it will continue to slide again. You could easily go below the 2 at this current point in time until we get some clarity around trade, it actually go below that 2 level next years \u2013 we move into next year. I think China is continue to grow, but I think it\u2019s more of a like a 3 % or 4% type of growth rate in China. And we seem pretty good pockets of growth. And if Bob\u2019s business, the commercial residential business has back to back, you say, two or three or four months of slightly positive growth that tells me that things have stabilized.","So the global economy is definitely slowed. And from my perspective right now, we\u2019ve got the Feds around the world and trying to figure out how to keep that growth rate up from hitting the stall speed. But the trade issues right now are quite a big negative and being pushed back that growth rate down. So that\u2019s the key offset and going on at this point in time.","Andrew Obin","Thanks a lot Dave.","David Farr","All the best to you. Take care.","Operator","And our next question will come from Deepa Raghavan of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Deepa Raghavan","Good afternoon, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Deepa.","Deepa Raghavan","Automation Solutions, Dave, so China continues to invest in infrastructure and that\u2019s been helping a lot of companies there this cycle. But what are some of the verticals within AS, that have been performing better than you\u2019d have thought in that region. And which are the ones that are losing some steam versus your expectations? I have a follow-up after that.","David Farr","So you\u2019re talking about China and specific Deepa, that we\u2019ve said there China.","Deepa Raghavan","Yes, China Automation Solutions, yes.","David Farr","Yes. So from the power standpoint, we\u2019ve seen China lose some steam that they\u2019re underperforming, I thought they would underperform. There\u2019s been a shifting around of priorities within the power industry. So that one has underperformed inside China from what I thought would happen that\u2019s earlier this year. On the \u2013 so the chemical side, I think, that process I\u2019ve seen those are held in there pretty well nicely, some of the refining investments that held in there pretty nicely. I would say that, if I look at some of the pipeline investments, they\u2019ve held in there pretty, pretty well. In the beginning of year, I believe if I went back and looked at when I gave a first forecast in China and we were talking around a 6% to 8%, 9%or something like that, 6%, 8%, 10% \u2013 8% to 10%.So that\u2019s basically where we are right now. So I would say chemical is little bit better, power is little bit worse and refining is little bit better. So that\u2019s where it is. We\u2019re pretty close to where we thought we would be. And it\u2019s \u2013 as you said, it\u2019s shift around industries a little bit. And that\u2019s how I see it right now.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Thanks for the color. My follow-up is on cost controls. Are you taking costs down along the verticals that are weak? Or is that more broad based across Emerson?","David Farr","Broad based across Emerson. So we\u2019ve set in motion Bob\u2019s business in the commercial residential Bob Sharps, he\u2019s gone through its process with his team and looking at places that we can take out layers, we can take out in situations \u2013 not necessarily needed anymore. Lal is doing the same thing, we\u2019re trying to accelerate some of the integration and some of the acquisitions and we\u2019re looking at the corporate structure and the same thing.","So we\u2019re looking at areas that from the standpoint of things we can do simpler without as much overhead. We\u2019re trying to figure out how to do that right now and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going at it. So it\u2019s very people focused in the near \u2013 that we started in April and we\u2019ll run all the way to in this calendar year to make sure, we have things tuned the way we want them tuned for this type of environment.","Deepa Raghavan","Great, thanks very much. Thanks for fitting me in.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome, Deepa.","Operator","Our next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.","David Farr","Gautam, you\u2019ve got the last question. You just got \u2013 you barely [indiscernible]","Gautam Khanna","Well, lot of questions have been asked and answered. One thing I was curious about is the June board meeting, I\u2019m just curious what the high level framework is on buybacks. I recognize the 250 you mentioned in Q4, but is there an appetite if there\u2019s not much in the way of M&A over the next 6 to 12 months to really pump the repurchase activity higher?","David Farr","I don\u2019t think \u2013 we show the board a range of \u2013 what we see cash flow doing, what we see our capital allocation from the standpoint \u2013 from the balance sheet, the leverage we have. We try to keep enough flexibility. If we had to do several medium larger site types of deals being \u2013 a couple of billion to $3 billion, $4 billion. So I think that right now the board feels very comfortable in this range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion per year in share repurchase. Assuming that the deal, whether we\u2019re looking at is moderate of somewhere between $0.5 billion to $1 billion per year. If we alter that and we start moving back into that $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $2 billion, you would see as modulate back down towards, I would say a little bit under $1 billion in share repurchase.","So we show the board that flexibility, but I don\u2019t see if the deal would really \u2013 it\u2019s not going to stop. And I mean, I don\u2019t see us pop and everything, all our capital into share repurchase. I think, we\u2019ve consistently bought stock back over the years. As Tim knows, it\u2019s close to 300 million shares that we bought back over the \u2013 since 2000.","Now the net impact not quite that high, but we bought back 300 million shares. And so we consistently are in the marketplace, but I don\u2019t see us changing the strategy of buying on a consistent basis. And I think the board feels very comfortable in a 750 to $1.5 billion based on what our acquisitions is. Hence, that\u2019s why we talked the board about taking up a little bit higher this year. And now with 2020 hindsight, the fact that the market\u2019s gotten weaker, it gives us some flexibility by some of reasonable prices.","Gautam Khanna","Appreciate the color, thank you.","David Farr","Take care, Gautam. I want to thank everybody for your time. I appreciate it. As you guys know, I try to be very candid about what\u2019s going on. And I do want to let you know that Rocket\u2019s one year birthday is today and doing is about five, I think he\u2019s four months old. And Doon is a little bit different than Rocket. Doon is a little bit more aggressive. And so Rocket and Tim go together. I got to get a breadth of Investor Relations guy now. So that\u2019s what it is. I want to thank everybody for your time and I want to thank the organization for everything you\u2019ve done and will continue to do for the company.

During today's presentation by Emerson's management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, November 7, 2017.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today is available on Emerson's most recent Annual Report and on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","[0GL7XZ-E Tim Reeves]","Thank you, Keith. I'm joined today by David Farr, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the fiscal year summary, as shown on page three of the slide presentation.","We had a strong second half and finish to 2017 as demand strengthened in key served markets and economic conditions improved in most world areas. Our full year results exceeded growth and EPS targets communicated at our Investor Conference, and exceeded the updated EPS guidance provided on our Q3 earnings call.","Underlying sales growth was 1% in the year. Reported sales grew 5% to $15.3 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisition, which closed on April 28. Profitability in the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, was solid. EBIT margin expanding 70 basis points to 17.9%. Adjusted earnings per share increased 8% to $2.64, excluding $0.10 of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges.","Finally, solid earnings in trade working capital performance resulted in strong operating cash flow generation of 8%, and free cash flow of $2.2 billion, reflecting 130% conversion of net income and a new high for Emerson's 14.5% of sales. In 2017, we completed our 61st year of consecutive dividend increases and returns $1.6 billion of cash to shareholders.","We closed out the year with September trailing three months underlying orders up 11%. We're encouraged by the continued strength in orders and note that these trends are consistent with expectations communicated at the Electrical Products Group Industry Conference in May when we laid out our top line expectations for fiscal 2018.","Turning to slide 4. In the fourth quarter, demand remained favorable across both platforms, and the company delivered 3% underlying growth. Reported sales grew 13% to $4.4 billion, including the results of the Valves & Controls acquisitions. Sales were negatively affected by the hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida, and we expect to recover these sales over the next 12 months. Adjusted earnings per share was up 12% at $0.83, which includes Valves & Controls operations, but excludes $0.06 of first year acquisition accounting charges.","Turning to slide five. Profitability in the quarter was affected by the Valves & Controls acquisition, excluding both the first year acquisition accounting charges as well as dilution from operations. Gross margin was down 40 basis points to 43.2%.","This decrease was driven by the declining ClosetMaid business, which was divested early in October, and by unfavorable mix as disruption resulting from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. EBIT margin increased 130 basis points to 19.7%, driven by the benefit of restructuring investments and lower restructuring spend in the quarter.","Turning now to slide 6. In the first half of fiscal 2017, underlying sales were down 1%, with strong demand in many commercial & residential solutions end markets, offset by slower global automation investment. Industrial business spending began to pick up in the second quarter as oil and gas prices stabilized and global economic conditions began to trend favorably. Full year 2017 underlying sales were up 1%, with reported sales up 5%.","In the fourth quarter, we saw a continued strength in most world areas, with emerging markets up slightly and mature markets up mid-single-digits. Growth was led by North America, including robust growth in Canada and, Asia, where sales in China continued to be very strong and began to run up against tougher prior year comparisons.","Outside of China, the rest of Asia grew low-single-digits in the second half, a reversal of first half performance, supported by improving demand in automation end markets. Middle East and Africa region was down in the year and in the quarter, but orders here have turned positive.","And turning now to slide 7. Total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 150 basis points to 21.5%, driven by the benefits of restructuring actions, lower restructuring spend and leverage on higher volume. Corporate and other charges increased $57 million, due to $56 million of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges. $44 million of this total related to inventory revaluation, which is charged to cost of goods sold, and $12 million is related to backlog amortization, which is charged to other deductions.","We increased capital spending in the quarter 21% to $176 million, reflecting our more positive outlook on the global business environment. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 90 basis points to 14.4% during the quarter, driven by execution around inventory management and accounts receivable collections.","Turning to slide 8, Automation Solutions. September three-month underlying orders were up 15%, supported by energy-related life sciences and chemical markets, with KOB 3 demand continuing strong through the quarter and an increasing mix of KOB 2 small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion, upgrades, and optimization of existing facilities.","Our underlying sales grew 3% in the quarter, and net sales grew 18% to $2.9 billion, including results from the Valves & Controls acquisition. Underlying sales growth of 10% in North America was supported by continued investment by shale customers, midstream upgrade and automation investments, and strong growth in Canada, reflecting a recovery in unconventional oil and gas investments.","The Control Systems and Solutions business returned to growth in the quarter, reflecting investments in small and mid-sized system projects. Latin America remained down and has not yet begun to recover. Middle East and Africa was down but underlying sales \u2013 underlying orders here have turned positive.","Our funnel for tracking large projects continues to grow, and we expect to have better visibility on timing of these projects in the first calendar quarter of 2018 as our customized \u2013 as our customers finalize capital budget plans for the year.","Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 300 basis points to 20.2%, reflecting the flow-through of benefits from restructuring actions, lower restructuring spend, and leverage on higher sales. In 2018, we expect strong KOB 3, an increasing mix of KOB 2 projects to drive 5% to 7% underlying growth.","Turning now to slide 9, Commercial & Residential solutions. September three-month underlying orders were up 5%, led by broad-based demand in Asia, as well as continued strength in professional tools in oil and gas and construction-related markets. Sales increased 4%, with underlying sales of 3%. North America underlying sales were down 1% due to cooler summer temperatures and the impact of hurricane disruption during the quarter. Growth of 14% in Asia was led by China air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Excluding China, the rest of the region was up high-single-digits in the quarter.","Margin declined 110 basis points to 23.5%, excluding the divested ClosetMaid business, margin was 24.7% and declined 60 basis points when compared with the prior year on the same basis. The decline was driven mainly by mix as cooler weather and disruption from hurricanes slowed higher-margin compressor replacement business. In 2018, we expect continued favorable end markets to drive underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%.","Let's turn now to slide 10 and walk through our 2018 outlook. With an improving global economic picture and momentum in our key served markets, we expect underlying sales growth of 4% to 6% next year, with Automation Solutions underlying sales of 5% to 7%, and Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales of 3% to 5%. Our operating cash flow target is $2.8 billion, and we expect to convert free cash flow at over 100% of net income, in part by leveraging the working capital opportunity we see at Valves & Controls.","Our adjusted EPS guidance is $2.75 to $2.95, or growth of 4% to 12%. Adjusted EPS excludes two items, $0.03 of Valves & Controls first year acquisition accounting charges related to inventory and backlog amortization; and $0.06 tax-related loss on the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business, which closed early in the first quarter and will drive a Q1 tax rate of approximately 40%. We expect Valves & Controls operations will be slightly accretive in 2018 including charges for our intangibles amortization and anticipated restructuring spend.","And now, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Tim. Welcome, everybody. And before I get into some other slides, I want to share \u2013 first of all, I want to thank all the people across Emerson after delivering a very strong year, outstanding year, strong growth at the top-line, strong order growth, as you saw in the second half of the year, very good performance relative to profitability in the margins, outstanding cash flow with our cash flow \u2013 the dividend \u2013 free cash flow to dividend ratio only being at 56%, which we, a year ago, we thought would be around 62%, so very good performance.","From my perspective, the people across this company rose to the challenge that we put on their back as we went through the repositioning effort, as we moved into early parts of fiscal 2017 and I'm extremely proud of it. As I look at where we see 2018 at this point in time, I see orders continuing to be at high levels. I will share a chart with you in a few minutes, saying that the preliminary October looked at 12% underlying growth for the total corporation, with Automation at 15% and Commercial Residential at 7%.","As I've also said to everybody over the last six months, as we've seen our order pace pick back up, particularly around the Automation Solutions, I want to make sure we understand the mix of this as we go through the last three months of this fiscal year, as we move into the January, February time period for a couple of reasons. One, our KOB 3, which is day-to-day MRO improvement of the facilities has been strong and continues to be the same pace. We're starting to see some of the KOB 2, which is smaller minor upgrades and our backlog is starting to build, our backlog built in the fourth quarter versus last year.","We expect that to continue to happen. I want to make sure we see a steady pace as we continue to see our orders pace stay strong and also our backlog builds and we see that mix of business as we see our customer base start telling us what their capital budgets are going to be. As you know, our capital budget for next year's going to be up nearly 15%. We're talking and planning to be from about $480 million to $550 million in capital, so we are investing in the company. And if you look at the tax reform bill right now, there's a lot of focus on encouraging people to spend capital.","So from my perspective right now, we're trying to be very careful relative to the pace of business, relative to our sales forecast. We have not changed the sales forecast, what I've been communicating now for several months, with the underlying growth rate of the total corporation in the 4% to 6% range; Automation Solutions in the 5% to 7% range; and Commercial Residential in the 3% to 5% range. I'll say it again, I want to see the pace of the orders over the next three to four months, I will then, at that point in time, upgrade the forecast and expectations that we see in our base business.","Clearly, the momentum is on our side right now, the order pattern is consistently stayed within that band and now, as I said, we from time-to-time will go at the high end of that band which we did in September, and we are there in October. I'd expect us to see some pretty good pace along those lines. From a standpoint of the cash flow and profitability, we will continue to have very good profitability in the base business. Looking at decent conversion across this company, in the 30s on a combined basis, as we look at the two businesses, again, I will refine that as I look at the mix of business and as we go forward, that makes a big difference.","Clearly right now, as the KOB 3 stays strong, KOB 2 starts coming in, profitability should be reasonable in the business. If we move towards that 7% type underlying growth rate automation or even better, then we're going to have start investing and to handle this growth in the top of business, so we'll be looking at all those trade-offs as we go forward. Right now, I feel good about where we sit at this point in time. Backlog building, orders good, world areas are all kicking in except for Latin America at this point in time.","Commercial Residential is running at extremely high levels at this point in time. Order pace still is good. Clearly, we have an issue relative to North America with the three hurricanes and also the bad earthquake down in Mexico. I fundamentally believe we'll work through that and that will be a positive for us. But again, we need to see what happens here as move into that season and they start replacing some of those units. But profitability, again, at Commercial Residential is pretty good. We are upping our restructuring in the Commercial Residential next year and some capital spending as we get ready for repositioning for capital, or for capacity, and also as we look at further consolidation across the Commercial Residential under Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann effort, and they're making great progress as you can see in the profitability and the cash flow.","Cash flow, I think, will be north of $2.8 billion. We put a number out there, $2.8 billion. I fundamentally believe that we'll be north of that. I also fundamentally believe our free cash flow will be conversion of around 120% to 125%. Again, those are different numbers than we put in the press release. This is where I feel we are at this point in time. We have a lot of momentum within the process of integration of Valves & Controls.","And for your information, and I'll share a chart with you in a few minutes, Valves & Controls orders for the month of October three month were all \u2013 (16:27) went positive. So we've been telling you that we felt they go positive, they went positive. And they went positive, as we continue to see the momentum across the organizations, as we share the synergies across our selling organization, our key accounts and we're getting into accounts that we never been in before and we're actually able to really start to really take advantage of the global network that we have in Automation Solutions, and Valves & Controls are now starting to see that momentum.","We're seeing great momentum of improving their on-time delivery. We're seeing momentum relative to the asset management. You already saw some of that in the fourth quarter in the cash flow that came through. Again, I want to commend the whole organization around Automation Solutions, including a lot of help here at the corporate headquarters as they work through cash and we're starting to see that cash come through and I think we'll see that go forward throughout all 2018. Feel very good about that and from where we sit at this point in time.","So, net-net, I fundamentally believe that the wind shifted. We have a couple of things we have to overcome. We'll give you a lot more details at our Investor Day in February, as we always do. But I'm giving you more insights to what we see at this point in time than we historically would in November.","We clearly have a couple of things we have to overcome, one of them being when we made the restructuring in Brazil last year in the first quarter, we got a tax benefit. It was the right thing to do as we repositioned our Brazilian organization for what we saw going on in Brazil. We got a tax benefit. We have to overcome that in the full year. We will do that and, obviously, really challenges us in the first quarter.","We also have lost the profitability from the business of ClosetMaid, which we did divest. And I'm glad we did divest. We've got that behind us and we, obviously, had to take a hit in the quarter as we booked that situation.","So fundamentally, I feel good about where we sit. So if you look at the chart 11 here and talk about as I look at where we are relative to what \u2013 the journey that we started back in 2015, when we announced in June 30, 2015 to reposition the company, which is a healthy process. We've built a very strong company. We looked out. We said, look we need to reposition this company and focus on two fundamental platforms, which we've done. We repositioned, got that done. As we moved into 2017, we talked about growth. We talked about improved profitability. We talked about improved earnings. We talked about improved cash flow.","And I fundamentally believe that we have moved through that phase in very strongly, and now we're moving into the next phase where people talk, hear me talk about getting back into a level of profitability to drive earnings per share in that $3.25 to $3.50 range as we talked about, I publicly talked about that around the 2020 range \u2013 in 2020.","I've also talked about trying to get back to the cash flow levels in that $3.3 billion level, which would get us below the free cash flow to dividend ratios of the low 50% into the high-40s. Again, very important relative to where we try to go. We have a very strong company this point in time. We have a very strong organization. We continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. And clearly, we'll talk about what we see going on with Rockwell in a few minutes, but that's not what I'm talking about now. I'm talking about the core company that continues to do very well and continues to create value and grow and have a great future as we move into that next phase of accelerating growth, accelerating growth in earnings and sales and also cash flow.","So if you look at 2012 \u2013 page 12, and you look at the leverage across the portfolio, if you think about the Commercial Residential Solutions business, we built this Commercial Residential business over time through strategic acquisitions, in fact, I worked on the Copeland acquisition as a very young planning expert in acquisitions back in the 1996 time period.","We've gone forth and we've invested in technologies that have a lot of internal growth. We've made strategic acquisitions. We've repositioned this from a pure component type of play to more of a solutions play. And under Bob's leadership, Bob Sharp's leadership right now, he continues to make investments in that next-generation of not only technology, but the solutions on a global basis that really drive the fundamental standards we need across this world relative to energy efficiency, refrigerants, and basically stewards of this industry, and we are a major player.","And we'll continue to make acquisitions relative to the technologies, relative to software as we continue to move up in this pyramid of solution. And you'll continue to see more of what we're trying to do, we actually talked about one with the board today relative to commercial solutions area and talking about that next-generation technology around control and around communications.","But very successful program of both internally development, investments, acquisitions, integration and creating us a very broad global solutions play around the Commercial Residential business and very strong Commercial Residential business today, running around $6 billion in size, with margins in and close to 24%, 24.5%, very strong business from that perspective.","If you look at chart 13, Automation Solutions. As you all know, I ran this business many, many years ago. I've been involved in doing acquisitions in this business. I've been involved in creating the whole process integration, including introducing Plantweb and the first control in the field products back in the mid to late 1990s, involved in making strategic acquisitions around the Westinghouse innovation, around buying companies like Daniel, buying companies around the various technologies, and so we built a very strong business from the sensors, the instruments, from the control, all the way up to data management, with the most recent acquisitions very much in the data management area. We build a very strong portfolio of technology, product leadership, solutions capabilities on a very global basis.","If you look at our marketplace today, we're fundamentally a leader in all the global marketplaces that we serve today, be it Europe, be it Asia Pacific, be it Latin America, be it United States on a very broad automation solutions capability around the process, we've got a very strong capability, very much built on a technology at the same time supplementing that with acquisitions and expectations of being able to do more in that area.","The final \u2013 the Valves & Controls acquisition we just recently did was a very strategic acquisition for us relative to bringing more capabilities, relative to bring a stronger solutions package for our customer and the integration's going well. We will continue to grow this business and we'll continue to improve the profitability and the cash flow of the business. And to-date, I feel very good of where we are and I fundamentally believe, as we close out the year, my hats off to Terry Buzbee, to Mike Train, and to Rob (sic) [Bob] Karschnia about the tremendous progress they've made in a very short time period. But clearly, they got a lot to get done in 2018, but the wind has definitely shifted at they're back.","But we really have built this strong foundation on core investments, acquisitions, going from all the way back in the 1970s, all the way up here to now to the 2017 and we'll continue to do that, so I'm very pleased with that.","If you look at how we created integrated solutions, Plantweb was something that I introduced as the leader of process. Many of you might remember, we had buses down in Houston ran around with Plantweb signs on kind of funky oranges and lime greens and bringing out the technology to Plantweb the first type of control in the field, the first industrial Internet of thing within the industry.","So we've been continuing to build from a foundation of products, the technologies, integrated solutions to problem solving to now the top quartile performance. We have been \u2013 our business is all about changing and creating capabilities for our customers.","And at the same time, helping our customers succeed, which allowed us to succeed, and we have continue to grow and prosper, and we've become \u2013 gone from a minor player in this industry to world's number one player in the process automation business. The time period that I've been involved with is going back into the mid-1990s to now 2018.","As you can see from the participation standpoint, we have continued to grow the business. We've continue to add in both acquisitions and penetration in market. We go through periods in this business, yes it goes up, yes it goes down. We just gone through a down-cycle, it's now starting to turn around. As we look at it right now, this market is now growing. We are continuing to execute along that.","We have a lot of new products, which is our core mantra within this industry. What we try to do is bring new products, new technologies out right when that market turns and the market starting to turn and we feel good about this marketplace. As we look at our automation business today as we move towards being $11 billion automation business in 2018.","And so we have a lot of opportunities here. I think we have continued capabilities of outperforming the market, continue to have opportunities through acquisitions, and we'll have continued capability of creating a very broad global solutions, at the same time, investing at levels that they are very significant compared to competitors in technology and innovation and setting the industry standards that we need to set to help our customers be stronger and more competitive.","If you go to chart 15, it's a chart that I actually showed back the first time in February 2016 in Austin, Texas. Showed it again last year, our fundamental discussion around be an automation business, be an automation marketplace, a very strong statement about we want to focus first going up that process, we're already in the hybrid marketplace, we're already in the discrete marketplace, but also move both up and across. The Pentair Valves & Controls clearly puts us down \u2013 coming down stronger in the process world. The Paradigm puts us stronger in the process world in the operations management and consulting world.","We have made investments and we'll continue to make investments over in the hybrid market and discrete market place. This is a strategy that we've been talking about. This is not a new strategy. We've been communicating this. I've been showing this chart to the outside world now for over two years and we'll continue to show this because this is a focus for us. And with or without Rockwell, we are very strong company and we will continue to make acquisitions within this space. We'll continue to grow in this space and be a player.","Our goals and our stated goal is to be a strong global automation supplier to this industry. And we'll continue to focus on that, and we'll continue to make the necessary investments internally and through acquisitions to make that happen. It has been a stated goal ever since our whole repositioning efforts has started from that day and going forward.","If you look at chart 16, the orders chart I talked about, you can see the map we laid out, the Electrical Products Group in May. We stayed pretty well within that band. And in September, we were at the high-end of it. October, I just said preliminary right now we're looking at 12% right at the tip of that. I expect us to continue to do well here in the next couple of months. But again I want to reiterate, I've been saying this now three or four months, five months, I want to see the pace of business, I want to see the mix of this business, I want to see the cut to the capital allocation coming from our customer base, that will tell me a lot about what is the momentum, what's the pace of this recovery.","Is this recovery a 7%, 8% recovery, is this recovery a 8%, 9%, 10% recovery, what is this? I fundamentally believe the recovery is going to spread out over two years. I think the recovery is going to be spread out over 2018 and 2019. But then, again, I don't control the recovery, the recovery is controlled by the market and what our customers have to spend.","The pace right now is very good. The order pace is very good. The comparisons will obviously get tougher, but we clearly have a lot of momentum on a global basis and it's not just one or two key markets as we started out earlier this year. Our backlog has continued to build. We're still not back to the September level as you see, excluding the Valves & Controls. But I fundamentally believe that our backlog will continue.","We are actually seeing very strong, what I call, KOB 2. These are minor expansions and upgrades. And not just the KOB 3 type of projects. The order pace that we started seeing in the last couple of months, I've seen that go up. It's one of the reasons our order pace is bumped up. I want to see the mix of that; I want to see where it's going to come from. But fundamentally, I like where we are right now, though the momentum is quite strong. Our new products are coming out very nicely and we are winning in the marketplace at this point in time.","If you go to chart 17, this is a chart that we're showing you the Final Control numbers, which is the \u2013 that's what we call the Fisher and all the other actuation put together, the Final Control business that Terry \u2013 that now Ram heads up, he's the Group President. Terry Buzbee, now Ram.","You can see the recovery has really taken off in that business. We've had strong momentum. Our estimated numbers are sitting there close to 20% in October. You could see, on a pro forma basis, together the numbers are around that 10% range and you can see that Valves & Controls actually have gone positive. And we see that momentum continue to build and we like where we sit at this point in time.","But the partnerships, the main valve partnerships, the broader market exposure, those are all happening. New key accounts, the areas that we thought that we could see happening are happening and I have a lot of expectations as the market recovers that we'll continue to move this forward. We will improve the profitability; we will improve the cash management.","You know Emerson can deliver on cash. We set a record this year of 14.5% of cash flow to sales, and it's a very good level. I mean there's couple of us in the industry that can do that. And \u2013 but it's a rare breed and we will have another good year in 2018. Clearly, the faster they grow the more cash we'll have to invest. But at the same time we'll also generate a little bit higher levels of profitability.","So before we \u2013 I move to questions, and I know you may have one or two questions, but just before I move to questions, let me address the proposal we made to rock Rockwell Automation to combine our two companies. Emerson, you know, has successfully repositioned its portfolio over the last two years. I just talked about it.","We've gone through phase one and phase two. We have two very strong platforms, Automation Solutions under Mike Train's leadership. The Commercial Residential Solutions under Bob Sharp's leadership. I like what I see with these two businesses. They're finding opportunities for growth, for profitability, that we had not seen before as we really focus hard on these two platforms. Both are performing extremely well right now and have very attractive growth outlooks.","As you just heard, I think that the underlying growth for the next couple of years going to look pretty good, and it's a function of what we see around the world. But I still like what we see. And most importantly, we have a situation going on in Washington right now, potentially, that could really accelerate investments and capital formation which will help a company like Emerson. It was from this position of strength and our two platform focus and with confidence \u2013 strong confidence in our future that we attempted to gauge with Rockwell for the long-term global opportunities, for stronger growth and stronger profitability between our two businesses.","In early August, we made a private proposal to Rockwell's board that valued the company to $200 per share in cash and stock, a significant premium to its unaffected market valuation at that point time. After that, proposal rejected, we followed up with a second proposal in early October for $215 per share in cash and stock which is a full and fair price based on public data information that we see today. The proposal will allow Rockwell and Emerson shareholders to benefit meaningfully from the superior growth in earnings, we believe, the combined company would achieve over the longer term.","Rockwell is a premier high performing well-run company with strong management, strong innovation, and employee base who we believe share our values and culture of execution and exceptional profitability. Very good company, a company we've always looked up to and really appreciated what they've done in the industry. Both companies provide engineering focused solutions and are leading the way on digitalization in our respective markets. We're market leaders in the end markets we play in today.","We continue to believe the combination of Emerson and Rockwell is compelling and highly strategic for the global automation markets for our customer base and for driving future technology for our customers for a long time. By leveraging the key technology platforms that are strengths of Emerson and Rockwell where these technology can mutually coexist and thrive. We would create an industry leader, better positioned in an environment where the global customer base is asking for a more integrated solution in the process world, in the hybrid world. The industrial logic behind this combination is very clear, in my mind and the board's mind. And the result would be a diversified company that's well-positioned to compete and thrive over the long-term and create value for our customers, our employees, and our shareholders.","Rockwell's management has for many years described to its shareholders the importance of process automation for future growth. Emerson has the scale and the best-in-class process automation Rockwell has been trying to build for many, many years. And we provide an immediate solution for this need with our number one global installed base and global position in solutions, service, and organization.","As our industry continues to consolidate to meet customer demand, we believe the opportunity to combine Emerson and Rockwell now is a timely, unique, and attractive proposition for both sets of customers, shareholders, and employees.","Looking across our competitive set, no two companies are a more logical fit than Emerson and Rockwell or provide a clear path to strengthen customer relationships and generate enhanced revenue and earnings growth for many years to come.","We are hopeful that Rockwell's board and management team will engage with us for the benefit of all stakeholders. But while we will be disappointed if Rockwell lets this unique opportunity go unexplored, we will remain disciplined in respect to price and we have a very viable strategic plan in place that we are highly confident as a company, as a leadership, and as a board as you've heard me discuss today and numerous times over the last 12 months.","We will not extend this proposal indefinitely without a clear signal that Rockwell and its shareholders are open to a mutual beneficial transaction. We'll continue to work with our advisors, JPMorgan, Centerview, and Davis Polk to find a way forward with this opportunity. However, Emerson is very healthy and prosperous company and we're very focused in succeeding with or without Rockwell.","That is all I'll have to say about Rockwell today. As I \u2013 and I'm sure you can appreciate, will be not taking questions on any acquisition proposal.","With that, I'll open the call to questions about the earnings results. A very strong close in fiscal 2017 and a look at 2018. I appreciate you understanding and honoring that because you will get \u2013 I cannot talk about it if you ask me. So thank you very much and I look forward to the Q&A section from our shareholders at this point in time. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And the first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Scott.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","I'm dying to ask about Rockwell, but I'm not going to because you...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You can ask me and I'll give those statements, if you want to just ask me, and I'll say, you know.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","I've got very thin skin, so. Anyway the question I want to ask this is.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You start your own company, it's because you got thin skin.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Just today, only today. If I got the stock right once in a while, my skin would get a little thicker, but anyways.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You can't get everything right, Scott, come on.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","I'm going to ask a roundabout question that isn't exactly Rockwell, but \u2013 and it's more about size of deals. And if you think in terms of, you've about bolt-on acquisitions and, even in hindsight, Pentair Valves business wasn't really all that big in the grand scheme of things. But are we to maybe take away from the Rockwell gig that you are comfortable putting together or putting out or looking at bigger stuff? And does it have to be automation? I mean, is there \u2013 would you invest in \u2013 I mean discrete automation, say. Would you invest in other kind of automation assets to get you to this maybe not the same exact place, but get you to a place that's a little bit different from where you're at right now in discrete?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I think that, from our perspective, as I communicated using that slide relative to the process automation and hybrid space, we are willing to explore significant acquisitions we've said it over the years in to expand that business presence around the hybrid space, around the discreet area. As we've gone through this whole repositioning effort, Scott, our focus is highly focused on automation as we define automation today in the Commercial Residential.","At this point in time, I think we have big opportunities, both small, medium, and larger opportunities. Clearly, with this type of transaction, move like we did with Rockwell it's a very compelling strategic fit between our two companies. I fundamentally believe organization today can digest larger strategic deals, but they have to be within these two spaces. We are very focused at this point in time. We think there's unique opportunities there and we'll continue to play that.","But from my standpoint, we move on after a certain point in time. We start looking at other opportunities which we have in our plate within the automation, but don't look for me and this management team and this board at this point in time to move outside these two spaces, these two platforms.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay, fair enough. And then just as a follow-on, I mean you talked about taking CapEx up 15% next year and oftentimes what we see is when CapEx goes up, kind of core expenses go up. I mean, do your operating expenses need to come up which is kind of a backdoor way of saying, are we going to see a full operating leverage in 2018 before \u2013 I mean, you mentioned after debt (39:20) cost back eventually, but I'm more particularly interested in that next 12 months or so?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From my perspective, where we are in this curve I'm interested in having appropriate leverage which means we've got to have a three in front of us. And...","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And the reason \u2013 yes, as you spend capital, now we've been planning and systemically stepping into the capital and I think we can manage that from the standpoint, as you know we don't really cut capital real deep nor do we go crazy on the upside, we just have a couple of larger projects that will be some big capital numbers which is, so it's not a lot of them, there's like three or four major capital spending projects, that we have a big chunk of that. So we could easily handle that and still have good leverage.","The key thing for me is I've been communicating outside as I've watched the Automated Solutions orders which have continued to do well double-digit. From my standpoint as I see that mix of biz happening, we start seeing growth rates of the first five then six then seven and seven-plus or eight then that's where we're going to have start triggering the investments that we need to support our customers on a global basis. So I think in the early stages, we want to see the appropriate leverage. And then, over time, we're going to have to take some of that leverage and invest it. But as we get into 2018, my sign is I want to have the appropriate leverage and the key thing for me right now is see the whites of the eyes of the growth rate, the top line. And what that means I want to see the Automation business going to the high-end of the range we gave you. I want to see Commercial Residential business moving towards that 5% which I think they can. And then we'll start saying, okay guys, how do we invest and maybe get a little bit more growth? But that's I'm in the period right now that I want to see it. I want to, if you've ever surfed, I'm going to ride at the front of the wave for a while here as we have been riding in the last six months. I do not want to ride behind the wave which means I would not have appropriate leverage.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","That's very clear. Thank you, Dave, and good luck with all the stuff.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Scott. And good luck with your company, too, by the way.","Scott Davis - Melius Research LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Thanks. Good morning, Dave and all.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good morning, Stevie. Are you free to talk now with your new firm, huh?","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Well, well, no views or opinions just questions still.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","So, Dave, I don't want to dive into Rockwell either than that Scott said but there's a question without Rockwell. If Rockwell does not happen as you've talked about in the past, what's your ability to either partner or just organically do something that's been so difficult to build on the discrete side and the hybrid side, can you make something work internally within internal organic investment and the right partnership that actually make a dent in that market?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think there are ways to do it outside a strategic fit like with Rockwell. There are ways to do it. There are through acquisitions and there are through joint ventures and partnerships. There are ways to do it. As we've looked at the process side as we continue to invest in the hybrid side, we know that in order for us to be successful in a good time period, we're going to have to do that. And so, that's why the focus is really picking up and we have opportunities, we talk opportunities again with the board today. And so I think that you'll see us that we'll be pushing there.","It clearly is a more building approach versus a very large one strategic move at one time but there are opportunities there and we have, as you can see, the return of sales growth and the probability and cash flow is allowing us to do to be go out and find these opportunities for us for the future. So I think we're in a good position right now. And I think the opportunities are out there and people see that we are very, very focused and very true to be a global automation house. Our customers see this and our competitors see this. And so I think that we're well-positioned to do more even outside if something didn't happen to Rockwell.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","And that product as well as installed base in technology?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, it is. It's across the board. I mean obviously, from the standpoint of, just in the hybrid and the discrete side, we need clearly some different channels, we need some different technologies and that's why you have to do the acquisitions or ventures. But I think we have the capability to do it internally, but I think to get there faster and get there on a timely manner and do it right for our customers, we will \u2013 most likely we'll have to do the right type of acquisitions or right type of joint ventures.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay, great. And then you talked about this recovery potentially being more of a two-year recovery and some of the things that you're waiting to see. How much of what you're seeing is sort of MRO catch up versus new capacity, upgraded capacity in the initial discussion? And when you think about that GFI growth that you normally talk about the kind of acceleration once you hit 4% or GFI hits 4%. How should we think about it in that context because it feels like we're right in the middle or right at the beginning of all this happening? So some perspective on that one...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We are definitely beginning to see and so what we're seeing right now as we look at the order pace and our sales pace over the last six months or seven months with Automation Solutions, it's heavily what we called the KOB 3 the service MRO type of base, what our customer base have had to reinvest and to improve their efficiencies, improve their quality, to improve their obviously safety. And we're now starting to see what we called the KOB 2 side where they're doing \u2013 starting to do some minor expansions. We fundamentally believe this recovery in the initial phases will be heavy on the KOB 3 and KOB 2 throughout all of 2018.","And what I'm trying to watch right now is the pace of the KOB 3 is pretty steady at this point in time, will accelerate a little bit more if there's more capital being allocated in the January, February, March budgets of our customer base. If that's the case and you're going to see more short-term investments, which will be good for us. And then we'll start to see in the KOB 2 minor expansions, which also help us late in 2018 and early in 2019.","I fundamentally don't believe the bigger projects will start happening to us. We're bidding on them right now, but they will not really start happening until late 2018 early 2019. But the pace of the recovery is pretty much similar to what we see in the past, except we have a customer base that I think are being a little bit more cautious. Now with the price of commodities, all sorts of commodities firming and go in the right way, we might see some acceleration. I also see my customer base getting more healthy from a cash flow standpoint. And so those are all good signs.","So I'm encouraged that we're going to see improve capital and reallocation towards the type of spending that we see in automation, which will be good for companies like us.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Okay. I'll pass it on. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Steven. Welcome back.","Steven Eric Winoker - UBS","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, I was wondering the Valves & Controls margin outlook, it looks like you had a little bit of negative EBIT in the second half of 2017 there. Do you think 5% is a good level for next year or kind of work and back to that by the second half of 2018 maybe?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I think we'll be better than that as we exit the year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","We'll still be running uphill in the first half of the year. But it should be when we lapped the thing, at the end of May, we should be accretive and we should be heading towards good high-single-digits as we go into the second half of the year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. From the standpoint of, I mean, we want to get double of that. We want a one in front (46:48) of that thing soon.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Again, that's operations that's without the amortization and then the restructuring is going to be lumpy. So we're building in the certain amount of restructuring in. But depending on how things develop, we might end up doing more next year, so we don't have a really good beat on that right now.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I like the pace. I like most of these guys doing a good job. The whole organization of Valves & Controls there with Final Control's getting engaged, and so I would say we're slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be right now. And what I'm looking for without the amortization and restructuring, I want 10% and then we'll go from there to 12%, and then we'll go there \u2013 I mean, that's what I'm looking for and so for the guys like Ram and your team out there, I'm thinking 10% for the year, and I'm sort of like a target-driven type of guy if you haven't figure that out.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Sounds like that would screen well against the EPS range. And then...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I communicate over the conference call as all the people listen to our conference, I got 80,000 people listening right now the conference call.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","You've given me stage fright. Hey, the free cash flow guidance looked again exceptionally strong, great conversion. As you transition out of fiscal 2018, is there a challenge in the near-term to holding the absolute levels of cash flow into 2019?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","If we have a continued improvement in our profitability, continued improvement in growth and with what we have with the Valves & Controls opportunities, in the Final Control area, I think we still have a good run of cash flow conversion opportunities both in 2019 and 2020.","I think if we map out and we look at how do we get to $3.3 billion of operation cash flow in 2020, we have to continue and convert well north of 100% and that's going to be a lot of that is getting the cash, basically $400 million, $500 million of cash that we see in the Final Control balance sheet right now converted into cash flow.","And I feel very good about it. We've done this over the years very well, and I think with a little bit of growth and improvement in profitability and investments we need to make there, I feel good about getting that $300 million to $400 million of cash flow over the next three years, and I don't think it's a one \u2013 I don't think it's a two year thing here. I think we've got several years of run with it.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You take care. All the best to you.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So just on \u2013 from a customer standpoint, with your key customers, are you hearing from the customers that it's important to have the full suite of offerings and solutions. And is this \u2013 have seen evidence of that, because we can't see that on our end and just curious if that's partly the motivating factor. I mean, obviously, there's clear reasons why this could came together. But just curious if there's any evidence from customers that they want this?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're seeing more and more requests on the larger projects in certain industries that they want to see an integrated solution both on DCS and on PLC and other type of control end-to-end customers, and particularly they're going into the industrial Internet of thing and they're more software, and they're more management control.","So we're seeing this requests both in the power industry, in the chemical industry, in the pharmaceutical industries. We're seeing this across the various industries these days, in oil gas. And so customers are asking for this. And I think that it is an opportunity for us in the United States to put two very strong players together with a strategic fit to create a better solution for our customers, and our customers are clearly asking for this.","I can find \u2013 I'm sure you can find examples of customers that are saying no, but I can find there's more customers saying yes. And so I fundamentally believe that this is the right thing to do for our customers to keep them competitive, to allow them to produce more efficiently, especially with the newer technology when they want to use less and less people out there. So the answer is, yes, we're getting asked.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as we think about fiscal 2018 guidance, can you quantify the sales that were lost in the quarter and how meaningful that could be for 2018? And then just on China for Commercial Residential Solutions, it was a great year in 2017. What's your growth outlook here with the comps being pretty tough?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. So, on the hurricane. So, I got all my friends out there, my auditors, my friends, and everything like that. My fundamental gut \u2013 and this is David Farr speaking from \u2013 see I only have 36 years of experience, business experience, so I'm a young kid compared to Tim. I think there is an impact around $30 million to $40 million in the quarter. It's not a huge number. And don't ask me to go audit that because I won't spend a nickel on it. This is just my intuition seeing what I saw from our customer bases and saw what went on in across the key markets. There was a lot of devastation and I want to thank my organization for rising up and helping people in their own company, but also people outside their own company, as we went through this tough time.","It will spread out over the whole year because it's going to be \u2013 it's going to take time, obviously, in the residential marketplace to rebuild. It will take time in the automation space and the projects that were delayed. So I don't think you can see a meaningful bump. I just know it's there and I know, over time, we will get that back. And I think we'll get that back over the next 10 to 12 months. And so, it's a positive wind to our back that's all I can say to you there. Now let's go to China.","We had it very good in China. We grew in total, I think, a little over 10% globally for the whole year, what was that \u2013 what was the number for the whole year, Tim? I know \u2013 Tim doesn't have 36 years of experience in this industry, so still looking at the book. I mean he's taking awhile. What did we grow in China?","[0GL7XZ-E Tim Reeves","Hold on, 15.4%.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","15.4% for the whole business for everybody. So from my standpoint this year, as I look at the momentum we see in orders and Automation Solutions and opportunities still on Commercial Residential, I'm looking in the high-single-digit. It will be a lot tougher. But I will be disappointed if we don't approach the 10%. We may not get to 10%, but basically what I'm seeing the activity around Automation Solutions and orders based on what I'm hearing early stages out of the Commercial Residential, it's going be tougher. But I still think that we're going to be looking at \u2013 I think we're going to be in that 8%, 9% 10% range, still a good year. And we do well in China, as you well know. I'll be there next week.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You take care. Great talking to you, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave, and gang.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rob. Where you're hiding out today? You hiding here in St. Louis, or where are you hiding out?","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Suitable undisclosed location like Boston. In any event, since we can't talk about Rockwell \u2013 so we can't talk about my favorite topic, Rockwell. Let's just talk about \u2013 maybe you can talk about incremental margins over the next couple of years from Automation Solutions given the fact that you have two scenarios, one which kind of a stair-step of growth and the other maybe more explosive growth which will lead to more investment and the relative mix. But how do we think about kind of incremental margins structurally in that business over the next couple of years and maybe take into account the accretion such that it is Valves & Controls?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What we've been talking to the team about internally on this, I want to get back to 19% over the next couple of years here by 2020. That means that so incrementally they're going to have to be in the 30s as we go forward here. Some of it's going to be, obviously, the improvement of Valves & Controls, some of it will be across the other businesses. But even with what I would look as a good recovery, a very solid recovery, I fundamentally believe we can get back into that 19% by 2020. Now, as you know, we peaked close to 21% in this space, clearly with Valves & Controls, it's going to take us a lot to get back over that 20%. But I fundamentally believe that we can get back to 19% within this next three-year window. And we'll get into that \u2013 into with the opportunities that I see there. I don't see why we can't do it. I mean it's \u2013 we should be able to do that.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then, just as a follow up on Valves & Controls. Obviously, one of the potential strategic value that could be coming out of it is, obviously, reversing some of the under-penetration you had in the Kingdom. And you did travel over to Saudi, I think, with Trump and \u2013 The President, excuse me, in May. But how do you think...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You should be more respectable there. Come on, I mean, I...","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. No, no. El Presidente.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. It's hurting me, Rob. Not just \u2013 I'm the Chairman, you know, what I'm saying.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But in any event, you have been over there, but obviously we've had some pretty interesting kind of Game of Thrones headlines over there. I mean how do you think about in the context of maybe getting share back there, the outlook for the Middle East? And then, where do you see the risk on the geopolitical side as well, given the fact that you've been in the region recently?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","A couple of things. One, we are making headway. We have been given approvals to be able to sell back and come off the list to sell our full product offering in the Kingdom. I will be back in the Kingdom in January. We are opening a whole new innovation center right there in support of Aramco. And \u2013 so I'll be in there meeting with the CEO of Aramco and talking to them.","Our capabilities are well respected and known within the Kingdom and what we have to offer. They fundamentally understand that our processes, our disciplines around our business on Automation Solutions is different, and that we'll make sure that we follow the rules and regulations.","We followed their local content and stuff like that. So I like where we sit right now with the Kingdom and the opportunities and we'll continue to invest and we'll continue to go. I mean clearly, there is some shaking out. I mean clearly they have a different political system than we do where someone says you're going to go and you're going to go and come in, it's not like an elected process. We're watching this. But I feel still very good. I'm seeing them \u2013 our business pick up in orders in the Kingdom.","Across the Middle East, clearly, I think we're going to have a better year. And from my perspective, I look at, again, the combination of the potential compelling strategic fit between Rockwell and Emerson, to me it looks pretty good even in the Middle East, too. Both of us do well there and I think we have opportunities there.","So I feel okay with the Middle East. I think we're going to have a decent year in the Middle East. And clearly, there's always risk relative to political and also war issues relative to the Middle East, but feeling pretty good about that. Right now, I like where we are.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good luck with your November.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Two more. Hello, how are you doing?","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, hey, thanks for fitting me in. So maybe sticking to Rob's last question on incremental margins. So, Dave, you talked about 30% over the next few years in Automation Solutions. I'm just trying to understand your guide here. You've got mid-single-digit type growth across your businesses and it seems like you've got lower incrementals baked in for this year. So help me understand what's going on in both Automation Solutions and C&RS just from a margin standpoint?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, I think that we have baked in the 30%. I mean, I \u2013 the only headwinds we have at the macro level at this point in time, if you look at those EPS, is obviously clearly the impact of the tax rate and also the impact we have probably neutral relative to corporate around the final tranche of our \u2013 we've gone to an annual stock incentive program. It is a three year incentive program. The headwinds are pretty neutral there. So I think, right now we're giving you the \u2013 if we approach 6% we'll have obviously a little bit higher earnings, if we approach the lower end we're going to have less earnings. I feel we'll give you more details around the pieces in February, but I feel right now we have a forecast that's very doable one with the way the wind's going at this point in time. So there's no hidden agendas in that number at all.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And I guess maybe just sticking for that, well, for one second just of the price, what's your embedded price cost for 2018?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Pretty neutral.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","It's neutral.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Right now, it's pretty neutral. It might be slightly negative, but it's pretty neutral at this point in time. I mean, there's a lot of moving parts but it's going to be better this year than it was last year. And so, clearly, we're having to deal with net material inflation, we're going to have to \u2013 we figure out some pricing and it's going to be more rear end loaded as we come out of this. But I think it's pretty well focused at this point in time. And I feel pretty decent about it. It'll gets tougher in the first couple of quarters and get easier. So I like where we are right now in this area, too. I think we're in a good position.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And maybe if I could follow-on with one last thing.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Go ahead.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Look, the orders have been great in Automation Solutions, right? And what's interesting is if you kind of look across the rest of the space, and the value chain, power and chemical CapEx has been a pretty lively discussed negative from a lot of your peers. I'm just curious, what you're seeing in that end market, because I think those two end markets still represent at least a quarter of your Automation Solutions business. So be curious to hear what you're seeing there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're seeing our customer base; we're winning right now in this space. We brought some unique technologies out and we've been able to help in this area. So we've been winning across the board. If I look at all of my end markets, if I look at all the key markets I serve, for oil and gas to powered to chemical to pharmaceutical, the mining \u2013 even mining is doing well for us right now because of the support that V&C got for us \u2013 gave us. We're seeing a pretty good momentum. And we've had good spending capabilities in the power and the chemical, people are upgrading and they are investing in the technologies for the improvement in productivity and efficiency. So we've seen a different marketplace than everybody else. And so we've been clearly gaining in this space. And as you well know, we are very focused, we have a lot of new products coming out and I think we're winning at this point in time. So I feel, I like the fact that we're outperforming a lot of people in that space right now, it's good news.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. One more question here. Thank you. I appreciate everyone. I can't get to everybody, but call Tim Reeves.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. And that last question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Gautam?","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","...for fitting me in guys. Yes?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I can hear you. Not as well of course. I can hear it. Go ahead. Go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Good. Good. So, Dave, you mentioned, you've done \u2013 you and the rest of your team has done a heroic job of improving the balance sheet over the past couple of years and you mentioned in your scripted remarks that you're going to remain disciplined. I was wondering if you could give us some insight in how you assess the opportunity cost of your capital. If you can give us any sort of metrics on what type of a hurdle rate you have for acquisitions in terms of cash on cash returns? What type of weighted average cost of capital you and the board look at to measure that type of return?","And then as a follow-up if you can talk about whether there are enough independent discrete properties out there in discrete automation to allow you to kind of do this on a niche basis or do you have to go big. So any sense for financial framework and then can it be done outside of a Rockwell type sauce (01:03:32)?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. So, the first one, I'm not going to give you that much insight because that's, obviously, something that we, as a company, think about. And we've made very strong returns over the years and some people say, I have done some good ones and some bad ones. We've all done good ones and bad investments. But from our standpoint, what I mean by discipline, we will make sure that we will create value for our shareholders from the standpoint of what we see and a combination of any strategic large transaction such as a Rockwell and we have to support that within our own board. We have to support that with our own sense of risk assessments.","Again, we've done certain things like \u2013 I think Pentair Valves & Controls would be a classic example. And someone says it was a small deal, but at $3.15 billion, it's not a small deal. It's a pretty big deal. And I think we stayed disciplined on what we thought we could make an adequate return on that. Clearly, it's also size \u2013 we risk assess something depending on where they happen we size the company, the technologies. Clearly, a transaction like Rockwell is well within our known space. We are a major player in automation, so we feel less risk around that. It's all I can tell you that this is something that we really feel quite strongly about. But at the same time, I'm not going to kill the company I run today to make a transaction happen.","Now relative to the opportunities out there, the answer is yes. There are smaller opportunities out there that we can, over time, continue to make acquisitions, someone asked me \u2013 someone talked about that, yes, they're smaller. Yes, I can do some joint ventures. I can do some technology sharing. So there are things we can do. So we will make a decision. We're a healthy company. We'll move forward and make the other investments if we're not able to make the very large strategic acquisition that we talked about. But right now, there are other opportunities out there that we think got them that can make sense for us. It will take us longer to go that route, but we're a successful company, we'll continue to make those investments. But we're going to stay very focused on this automation space and the commercial residential space.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","But to your point on discipline \u2013 I just want to be clear, in terms of the delta between whatever return you promised to the board and your weighted average cost of capital on a large transaction, is that \u2013 it doesn't have to be a much wider gap, i.e., you anticipate a much higher return to compensate for the opportunity cost of that capital or are you willing to go lower for something there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I will not. I mean if you go lower below your lower cost of capital, you're obviously destroying value. And that's not something this board nor I. We have never known we've made deals. Now we have had acquisitions that did not pan out. Clearly, we made mistakes, but we would not normally go in there and say we're going to destroy value. That's not what I \u2013 I have a fiduciary responsibility as a Chairman and CEO of this company to make sure, as does this board, to make sure you make the right strategic deals.","If I can't demonstrate in a reasonable level of risk assessment with discussion amongst the board members and their advisors, then I can't deliver or say we can make value then we're not going to do that. So that's how we look at this thing. We've been involved in transactions and deals for a long, long time, and we will continue to do that way. So I'm going to break it off here.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I want to thank everybody for joining today. And then the key issues, couple points I want to make. Emerson today has a very strong business profile where the two platforms are doing well. I think the momentum is very positive on our side. I think we had a very good 2017 outlook for even a better 2018 relative to our standpoint of growth and profit improvement and cash flow. Clearly, I think that the Rockwell opportunity has tremendous strategic fit with Emerson. It clearly fits in the opportunities for our customers and for technologies and for the communities and for our employee base, it's very positive and something we're really going to work hard at.","However, we do have options outside the window, so we're not going to make this forever. It's a finite situation. At some point in time, as I told my board today, to their board meeting, that we will move forward. If we're not able to engage and do it, then we have other opportunities we can move forward on and continuing to invest in the company, continuing to prosper as a company and continue to do well for our shareholders.","So with that, I want to again thank everybody for joining us, I want to thank all the employees for having a great 2017 happen and now look forward to a strong 2018. Thank you very much everybody.","Operator","Thank you. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"7515":["Emerson Electric Co.

Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Fitzgerald","Thank you, Diana. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in Emerson's website, at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the web after the call for the next three months.","I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page two of the conference call slide presentation. Third quarter sales increased 3% to $6.5 billion underlying sales growing 6% as robust growth in process management was driven by strong energy in markets in recovery of sales deferred from the Thailand flooding and supply chain disruption.","The strong US dollar particularly against the euro reduced growth by 3%. Gross profit margin improved 80 basis points from the prior year to a record of 40.5%. Operating profit margin of 19.9% increased 180 basis points from the prior year, benefiting from strong sequential operating profit leverage of 55%. Earnings per share of $1.04 increased 16% from the prior year achieving a record for the third quarter.","Today Emerson\u2019s Board of Directors approved a fourth quarter dividend payment completing 56 consecutive years of dividend increases. The third quarter reflected solid results with strong operational execution despite slowing of the global economy.","Next slide, P&L summary. Again net sales increased 3% and underlying sales grew 6% with mixed demand among end markets and regions. Operating profit margin of 19.9% improved to 180 basis points to prior year benefiting from a strong volume leverage, cost reduction benefit and recovery of process management of sales and profit from the Thailand flooding..","Earnings growth of 13% along with the repurchase of 4.4 million shares drove an EPS increase of 16%.","Next slide undergoing sales by geography. Underlying sales in the US grew 6%, Europe was flat, Asia grew 9%, Latin America grew 19%, Canada grew 10% and Middle East and Africa grew 5%. Total underlying sales grew 6%, currency translation deducted 3% with net sales increasing 3%.","Moving to slide 5, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 40.5% improved 80 basis points and achieved a record level. Lower SG&A as a percent of sales drove further margin improvement as operating profit margin expanded a 180 basis points.","Other deductions was essentially flat as higher restructuring of $14 million and currency transaction losses of $11 million were offset by the payments received related to dumping duties of $37 million under the US Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset Act. Pretax margin reflected an increase of 200 basis points.","Next slide, cash flow. Operating cash flow decreased 6% as strong earnings were offset by higher receivables related to sales timing. Free cash flow was essentially flat to prior year with strong conversion from earnings at 90%. Trade working capital as a percent of sales was even to prior year benefiting from strong inventory performance.","Moving to slide 7, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 18.5% improved 160 basis points reflecting strong volume leverage and cost production benefit as well as the dumping duty payments received as mentioned earlier.","Corporate expense declined $14 million, primarily due to lower stock compensation expense and interest expense decreased 8%.","Moving to slide eight, Process Management results. Process management net sales grew 19% and underlying sales grew 23% as currency translation deducted 4%. By region, the US was up 29%, Asia up 25%, Europe up 14%, Latin America up 33% and Middle East and Africa up 13%.","Robust investment in oil and gas, chemical and power industries drove growth in all businesses and geographies. Sales benefited from approximately $130 million of converted backlog related to the Thailand flooding supply chain disruption. Segment margin of 23.1% improved 270 basis points, primarily driven by volume leverage and cost reduction benefits.","Year-to-date underlying orders have grown 17%, with the US up over 20% which has driven backlog of 15% from the prior year. Continued energy in market strength and the high backlog supported strong outlook for the next several quarters.","Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial automation net sales decreased 1%, but excluding currency translation grew to 3%, with the US up 12%, Asia flat, Europe down 4%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa down 1%.","Strong growth in the power generating alternators, hermitic motors and ultrasonic welding businesses were offset by decreases in the fluid automation and motors and drives businesses primarily due to European weakness.","Segment margin of 18.8% improved 220 basis points, which benefited from the dumping duty payments as well as cost reduction benefits that offset material inflation, unfavorable product mix and higher restructuring expense.","We expect the European fiscal prices and euro weakness to remain a challenge in the near-term.","Next slide, Network Power.","Network powernet sales declined 6% and underlying sales decrease 4% as currency translation deducted 3% of growth and acquisitions added 1%. By geography, US was down 14%, Asia up 6%, Europe down 7%, Latin America up 16% and Middle East and Africa down 6%.","Global telecommunications and IT end markets remained weak particularly in the US. The Asia growth benefited from the NBN project in Australia, while Europe economic conditions were challenging.","Pipeline rationalization continued in the embedded computing and power, deducted approximately 30 million from (inaudible).","Segment margin of 10.3% declined 10 basis points from the prior year as volume deleverage, unfavorable inaudible) product mix and higher restructuring were partially offset by cost reduction benefits and materials cost increases.","Profit margin improved in the Network Power Systems business from the prior-year quarter and sequential margin continued in the Embedded Computing and Power business. We expect the aggressive restructuring over the past year to continue to generate incremental cost savings and profitability improvement.","Moving to slide 11, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies' net sales decreased 2% and underlying sales declined 1%, the currency translation deducting 2% and acquisitions adding 1%.","By region, the US was up 1%, Asia down 5%, Europe down 12%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa down 14%.","US market improved, but channel conditions were mixed towards strong growth in residential and commercial offsetting weakness in service.","China improved as well, but remained negative, while the rest of Asia was flat. And economic conditions remained a challenge in Europe. Segment margin of 20.2% improved 60 basis points despite the sales decrease --- cost containment and mix. We shipped our 100 million of scroll compressor in the quarter (inaudible) broad global installed base. US and China markets should improve at a modest pace but the weakness in Europe will continue. ","Next slide commercial and residential solutions. Commercial and residential solutions net sales grew 2% and underlying sales grew 7% as the heating products business divested in 2011 deducted 4% and currency translation deducted 1%. By geography, US was up 4%, Asia up 11%, Europe down 1%, Latin America up 5% and Middle East and Africa up 58%. ","Steady demand in the US commercial construction markets continued, segment margin of 20.4% improved 20 basis points as cost eruption benefits drove solid margin improvements. We expect US construction end markets to remain stable for 2012. ","Moving to slide 13, the outlook, a strong third quarter results keep us on track for a solid 2012 with the economic outlook with clear weakening, there's no apparent fix for the Europe debt challenges, US fiscal policy crisis or slower Chinese economy. ","The global economic uncertainty has limited visibility and companies are being cautious with investments. It is on current conditions the revised 2012 outlook as follows, underlying sales growth 3% or 4%, reported sales growth 1% to 2%, operating profit margin 17.5% to 17.8%, restructuring expense approximately $125 million, tax rate approximately 32%, earnings per share in the range of $3.35 to $3.40, operating cash flow at $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion and capital expenditures approximately $700 million. And with that I will turn it over to David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much. First I want to thank everybody for joining us today and I appreciate our shareholders and their long-term support. As you know, today the board did finalize our final dividend increase for fiscal 2012 by $0.40 to $1.60 for the whole year, our 56th year and along with approximately $1 million of repurchase in fiscal year 2012 which is our current target, a strong commitment of payment back to our shareholders in cash which is very, very important to our focus here as a company and our management team. ","At the same time, we have continued to increase our investments internally for growth. For capital we need to grow the company at record levels and our balance sheet stayed strong and liquid and we have the room to do what we need to do. We can control our own destiny. I also want to let you know that Zorro, my rally monkey and my baseball bat are here with me today to keep me in line and to make sure I do not lose my focus. Thanks to all those help for the tools as we know. I also want to recognize the operating executives across this company and especially the process management operating executives. They got the job done this quarter. They had a tough hand coming out of the Thailand floods and the situation that we hit early on this year. ","They mapped up the course of correction. They kept taking the orders, we didn't lose the business, we supported the customers and we've got the sale shipments done. This quarter we picked up approximately $130 million of sales from the impact that we had in the first quarter, we will have a little bit of more of that in the fourth quarter, probably $140, $150 somewhere around that range and a little bit leftover in the first fiscal quarter of 2013 but the team out there in process is getting the job done. Across the whole company operationally we are getting the job done. ","From an execution standpoint of cost reductions from shipments to backlog reductions they are getting it done. As I look at the pace of business the last 70 days, it is definitely slow, in early May when we had our last communication we talked about 7% to 8% underlying sales growth this quarter, we ended up at 6%. It\u2019s a function of the weakening that we have seen around the world in the US, in Europe, China, Brazil, India clearly we have seen this continuing weakening in orders, our order pace has maintained around 3% we expected it will improve a little bit, it\u2019s maintain probably the month of July too we haven\u2019t got the following numbers but my gut tells me we are probably around 3% in orders in the pace for this month. ","The key for us is maintaining the order pace to deliver the backlog and reduce that backlog, the same game plan we just executed in our third quarter. Underlying sales will be slightly better in the fourth quarter, there are no more pattern but we need to execute on getting the sales out the door operations are focused on that and we believe that we can deliver.","In addition to the loss of sales that we had in our underlying orders and sales this quarter, we had also had a stronger dollar which impacted us about $50 million in the third quarter from beginning to end and that pays unfortunately even worse as we go into the fourth fiscal quarter and we have been revealing those numbers for the last three [decades] and the order pace to keep an idea out there for the shareholders to know what we see happening relative to the stronger dollar. ","I personally like a stronger dollar, it reflects the stronger economy, I believe in it. It gives us a lot more leverage relative to managing our global company and we are a global company, we are not an export driven company. So I personally like a stronger dollar. I think it\u2019s great for this country.","From my perspective, Europe has continued to be a weaker economy I do not see any change in that as we go forward here into the next fiscal year. At this point in time I would expect negative growth coming out of Europe. I expect negative GFI again in 2013 in Europe and US have one big issue it's called a fiscal flip and fiscal mismanagement. It is causing corporations in the United States to pullback, pullback in the range that I referred to it you hear talk about this all the time. It's causing us to pull back in rein clearly, our capital spending in the third quarter was less than prior year and less than we have been running out from the pace basically. However, I still think that is going to continue because it could be a weaker pullback as we look at going on here in the next couple of months. ","I believe that companies out there right now are only spending what they need to spend, the uncertainty of what is going to go on relative to US fiscal policy is a big issue, it is a huge issue, people are only going to spend what they need to spend and people are cutting back on anything that they see for growth and I think that's going to be an impact relative to the whole rest of this calendar year relative to underlying US growth. ","In china, from my perspective China has stabilized. It has not picked up significantly, the economy is definitely weaker than prior years, and I think the economy in China will continue to struggle. The political transition is underway. We will see how that plays out but I see nothing at this point in time to change the growth profile of China significantly than what we have been seeing for the last six, nine, 12 months as we go into calendar year 2013.","Relative to Brazil which is impacted clearly by the slowdown around the international markets and exports of the product, that economy has also slowed down in my opinion and we will continue to slow and struggle from a whole standpoint of their cost structure and also there is an export driven material marketplace which I think will be impacted. ","India also has its own issues right now be it from a political standpoint, a financial standpoint, inflation standpoint and power standpoint. India has continued to be a good market for us but I am concerned about the future, the next 12 to 18 months in India, given what's going on inside that country.","Relative to leverage in the third quarter, it was an outstanding leverage. It's what we expected. We expected to get some money back from the government on the (inaudible) amendment. That\u2019s been around. We\u2019ve known about it for six months. We had a plan in the forecast; we had a plan in May. It would most likely be our final payment, maybe a [$1 million or $2 million] more in the future. This thing is going on but it's going to be finalized here but it's pretty much done for us. It was well planned. The rest of the operations have continued to execute on slower growth, leveraging back the cost structure, getting the job done in restructuring and position themselves for I think a slower growth environment for the foreseeable future. ","We\u2019re doing what needs to be done across this company, protect our profitability, protect our cash flow and make sure we have a flexibility to deal with issues that come up, via Thailand flood, via embargoes, whatever happens, via wars around the world, we\u2019re taking the actions necessary to make sure this company is strong and able to have a flexibility to get the job done.","As I look at the fourth quarter right now, we have to execute just like we execute in the third quarter. We need process management to continue to reduce its backlog that we build up. The order pace has been very, very, strong throughout this whole year as you\u2019ve seen. Its not just one month or two months have been strong now for a long time. ","We need to execute getting that order pace or those orders converted to sales. We need to get that backlog down and we need to deliver the profitability just like we did in the third quarter and I expect that team will do that. ","At the same time, we need to continue the restructure across network products which had good traction in the third quarter and we will have continued good traction in the fourth quarter.","We are dealing with a lower growth environment than we expected, but we\u2019ve got the cost in line as we started in way back three, four, five months ago, as we saw things slowing down.","I feel good that he will continue execute this in the four quarter and I feel that we are ready to deliver a record level of profitability and hopefully a record level of sales given what\u2019s going on at this point of time, but clearly with the underlying growth rate slowing down a little bit and given the fact that dollar continue to strengthen that getting tougher and tougher relative to the topline sales. But we feel good about where we are right now. We have a good start in the month of July; we alright now into August and we are executing.","The top 40 executives of Emerson will be in town for the next three days working on the OCE talking about how we close out this year and talking about what we look at 2013 and basically making sure we\u2019re positioned to continue to perform at high levels even if we had issues coming out of it.","From my perspective again, I want to thank the operating team of what they got done in the third quarter. We will continue to execute. We have a fourth quarter challenge; we must make sure we deliver and I feel good about where we are right now and we are going into a 2013 to be honest that I think we\u2019ll continue to be very challenging from growth and from the standpoint of what\u2019s going to happen around the world. Companies need to be flexible, they need to adjust very quickly and deal with issues that come out to them.","There are pockets of growth out there, but there are also pockets of weakness and it\u2019s very important for us to focus on where that growth is and to delve back where the weakness is. But we are not looking at anything that in my opinion that\u2019s going to quickly turn around and so a strong growth profile we are looking at a challenging growth environment very similar to what we are dealing with now and I expect that will continue throughout 2013 and may be even a little longer.","So again thanks for us being with us today. Thanks for supporting us and we will continue to work hard to deliver a very strong finish to this year and to execute like Emerson can execute as we have done in the past.","With that we\u2019ll open the floor for questions. Thank you.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","I had a couple on Network Power one, just how the chloride energy in the transformer list when that might start to drive some share reversion I guess? And then second early thoughts on repositioning budget for that next year, what kind of headway have you made on what you see as requisite for that segment?","","David Farr","The new transformers product in United States has been introduced the first wave has happened; who knows what go in the marketplace from a share standpoint, who knows what\u2019s going in the marketplace standpoint right now with the uncertainty. I think the whole Network Power systems business has had a good quarter and they continue to make good progress around the world and they will continue to make god progress the next quarter.","My opinion right now, you are looking at a challenging marketplace these guys are serving and we will continue that way in 2013. I don\u2019t see anything that\u2019s going to say that this business a business environment is going to say that we are going to go out and spend money freely; we will have some clarity on what\u2019s going to happen in Europe from a fiscal standpoint and what\u2019s going to happen here in the United States from a fiscal standpoint.","So we are planning on very low growth and continue to execute the restructuring, improve the profitability like we are doing and get the new products out the door, that\u2019s where we are.","","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then just lastly the SG&A spends have been very steady five or six quarters; do you start to see any upward pressure on that spend rate; annual increases or what have you?","","David Farr","I think from my perspective we are going to continue to keep our cost in line. We have gone out and pushed pretty hard on making sure we are spending appropriately. We are going to be looking at our spending on the big growth investments going into 2013 and look at which ones we want to maintain and which ones we want to curtail.","But from our perspective right now I think our SG&A is in pretty good shape. The key issues we don\u2019t want to like to drive to have our GP market hit the 40% level for the whole year, we are real close to that right now; we are a little bit shy of that as you look at the first nine months, I think we are setting at 39.9% or 39.8% somewhere around like that. So I think from an SG&A standpoint we are nor big spenders here and we move around from a mixed standpoint but I think we\u2019ve got that pretty well in control.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays","David it just look consistently that Latin America was very strong in the quarter; you did make some negative comments about Brazil. Can you just talk about maybe some timing issues there in the quarter and what kind of drove that strength and particularly in Network Power?","David Farr","I mean from a standpoint of Latin America there are a lot of projects, more of a projects business down there and we have had some good orders down there for the last six months both in Network Power, both in the process side and we are able to get those businesses out the door. Right now I think Brazil will still do okay; I think Mexico is far stronger than Brazil right now, Mexico has become a very important market for us and we have a very strong position there and it\u2019s continuing to grow.","So I think right now across Latin America expect another pretty good quarter; I expect another good year next year, but my concern about Brazil is they have made some big forecast relative to investment and capital and let\u2019s say oil and gas type investments. And the question is will those continue to go forward or will they delay those a little bit?","Right now our business is doing well down there; we expect to continue to do well down there but my focus right now is Mexico and it has continued to perform extremely well with a new government in Mexico, I am very encouraged by this new government and I am looking forward to meeting the new President and his team. I think Mexico is going to be $1 billion market for us in the next couple of years.","Scott Davis - Barclays","As a follow up, just trying to get a sense of how the markets changing and shifting in climate, I mean when you see tough conditions like this, does it rotate back towards kind of older technologies like reship away from scroll or is that just not an issue anymore?","David Farr","That\u2019s not an issue anymore. I think the key issue on the climate standpoint is consumers very, very tight with spending money and last year they did a lot of repair work. This year they're doing outside unit and they're replacing the outside units. So it\u2019s less service for us; more sales for OEM customers which is good for them. We get the compressor, but obviously at a different price point.","As you know the scroll will continue to do well, you got another transition underway. That will happen effectively January 1, 2015. So the key North American OEMs right now are going through that process, you know, how they\u2019re going to reach those new standards, and obviously we\u2019re working very closer to those and you\u2019re going to see that continuing.","I mean the key issue for us right now is we need to see some stronger housing in North America. We need to see a stronger replacement market, but I am not expecting much of a big surge here. I expect some stability. The key issue also is that you have to see commercial, which is weakening a little bit and you\u2019re also seeing a transportation type of marketplace weaken a little bit.","So with regards to our global business, we have some plusses and some minuses. Right now, our mix is very good, so we've pretty good profitability and residential has not been one of the strength, but our commercial business has been very good and our refrigeration business has been very good.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital","","Can you give us an update on the mid-tier sales strategy whether this backdrop is the right backdrop to continue with that and then China is it the right time to move into second and third tier cities given just 2% growth there?","David Farr","We've been moving into second, third and fourth tier cities in China for 10 years. So I think fundamentally China will continue to be a good growing marketplace. If you look at quarters and a lot of things happened, you have quarter surges, you have quarter backed off, the underlying China will continue to outgrow in my opinion the US economy and we may have a quarter or two of the sales are not that strong, but if you look back over the last 10 to 15, five, three years, we've averaged well over 15% growth, we have a tough year this year, it doesn't mean we are backing down.","The mid-tier strategy is going to continue; we've started this 18 to 24 months ago. A lot of products have started launching. We have been building the organization and I expect China will have a better year in 2013 from an underlying sales growth standpoint just because of our businesses in our mid-tier projects where things are happening. I feel good about China even though it\u2019s still going to be challenging and the economy could be weaker, I still think we are making the right moves at this point in time.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital","And can you give us an update on where you think the global fixed investment is running currently and how you are faring on outperforming that?","David Farr","The problem is the information is more of a rear view mirror it\u2019s touched on. So right now the trend line has continued to deteriorate. I would say at this point in time the forecast I gave in May at EPG is holding path right now from that perspective and so I don't think it\u2019s changed much. I don\u2019t have anything that tells me it\u2019s improved, but I definitely think it\u2019s weakening. And I don\u2019t have a visibility relative to how much is weakening because it\u2019s so rear-mirror oriented and I think you got to wait for things to settle down for a while. But clearly economic numbers you are seeing around the world continue to weaken a little bit.","And I think the business spending this quarter has been weaker, so that will reflect in the GFI spending. So my feeling is this is going to be -- the numbers I put out there and showed in EPG in May are still holding tight and I don\u2019t have it off the top of my head, but they are out there in the charts, you can get them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Farr.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","A couple of questions. The Network Power margin trajectory, it looks encouraging obviously. Where are you at on kind of the downsize of the Embedded Power relative to kind of the overall plan. And just kind of taking out a step further, I mean that margin improvement we saw in the quarter came on very little sequential revenue growth. Can you give us some context to think about restructuring saves your other dynamics are coming to play and kind of how we should think about this margin going forward?","David Farr","The Embedded Power restructuring, I mean we still have a little left, but it\u2019s really getting close to finalizing from our perspective. From my perspective, the winding down and the repositioning, I think we are about there. I mean I expect them, our growth rates to be less negative, let's put this way in that space. So I think there from the restructuring you're going to see a slower number there.","It will be even less as we go into starting into 2013. On the Network Power System standpoint, we still have a lot going on there relative to Europe because these programs take on -- you know they take on quite some time. It takes anywhere from 12 to 18 months for some of the restructuring there.","But that will continue and that will continue going into 2013. Overall I do expect a restructuring dollars to probably end up being a little bit lower in 2013. And I would expect Network Power to spend less money in 2013 in total than we spent this year.","It's a function of what we see happening relative to our European opportunities. The window opens up, we will obviously take advantage of that situation. Relative to the overall integration and where we see right now -- we're in pretty good shape. It's just a matter of continue to execute.","I believe that we will see continued sequential improvement and profitability in the fourth quarter. You know it's a matter of how we are getting our backlog of the door and stuff like that. But I wouldn't say any robust improvement in the business space, it's more of an internal execution at this point relative to what we have, day-to-day business, getting the stuff out the door and continuing to finalize the restructuring.","So we are really in control of our own destiny at this point and I feel good about it.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","How about CapEx? Are you planning to spend down next year on an aggregate Emerson basis?","David Farr","Probably not because as I've talked about for the last I think last couple of calls process has a capacity that you know, based on what we see on the underlying demand base on our backlog based on continued repositioning of the business on a global basis, we're going to have to improve our spending in capital as we put on that capacity in that regionalization.","So I would say that we\u2019re going to be up a little bit next year in capital and it is going to be primarily driven by process management because of the strong growth we've had over the couple of years, and I think we\u2019re going to still see some pretty good growth there. So we need to make sure we reinvest for the next wave and you know, that\u2019s where we are now, in the business cycle, just like we did a couple of years ago in Climate Technologies. You have the to get ahead of these things. You can\u2019t wait or you will miss shipping opportunities.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","What's your feeling at this point appetite on M&A versus share repurchase, you know obviously nice bump in the dividend today. Where is your head on that now looking into 2013?","David Farr","Acquisitions are still, I mean I consider the acquisitions number one relative to share repurchase. It\u2019s a function of you know, can we find the assets out there. There is not a lot of assets out there and we\u2019re trying to work those assets, but we've had a couple of years of less than $300 million from a spending standpoint. ","You know, as you know, it's lumpy, we'll go two or three yes, you know, less than $500 million then we will have kind of have a big year. So we still are looking for the acquisitions. I would rather do acquisitions than share repurchase. But in the meantime our balance sheet is strong and we will continue to do the share repurchase if we have flexibility. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Just maybe a quick follow up to that last question. I mean given all your commentary that sort of trending more negative on the macro, even though it sounds more positive operationally, are you thinking about divestitures in the same way, same sort of longer-term timeframe even as the macro deteriorates or has that thinking evolved?","David Farr","I don't think our divestiture programs have changed from what I talked about, both at Bernstein conference and\/or the EPG or even last February. We are looking at a multi-year program here. [Kanak] will be finished this quarter. We will evaluate some other assets as we closed out this year going to our strategy playing with the board in November. So, there is no change at this point in time.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great, and on the process conversion, you know, so much of that was on the backlog and you've got these record margins. So, as you think about normalizing kind of a normal growth rate without the excessively high backlog from Thailand. How are you thinking about margins evolving in that business as you head in to next year or through maybe later in the next year as that normalizes?","David Farr","On a quarter-to-quarter basis, the process margin will move around because of the type of mix we have clearly. But if we finish on 20% for this year, we will probably have a little bit uptick next year from a profitability standpoint. You know, I am not looking at a significant change in the margin of that business. ","Clearly from our profile, we\u2019re investing quite significantly in underlying growth programs and technologies and we intend to continue to do that. We want to protect that core business. It's a very important core business to us and we are going to make sure that we protect it and not milk it. And so I think that you\u2019re looking at low profitabilities for the 20% and we'll mix and match around that level at this point in time.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","And maybe just sneak one more in on telecom. How are you thinking about end user CapEx in telecom and as you look at the next couple of quarters, how optimistic are you on that?","David Farr","I wouldn\u2019t say I am optimistic. I mean I'll just put this way. I think the telecom guys are spending money. The question is not, can we continue to get a piece of that spending, but they are spending money and the question will be as what does that do as they go into 2013 but right now they have a bunch of pool of money they are spending and we have to make sure we get a piece of that. I mean I process, I'm far more optimistic about capital spending than I am of our customers than I am with the telecom spending, let's put it that way.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Hey Dave in terms of pulling back on the reins obviously, your customers and process aren't doing it. Where particularly when you look within businesses by businesses are you seeing that specifically at customers?","David Farr","Well, I haven't personally called or received of my customers out there but I think that if I look at most customers and from the standpoint of looking at their inventory stockings and looking at the industrial customers I think the people are pulling back and being very careful to spend money and I would say that even the process guys are being a little bit more careful of spot where they are spending money, I don't know how you say they are not. I think these guys are going to be very careful about where they put their money. I think they are going to continue to spend on high levels but I think they are going to be very cautious. ","I mean across the board, last quarter if I remember correctly, if I looked at the spending in the GDP numbers of our business it actually weakened a little bit Shannon. So that's my input, I just might be out there talking to CEOs, they are being careful.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Yeah, happened to spend with process it seemed I mean are\u2026 ","David Farr","I'm not going to tell you business by business, if you want to go on out and call the CEOs I'll give you some numbers, you can call them if you want to Shannon, but I don\u2019t personally do that.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","I'll take them.","David Farr","Okay, good I will give them to you.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","One more just on embedded power as you know you continue to downsize the business there, is that changing at all how you view the attractiveness of sort of the industry structure there and you've sort of got a smaller business to operate or whether it's still tough?","David Farr","Its still tough and I will make, I will review our decision on what we are going to do with this business as we go on this year with the board in November and we will be making a decision on what we are going to do as we talked about earlier, right now its still a very difficult marketplace relative to profitability and returns and a very dynamic marketplace, so the dynamics haven't changed and at this point in time I don't see any change relative to what we how we view it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Just a quick question on the industrial automation, as a new president of that business, I just wondered if any of the priorities that maybe changing along side that and in particular I guess around the outlook for restructuring, do you think there's going to be very high again in 2013. The business is kind of bumping along flattish organic sales growth, there seems to be some risk of maybe margins level of, so could you talk a little bit about the main priorities in [IA] right now?","David Farr","As we go through, Mark will be going through his first strategy session with us in September with the OCE, I would say the main priorities there are basically we are looking at a very low growth environment. So we know what restructuring needs to be done, its underway. Right now, what's the current plan for this year relative to the restructuring Frank, we are going to get the number here for this business approximately. $25 million, I think you can be looking probably again in around that $20 million level next year, so we are going to continue to restructure we can Julian in that business. It\u2019s a very European centric business and we are taking our time relative to that. ","The key issue for us is we have new products coming out in the drives area. We have new products coming out in the couple of areas that's very, very important to us relative to reignite some growth in that market space. But overall, I think you are right from a low growth environment and the question would be to get our cost line to protect that profitability that would be the goal for [IA] next year. You are right.","","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Just secondly on network power, the decline in earnings has sort of shrunk recently, but the earnings are still fallen for sort of seven quarters in a row year-on-year. So when we are thinking the next 12 months or 18 months for that business, how confident are you that we can get some kind of earnings growth there, for example is there reasonable earnings growth if we strip out embedded computing and power, so it\u2019s just a question of maintaining that if something strategic happens to embedded computing?","David Farr","The key issue for us and to get the earnings growth going forward from here is to stop the [weaning] out of what the businesses we don\u2019t want to be in, and that process is truly slowing down and we should start seeing some earnings growth as we go forward here because the majority of that [weaning] is almost done, the profitability is improving, we are taking the cost action side. So we will continue to work on that issue and feel good that we will some underlying growth and we will start getting some underlying earnings growth in that space. As we go to that process, it takes time and obviously a very challenging process but I feel good we are making headway as we go into 2013 and 2014 I see that we will get some earnings growth out of that. We have done this before and we will get it back.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Just to follow-up quickly, so excluding embedded computing, the earnings in network power\u2026","David Farr","I am not going to tell you that. I mean I would like the breakout next time. Good try Julian, nice try.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dean Dary with Citi Research. Please go ahead. ","Dean Dary - Citi Research","Can you comment on the increase in the receivables at the end of the quarter was all just the timing of shipments?","Frank Dellaquila","I mean we had a $550 million sequential increase in sales. So its really just the timing that caused the receivables to pop up in the third quarter. ","Dean Dary - Citi Research","So that check for the (inaudible) clear successfully?","David Farr","Yes. They took my tax payment and paid it back to me, to the company.","Dean Dary - Citi Research","That\u2019s good to hear. And then Dave you got the top, you said the top 40 Emerson executives are going to be gathering, may be you can just give us a sense of the agenda? I am curious of hearing has the agenda changed in what you were thinking may be a month ago, what are the kind of a key hot spot this year as we go through LIBORS, new product introductions, pricing, what could you share with us?","David Farr","Good question. The answer is yes it has to change in the last 60 days. From my perspective the number one issue is, if you at the underlying growth rates above the emerging markets then you see the trends that sort of common out here over the last 12 months to 18 months. We have to figure out how we are going to manage and a little bit lower growth environment for a couple of years as we talked about May. I think we\u2019re looking at some challenging; it could be three, four, five years here. The other key issue from my perspective we got to talk about is talking about where do we want to put our incremental investment dollars. We have been very strong and as you know, some of the what we call it A12, A13 programs and we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those dollars, what big programs we want to invest in, given the type of environment we\u2019re in right now and the market mix we see right now, where do we want to put that as dollars and the business leaders in the OCE, and the top 40 guys and people and those guys will be discussing that issue. ","The other issue would be, my opinion is we're now going into I think little bit more of a negative material type environment. We had environment here, we surged up in material cost and raised prices now, its starting to weaken in a little growth environment, I think you\u2019re going to be looking at more of a negative material type environment and how do you maintain our pricing integrity, our green, we call that net green environment and that and trying to manage it very carefully. So those are the things I want to talk about.","Dean Dary - Citi Research","May be just rhetorical but just to understand environment compared to discussions you had with the same team in 2008?","David Farr","Well, in 2008, we\u2019re looking at, clearly a lot higher growth globally. You know, we weren\u2019t looking at the type of debt structure we have out there and you\u2019re looking at a whole different growth profile at that point in time. So you know, it\u2019s a more selective focus growth area and so you know, that\u2019s where we want to get our minds around. Where do we want to put those dollars to make sure we get the returns and make sure that we drive as much growth as we can in the pockets out there, in the areas we don\u2019t have that opportunity growth, what restructuring, what reposition can we do to protect our profitability.","I still believe the company can grow. I can think we can improve our profitability and deliver high levels returns in cash. But the question is then how do we get that and where do we invest that money carefully, that's what's it's about.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So the Network Power, US was down I think high single digit, was that just the telecom stuff not coming back this fast that you thought?","David Farr","Yeah, telecom and also some of the embedded stuff that we get out of, is also US based type business, but that\u2019s primarily what was down in the US.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So in the embedded comp actually here in the US, not just in Asia?","David Farr","You got it, typical business and we try, even though some of the products are made and sold over there it\u2019s actually that we look at destination and destination comes back in the US.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then piggybacking on Jeff\u2019s question about the sequential margin, you know last year you went from 10.5 to 13.5 from third quarter to fourth quarter. How do we look for the fourth quarter Network Power for this year?","David Farr","We are still looking at. Last year with our 300 basis points, we are looking probably half of that. So we are still looking. The key thing for us Steve is we've been restructuring. We've got some stability there and the question is actually including around the products, the new products are coming out and getting that job done, so we see the momentum right now, the profitability is improving and I'm pleased with that.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then on the alternator side, you said power generation was strong, but it seems like CAT gensets have been pretty weak year-over-year. There's probably less inventory in the channel relative to where it was and kind of the \u201908 or \u201909 time period, so maybe it\u2019s more real time these days, is that business, is that kind of the source of the concern going forward when you talk about Europe, because I know that supported your Europe revenues I think?","","David Farr","","I think that from a genset standpoint, what we do and what CAT does a little bit different timing different here but we also you know half of our business is non-CAT. From what we see right now clearly what happened in India is a good issue for us, the gensets and we are a strong player in India, Indonesia.","I am little bit nervous about that we are sitting at very, very record levels of our alternator business right now, so I am a little bit nervous about that, I think Europe is weaker, but I still think that this power needs around the world, the economy is hold up and we still have power issues around world.","We should have a reasonable year next year, but it is a concern for me because if you look at the general order patterns, not been that strong and you are right the actual inventories out there are not that big either. So that\u2019s a plus we live a lot day to day in that area. But I am obviously nervous overall that overall underlying power needs and economy needs well emergency is out there like in India; it\u2019s good news for us.","","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, one last question for you a little bit picture, you obviously had a lot going on first quarter of last year whether it was the seasonality, and climate, the network kind of air pocket whatever you want to call it the process stuff. If you kind of model normal seasonality you have got some pretty easy comps in the first half of the year, but you are talking about how cautious people are in the near-term and obviously the fiscal cliff who knows when that gets resolved. So I am just trying to kind of put those dynamics together. When you go out and you think about \u201813 will it be as easy as saying hey comps are easy so we\u2019re kind of come strong out of the gate or is it the economy is going to be do that so it will be more kind of straight line as we move through the year, next year?","","David Farr","I really haven\u2019t thought about that long; all I know is as I look at the trend line, I know next year is going to be very difficult year for any one to model because of how disaster first quarter we had and almost a disaster in the second quarter and then started coming back; I mean very difficult where I have to get some, we\u2019re going to have people in this one for sure because it\u2019s a little bit more help than I normally give, because I don\u2019t give quarterly forecast as you know Steve.","As I look at it, I am looking at a \u2013 if I am saying underlying growth rate, it\u2019s going to be low single digits next year and I think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t at straight line, its not how I am thinking at; I don\u2019t think that \u2013 its hard for me to say but right now I am though about that first and second quarter but I don\u2019t think its going to be say easy comps and then we\u2019ll just have a straight line. I just think what to think about how that first year unfolds, how our backlog finishes and the order pace go into this as we finish September; it\u2019s not going to be a difficult year.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Sorry, did you say low single digits underlying sales growth?","David Farr","Yes I did.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, that\u2019s for \u201913?","David Farr","","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg with Langenberg & Company. Please go ahead.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","A couple of questions; just on the process side, just review with this backlog that flowed through from Thailand, was there \u2013 were most expenses incurred in earlier periods in the fiscal and basically kind of what the incrementals were just on that piece of flow through; did it unusually boost the margin in the quarter; that\u2019s my first question?","David Farr","It definitely helped, but I am not going to tell you, I am not going to tell you that; if that\u2019s from me you are not to know. So clearly, the way this thing works is we incurred costs, we definitely incurred costs, we built the product and put it inventory, there is no doubt we captured cost that way. We also had around $35 million spread even throughout the years, coughed we\u2019re having to incur because of the extra dime in this overall cost, customer cost from that standpoint.","So if you think about, we had what was the EBITDA margin for the quarter its approximately 23%. You know, we've been running around for 20% for the whole year and so for a company. So we clearly had a pretty good incremental flow through on that profitability.","For us it's the same, was it Thailand related, was it not Thailand, its an exercise that basically left pocket, right pocket and I am not going to waste my time on that. I mean, process guys got one thing the guys do from this quarter, they got to ship a lot of sales and make a lot of money. And so that\u2019s the one we\u2019re focused. But we had good flow through obviously at 23%.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","No, clearly, I not trying that I missed, so basically some of its usually good growth, some of it is bad, some of it sounds like lower expediting cost if you will.","David Farr","And you are right. We did capture stuff in inventories. There is no doubt we do that to ourselves.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","Okay and then can you just overall talk about price loss for the total company in the quarter, total price net of loss in material?","David Farr","You know, its still positive, right now because our price, we take pricing actions more early in the year and so if you remember correctly, we had probably the first quarter was negative. We went slightly positive in the second quarter, we went more positive and so right now we\u2019re obviously what we call green net material price, we'll again have that in the fourth quarter and then what we will do is we will start working the price increases and clearly as I\u2019ve said earlier, we\u2019re looking at more of a negative net material inflation environment so therefore next year it's going to be a different environment. This year we\u2019ll probably end up totaling around lets say around 0.5 positive, 0.4 positive price; I don't know what the number is going to be.","Next year, we will have to fight hard to hold to zero, but net material inflation is going to be negative. And so we\u2019ll be working that issue as we go into that now, but clearly, we\u2019re going to going into a different environment and the key thing I what, my management team will be thinking about it, how do we manage it going from a more costly, material cost environment to a negative one and how you manage in that pricing get back as you go through that process.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","And just last one, great SG&A performance, your sales year-on-year up $270 million, your SG&A was down $25 million, so there's such same returns of normalized of SG&A, of course talking $60 million or $70 million, how much of that was just discretionary pullback and just kind of put some chunks around what you did in the quarter to manage that. You clearly played it really tight?","David Farr","We started about almost 90 days ago and I think on the last conference call in May I talked about, we really started pulling back in the range and we started talking about not necessarily placing people, the restructuring savings have come into play in the second half of the year where we took some costs out in the SG&A level.","We are being very cautious relative to our spreading levels and so there's a little bit of that going on, but its just basically being cautious and allowing that growth; we have 6% of growth without trying to increase our spending levels and when I try to do the same thing again this quarter in order to get the leverage, because for us to deliver the whole year it doesn't take a rocket science to figure out what kind of margin I need to have in that fourth quarter.","And so we are going to keep that spending level really tight right now. I am really nervous about what's going on around the world and so I am pulling those reins back. I haven't yanked the reins back and put the bit in the horses\u2019 mouth real hard yet, but I could easily do that and you could see the power cost come down.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions. I would like to turn back over to management.","David Farr","Good, again I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I appreciate the questions; I appreciate the support and (inaudible) and the baseball bat are going back in the shelf and will be ready for the next quarter. So you all take care. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the Emerson third quarter fiscal 2012 results conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, May 1, 2012.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","Now I'd like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Fitzgerald","Thank you, Vince. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call summarizes Emerson's second quarter 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in Emerson's website, at emerson.com. A replay of this call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 3 months. ","I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Second quarter sales increased slightly to $5.9 billion with mixed results across businesses and geographies. Underlying sales were up 2% lead by strong recovery from the Thailand flooding supply chain disruption in Process Management. Climate Technologies had another difficult quarter, but a recovery appears underway in the U.S. and China. Gross profit margin increased 10 basis points from the prior year and expanded 80 basis points from the first quarter. Operating profit margin of 16.5% increased 330 basis points from the first quarter, which was a decrease of 40 basis points from the prior year quarter. Earnings per share of $0.74 increased 48% from the first quarter and 1% in the prior year. After robust sequential profitability improvement in the quarter, Emerson is well positioned for a strong second half of 2012. ","Next slide, P&L summary. Net sales increased 1% and underlying sales increased 2% despite continued product line rationalization in the Embedded Computing and Power business. Operating profit decreased 1% as volume deleverage, unfavorable product mix and other cost increases exceeded cost reductions and price increases. We repurchased 1.7 million shares for $84 million in the quarter and earnings per share increased 1%. ","Next slide, underlying sales by geography. Underlying sales in the U.S. grew 3%; Europe decreased 4%; Asia grew 2%, with China down 4%; Latin America grew 11%; Canada grew 10%; and the Middle East and Africa was up 5%. Total underlying sales increased 2%. Currency translation deducted 1% with total net sales growing 1%. We expect Europe to remain weak in the second half, but order trends suggest that China sales will improve. ","Next slide, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 39.5% expanded 10 basis points as cost reduction benefits and price increases offset unfavorable product mix and other costs. Price cost is favorable in the quarter. Operating profit margin of 16.5% decreased 40 basis points from the prior year and expanded 330 basis points sequentially. Net other deductions reflected higher restructuring and lower gains, partially offset by lower FX losses and amortization. Pretax earnings declined 2%. ","Moving to Slide 6, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow decreased 25% on lower earnings and higher investment and working capital to support second half growth. Capital expenditures increased 25%, reflecting investments in technology, growth programs and capacity. And the balance sheet inventory peaked in February and is expected to continue to decline. ","Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 15.3% decreased 20 basis points from the prior year and expanded 260 basis points from the first quarter. Corporate expense increased $19 million primarily due to the gain from the Fisher Sanmar JV buyout in the prior year. ","Turning to Slide 8, Process Management results. Process Management net sales grew 13% and underlying sales grew 14% as currency translation deducted 1%. By region, the U.S. was up 24%; Asia was up 10%; Europe was up 4%; Latin America was up 33%; and Middle East\/Africa was up 5%. Strong demand in oil and gas and chemical end markets continued in the quarter with underlying orders up 18%. Segment margin of 18.3% improved 40 basis points from the prior year and 590 basis points from the first quarter as volume leverage and cost reduction benefit offset unfavorable product mix and other cost increases. Delayed sales from the supply chain disruption should be recovered by the end of calendar year 2012 as we balance recovering the sales with ensuring product quality is not compromised. Acceleration of backlog conversion and continued strength in new orders will drive sales in the second half. ","Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net sales declined 2% and underlying sales declined 1% as currency translation deducted 1%. By region, the U.S. and Asia declined 1%; Europe was flat; Latin America decreased 5%; and Middle East\/Africa grew 14%. The electrical distribution and ultrasonic welding businesses reflected strong growth, and demand in the global power generating alternators business remains at a high level. The Electrical Drives, fluid automation and HVAC related Hermetic Motors businesses were weak, and solar and wind energy end markets remain challenging as well. Segment margin of 15.8% declined 20 basis points from the prior year as volume deleverage and materials cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and cost reduction benefits. Price cost was favorable and margin improved 100 basis points sequentially as restructuring benefits have started to flow through. Europe's softness will persist into the second half of 2012. The capital goods end markets should remain stable in other regions. ","Moving to Slide 10, Network Power. Network Power net-net sales declined 4% and underlying sales declined 3% as currency translations deducted 1%. Geographically, the U.S. was down 4%; Asia was up 3%; Europe and Latin America decreased 13%; and Middle East\/Africa was down 3%. Telecommunications and IT end markets remained weak, but second half improvement is expected. The Global Data Center business was up, with strong growth in the U.S. and solid growth in Asia. Europe pressure continued. Segment margin of 8.6% declined 70 basis points from the prior year as volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and higher restructuring was partially offset by cost reduction benefit and materials cost decreases. Embedded Computing and Power business returned to profitability and Network Power Systems expanded margins from the prior year. Sequential margin improved 40 basis points despite increased restructuring, continued end market weakness and aggressive product line rationalization. ","Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies' net and underlying sales decreased 9%, with the U.S. down 11%; Asia down 9%; Europe down 12%; Latin America up 25%; and Middle East\/Africa down 3%. U.S. residential end markets were weak, but growth in commercial and refrigeration markets were solid. China was soft but other Asia sales growth was robust. Economic conditions remained challenging in Europe. Segment margin of 17.1% declined 130 basis points from the prior year as volume deleverage and material cost increases were partially offset by higher selling prices and cost reduction benefits. Price cost was favorable, but not enough to maintain margin. U.S. and China markets appear to have bottomed and should improve in the second half of 2012. ","Moving to Slide 12, Commercial & Residential Solutions. Commercial & Residential Solutions net sales grew 4% and underlying sales grew 8% as the divestiture of the Heating Products business in 2011 deducted 4%. By region, the U.S. increased 8%; Asia grew 3%; Europe was down 3%; Latin America grew 25%; and Middle East\/Africa grew 85%. Commercial construction in the U.S. drove demand across the segment with a very strong growth in the Storage businesses. Segment margin of 21.0% improved 90 basis points from the prior year, as price increases, volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset high materials and other cost increases. Price cost was favorable and aggressive restructuring programs over the past 2 years are paying off. Growth should remain solid in the second half of 2012 as U.S. residential end markets improve. ","Finally, on Slide 13, the 2012 outlook. The significant sequential improvement in the second quarter supports our expectations for record sales, profitability and earnings per share in 2012. Recovery of HVAC and telecommunications end markets remains likely, but the pace of improvement are occurring slower than planned. While U.S. economic growth is positive. It is anemic compared to past recoveries and Europe remains weak and has no economic momentum. China, while stabilized and strengthening, has been softer than expected as well. ","Based on current economic conditions, our revised 2012 outlook is as follows: Underlying sales and orders growth, 3% to 5%; reported sales and orders growth, 2% of 4%; operating profit margin, 17.5% to 17.8%; and pretax earnings margin, 15.0% to 15.3%; restructuring expense, approximately $125 million; tax rate approximately 32%; earnings per share $3.35 to $3.50; operating cash flow, $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion; and capital expenditures approximately $700 million. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much, Pat. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I appreciate that. First, I would like to say that on behalf of the OCE and myself and the business leadership, we are clearly not very happy or pleased with our first 6 months of this year. We've had to fight, as you all know, several both internal and external issues as we've gone through the first 6 months. And yet, the second quarter results were not as strong as our expectations just 3 months ago. ","The first issue I would say, looking at it, Emerson Process Management, we have begun a recovery. The order pace has been very strong. We have actually added to our shortfall relative to what we built in the first quarter on the loss at the Thailand board and the supply chain, another $50 million, primarily because in the month end of February, early March, we had to put several of our businesses back on hold as the supply chain basically had some quality issues that we refuse to ship when he had to deal with those. By the end of the month and, as we gone through the whole month of April, we're back up and running full out and we will recover. As we look at it right now, we'll recover the sales which is approximately $300 million that we've missed in the first half of this year. Most of that will be recovered by the end of the fiscal year and we should recover the remaining part of that by the end of this calendar year. The key issue for me is, we will not ship and create quality issues out there, so we want to make sure that it maintains the highest quality integrity of the product. But we are running at very high levels right now and should see a very strong third quarter.","Just coming back from Europe and China, our European business has continued to weaken. Other than Process business, I see continued weakness in Europe and I see no momentum. In fact, I see a continued deterioration in the core market space. Until we see some action and I would say the marketplace relative to the government is trying to get some economic growth back into Europe. But we've been looking at recession all year. The recession, I think, is a little bit deeper now and continues to impact us across our business space, and particularly, some of our export business which some of it would have been going into Asia and other parts of the world, that business is also very weak. China has had a very difficult first 6 months. We do expect that to recover. However, I do not see it to be the same strength as we've seen in previous years. And Brazil has also slid back a little bit this quarter and has actually had a weak second quarter, though, should start turning around as the logic business starts shipping. ","And there has been no recovery at all in the Climate Technology business in the second quarter. We did anticipate a little bit of a recovery. We are now starting to see the order pace come back from North America. I'll comment further on that in a few minutes. But still, for the last 9 months, this business has really struggled and hurt us both at the top line and at the profitability line as we had to manage that cost structure with the volumes being as low as they have been over the last 9 months. But we did make progress on the positive side going from Q1 to Q2, not as much progress as we wanted, not as much progress as we expected, but we did make progress.","The big issue that we face here, I think, in the next 6 to 12 months is the global economy continues to slide, slide a little bit downwards, a little bit weaker. The U.S. economy is holding in and what I call a very moderate growth, maybe 2%, 2.5%, and certain segments are not seeing much growth. But the U.S. economy is growing; it is the global engine of growth right now. And I don't see the rest of the world coming back too much in the second half. Some recovery in a couple of markets, but much weaker international growth than we have seen in the last several years, in particular, Europe, China and Brazil with some recovery in China and Brazil, but very, very little recovery, if any recovery. In fact, I expect negative growth in Europe outside of Process in the second half this year. ","On the positive side, as we look at the business pace today, Process Management always have continued to be strong. They're shipping has continued to ramp up. They are making excellent progress and we have continued to make progress relative to the quality and the global supply chain, and I feel much better where we are today than just 45 days ago. ","Industrial Automation has started to see some of its core markets recover a little bit after -- the last year, the Industrial Automation was up extremely strong, 20% to 30%. We were ahead of the recovery, and now the order pattern have stabilized and I think the order pattern is starting to give us a little bit growth in the second half of the year, in particular in the North American -- in Americas and in Asia Pacific in particular, China, and we're seeing that. I see no recovery in Europe in Industrial Automation. ","The Commercial & Residential Solutions, continues to grow nicely. The residential numbers and the nonresidential numbers in the U.S. continue to support that, and I expect that will continue for the second half of this year as those numbers continue to firm. Climate Technologies, which has had a very difficult 9 months, will start seeing and we are starting to see some recovery. I personally believe the recovery will not be as strong as you expect after 9 very difficult months. I believe the marketplace only has so much growth in it right now. I think people are going to be very cautious, though we do see the recovery, but it's not going to be anywhere close to the type of recovery you would expect after being down as where they are. But the recovery is happening. I would expect recovery in Climate both in U.S. and in China which we're already seeing for the last 45 days. So that part are very positive. ","From my perspective, I'll expect the Network Power Systems will continue to make progress. They made progress this quarter. North America, our Data Center business was good. Our Asia Data Center business was good. Our European Data Center business was not good, and that market is driven primarily because of the weak European economy. The embedded power and computing continues to make progress and their turnaround. They went from a break-even loss position in the first quarter to making money. The pruning continues. It's our estimate, it's around $25 million in each of the quarters. It's the best way-- that's what we can give at this point in time, but they're continuing to make progress. They've got control of the -- I would say the order and sales pattern right now and the profitability has continued to improve and will continue to improve in the second half. As we look at it right now, our orders, our current backlog, the recovery within Emerson Process Management, which has begun quite strongly and has continued well in April, will continue. We're looking around 2 $7 billion quarters. And relative to delivering our profitability in the second half of the year, we need incremental profitability a base like 40%. We just delivered 45% in the second quarter, so we're looking at a much higher sales volume around 40% incremental profitability. The company is geared up to that. I believe that we have the capacity right now, we have the capability and there's always the issues coming out, it's around the world, but I feel we have based on the new in underlying sales growth of 3% to 5% because of the weaker Europe and China and the profitability base flow-through and our cost structure and the restructuring efforts underway which will continue to be positive, I think we have this well and focused to where we think the year is going to be point in time both from an earnings standpoint, underlying growth standpoint and a margin standpoint. I feel we've gone through this in great detail as we closed out the quarter, looking at the pluses and minuses and looking at the momentum through April. So I feel, after reviewing this report today, that we have this pretty well boxed and focused at this point in time. ","Again, I want to say that myself and the OCE and the businesses are not pleased with the results in the first 6 months. No one's happy. We do not like to hurt our shareholder base. We take our shareholder base very seriously and we take this company very seriously and the performance of this company very seriously. We did have good improvement in the second quarter, but it wasn't as strong as we wanted and we will continue to improve as we in to go into this third quarter and we already see it in the month of April. ","Relative to our cash management, we are online to generate somewhere between $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion of operating cash flow. From my perspective, the inventory performance is actually improving. We're sitting at pretty close to record levels of days on hand already. The inventory dollars has started to climb -- or reduced, so that's good news. And we have from our standpoint, the rest of asset management in pretty good shape. Payables will continue to decline -- days continue to get weaker because we are cutting inventory and we're actually starting cutting spending and we have been cutting spending both in capital: one, I see a weaker global economy; and two, to make sure we'd keep our cost in line with the uncertainty of what's going to come at us in early 2013, both in Europe with very little recovery in sight; I think China will continue to weaken and the uncertainty of North America with what potentially could hit all of us, companies here in the U.S. will have certainly relative to the fiscal and monetary policies coming out of Washington. ","Capital spending will continue to be a little bit under $700 million or around $700 million in that range right there. So pretty much from the standpoint of where we sit right now, we see what we have to get done. I feel confident the business leader, the OCEs feel confident that we will deliver the second half, again, after a very challenging first half, but we have things in line, things in order where we need to be at this point in time and we know exactly what has to be done from restructuring, from shipments, the delivery backlog, getting the inventory down and the cash management. And from the standpoint of Emerson executives, we know what has to be done and I feel confident that we'll get it done. So again, I want to apologize for the questionable results in the first half of this year and I look forward to answering some of the questions and comments coming out it's here on the phone. And with that, I'll open the line. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I just start off with a question around the extra costs you actually had in the quarter on the supply chain and inefficiencies that -- how much was there really in that result and how much do you expect going forward, so in terms of expediting airfreight, line ramps, things like that?","David N. Farr","I mean, it's a number we have. I don't have on the finger tips of my hands, but I mean I would -- Frank, what do you say?-- about $35 million. Around $35 million, so between $30 million and $40 million in the quarter. Well, it's more than that-- is that for -- I'm sorry it's about $12 million for the second quarter, I apologize, what's the number there? Frank just showed me the numbers, and about $5 million. It's around -- I'd say around $40 million for the whole year. Therefore, we're going to be running around $10 million, $11 million for the second half of the year, per quarter. We'll be eating that cost.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. so, $10 million, $11 million run rate for the next 2. And then presumably, you're saying that you're finished at that point, right?","David N. Farr","Right now, based on the fact that we put some things on hold, I mean, there's no way I'm going to allow quality problems. We've already hurt our customers once. I'm not going to hurt them twice, and so I would say that we'll probably have that -- probably somewhere between $5 million and $10 million in the fourth calendar quarter. It'll take us all the way after this calendar year to get this done. It's pretty even now, I mean we're going to get the biggest chunk out in the first -- of the third and fourth and we'll get some leftover in the first fiscal quarter next year?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then the second question is on the underlying core growth assumptions that you've talked about. My math tells me somewhere between 6.5% to 10% implied underlying growth for the second half to hit the 3% to 5% for the full year. So I'm not sure how close that is to what you're thinking. But if that's true, that's telling me I've got to have or you've got to have a pretty big take-up in Climate, in Network. Hopefully, PM has got to continue growing strongly and IA has got to be positive, I think. So how are -- maybe you could just walk for your expectations then?","David N. Farr","Frank, do you have your chart there? Where's the number? I'll get the number here. Give me one second, Steve. Okay. You're approximately right. They can probably be somewhere between, it's going to average between 6% and 8% depending on which quarter. Some-- 1 quarter can probably be 7%, 1 quarter would be about 8%, something like that. I mean, that's our current expectations, I'd say 6% to 8% per quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And across the business units, what -- how you're sort of...","David N. Farr","The big drivers are going to be, from our standpoint, you have Commercial & Residential Solutions has been averaging about 7% in the first half of this year. Climate Technology does go positive and we see the order pace that haven't gone positive. I'm a little bit concerned about how fast and how sustainable, so -- and you're looking at mid-single digits here from my perspective. Industrial Automation is going to be low to mid single digit. Network Power will actually stabilize and be in that mid 5%, 6%, 7% type of range, and Process is going to be obviously very strong in the second half of the year, above where it was in the second quarter. So -- I mean the second quarter's around 14%, so it's going above that. It's going to be somewhere between 15% and 20%, somewhere in that range.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And I guess I'll speak one last one in. Just thinking about the last 60-plus days, and what is it that's sort of -- what's been the most surprising to you both on your internal information flow and externally, if you think about where you step in and where you're sitting now, that sort of changed?","David N. Farr","I mean -- from my perspective, there's 2 things that happened: One, I did not plan to have to shut down some of my Process business again for a quality board. We moved a lot of boards, and the board that go into some of the instrumentation businesses, and when I moved that board, we had a very strict quality control and, unfortunately, had some time there that they were producing bad boards. I did not anticipate that unfortunately. We've got that corrected, but when you move that many board that quickly, one would have to expect that. But that hurt us. I wasn't surprised internally. And secondly I did actually expect to see more. I actually saw -- expected to see some recovery in the month of March. Typically, our -- this industry has always built a little bit ahead of time, but there's been no build at all, in fact, there's been continued liquidation almost all the way up to the end. And so we're obviously operating in a different norm now. We're basically going to be operating as orders book and go. I mean there's not going to be any build at all in this industry and the climate in the industry around the world. So those are 2 different things that really impacted us in the second quarter and I mean that's where we are. It's just the fact of life that climate business is at a very difficult year and you would expect it with the consumer spending, that we'd see more business spending in the climate area which we have not seen. And now we're starting to see some -- but the automotive -- if you look at where there is support in the second quarter, half the U.S. GDP was automotive sale a.k.a., not housing or air conditioning for housing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, in Embedded Power, back in February, you talked about launching a fix or exit strategy. And hoping you could give us an update. We saw on the slide comments about aggressive product line rationalization. But any color in terms of where you are in that evaluation would be helpful.","David N. Farr","There's no change, and the strategy right now is we are on an aggressive restructuring fix of business, and that's where we are this point in time, and there will be nothing other than that focus internally and with that operation, and -- so there's nothing new to add there this point in time. The key thing for me is to fix this business, and I saw progress in the quarter, which is a positive, and I expect to see continued progress here as we move into this quarter here. And so we will start seeing a better result within that business as we get into this quarter. That's where we are.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great, and on the process side, the recovery out of Thailand, while it's -- just to clarify, have there been any cancellations of size in that backlog?","David N. Farr","No. In fact our backlog and order paces continue to be very strong. We've been working with our customers. We're spending an extraordinary amount of money to make sure we support our customers and shift stuff around and expedite. I mean it's really difficult even though we have an estimate of like $35 million, $40 million for the year, the cost of doing this, it's really hard to estimate that. So the key issue to me is that's why we should -- I mean, we'd put the word out very clearly. Any question on quality, you shut it down and confirm it. Because you do not want to have 2 hiccups here and we have not had any. And from my perspective, that's very important in our backlog and support happens to be very strong at this point in time, so we've got to get back in.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And last question for me. On China, you had talked earlier about an expectation of a soft landing, but then perhaps a reinvestment by the government in the second half. Are you seeing any of that, just mentioned discussion about some investment in nonres and energy be interested, if you're seeing it and how you might be positioned for that.","David N. Farr","We are seeing some improvement in business environment spending right now, Deane. It's not nearly the type of the recovery that we had seen historically when they turned this on. I think there's still a lot of issues relative to the government. There's a lot of issues internally going on in that country right now. And so I think from the perspective of how much money is going to reinvested in trying to revitalize a weaker economy, I didn't see -- I have not seen the magnitude of investment. Though we are seeing from the Industrial Automation, the Process stand, the Climate standpoint, the Network Power standpoint, the orders for the last 45 days and continued this month have been good. So I do anticipate a stronger second half, so I do not see the same second half that you would normally expect in the top of mode that we would see from a recovery standpoint in China. So it's better, it's still growing, but it's not going to be anywhere close to what I thought it'd be. We'll take an underlying sales die. Just -- I can't bank on this at this point in time.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Any lift from the energy investments they're making?","David N. Farr","Yes. We -- I mean we see that. We do see that benefit right now in the Process and also in the Climate area. So the answer is yes. But it's not going to be -- the investment that's going in is not anywhere close to magnitude of investments that we've seen historically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, I guess the first question is really on the incremental margins. I mean, you mentioned sequentially those were about 45%. In the March quarter that was a similar run rate, sort of incrementally and decrementally in the prior 2. So I guess if we think about the June and September quarters, you're guiding for that to be about 40%. When you look at the next 2 quarters versus what you had seen in March, just looking at Page 3 of your slides, I mean you call out a bunch of factors there around the operating profit line. I guess volume deleverage, we know, goes away from the order book. Other cost increases you've already quantified that around $10 million, $11 million a quarter, so there's no big change there. Cost reductions, they're sort of in the back from prior restructuring. I guess the 2 things that are left unfavorable for that mix and the price increases. So could you talk little bit about those 2 points and how you think they're going to affect the second half versus the other which you just had?","David N. Farr","Our price increases in certain businesses -- we have from a pricing increase standpoint that goes in, in the middle, early part of the second quarter, so there are price increases are holding at this point in time and they're in. So we should start seeing the benefit of those in the second half. I feel very good about that at that point in time, if the volume holds up. I mean, clearly, if you don't get volume, you don't get the price. Relative to -- from my perspective, mix at this point in time, we are -- I mean, when -- if you look at the very businesses that are going to start coming in to play here, the Climate Technology turns positive, given the fact it's around 18% profitability margin, that will help us from that standpoint. The fact that they've been negative and they've held their deleverage recently well, and those model scales haven been down, but that's going to be a positive standpoint. Commercial & Residential Solutions are going to be positive for us in that standpoint and then Process Management will continue to be a positive for our standpoint. On the cost reductions and restructuring and in Industrial Automation, that benefit is starting to flow. We saw that in March and I feel better that we will continue to see improved profitability in Industrial Automation the second half of the year, which we forecasted and we'll continue to forecast. I will update everybody relative to an EPG, relative to the underlying sales and profitability of the segments when we're together in EPG and we'll stand relative to what we said in February.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sure. And then just a quick follow-up, keeping it at the overall sort of Emerson level, I mean your sales about flat year-on-year. Your earnings about flat year-on-year. I mean, does that -- when you see that, does that make you want to accelerate the restructuring or accelerate portfolio change? Because I guess, you don't want to be a company that's just relying on volume leverage. With flat sales, it would be good to have some sort of earnings growth through price or cost savings or -- are you sort of thinking about the restructuring and maybe you are trying to accelerate that or...","David N. Farr","From a restructuring standpoint, we are accelerating already. We're trying to do as much restructuring as we possibly can and particular in Western Europe. And we've got some underway here in North America. But I think from a restructuring standpoint, we've now got -- we've got to geared up at a level as we go into -- finish the second quarter going the third quarter as highest level as we can handle at the company. Relative to our repositioning assets, at this point in time, I mean we've just gone through what I would call 2 or 3 very good challenging quarters. I want this things to stabilize before -- I mean get a better sense of underlying business before I make any more shock treatments. But I still believe the mix of our company still has a very good underlying growth rate and we're just going through a couple of shocks here, so I'm not ready to overreact based on 1 or 2 quarters, Julian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So on Process, I mean, how far from optimal would you say was operating in the quarter? I mean, you talked about being at full strength it began in April. I guess, one, how far were you from optimal in the March quarter? And what's your confidence that this April rate can sustain?","David N. Farr","I mean, if you look at optimal, we are probably $50 million to $75 million below where we should have been in the second quarter. I mean, it was a pretty good quarter. I mean we're up 14% and we had pretty good profitability. And so from my perspective, if I look at the second half of the year, if I look at third quarter, I mean I feel very confident based on what I see right now, based on the plant structure, based on the inputs going in, the order of pattern which again continues to stay ahead of those. I feel pretty confident that these guys are going to be running pretty close to full out. I don't think they're going to be running 100% full out, but I think they're going to be running a lot closer than they did in the second quarter. I feel -- I mean everyone's focused on this and we've got the management team focused and the quality of the boards have held up and the quality of supply chain. We don't make them in Thailand anymore. We're out of Thailand, but we've gotten in started around -- different places around the world. And so that chain is working pretty well at this point in time.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Dave, I wanted to ask you a question about taxes. I mean your tax rates got up another point, so you're at 32%. I mean you're now about 7 points above the peer group average. I mean, you have any updated views on corporate tax reform or if you plan to do anything to work on the tax rate?","David N. Farr","What's going on right now is our U.S. business is stronger. And from a standpoint of -- if you look at our mix of business, our U.S. actually had a couple of very good quarters here relative to our profitability in some of the -- we've given China, given some of the other marketplaces has a lower tax rate like Europe, that's hurt us. Right now, we're very eagerly working with tax reform because we clearly are a player that has been impacted by this and we do not have offshore deals. And that right now, we'll work with that and we're going to keep working that and that's where we are.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So first on the guidance and just trying to parse out downside from this quarter versus the outlook side, it certainly sounds like you're expecting still the acceleration at the back part of the year. How much of the downward guidance move was really just part of the 2Q underperformance versus actually pulling it down at the back half of the year?","David N. Farr","I mean, from my perspective, and in Q2, I mean, the underperformance, depends what you call -- people have forecast out there for us in Q2, that's not -- I don't give guidance forecast and that necessarily would have ticked an 80% -- $0.80 guidance for the second quarter. So I would say that a couple of pennies on an average are from the first quarter -- from the second quarter and the remaining comes from the second -- back of the year as I pulled down both China, Europe and a little bit of Latin America.","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Makes sense. And then on the climate tech side of the things, I obviously, saw the improvement. Could you just talk a little bit about the inventory levels and then also whether or not you're seeing similar trends in the hermetic side and your Industrial Automation business?","David N. Farr","The inventory levels in the channel are extremely low. Our inventory levels are extremely low. The order pace is picking up, and we'll see -- this is going to be now 1 month thing. We've got to see sustained improvement in North America, so I'm very concerned about how sustainable that is given the fact that the residential numbers have been improving, but it hasn't been improving all that well and it actually has been kind of choppy, so we'll see what happens here. And what was -- what's the other part of that question?","Michael Halloran - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just whether you're seeing the same trends under Hermetic Motors side?","David N. Farr","Well, Hermetic Motors move exactly with our compressor business because that's what it is, one in the same.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, we haven't talked about cash reinvestment and all, I mean you got a stock that is probably at the level now where share repurchase starts to make some sense. I mean, where do you have -- What are you thinking there?","David N. Farr","We talked that we've been doing share repurchases. As you know, we have a set, type based on where the stock price goes. If the stock price goes down, we buy more. And as it goes up, we buy less. So right now based on our communication working with the finance committee today, we will be increasing it and we will be increasing it here as we go into the second half of this year.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Dave, I'm still trying to get a feel for how you feel about guidance. Maybe this isn't fair, but you view it as realistic, conservative, optimistic. I mean it still feels like there's a back half recovery baked in, particularly in China that may or may not come to fruition. So how do you think about that?","David N. Farr","I think I've told you this before, at my level of guidance, I do not say guidance out there so low that I'm trying -- that my dog, Zorro, can jump over. I set a guidance, what I believe based on -- talking to my business leaders and the OCE that I feel is a realistic balanced guidance, that's the way it is. And I'm not a CEO; I've never been a CEO that set guidance so low that anyone can beat it. It's not the way I do it. I run the company based on pushing the guidance as hard as we can. Sometimes, we make it, sometimes we don't make it. So that's where we sit. And yes, the forecast is -- has a second half recovery. Our business always has a second half recovery. And so from my perspective, it's a little bit more this year than normal, but I do not feel uncomfortable with this based on where I see the global economies both from China, Europe and the United States at this point in time. So we have to execute, and so do I feel comfortable I gave you guidance that we can make? Answer is yes. Do I give you guidance I think that I could trip over? The answer is no. I believe that we have a fair balanced guidance right now. That's where I am. That's been that way for 12 years.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, yes. Now, I get it. Can we just really quickly move to climate in China? I mean there's been -- I think you guys and most of your competitors added a fair amount of capacity and that the growth really hasn't come through. Have you seen any price leakage or any kind of structural changes there that make you nervous for the recovery?","David N. Farr","No, there really hasn't been. From a price standpoint, our pricing stays in line with inflation and we price accordingly. Our product is not a commodity. And so from my perspective right now, I see nothing that's changed in the fundamental of business model of proposition that we have in China and it continues to be very good business for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So Dave, I get the comment about the guidance being balanced. The achievability of targets is important to a lot of your investors. Where do you see you're most confident in your guidance? Is it top line acceleration? Or do you feel most confident in achievability of your margin targets?","David N. Farr","Obviously, I feel very confident that we'll deliver the margin target. I feel pretty confident we'll deliver within that. Obviously, margin is more confident than the sales. But within the range sales, I feel very confident we'll deliver that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. In the second half margins, my calculations suggest that margins need to be 19.5% or above at the OM level. We haven't seen that level absolutely before. What is driving that? I understand the Process Management is going to have a very strong second half of the year, but it seems -- Climate needs to be in that range as well. I mean, do you endorse that Climate in that 19% range and Process Management in the low 20s?","David N. Farr","I mean I've not calculated the 19.5% range. I mean I can't tell you that's the right number, not the right number. I mean, I do know that profitability will be stronger in the second half of the year because of the mix and because we're running basically $7 billion quarters. And so from my perspective right now, the 40% incremental margin looks fairly realistic, and I think that I feel very good that we'll deliver that number.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's great to hear. And then finally, Dave, when you talk about inventories in the Climate business, can you maybe talk about where else you see in inventory headwinds. It sounds like Network Power has been an area we've seen some of it as well. But if I look at Industrial Automation, U.S. down 1%, this is IP growth about 4%. It sounds like you got some issues there as well. Can you talk about that as well?","David N. Farr","I mean, from the standpoint out there in the industrial segment, I think they've been working some inventories off. Some of the issues that we're such a strong growth last year and I think now that the slowdown -- it's been a very spotty recovery. In certain industries, we have done well. In certain industries, we have not done well. I don't sense a lot of it in inventory in the industrial areas, but there are some and I think that, that's being worked off. From my standpoint, the Network Power business, I think that you're seeing -- we had a strong business in North America. We had a strong business in Asia-Pacific. Europe is really -- is very weak and continues to weaken. I think that there's probably little bit of capacity issue we have here in North America, where people build up. And if the economy continues to muddle along in this 2% to 2.5% range, I think you could see some issues relative to what I would say capacity in that industry, too much capacity, but the inventory levels are starting to come down across North America. I think they were built -- if you look at GDP in the first quarter, inventories did help GDP. I think the industry will continue to bring some inventory down as we go into the next 2 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","To dig in on, not to dwell on U.S. HVAC, but it seems like some of the OEMs there have been pretty positive exiting March and entering April. I understand there's a bit of a delay, but some of them have been talking about orders, order of magnitude, strong double-digit 20% or more and you seem to be talking about a more tepid recovery than that and inventory is still being lean. Are you guys still waiting for those orders to come through further down the supply chain or there's no inventory draw at the OEM level?","David N. Farr","There's no inventory draw at the OEM. From our perspective, we work day to day with our OEM customers, and you can go for a week, strong 10%, 20% growth. But then you could go for a week where there's no growth. So I wanted to see sustained growth in this -- in order pattern. Two weeks doesn't make a quarter to me based -- and after just the last 9 months we've gone through with these OEMs. So from our position, we have a very strong position in North America, and the industry basically performs and we'll perform right with it. So I know what's going on in the industry. And from my perspective right now, the order pattern has picked up. It's gone positive and we'll see that sustained through May, June, July. The year's now shorter. With March gone, the year -- what I'd call the AC year has now gotten shorter. That's the negatives-- that's one of the negative takeaway that we did not see any recovery in March. We saw the -- last couple of days going into early April. But we'll see how that -- those orders sustain as the whole quarter goes forward.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Great. And you mentioned at the Analyst Day maybe a bit of a pinch on that supply chain if the OEMs wait too long. Is that still a concern of yours?","David N. Farr","The only concern I have was if they try to turnaround from 0 to 50%. I don't think from the capacity, they have a lot of extra capacity and we have lots of extra capacity. They are bringing it up and we're communicating with them. They communicate with us very nicely. I commend them on -- towards the end of March, they started talking to us about -- they're bringing line rates up, which is very important, and we start adjusting with them. So I think we've been in sync. We've had our discussions, we're in sync and we're going up very nicely together. There's lots of capacity out there in North America. I mean, the housing market in the investment and the housing market has got a long way to go before it comes anywhere close back to where it was just 4 or 5 years ago.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Understood. And if I can sneak one more in on Process Management, should we expect kind of normal seasonality in the 3Q to 4Q margin bump?","David N. Farr","We're going to be screwing up here for -- I mean I explained this to my board. With what's happened to us in the first quarter, what's happened in the second quarter, what's going to happen on third and fourth quarter. Seasonality comparisons, unfortunately, again I apologize for our mess up the first half, but that's going to be very difficult. And so you're going to see extraordinarily high profitability coming through. Because as we've got things ramped up both in the Process side and our total consolidated numbers, I think something that Scott just pointed out to me or someone else just pointed out to me the question, and so you can't pattern seasonality here right now. It's very difficult.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Okay. So I get -- does that mean that in Process margin, 3Q and 4Q should look similar or -- I guess I'm just trying to understand...","David N. Farr","Right now, I'm looking at pretty -- I mean the fourth quarter typically will be a stronger quarter for Process. I still think that will be the case. And the only thing will be different, the profitability will be the mix of any big systems or big projects slip out the door. But typically, Process has a stronger fourth quarter. And I would expect that would still be the case, but it's going to be very difficult to pattern out a seasonality. Typically, the fourth quarter profitability and fourth quarter sales for Process is bigger. It's the way it's always been.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I'm wondering if you might talk a little bit in terms of the second half improvement in organic revenues at Network Power, a little bit of color between what you're expecting for Data Center versus Embedded versus Telecom and sort of any color in terms of the visibility you have on that acceleration, whether it's backlog and Data Center or just comps in the other businesses or whatever else is giving you the confidence there?","David N. Farr","Well, as I look at the embedded, we are looking at some moderate growth from the standpoint that -- one, we've some of the pruning done and we actually have some underlying business as some of our customer base actually sees a little bit of growth. I'm looking at what I would say, low single-digit type of growth there. As I look at the telecom, we are starting to see some orders, though it's not been really strong. If you look at the telecom spend in the quarter that we just went through, around the world, it was not good. We are starting to see some stability and some improvement there. So again, we're looking at some recovery in the telecom. And I'm hoping it's going to be north of 5%. I mean, right now, we don't have a lot of visibility. That business is -- it's pretty tight from the standpoint of what our customer base does go there. So it's very tight relative to 30-day, 60-day type of numbers, and that's about how we get there. On the data center marketplace, I think the U.S. will continue to do reasonably well. I think Asia could you do reasonably well. I think Europe will continue to weaken. And so we're looking at, what I would say, solid single digits in the space, with the Data Center being our best; telecom probably the next best; and embedded being the weakest of the 3. The telecom right now, we need to make sure the telecom customers continue to order and build out the inventory of their infrastructure and then they're just starting to do it. That's the wildcard there.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. Just couple of follow-ups there. Is there any inventory dynamic here in any of these 3 businesses, probably not Data Center, but maybe in Telecom or Embedded that was in the context there.","David N. Farr","The inventory has been worked out in both those spaces. The telecom was worked out over the last 9 months and embedded has been worked out over the last 9 months, big-time worked out. So I think the inventories are in pretty good shape and both those space, and the Data Centers, too. The Data Center capacity comes in place if they get ahead of what the needs are in the corporate world. And they say, slow it down, we don't need it anymore. That's where inventory comes in.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you remind us how big Europe as a percentage of the Data Center business is now? I mean is it just the L Chloride business essentially?","David N. Farr","We have -- if you look at our European -- let me get a number here, I'll give you an idea. Give me a number for the whole -- do you the other European number for your Network Power? Our European business, and I wouldn't have guessed about 1\/3, but it's still pretty significant.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And when you say getting worse, I mean in terms of rates of change, are we going from single digits to double digits?","David N. Farr","No, no. I think you're looking at -- I mean, if you look at -- I want to look at the total Europe for the first, second quarter, total year for the second quarter, Network Power. Network Power is around here. Network Power is about $200 million, plus embedded. That was $200 million. It's a significant piece of our business. This is around $200 million in a quarter. And you asked the question on -- pardon?","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Where you see those rates in Europe?","David N. Farr","I think from my perspective, we were looking at some improvement, so we're looking at moderate growth there. I think we're going to be looking at probably flat type of growth, that there's just been no improvement at all and it's been slight negative. I think Europe right now, you're going to be looking from 0 minus 5 to plus a couple of points in a couple of our space outside Process. It could depend on a couple of orders, depends on exports and stuff like that, but it's not a magnitude chain, if that chain -- if that's what you're trying to get at.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you threw out a $25 million number. It sounded like that's where you saw profitability, operating profits for the Embedded Power business in 3Q, 4Q?","David N. Farr","No, no. What I threw out there is what I call pruning. It doesn't look at what I would call underlying pruning in the second quarter of Embedded Power, Computing sales, that was about $25 million.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly shifting over to Industrial Automation and again the same question, if we get a little bit of color on the segments with regards to the second half acceleration growth, that'd be helpful.","David N. Farr","I mean, from our perspective right now, we're seeing our second half improvement in North America, Latin America, and Asia in Industrial Automation. We had a very strong first half last year, so the comps are very difficult, there's a little bit easier comps now and we're starting to see a little bit of old momentum. I look at Europe being down in the second half in Industrial Automation. I see no recovery from that standpoint.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sorry I was thinking more about of the businesses, so electrical distribution versus power gen versus fluid Automation, et cetera.","David N. Farr","I would say -- I mean I'm not going to give you numbers for each businesses, but I would say the power gen business is going to continue to be pretty strong both in North America and Asia. And electrical distribution is okay because of the channels, so I would say, it's going to be a mid single-digit number and the automotive type -- so we have business that goes in automotive, that's doing pretty well, too. So Europe is the one area that it's going to be negative. The rest of the world's going to be positive. So I think it's going to be okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Just a question, I always have to play with numbers. You took guidance down by a $0.10, of which looks like the tax rate is $0.05. You gave us $40 million of costs associated with trying to catch up, which is another $0.03 or $0.04. You've got pruning of inventories and restructuring of businesses. I mean, is it basically the whole guidance change reflecting these ongoing side course embedded with the U.S. profitability tax rate.","David N. Farr","I mean Eli, I don't know where you come up with those numbers. That's not how we built that. Our tax rate did not move that much to create $0.05.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Well, you got 31% to 32% of guidance, and that's $0.05 on a year.","Frank J. Dellaquila","We didn't move a full point at a tax rate.","David N. Farr","Yes, we didn't move -- I mean the numbers you're talking about -- I mean, with the guidance change, and by the embedded costs, we actually have been looking at that cost ever since we started the recovery so we had embedded in some that cost already from the Process standpoint. Primarily, the underlying sales, the lower sales. And with that lower sales, a tad lower underlying profitability from the business and a little bit of disruption of the business, that's how we got that and maybe a tad, a little bit from tax rate, but it wasn't $0.05 for tax rate.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So these are more rounding as opposed to major changes. And excluding Process, how much of the business is European across the company, fitting process how much [indiscernible]? Your process in Europe is not a real threat, but the rest of the business...","David N. Farr","I mean, I wouldn't call it a threat. I just don't see the recovery. I think that Process -- the European business was down in the first half of the year. I think excluding Process will be flat or slightly down. Our total European business is how big, I'll give you a total number, $6 billion approximately; and Process is -- $5 billion and process is $1.8 billion, Europe.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And that $1.8 billion is in the $6 billion.","David N. Farr","$1.6 billion is process. $1.6 billion of the $5 billion is process. And -- so if you look at the second half of the year, I think outside of Process, that will be flat to down as it was in the first half, too. I just don't see any recovery. We did see some recovery, but I see no momentum and I see nothing in Europe that's going to give us that.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And can you make some comments on Latin America, and particularly Brazil, you said it was down. But that's a one market that will try to accelerate in the second half of the year?","David N. Farr","Well, we have a lot of big projects that were held back and we do expect those projects to come forward. I mean the economy in Brazil has definitely weakened. And obviously, the impact of some of those raw materials has definitely weak in that economy. So I do expect -- Latin America, we had a very good quarter and I expect us to have a really good quarter, but I don't think Brazil is going to be playing a stronger role as it originally was. So I think Brazil economy is weak right now and I don't see it strengthening all that much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Dave, on the European outlook, at the beginning of the year, you talked about sales growth in Europe and the market is worse than what you originally thought. Based on -- I know some other people have asked questions that you've given some color around it, but it sounds like though, the market share gains that you were expecting in Process and, to a lesser extent, in Network Power, have those materialized? And are you thinking just Europe's going to be flat for you for the year at this point?","David N. Farr","I mean I can't tell you, market share gains in the quarter. I think you've got to wait a year, you're going wait for a little bit after the year to see if you actually gained share. But right now if I look at Europe in total, I do expect a little bit of growth because of Process, but not much. I mean I expected some of our businesses that were export-driven to have a little bit of growth coming out of Europe. That has not materialized because of the overall weaker economies. So right now I would say we still expecting some moderate growth in Europe and -- but not anywhere close to where it was. I originally thought -- because I thought there have been more export. But that's where it is right now.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then on Network Power, are you seeing in Europe specifically, are you seeing any more competitive pressures there or is this just a function?","David N. Farr","No, I mean, ever since, the competitive environment's gotten extremely challenging and tough since we bought Chloride, and that is expected when Schneider bought APC, everyone mobilized against them. The same thing -- this industry when someone does a movement like this, that's a window open to attack, and that's what's going on. It'll take a couple of years first thing to stabilizing them. We're going through restructuring right now in Europe and so I think the European market is unfolding for us in Network Power which I thought it hasn't made any big change.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a couple of things. A lot of questions about guidance. Just 2 things. And the prior question caught it a little bit. I mean there's so much movement around obviously with macro and then these internal issues. But there is an element, though, that it feels like there's share loss going on and it is hard to pinpoint in a quarter or anything, but your comments on like fluid automation sounds tougher than Eaton and Parker. The Electrical Drives comments sound tougher than Rockwell and ABB. I mean Telco, TI sounds a little better. Is this kind of feels like there's a bunch of stuff moving around and maybe there's too much noise and all the macro that really ascertain exactly what's going on, but just stepping back and kind of thinking about the portfolio and what's going on competitively, do you feel like you're holding your own? Are you seeing some fresh competition from people that stepping it up relative to what you might have seen historically?","David N. Farr","I don't think that's changed that much. I don't think you can look at a quarter or 6 months. Those businesses -- all those businesses you mentioned had extremely, extremely strong 2011 numbers. Different customer base from the standpoint of what we serve and the other guys you mentioned serve. I do not sense based on our business performance looking at the underlying macro or individual markets basis that we've had competitive issues, different than we've had before, and I don't sense -- I mean it's all said and done that we'll have anything changed that dramatically from what the market's doing. So I don't sense that, Jeff. And as you know, I'm pretty close to that stuff and I don't sense that.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay. I mean just one last thing, your comments on China were pretty clear. I think you also said, though, in your opening comments that you expected China to continue to weaken in 2013. So just some thoughts on that you are expecting a little bit of a stimulus bump and you think it might stay into next year?","David N. Farr","Yes. I think that if you look at the global marketplace, if you look at their export markets and there's not a whole lot of recovery and it's basically stagnant type of growth, I think that China will continue to have weaker -- just fundamental economic pace as you go into 2013. If the U.S. stays at a very moderate growth in the 2% to 2.5% and Europe stays basically at no growth or negative growth, those are very, very important markets for China. And yes, I know there's a lot of talk about turning this into a consumer-led economy there. But from the standpoint -- the capital spending, the export business is still very, very important for the China marketplace. So as I look at the onetime money they put back in there, they still have some structural issues they have to deal with. So I think -- I firmly believe they're going to allow the growth to modulate down a little bit more again next year to allow that working off some of these issues that have built up over several years, Jeff. That's my call. I mean it's my feel and I have a pretty good feel for China. ","And again, I want to thank everybody for the call and I appreciate the questions and hopefully we gave you some insight. If I confuse people, I'm sure Pat, he wrote everything down, he'll unconfuse you and -- or try to. So thank you very much and take care. I'll see everybody soon.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, August 2, 2016.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Renee. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Button Bell, Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2016 results and also provide an update on Emerson's business transformation. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days.","I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 7% versus the prior year to $5.1 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. The third quarter results reflected the continuation of challenging demand conditions in our key served markets.","Oil and gas spending, both capital investment and operational expenditures, remained at significantly depressed levels. Automation markets in North America have been extremely challenging, as anticipated improvements in spending did not materialize as we had forecast. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure demand continue to be favorable, while global air conditioning and refrigeration and U.S. construction markets were mixed.","The trailing three-month orders for June were down 6.7% on a GAAP basis, with underlying trends down 4.4% excluding approximately 2% for currency translation. Adjusted earnings per share, which excludes $37 million of separation cost, decreased 5% to $0.80. Reported earnings per share were $0.74. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $718 million.","Turning to slide three, despite lower than expected sales, EBIT margin increased 20 basis points versus the prior year driven by benefits from restructuring actions and solid operational execution within our businesses. No additional shares were repurchased during the quarter; and separation costs were significantly lower than expected.","Turning to slide four, underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results by region were similar to the second quarter as the global environment for business investment remains challenging.","Turning to slide five, total segment margin was up 50 basis points to 16% as three segments reported improved margins. Both the Climate Technology and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments reported up margins despite lower volumes. And improved cost structure resulted in operating cash flow of $718 million in the quarter. Capital spending continues to be reduced, in line with overall business conditions.","Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales decreased 13% in the quarter. Energy spending, particularly in North America, continues to be reduced as customers evaluate the stability of current oil and gas prices, while power and life sciences markets continue to provide growth.","Restructuring programs will be further increased in response to weak demand conditions from global oil and gas customers and the expectation that weaker conditions will continue into 2017. Segment margin decreased 290 basis points primarily due to a sharp volume reduction and the resulting deleverage, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions.","Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation third quarter underlying sales declined 11%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial spending and upstream oil and gas capital investments, while wind projects remain favorable for the drives business.","Segment margin decreased 110 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Mixed demand forecasts among the businesses are expected to result in improved levels of sales and profitability in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide eight, Network Power underlying sales increased 10% in the quarter as strong order trends in both data center and telecommunications infrastructure markets translated into positive growth. Sales increased in all regions except Europe, which reflected a difficult comparison to the prior year from large project revenues.","Segment margin improved 550 basis points to 9.1%, driven by volume leverage and savings from restructuring actions. Benefits from restructuring actions and new product programs support the expectation for continued margin improvement in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide nine, Climate Technology's underlying sales decreased 1% in the quarter as decreases in Asia and the Middle East more than offset increases in other regions. Underlying sales growth in North America and Europe reflected low-single digit growth in both the air conditioning and commercial refrigeration businesses.","Segment margin increased 270 basis points to 22.4%, primarily due to savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment, partially offset by lower pricing. The near term outlook for global demand in our served market supports the expectation for modest sales growth in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 10, underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment decreased 1% as growth in food waste disposers was offset by declines in all other businesses, which were impacted by customer-driven inventory reductions.","Segment margin improved 380 basis points to 24.4%, reflecting the impact of the divestiture, savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Modest levels of underlying growth are expected in the fourth quarter as we anticipate favorable conditions in U.S. construction to continue and channel inventory reduction should be complete.","Turning to slide 11. Earlier today, we announced agreements to sell our Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques businesses for a combined value of $5.2 billion, which is in line with the guidance we provided at our February Investor Conference. These agreements represent a significant step forward in the overall portfolio repositioning strategy we announced last year in June.","And with these agreements now in place, the strategic repositioning squarely focuses on acquisitions within our core platforms of Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions, as Emerson management and the board determine how best to redeploy the cash proceeds from these divestitures.","Turning to slide 12. The third quarter results continue to reflect the low growth global environment facing our businesses today; and the outlook remains challenging as markets will continue to be impacted by reduced levels of investment spending, weaker global economics and political uncertainty.","Considering these conditions, coupled with the fact that anticipated improvement in order trends did not materialize, the company now expects fiscal year underlying sales to be down 5% to 6% excluding currency translation and an impact from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each.","Adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal year are now expected to be $2.90 to $3, excluding $200 million to $250 million of separation costs and a fourth quarter loss of approximately $100 million related to the agreements to sell Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques.","I will now turn the presentation over to Kathy to talk about our business transformation.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Before we do that, this is David Farr, I want to first thank Greg for the update in the quarter. Secondly, Kathy \u2013 I'm going to introduce Kathy. Kathy has been engaged for a little bit over a year now relative to what we refer to generally as the new Emerson. There's a lot of work that has to be done relative to the communication to our investors, communication to our customers, communication to our employees. And Kathy has taken on this assignment with her team and several people from the various businesses that will still be part of Emerson going forward; and she's creating a new presentation of what Emerson means going forward.","And so, what we want to do today, given the announcement of the transaction to sell Network Power and the transaction to sell Leroy-Somer and CT, I wanted Kathy to go through and share with the investors and the outside people what we're seeing as we go forward and we'll be formally announcing in early October. So I've asked Kathy to talk to investors today and give you an insight to that.","And, Kathy, the floor is yours. Thank you.","Katherine Button Bell - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm positive you're all anxious to hear from Dave, so I will try to use your incredibly valuable time with great care and sensitivity. It is clear to me that I am merely the warm-up band and you're eager to get the main act. Today, we're going to briefly discuss how we're applying our marketing expertise to better redefine our great company to accelerate change, drive growth and imagine a different future. I believe you've already witnessed some highly tangible efforts of this, this morning.","Go to page two. Although today is about moving your view beyond our financial pie chart, this particular one holds all the excitement about our new possibilities. This demonstrates how we're adapting to a new reality utilizing our already industry leadership position in adjacent markets and driving our single source end-to-end solutions.","Go to page three. This is not revolutionary for an already well-managed and financially strong company. We are on our 126-year-old journey of complexity reduction and perpetual integration of our businesses. We're driving efficiencies through a tighter brand, which would deliver more collaboration and more customer focus, resulting in more integrated solutions innovation between our businesses. We're, therefore, more capable of cross-leveraging our remaining portfolio and making it easier for all to navigate our business.","Slide four. So we need to accelerate past our previous transformations, evolving our business and our messaging from doing many things to concentrating our efforts on the critical challenges facing our customers, specifically in the process, industrial, commercial and residential markets.","For Automation Solutions, this means being the most trusted partner and problem solver for our customers during the current business crisis for them. This also becomes a showcase for our Internet of Things initiatives as we build on our legacy of long-term success of network intelligence in the field via our groundbreaking PlantWeb technology and our unmatched wireless heritage.","For our Commercial & Residential business, we can focus on the global criticality of human comfort, connected home, food quality, advancing energy efficiency at home and work, as well as sustainability.","Slide five. As conglomerates have fallen out of favor, we've quickly transitioned to a more highly focused enterprise. The best example of this is the new emerson.com debuting on October 1. But all of our communications, both internal and outside, will reflect and promote our new positioning.","Talent acquisition migrates from fragmented business units to an Emerson career-centric approach. Our social media has historically been product brand focused and now we're trying to expose our deep industry expertise and to humanize our brand. Finally, advertising, which previously portrayed us as wide and deep now can support two major businesses in their our own deep special expertise.","Slide six. So a great example of this was our truly unexpected foundational sponsorship of CERAWeek, which, as you probably know, is the Davos meeting of the oil and gas industry. As we were developing our new Emerson Automation Solutions positioning, this seemed like a great opportunity to dramatically demonstrate our leadership position in the industry and launch our unique and desperately needed approach for the oil and gas businesses facing a crucial moment in their troubled marketplace. Top quartile solutions were a breakthrough approach for a vulnerable industry and we tried to optimize our moment in the sun.","Slide seven. We poured exceptional effort and assets into the Houston-based event with full immersion media and social media training for all the Emerson executives, as we drove a full frontal media approach of the city, venue and with all the participants. The extraordinary results are the positive outcome of tightly choreographed messaging strategy, as well as very well-prepared executives. This is Emerson at its best, applying full energy and singular focus.","Slide eight. For Emerson's newly combined Commercial & Residential Solutions business, the opening of our new Helix Innovation Center in Dayton offered a similarly tightly focused media and promotional event that was designed to showcase the advantages that's closely aligned with those businesses.","Innovation Center clearly demonstrates our unique research capabilities around energy efficiency, connected homes and businesses in a real-time simulated environment. This miraculously includes a fully built-in IKEA furnished house; a commercial kitchen, which serves the entire Dayton campus with catering and a convenience store. This all exists under a single roof and allows for monitoring and research under an exceptional array of climate, environment and variable conditions.","Slide nine. From a marketing viewpoint, like CERAWeek, the opening of the Helix allowed for a wildly focused media event. We continued our highly publicized STEM support initiative with a survey on the issues of STEM education. For you financial guys, STEM is the acronym for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math.","We again tapped Internet science superstar, Hank Green, in the backdrop of our Innovation Center on the University of Dayton campus. It was media magic. We showcased our engineering initiatives and allowed Hank to do his storytelling sorcery to millions of network viewers, social media networkers and even thousands of potential investors. This was astonishingly successful for a B2B initiative, where media interest was stoked by the authentic connected story of STEM careers, sustainable research, a science geek and a real university setting. This is not just another product launch event.","Slide 10. As we all know, digital access and transparency has changed all of our business lives forever. We also know that an extraordinary amount of research and private exploration goes on long before a salesman is invited to the party. Your website is the window to your company's soul and undoubtedly has the ability to expose one's capability to better explain, as well as execute one's business. Most multi-billion dollar companies cannot unify and face the challenge of reconstituting their digital presence.","The unique inflection point of today's divestitures have swung open an opportunity to begin again. We've been working for 12 months on Phase 1 of our new web presence to launch single taxonomy, single product catalogue, single technology approach, resulting in mobile always, all glass (16:50) responsive design. This will result in a cleaner, portable, searchable new emerson.com.","It will take us two more years to complete the technology transition; keep, kill, edit and vent (17:03). We had over 700,000 pages in our previous environment, but we will be at the very least a more nimble, unified player. This is the one thing I believe our competitors would not expect from us and would fear the most; a better more truly (17:20) integrated Emerson.","Slide 11. So Dave has generously allowed me to give you a 3.5-minute cook's tour of the emerson.com prototype. This is giving you all a sneak preview into our Phase 1 of the new site. I think you will find it as a new vision of our streamlined tightly focused selves, exemplifying enduring strength and adaptability to change as we rise to the new challenge. Please bear with me, as we thought it was technically safer to videotape the prototype as it is a little jumpy and we didn't want to take you out of the webcast. Here is emerson.com. Please roll the video.","[Video Presentation] (18:00).","There they go. Okay. The front page is dedicated to introducing our clean design, inviting customers to explore, career seekers to learn and investors to fall in love all over again. It is meant to be a showcase of our great stories and a window to our values. The new site is an exceptional initiative to bust our silos and unify our businesses. In usability research, our customers said it was beautiful, complete and visually appealing and that the images highlight the breadth of our industries and humanize our brands.","As we move to About Us, you'll see we introduce our visitors to our transformation story. This describes how we plan to increase value to both our customers and shareholders with our tight focus on two major business segments.","Our realignment is about accelerated cultural change inside, customer joy outside and value creation for all. As we wind our visitors down the page, they will encounter a new Social Responsibility Report, access to our educational I Love STEM page, our much more extensive Join Our Team careers section. I'm also very proud of our more extensive social channel selector, (19:46) which you'll see from Twitter to YouTube we are ready to connect.","Finally, we head to our Investors happy home. Our Investors page is meant to be a familiar, but improved user experience for all of you. Roll over resources, back year Annual Reports, profiles and SEC filings are at your mouse tip. Finally, an up-to-the-minute mergers and acquisition updates section will be available, but not currently available in our 30-day-old prototype.","Emerson Automation Solutions is the doorway to our ever-broadening offering in the industrial and process industries. We immediately discuss capital projects, operational efficiency and tour our Internet of Things offering on a global scalable level.","Our site is founded on an industry-centric approach, allowing us to better explain our end-to-end solutions with an industry view. Our world-famous signature brands are still prominent and easily searchable, so every customer can still reach each SKU by bookmark, new easy search and relatable discovery.","The Emerson Commercial & Residential Solutions business introduces us to the unified concept of optimized performance for connected buildings with energy control. All our products and services form the basis for many cohesive growth opportunities based on connected equipment, home and business monitoring, energy efficient improvement and infrastructure support. World-class signature brands like RIGID, Sensi and InSinkErator form the basis for scalable solutions and are the bedrock of this B2B business and our only B2C empire.","As I introduced earlier, the Helix is the metaphor for our Commercial & Residential businesses. Our five simulated environments are almost impossible to appreciate from a distance, as the building offers us the ability to control the external environment \u2013 think winter in Alaska, summer in Dubai \u2013 in order to measure the energy efficiency or the home or business inside. Our Innovation Center has been a terrific real-life laboratory with some of Emerson's most impressive, sustainable innovations, like InSinkErator's Grind2Energy, food waste initiatives to Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostats and groundbreaking compressor health control.","So thank you very much for your time and attention, and I will hand it back to Dave Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Kathy. I appreciate your time. I wanted the shareholders to understand, the investors to understand, where we're trying to take the company going forward. A lot of work will be undertaken here the next 60 days as we get ready to launch. It is very important for our employees and our customers to understand what we're trying to do with Emerson and reposition the company into these two core business units.","Clearly, a little over a year ago, we announced our repositioning efforts. We announced that we were going to sell or spin Network Power and sell the Leroy-Somer and CT business. Today, we're very excited to announce that we found two strong partners to buy these respective businesses.","Platinum buying the Network Power business and a great solution for this business; and one that we are excited about for Platinum, the management team and long-term even potentially us, given that we will have some potential upside if they're successful and with our 15% equity ownership down the road.","Also, Nidec, a strong Japanese company that we've known for a long time, I've known the Chairman for years, buying our Leroy-Somer CT business and managing that business going forward. Again, a great solution for these two businesses with a good outcome for Emerson, with over $5 billion of investment value for Emerson and our shareholders and for allowing us to reposition the company.","We will have one more transaction in 2017. If you remember, we talked about selling ClosetMaid and we said we'd do that in 2017. In total, we'd do somewhere between $5 billion to $6 billion in proceeds. And so, we're well within what we expected back in February. So we look forward to closing these two transactions before the end of the calendar year and moving forward as the new Emerson and trying to drive a stronger valuable proposition for our customers and for our shareholders.","Now the third quarter. Yes, it was a tough quarter, a very tough quarter. June was a very challenging industrial marketplace for us, especially on process. Given the recent announcements of the GDP numbers, it shouldn't surprise any of us. The numbers announced last week from business investment for the last nine months were negative and declining. Restatements for the last couple of years made it worse.","So we're facing a very tough environment and we saw that very quickly in the month of June as our Process Transactional business really slowed down, as our customers continued to protect cash flow and their investments to make sure they have the cash needed to run the businesses or pay dividends or whatever they're doing, but clearly a very challenging environment, but an environment where our team across Emerson knows what to do. And we're acting on it very aggressively and making sure we keep our costs in line, making sure we do the right things internally to protect the key investments, but also keep our costs in line to allow us to generate the profits, the cash and the returns we expect at this company.","In total, profitability with the third quarter was pretty good. We generated operating margins flat with last year at 17.4%, in case you didn't figure that out, 17.4% with down underlying sales of over 4%. Cash flow was very strong in the quarter. We were strong in cash flow for the first nine months. We will continue to generate the cash flow to run the company, to invest and pay money back to our shareholders and do what we need to do.","But we have to face the reality of what we see today. It's a tough market. We did see a bounce back in July in our process orders, which is a good sign. But in reality, we are look at a marketplace right now where people are being very cautious, they are being very careful with what they're spending money on and they are very uncertain relative to what's going on around the world from a political standpoint relative to just a business environment standpoint and where things are heading. So we're staying very focused on trying to drive the necessary actions to protect the short-term profitability, at the same time, staying very focused on making the right, relevant, long-term investments to drive the necessary change that we'll see in this business, this industry when we come out. We will come out. This industry will come out. But clearly, a challenging marketplace right now and one that we fully understand that we have to deal with and we will deal with it.","Now let's think \u2013 on the positive side of this. We had many people out there doubting that Emerson could take the transaction, the repositioning and get the job done. But the team within corporate, the team within Network Power, the team within LSCT and our external partners did a lot of work the last 12 months and came up with very strong proposition both for our shareholders and for the buyers of these actions and of the remaining assets that are being bought. Very pleased with the work there, not easy to do in a marketplace, by the way, which is quite challenging. So my hats off to the entire team around the world for making this happen.","Also want to thank the team for landing a tough quarter, a quarter that was a lot tougher than we started out thinking about it and in reality, it ended up being very challenging, but we got the job done and delivered pretty good levels of profitability and levels of cash flow. No, it was not what we expected, but still, very good in the environment we're seeing.","From the perspective of the board and the senior management team, we're very focused on the future of the company. We have been repositioning the company and we continue to reposition the company. It is a very solid company when we get down to the two businesses that will remain at the end of the calendar year. And we're very much focused on making the necessary investments internally and through strategic acquisitions to build upon these two businesses to once, again, return to over $20 billion in sales, profitable sales and profitable returns. The opportunities are there and we're working on those.","Yes, it's a tough environment, but that's no problem within Emerson, we deal with those tough environments. That's what we do. It's our DNA. Clearly, would I like to have better times? Yes. But that's not what we face today. So we're facing reality. We're very much focused on driving a stronger company, a more profitable company, a faster growing company and remain an industry leader in the two key business units, business segments that we'll have when we finish.","A tough quarter. Fourth quarter is going to be tough too. Wasn't long ago I thought that maybe we'd actually have flat or up sales in the fourth quarter. That's not going to happen. So we're having to deal with that. And from our perspective, as we continue to restructure and get ready for a challenging 2017, it will be more favorable coming through a very difficult last 18 months, but still a challenging environment for us. But we are well positioned and will continue to be well positioned to derive levels of profitability that will generate great cash flow and returns and over time will continue to return to the growth mode that we know with inside Emerson.","So yes, I look back at the third quarter, a tough one, but we got a lot done. Within 12 months from the announcement of the concept of repositioning and selling or Network Power business, LSCT, we did it. We got it announced. We are looking at how reorganized on the company to drive longer-term value, very good. The game is still on. The hard work is still happening and I want to thank the entire management team globally, working so hard here the last 12 months and in this quarter to deliver what we need to deliver to continue to move Emerson forward, to remain relevant and an industry leader in the space as we serve today and will continue to serve going forward in 2017 and beyond.","With that, I'll open the floor for questions or comments. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So look, I know it's early you don't want to give specific 2017 guidance, but can you talk about the puts and takes in terms of 2017 EPS? You've got dilution from the sales of your businesses.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, thank you. I will not talk about 2017. I will not talk about 2017.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Wait, Andy. Let's be realistic here. We're in the process of selling two businesses that will happen in our first quarter of 2017. We're in the process of going through, what I call, continuing restructuring process. We're in process of going through an environment where people are still cutting back spending. So I'm going to give you a forecast. I've had a tough time this year. So I had a better view six months ago than I do now. So from my perspective, I'm not going to give you a forecast for 2017.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","For people trying to guess 2017 right now, I think it's a pure guess.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I understand. So just shifting gears then, you're guiding to $90 million to $100 million of restructuring expense this year. You've done, I think, $43 million so far. So we know you've mentioned in the past that restructuring takes time. But when we look at restructuring going forward, you're seeing Process Management business have lower decrementals in the quarter than last quarter. How do we look at margins going forward in Process Management? Could the decrementals get a little worse before they get better?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From our perspective, yes. I think what we're going to see is from a Process Management standpoint, we'll have a good fourth quarter process because it's always our best quarter. And we have a lot of restructuring underway in Process, a lot of things have been announced and we'll be starting to book or starting to book already. So we expect that we'll be close to the $90 million level restructuring at fourth quarter. Clearly, you have timings when things get pushed and shoved, but we're going to continue to restructure there in the fourth quarter, then also in the first half for Process Automation.","It looks to me right now that Process Automation, from a profitability standpoint, are going to be going down into the operating level, probably around the high 17%, low 18%; EBIT margin is obviously lower because of the restructuring. And they'll bounce back into that 20% level, but will not bounce back in 2017 based on what we see right now. I do not see the growth coming in the Process world to drive that leverage back up. So we're in the mode right now of trying to protected and minimize the downfall in profitability. And so what we're looking at right now probably from profitability is somewhere between 200 basis points, 250 basis points, I would say deterioration in profitability at the operating level line of the Process business for 2016. And we'll stabilize that as we get into that \u2013 into 2017.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful, Dave. And then if you looked at \u2013 remember you gave the order growth curve to us in May and you talked about it potentially going positive in July. And I know you talked about it sort of being delayed. How do you think about that order growth curve? Now, I know you said it's very hard to forecast, but is it fair to say it just sort of pushed out maybe six months to nine months? Any commentary on orders as we go forward here?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The order curves that we see today have trended pretty much in line where I thought they'd trend, except for Process. On the Process segment, we've been bouncing between this minus 12% to minus 14% underlying order rate now for over a year. And until, you know, we anticipated, including myself \u2013 I made the call, no one else did, I made this call \u2013 that I thought that would start lifting up towards the minus single-digit. It has not happened.","So based on what I see right now, the rest of the businesses have continued to trend upward and would be pulling us up to positive, they would have pulled us up earlier to positive, but until Process Management starts seeing, I would say, a lift in the order pace, which right now is running as minus 12%, minus 13% range, until we start seeing that move off that range, and we'll communicate that. So once it goes into this minus 5% to minus 10%, then you're going to start seeing the total Emerson lift come.","But right now, Process is such a big piece; it's down at a level that we have not seen a lift to pull us up. So that's what we see right now. And I see no indication that we'll see that going into single-digit underlying order pattern in the rest of this fiscal year, which is the fourth quarter. So most likely, we'll start seeing it as we move out of this quarter going into the first quarter and the second quarter of fiscal 2017.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Thanks. Good questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks, and good afternoon. Dave, you...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","You invited questions or comments, so I am \u2013 I actually am going to take the leap here and say congratulations on getting a sale done, which I know we've been debating for a long time. So congrats on that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you. A lot of hard work by a lot of people out there, Steve, that you should be thanking, not me. I mean, I'm just \u2013 there are other people that did a lot of work on that one; it's not easy, and do it right for the organization, which is very important.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. And you had to still agree to and get it done. The midpoint for the fourth quarter implied, I think, sequentially is about a 5%, just over a 5% sequential step-up. It is a little bit more than we've seen historically. And given all the order rates you keep giving us, it certainly makes me \u2013 just want to understand a little bit, is there \u2013 are there any bright spots in here that are making us think that this would be just a little bit better than usual from 3Q to 4Q?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Based on the \u2013 if you look at our underlying order pattern, we've been, on total Emerson, we've been running underlying around the 4% \u2013 the 4.5%, 5%, if you look at the pure underlying order rate. So right now, what we're seeing is that \u2013 if that pattern continues what we've been seeing, then we should be able to reach this from the standpoint sequentially from the sales.","We are also seeing, on a positive standpoint, we are seeing \u2013 we had a lot \u2013 we had some inventory liquidation in some of our channel in the month of June and \u2013 May and June in some of the Commercial and Residential. We expect that that \u2013 some of that will return in the fourth quarter. We also expect some of our compressor-type of business, which is the heat and the refrigeration markets, we expect a little bit of lift in that, which will help us as we go into the fourth quarter.","We're not expecting much from the Process Automation. If you look at the underlying business, we were down last year in the fourth quarter around 10% in sales for Process. We'll be expect to be down again around 10% again for the fourth quarter. So we're seeing the other businesses are seeing a little lift and that's what's going to pull us up and we are banking the fact that Process does not have a leg down.","So I was very pleased to see Process came in in preparation for today's board meeting and showed us the July orders \u2013 the way they work, they do a 4%, 4.5%, so we know the July orders, and they bounced up back to a run rate that got back into the average that they've been seeing for the last five months or six months and way above what we saw in June. So we did see a bounce back there. So that's how we look at it right now, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then if you look at just MRO versus CapEx type of demand within Process and Industrial or just overall automation, any, at least a little more commentary on the MRO side? A little more \u2013 is there any more stabilization there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Not really. We've seen very weak \u2013 and North America has been the real challenge for us. It would be Canada, U.S. and Mexico. The MRO business and the \u2013 what we call the transactional business had a very, very weak June, as people really \u2013 some of our customers curtailed spending, they're doing the turnarounds of the facilities and changes, for the facilities and maintenance, but they're doing it very, very carefully and really cutting back on the extent of how much money is being spent. So that has not seen an improvement. We expected that to stabilize, but it's not yet. That will be a key sign for us. And I think that is also a reflection that you see in the GDP. When you deconstruct the GDP in the United States the last three quarters, you'll see that business investment continues to deteriorate. And that's one of the areas we're seeing right now is that day-to-day MRO type of business and that's hurt us in this space.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And can I just sneak one more in? Given your prior commentary about where to deploy the capital going forward, and especially now that you're through this big milestone, are you thinking still \u2013 you talked about a couple, one or two transformational deals versus bolts-on. What should investors \u2013 are you leaning \u2013 do you think we should expect one bolt-on versus transformational? Or it's really up in the air? Or what? What are you thinking?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We continue to do little bolt-ons. We've done a couple of smaller transactions, the unique software transactions in the Commercial Residential business the last 30 days, 40 days. We are continuing to look for a strategic investment in either the Automation business or the Commercial Residential business. So in discussions with the Board today, we're very much focused on driving our trend \u2013 what we call a more strategic type of deal, a bigger deal. And clearly with the balance sheet strength, we can do that. But we're still very much focused on that and our focus is to get that done sometime in the next three, four, five, six months. We're not going to do anything stupid, but we're looking at where we can invest and make a stronger, core Industrial Automation business or core Automation Solutions business in this tough marketplace. So we're going to work it hard. We're not going to step back and wait.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, Dave. I'll hand it off.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Steve.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Afternoon. Just following up on the issue of the stepped-up restructuring, so if we think about the sort of RemainCo Automation Solution segment, is the idea that the restructuring you've announced today, that should be sufficient to keep margins sort of flat in that business over the next 12 months, even if sales declined sort of a single-digit rate?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Our goal is within the Automation business \u2013 Commercial Residential Solutions business restructuring is really starting to tail off. Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann have really done a very good job. They got ahead of this and that business is doing better. So our goal here is between this year and the first six months of Automation Solutions business is again spend restructuring. We're going to probably spend somewhere between $50 million and $60 million next year. And the goal is to maintain the profitability level of this business, plus or minus a tenth or two. So that is the goal.","We're trying to find where we can find that bottom without, Julian, without as I tell my board, I will not jeopardize the future of that franchise because it is a franchise. But we clearly are working that equation right now relative \u2013 as the business has continued to weaken as we look at probably next year, as I've said, probably low single-digit negative growth in the Automation Solutions business. How do we protect that profitability at the level we finish this year? And that's what the game is. And that's what we're trying to structure. That's how we're working the equation right now.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just a follow-up around the sort of gross margin's impact from price versus from material cost. I guess for you, for everyone, that's been a tailwind for 12 months, 18 months in particular. When you look in the next 12 months where input costs are now, and what pricing is doing particularly for large projects, how do you see the price-cost delta shifting, if at all?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From our perspective, it has been a positive for us. If you look at our GP margins, we had a \u2013 our GP margin this quarter was what, Frank, we were up this year \u2013 this quarter. I think our GP margin was up this quarter.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","We were up.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we have one more good quarter of it, Julian, to be honest. And then my feeling is what you've heard me talk about. I think that shift is going come and the wind is going to come against us a little bit. And I fundamentally believe that we're going to start seeing that squeeze and we will not have the positive, and that we'll have to fight pretty hard to maintain a neutral balance. But I wouldn't be surprised if we don't have a quarter or two where the wind goes against us.","But right now, we're in a mode where we're still positive, but I think there's a period coming maybe early 2017, where it goes against me for a couple quarters. But we're working that hard \u2013 yeah. Frank Dellaquila said we're up 0.2% on the GP margin for the quarter. So that \u2013 your assessment is right. Give us another quarter and then we'll probably get two quarters or three quarters coming out that will be more challenging. It will probably be neutral or slightly negative.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. But pricing itself, you and your competitors, is that changing much? Or not really versus six months ago?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. Pricing is not changing. What's happening right now, the pricing \u2013 I think we talked about pricing around the negative \u2013 on average negative 0.5, negative 0.6, negative 0.7 for the year. We're well within that boundary right now. And the net material inflation has been good for us and it's been good for all the people. So the pricing is staying well within that boundary. I think next year, we'll probably \u2013 I mean if I took a snapshot right now, Julian, and think about next year, I think it'll be slightly negative; won't be quite as negative as this year, but our net material inflation won't be as positive. And we could have that switch coming on, where you \u2013 often you get squeezed a little bit. So that's what I see right now. But people are behaving \u2013 we've got other issues out there from a manufacturing standpoint, like too much capacity and stuff like that.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Agreed. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","Yes. Thanks, David. I may have missed it, but could you elaborate on what the tax leakage is from the two divestitures, if any?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, the tax \u2013 I'll let Frank talk about the tax leakage a little bit.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, so we've got gross proceeds, as we told you earlier today, of about $5.2 billion. The net proceeds will probably come in around $4.3 billion, $4.4 billion. So we've got a bit of tax leakage on both of them, a lot of moving parts, especially around the Network Power deal. In terms of where we're recognizing gains and losses, where we have basis, but that's about the net of it right there.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","Thank you. And just one other one. We've heard a lot about the M&A pipeline on the AS business. Can you talk about what you're looking for in the C&RS business? What types of technologies or geographies that you're looking at? And any sense of what the size of some of those opportunities might in fact be?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Most of the opportunities within the Commercial Residential Solutions, I will use the real names, not the abbreviation. I've got Kathy in, my head of marketing, and she's beating me over the top of the head with my \u2013 I got hit with my own baseball bat. From our perspective, what we're looking for is sensing; we're looking for sensing type of technologies to allow us to create a bigger solution within our core product that we have there today. We're looking for software, we're looking for monitoring, we're looking for the transformation that we did in the process world back 20 years ago when we created a very strong Component business and created sensing, solutions, the software. And that's where we are taking the position for the Commercial Residential.","The business acquisitions, most of them right now will be probably in the $20 million to $100 million range. There might be another one $200 million. No big significant acquisitions in what I would say the next 12 to 18 to 24 months. Bob Sharp and his team is driving the solutions strategy around this right now. It's sort of the early days of understanding how to create that. One of the things Bob is coming from the process world and understanding that, so I'm expecting him to create a more of a solution type of environment around this and to leverage the core assets, the leading assets we have in that space. So \u2013 but it's going to be smaller, sensing, solution, software type acquisitions, and companies you've probably never even heard of or thought of, to be honest.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. Good luck.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Dave, I echo the congratulations on getting the sales done and for the amount that you got them done. I guess as I think about your capital allocation priorities, clearly we've been talking about the M&A. But can you maybe touch on the dividend once again? I know it's kind of like a Holy Grail for you, but I'm trying to get a sense for whether you're planning to set aside any of the capital from the net proceeds to fund the dividend going forward and how to think about buyback in that context as well.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Thanks. First of all, thank you very much for recognizing the sale. I appreciate that. As I've been communicating for over a year on sort of our utilization of cash flow going toward, yes, the dividend is important to us. It's important not to us per se, but to our shareholders. And from our perspective, where we are right now, with the shrinking of the company down to, say, around $15 billion and the cash flow coming down along those lines, we will be detecting (48:55) our dividend as we've discussed at the board level for the next couple years. The goal is obviously to grow the company both organically and through acquisitions, to rebuild the cash flow base that we're losing from the divestitures. But right now, as you think about our company and you think about our free cash, let's think about our free cash flow next year. And let's say we take the dividend up marginally a little bit like we did this year. Our dividend coverage \u2013 our cash flow, the free cash flow of the dividend coverage is going to go around the mid-60% level. And so, our goal is to figure out how to keep that \u2013 peak at that mid-60%s, maybe higher 60%s and then move it back down in the range of 40% to 50%.","As I've told the shareholders, however, let's say that we're not able to find significant strategic acquisitions, we're not able to get the growth necessary to get back up to the size of the earnings and cash flow base that we had just a couple of years ago. Then we will, as a board, will have to consider do we cut the dividend. But that is not where we sit right now. Right now, we have the capability of both funding internally and doing the dividend and will dial back the share repurchase. And this year, we're going to end up around $600 million of share repurchase, next year will probably be somewhere in the $100 million to $200 million range, just basically covering any stock we're putting out there for employees \u2013 and but we'll dial that back.","The intention of the board, as we discussed a lot over the last 12 months, the use of proceeds and our balance sheet to go out and continue to do aggressively \u2013 make investments within the two core spaces we're maintaining, we're keeping the company, and that's where our focus is going to be.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, that's really helpful. And I guess maybe one last question and I know it's probably too early to talk about 2017.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No way. Go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm going to ask it anyway. I guess if you're thinking about just the underlying trends that you're seeing in process today, if those underlying trends were to hold steady through the year and as we progress into 2017, can you guys grow margins given the price cost commentary earlier as well as the restructuring actions that you're taking in that business?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think to be very honest with you, I think given the current trends, the underlying growth rate of our Automation business next year will be slightly negative, will be low single-digit negative sales. From that perspective, with the restructuring we're doing, we're going to do (51:29) everything possible to protect our profitability as we finish this year in that environment, and so that's what I see right now until I see our customer base willing to invest more for productivity, invest for next-generation capacity or whatever it takes, that it's going to be a tough environment. So I don't see that.","On the Commercial Residential, we do see underlying growth and we do see a little bit of improvement in profitability. Next year, the focus of that business will be the integration of some of the \u2013 on the various businesses, as we've talked about streamlining, creating a very strong global integrated business, and so that's where that focus are going to be. So next year, I would say that business will be \u2013 will have a positive underlying growth and most likely we'll see a little bit continued margin improvement, which \u2013 and the business is running at pretty good levels of profitability right now.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Johnny.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, Dave. So maybe a question for Frank or perhaps you. In February, you gave us a pro forma EPS number of $2.60. And now that we've done these transactions, the guidance has come down. And I guess just with all the corporate moving parts and stuff, what is that \u2013 what maps (52:49) to that $2.60 for fiscal 2016 pro forma? What would be the number today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's going to be lower; I can tell you that. It's a little bit early to say how we finish up, but it's definitely going to be lower than that and it's going to be moving \u2013 it's obviously more closer to the $2.50 range and slightly lower. But it's going to be \u2013 that's what we're \u2013 clearly, with our EPS now down lower, I think that's what's \u2013 just being (53:13) reality, that's what's going to happen right now. But the basis is going to be more in that line at this point in time.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then pro forma, how much of your free cash, so pro forma, so these businesses have gotten \u2013 how much of the free cash or how much free cash would you be generating in the United States?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Still going to be about 50\/50. The profile of the company from sales profitability, it does not change much from the \u2013 John, as we operate going into the transformation and as we go to the next \u2013 the NewCo, doesn't change much. So it's going to be about the same. And so we're losing cash flow operating cash flow, Frank, around...","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","$400 million to $500 million.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$400 million to $500 million. So \u2013 but as you look at the generation of $3 billion, we lose $400 million to $500 million, it's going to be the same makeup between U.S. and international.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was just trying to bridge the dividend is like $1.2 billion and change, right? You raised a little bit. You've got half of your free cash. Is it \u2013 just the question is almost to Joe's question, is are we generating enough U.S. free cash to pay this? And it seems like we're kind of on top of that, right? It's...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're on top of that. And the other issue we've talked about is that one thing Frank and his team is looking at right now is we will be making \u2013 assuming we don't do anything from an acquisition standpoint, we will be bringing back cash flow at a very low tax cost to us, as we talked about both in February and this year. So Frank, you might want to mention...","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. As we walk through these transactions and as we move toward closing, we're looking at bringing back all the proceeds because we'll receive a significant amount of proceeds offshore. But we'll bring everything back as well as all the cash that was in those businesses that had been generating over time. So we'll have pretty significant cushion here in the U.S. as we do that. And then we normally bring back $400 million to $500 million of cash very efficiency every year anyway. So we understand the issue on the dividend and the share repurchase, but we think we have it covered.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. One thing we do with our finance committee is we very clearly lay out the cash flow needs over a couple of years and where that money is coming from. So we try not to get ourselves surprised and boxed, but it's easier for us to see it than you. So that's how we understand the issue.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No. That's fine. I think the Network Power transaction, talked about Emerson retaining a subordinated position.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What exactly does that mean? Does that mean you're some sort of a minority interest accounting number? Or is that actually pertaining to...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. There will not be any of that. There will be no minority interest. We have no board fees. What we have is if the business does well and we'll be retaining a 15% subordinated equity piece, if the business goes well and something happens and they make their return, then we \u2013 then obviously we'll get a piece of that on the upside. So that gives us a little bit of capability if something does go well and a lot of the efforts we put in the last couple of years, we have a chance of making something down the road. Maybe my successor or whoever has a chance to have a little bit more money coming out of that for our own shareholders at some point in time. But no minority interest on the balance sheet in this one.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No, it's not, from an accounting sense, an equity position. It's a subordinated interest, which under the right circumstances, could be a very good payout for us down the road.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That makes sense. Lastly, is there a timeline, Dave, where you would say now we've sort of accomplished the M&A for this? I mean, in other words, you've sort of given yourself a two-year window on the dividend. Does that imply that the execution of replacing the lost earnings is over two years? Or \u2013 I mean, obviously you would want it to be front-end loaded, right? Except that the M&A markets, it's a little bit pricey. So I'm just curious how you would like us to think about the timeline, perhaps, of deployment of proceeds to do these acquisitions?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, from our perspective, Frank and I, we review with the Board and also the Finance Committee. We see that \u2013 where the two years come from, the fact that we know we have to be in a map, or sort of like a roadmap of figuring out how to get that \u2013 our return coverage interest \u2013 coverage from the dividend on free cash flow coming back down towards the 50% level. And so that's why we say two years because if we don't have a roadmap that's through acquisitions or faster internal growth, then the pressure is going to be building both us as a management team, the board and our shareholders and say hey, how long can you maintain that high level of dividend payout without damaging the company? So that's why we look at that and say a two-year window, a nice round number to talk about. That's why I say that.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Got it. Perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. I guess, Dave, in terms of your comments around Process, I mean, obviously you talked about perhaps a bounce in July orders. But obviously, we're now in a bear market for oil again, given recent trading. So I guess what gives you confidence that we're not going to see something kind of worst going forward?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't have confidence. I mean, from our perspective, just go read the transcripts from any of the oil and gas companies reported, all we do is we look at our businesses, we look at what's going on in transaction, look at the day-to-day order book and what comes in. We have good systems, we can see that. The fact that I look at the stability and the flattening of certain things and we make a call. So that's the type of confidence level I have. And I know of no customer out there saying, oh, things are great, we're looking at increasing spending. But we have a very broad and diverse business, global business, a lot of industries. And so that's how we make that call. And I was just \u2013 I am encouraged by the fact that we did see a bounce back in July because June was a very \u2013 I mean a knock-you-over-the-head type of month for our Process business, so that's where I'm coming from. And we'll see.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","In terms of the Network Power acquisition, the six \u2013 I mean how would you, on the basis of your guidance, the performance of the businesses right now, how would you categorize the EV to EBITDA multiple paid on 2016 numbers?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're talking about (59:22)? The number we showed was...","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I think if you look at our trailing 12 months, we're right in the 8 range on EBITDA, plus we've got the upside.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then the final question is \u2013 I mean from a capital allocation standpoint, you're kind of between a rock and a hard place here. And from that standpoint, you've got companies that are probably having a road in fundamentals right now and you have to take a look at them in a public equity market that, in the main, is still rising, still high valuations. I mean, is there a case to be made to kind of batten the hatches here? Shift capital allocation and then just get a better sense of where we are on the down cycle before pursuing something more aggressive on the strategic front?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, we obviously look at everything, but we'll make that call based on what assets are potentially out there for us to make a call on. I mean I think that if you have unique opportunities, you have to take those opportunities. If you think about our business, the Automation business we're involved with, there are few and far-between assets you can actually interact with, so you do what you have to deal with. But \u2013 let's just put this way, I'm not looking to go out and do something really quick and crazy with the $4 billion which I don't have yet.","But I think from our perspective, we see the opportunity and we see a situation \u2013 we're going to take advantage of the situation. Right now, it's a tough marketplace out there. And you try to find \u2013 you ever try to get to bottoms when to buy stocks or buy things? You're going to lose. That's a loser's strategy. We're going to buy assets we think we can make money. And so I look at people that sold the day of Brexit and the day after Brexit. I would call that very short-term thinking.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Congrats on getting the deal done. Talk to you later.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Hi, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Congratulations on getting everything coordinated for (1:01:21) today. That's quite a task.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So I know you've clarified that you're not going to give any 2016\/2017 guidance. But you \u2013 back in February (1:01:34), you talked about $0.65 of lost earnings from the assets to be sold in (1:01:40). Obviously 2016, there's been a lot of moving parts on Network Power, probably a little better than plan (1:01:46), industrial automation, their worth. So are we still on track with our $0.65 impact?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I \u2013 well, I just said in the \u2013 a couple of minutes ago, I think what we've said, the impact will be about the same, maybe a little bit more, maybe about the same. But because our \u2013 the base in 2016 will be lower on that number than we talked about. We talked I think $2.60 EPS. That number's now going to be lower because from the standpoint of the whole range came down. But I think if you look at the Network Power and Leroy-Somer assets, there's about the same number. Delta's about the same. Just one's done better, one's done worse, so that's about where we see it right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So the net impact's about the same. Okay, that's helpful. And then perhaps a question for Frank. The tax rates for the pro forma Emerson, how does that look?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","About the same as the old Emerson. It really comes out pretty much the same way as the total company is today, so there's not \u2013 I don't expect any material change in the tax rate. I think we're going to be in that 30% to 31% range going forward.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just finally over to the last pieces, (1:02:48) you said probably mid-2017 for this. I'm assuming that proceeds from that would take us right in the middle of that range, the $4.4 billion to $4.7 billion?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Exactly. Exactly.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that \u2013 yeah, it's not a huge transaction and we'll \u2013 our people have been pretty busy right now on this one, so we'll get \u2013 we'll launch that sometime early 2017. The exact \u2013 we'll be \u2013 I think we talked about $5 billion to $6 billion, and then we'll be right in that range with this one too.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And then we're done. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Dave, I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the potential divestitures. And as I was going through Kathy's slides, you still have a legacy exposure to data centers with Liebert. And I just wanted to hear from you what sort of linkages you think that business has? It certainly does with climate, but beyond the climate linkage, where else does Liebert fit within the business on the go-forward?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Liebert is part of the Network Power business which is being divested. So...","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There is no \u2013 there is no \u2013 if you look at our Network Power business, which if you think about the business in that you have Liebert, you have Chloride, you have ASCO Power, you have Avocent, you have Avansys, businesses that we've had for a long time or maybe acquisitions. That's the compromise \u2013 that's the composition of the business that are being divested. So those businesses will make up the Network Power business which is being invested and bought by Platinum today and run by Scott Barbour and then the Leroy-Somer CT business, which was the \u2013 what we call the Industrial Automation businesses that were left out with those businesses we've had for a long time will also \u2013 those are being sold to Nidec in a separate transaction.","So once we're down with that, the only business left that doesn't fit within our Automation Solutions business is our ClosetMaid business, which is a storage business we bought many, many years ago and did very well with; and there's no reason to keep that, so we're moving that out. And then at that point in time, all the business will fit in very nicely and have a lot of core strength between Commercial & Residential Solutions and Automation. And maybe, Craig, come back \u2013 come and come in and see (01:05:07) sometime and go through it, so you can see the two business segments and how everything fit together.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No. That's helpful. Just looks as though that slide hasn't been updated because you still have data set of thermal management included on the umbrella of the businesses.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Okay. Because that's within \u2013 okay. Okay. Now I \u2013 okay now I understand the (01:05:26) question, Deane. So you're right. Within the Helix, our interim center, we actually have a cooling data center there which we're monitoring and with that, from that standpoint, that was built in when obviously Network Power's a part of us and we'll work with them down the road to help them but as part of cooling, but it's just more of a compression thing. That's all it will be in the (01:05:46). That will not be our core part. They do have that capability within the Helix today because our customers want to look at cooling, precision cooling or humidity or whatever it is. And that's nothing to do with business we're keeping. It's just within that engineering center there in Dayton, Ohio. Good grace. Thank you.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for that clarification. Just a last question, I don't mean to spin you up, but you did bring up the thought that there could be some of the business investment hesitancy because of political uncertainty, and how meaningful do you think that is across your businesses today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean I don't think \u2013 I mean, from my perspective, North America, I'm sure there's some hesitation relative to spending, but really \u2013 and you think about \u2013 it really boils down to the overall economies not growing. 1% growth for the last two quarters or three quarters or four quarters is not very exciting; and I think that that's created an environment where businesses are being very, very cautious at spending money.","Political environments around the world is more of a function of what's going on in Europe, our elections here, what's going on in Japan. It's just there's a lot of uncertainty relative to, well, from a government standpoint just what \u2013 where the direction is of the government. Are we going to try to create negative interest rates for the world? Are we going to try to invest and grow the world? And right now I see more of an environment where we want to create negative interest rates and give people free money; and there's no incentive to invest. So I thought that's the only environment, I'd say.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. And just in terms of this June and July stuff with the process, I mean there are parts of the oil and gas world seem to be stabilizing during that period of time, but other parts seem to be still getting worse. I mean as you talk to some of the customers and took some of that feedback in June, I mean were you able to make any sense of parts that were stabilizing versus parts taking another leg down?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From what we're seeing, what we saw was clearly they're doing the maintenance, they're doing the turnaround situations, but they clearly are being told to spend less on it; and that's what we're seeing right now. And from the standpoint of June, June's normally a very big month for our process industry because of all the turnaround situations over the summer months; and I think that our customer base just got a little bit more cautious in that month and hopefully there's \u2013 maybe they're getting through that period right now and they're going to feel \u2013 and go back to a little bit more the normal pace we've been seeing. But June was such a shocker to us relative to how much they decided to contract.","But I just think people are being super, super cautious, and bosses are probably saying, hey, we did it for $1 last couple of years; can you do this now for $0.50? And so, I think that's was going on in this environment right now.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just as you think about investing in the process business both organically and via M&A, I mean, Emerson was a real trend-setter in terms of digital communication and asset management of devices, et cetera, and now there's a lot of activity going on in that space. I mean, do you think there's anything you need to do differently there? Or do you \u2013 still comfortable with the control platform and just think you want to add more devices to it? Maybe just give a sense of where you think you are there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From the control platform or from diagnostics, sensing and stuff like that, we continue to invest, we continue to buy technologies, we continue to do internal investments on those technologies. Nothing real big in that space as we continue to make sure that we stay, keep a leading position as we go forward here. So a lot of our investment dollars are still safe in that space right there. We will continue to look at acquisitions relative to offering a broader package relative to our solutions. So bringing more capability to the end market relative to the capabilities both from control, from its rotation, from valves, whatever it takes, measurement out there.","So we'll continue to look at trying to add to that capability. But we continue to be a leading investor, relative to your first question, relative to sensing, control and diagnostics; and we'll continue to do that going forward, because we have no intention of losing that. So that's the fine line we walk relative to where we slow down our investments and where we don't slow down our investments.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. A question on process, Dave, as you've seen a deeper trough manifest here, how does that inform your view of expectation for a steeper recovery at some point versus kind of just the more absolute baseline reset?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","My opinion is the deeper we go, the longer we stay down here, the faster the snap back. I've been here once before. I saw it. And so, the more pain you have, the better in the end. No fun having the pain upfront, but the better a snap back. So right now it's a deeper pain going down; it's a longer pain going down. And that tells me one thing, that spending will have to bounce back at a faster rate.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's it. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And knowledgeable about (1:11:16) this industry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think there was some cash over in like China or something with Network Power. What's happening with that? Does that go to the buyer?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we've worked out contractually a way to get that out of there over time, over and above some reasonable amount that needs to be left behind.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not a worry.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Is that kind of part of the \u2013 and this is \u2013 just basically this is an earn-out, right? I mean is what you're kind of \u2013 you propose to these guys?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, no, no. Steve, Steve, when they buy the business, they will write a check for $4 billion. And then if \u2013 they are going to run the business and if the business does well \u2013 and we've made a lot of investments with that business and you can see it's been progressing to come back \u2013 and the business does well and down the road if things do really well and they have a chance to sell the business, or take it public or whatever they do with it, and there's an upside from what they return, then we have a chance to get a little bit more money down the road too ourselves.","So upfront, the day they take this company, they're going to pay us $4 billion cash right up front. So we get money. And typically we'll work the cash balances around the world. As you said, there are taxes around the world, and we will leave what we consider adequate cash for our business, but the rest of that cash belongs to Emerson and our shareholders.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then just one last question just on I guess kind of the cultural direction here. I mean, you guys walked through the website on the conference call, which we've kind of never really seen that before. So obviously you're trying to put a foot forward when it comes down to the transformation of the company. GE has got these commercials out there, even though it's like literally 2% of sales for them.","I'm just wondering like how \u2013 is there like something going on in the industrial world where there is \u2013 is this kind of an internally driven thing or is there some consultants running around trying to pitch this story? It just seems like everybody is talking about IoT at the same time. And to varying degrees, what is your percentage of sales? Because I think you guys have a decent amount in software, better than the other guys, but I haven't seen it before.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. We have a lot there. We're not buzzing IoT. I mean, in reality, there is no consultant running around. I've got Kathy, and she's got a little minion here and she is right here next to her. So it's a dynamic duo team right here. Steve, there's no consultants. I think that why we did this today, it's very important, this webcast is listened to by a lot of our employees, too.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And one of the key issues from our perspective right now, we're communicating to you, we're communicating to our customers and internally. And what's going on right now, our customers are looking for what are we going to look like, how this thing look like going forward when we come out in October. So I asked Kathy to come in and to talk about it. There are no buzzwords here. I mean we're very much into Internet of Things and we have been involved in this for a long time, going back to initial Internet of Things been called PlantWeb, which I used to present when I was running the process business.","So I think that it's just people like to talk about it and we felt very important for you to understand, and for our investors to understand and then also for our employees understand where we're trying to take this in the next two months to three months as we unfold this transaction.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Jeff. Good afternoon.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","How's it going?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I just wanted to make sure I totally got the cash proceeds right. So the $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion net is after-tax payments that you make and includes cash that you're repatriating as part of the transaction...?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. That includes the cash tax payments, Jeff, on the taxable gains. There's another couple of hundred million. Depending on what we decide to do on repatriation that we would incur, we can bring a lot of cash home at a very low effective incremental rate. But it would be another couple hundred million of cash taxes if we bring home all the proceeds, as well as all the cash that was in the businesses.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So it's real simple, $5.2 billion of proceeds, we pay taxes for the transactions, some with losses, some gains around the world. We'll end up somewhere around $4.3 billion of cash sitting in our bank account that we'll use to do something with. That simple.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Is there any election, a 338(h) or anything like that that has some negative ramifications for you guys down the road?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one last one, Dave. Your comment about the dividend and deploying the capital and kind of bringing the cash flow back made sense. I wonder if you'd also, though, consider massive share repurchase to lower the share count and therefore lower the cash dividend amount, right? And it seems like you could kind of correct the imbalance that way if you wanted to. Is that something you would consider or not?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Not at this time. Our consideration is to invest in growing the business again and not liquidating the business. So the investment profile of the board is such that we feel that we have opportunities out there and we'll continue to have opportunities out there in the next couple of years. And we've gone through a whole process here saying (01:16:50) where do we want to focus. And so, our focus is in these two areas here and we're going to look to go out and buy assets and leverage those two businesses which are two very strong global profitable businesses; and that's what we're going to do. I'm not in the mode of buying stock back and taking the company private.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","No. I'm thinking more kind of further down the road, you suggested if you can't find deals dividend (01:17:12). All right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I would just go all out (01:17:15) and take the company private.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We move next to Jeremie Capron with CLSA.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. Question on the underlying sales trend, do you have an idea of what it looks like excluding energy markets? I mean, I see the huge contraction in Middle East, Africa and Canada here. But Europe and U.S. don't look so bad. I suspect that if we exclude energy markets, you should be running positive this year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, we don't look at it that way, because there's a lot of cross-correlations in there. But I mean obviously the major oil and gas downturn in North America and Latin America and Middle East has definitely pulled it down. Obviously, I mean, we don't cut it that way. I don't have that capability of doing that, but clearly they're down quite a bit. So I would say that there's a good chance if you start cutting out and looking at a smaller part of Emerson, you could say it's growing. But that's not how we think about it. And I just don't see the numbers that way.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Fair enough. And you commented on the valuation of the Network Power deal. Any comment on the Leroy-Somer?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. The price that we're talking about is $1.2 billion. I mean we'll end up \u2013 obviously there we have less taxes to pay in that transaction. And so, we'll end up probably around a little bit under $1 billion in cash when we're all said and done.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","And in terms of the earnings multiple on that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's around 10 times.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","10 times. 10.3 times.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thanks very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I want to thank everybody. We wrapped up here. Again, I want to thank the organization around the world and particularly around the Network Power team, our Leroy-Somer-CT team, and the work working the Platinum folks from Network Power and Nidec on the Leroy-Somer CT. And I want to thank the organization. Yes, a very tough quarter. But we'll get our way through this and we'll get on into the next quarter and moving on to the next generation of Emerson.

Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days.","I will start the presentation with the second quarter summary, as shown on slide two. Net sales in the quarter decreased 9% to $4.9 billion, with underlying sales down 5%. As we anticipated, served markets were mixed, as oil and gas and industrial markets remained under pressure, particularly in North America where conditions were tougher. On the positive side, market conditions were more favorable in HVAC and U.S. construction. Data center and telecommunications spending improved during the quarter as well.","Reported earnings per share decreased 60% to $0.57. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66, which exclude $56 million of total separation costs, were slightly above our expectations. Profitability in the quarter benefited from the significant restructuring actions we completed in 2015 and solid operating performance across our businesses. Improved working capital performance generated strong operating cash flow of $719 million in the quarter. Overall, the second quarter exceeded many of the company's expectations, and we remain on track for fiscal 2016.","Turning to slide three, gross profit margin was up 40 basis points due to cost reductions and containment actions, and lower SG&A expense benefited from restructuring actions. The year-over-year change in EBIT reflects the impact of separation costs of $31 million and a $932 million divestiture gain from the Power Transmission Solutions business in the prior year. Excluding the gain and the separation costs, EBIT margin increased 70 basis points.","Turning to slide four, underlying sales decreased in all regions except Europe. The results were similar to the first quarter, which are noted on the slide for your reference, as the global economies are still not showing much strength.","Turning to slide five, business segment margin improved 140 basis points to 14.6%, led by year-over-year margin improvement in the Network Power, Climate Technologies, and Commercial & Residential Solutions segments. Restructuring was a positive, as savings from the 2015 restructuring actions and lower expense in the current year were a benefit across the segments. Comparisons in Corporate and Other were driven by an increase of $46 million in stock compensation resulting from share price appreciation, pre-tax separation costs of $31 million, and a 2015 divestiture gain of $932 million. Working capital performance drove an operating cash flow improvement of 101% in the quarter.","Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales decreased 9% in the quarter. Oil and gas customer spending remained a headwind across the regions, but was more pronounced in certain markets like the Canadian Oil Sands and the U.S. Efficiency and productivity projects continue to gain traction with customers in the energy sector, as interest and engagement continued to increase. Project opportunities in power in the U.S., Asia, Europe, and the Middle East Africa continue to support growth, while chemical markets across various regions continue to be favorable as well. Segment margin decreased 20 basis points, primarily from volume deleverage and mix, but were partially offset by savings from restructuring actions, which will continue to benefit profitability in the remainder of the fiscal year.","Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation second quarter sales declined 10%, reflecting continued weakness in industrial and upstream oil and gas spending. Power-generating alternator sales are at a 10-year low. Alternative energy wind projects were a bright spot for the drives business. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, and price, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions and materials cost containment. Slightly better market conditions and easing comparisons are expected to improve both underlying growth and profitability in the second half of fiscal 2016.","Turning to slide eight, Network Power underlying sales were down 1% in the quarter. The global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure improved during the quarter. Telecommunications power systems had particularly strong growth in North America. Segment margin improved 490 basis points to 8.1%, mainly benefiting from restructuring actions. New product programs and the segment's global repositioning strategy are starting to flow through to both sales and profitability. Improving order transfer both data center and telecommunications investment will drive positive third quarter sales growth and improved margins.","Turning to slide nine, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 2%, driven by the U.S. residential and commercial air conditioning business, which was up 10%. Europe reflected strong growth across the region. The refrigeration business was up high single digits. Segment margin increased 170 basis points, primarily due to significant savings from restructuring actions and material cost containment. Favorable air conditioning and refrigeration end markets should continue to support improvement in underlying growth through the remainder of the fiscal year.","Turning to slide 10, underlying sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment increased 2%. Favorable conditions in the U.S. construction markets, particularly residential, were supportive for growth. The divestiture of the Commercial Storage business reduced year-over-year sales by 16%, but had a positive impact on segment margin, which improved 380 basis points to 23.2%. Favorable trends in U.S. residential construction are expected to continue, supporting the outlook for modest levels of underlying growth and margin improvement in the remainder of the fiscal year.","Turning to slide 11, while the global economic environment for Emerson businesses will continue to be challenging, demand has begun to stabilize or improve in certain markets. Comparisons in the second half of the year also become easier due to the significant decline in underlying sales during fiscal 2015. As we have indicated, order trends remain in line with expectations and therefore continue to support our assumptions that 2016 underlying sales will be down 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation of 1% and a 2% deduction from completed divestitures. Underlying sales in the third quarter are expected to be approximately flat to the prior year.","We also reaffirm our guidance that adjusted earnings per share will be $3.05 to $3.25, excluding $250 million to $300 million of separation costs related to the company's portfolio repositioning. Adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter are anticipated to be flat to the prior year or approximately $0.85, excluding $145 million of separation costs.","And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate your time. And as you can see, fundamentally this was a very solid quarter. And I want to thank the entire global organization relative to execution around the significant restructuring starting last year and continuing to run through this year, and the results are starting to flow through as they did for the last three quarters. Poor profitability has now begun to improve, and we're exhibiting strong cash flow and very good performance. And again, I want to thank the global Emerson organization out there for doing some very difficult heavy lifting in a very challenging marketplace.","As we've talked about, since November I've been talking about fixed rate orders. We're going to reach a goal by April. I'm not quite sure yet. But as we've looked at the order pace through the last several months, step by step by step, with October being the bottom, we've seen continued improvement. Last month's three-month roll, we basically saw around negative 4%. We do not know what the April ending numbers will be, which we report \u2013 we're talking about reporting around the May Electrical Products Group meeting.","But right now, my gut tells me we've seen some weaker North America oil and gas spending on the short cycle, and clearly we're seeing very weak spending around the backup power generator marketplace, which as we see it is running at an 11-year low. But we might be close, and we'll know when we get it all in. But it might be May, but we haven't given up on April yet. And I know I can tell you this much. We're going to be close enough that my 14-month-old Zorro might be able to jump that rope and get there, but I do know there has been some weakening in the North America oil and gas spending route and the alternate route for sure.","The overall performance this quarter relative to the operations was very good in a very challenging marketplace. You think about the balance sheet, the cash flow, the earnings setting up for us what we believe is a very important milestone again in the third quarter, with hopefully underlying sales getting close to zero and our earnings per share being flat with improved margins. Again, very important milestones as we quickly work through the process. And the operations have done a lot of heavy lifting here and the restructuring is really starting to pay off.","From my perspective right now, as I look at the global marketplace, I just came back from Europe. Europe, our Western European business has continued to improve. I finally see some good momentum there. No, the economy is not going to be robust there, but they clearly are making investments. They're making strategic investments. They have some exports. And so underlying, we see our European business being a benefit, a positive versus what it was a couple months ago.","To the U.S., the U.S. economy in particular around the industrial segment has continued to be challenging. And in certain segments, I would say even weaker within the U.S. marketplace. The rest of world basically is trending along the lines that we've been talking about for the last two or three, four quarters, including what we talked about at our Analyst Meeting in February. So not a whole lot of change as I see it, the pluses coming from Europe, the minuses coming from the U.S.","Network Power business orders continued to be improving and positive, and we expect Network Power to have positive growth in the third quarter at the top line and positive growth in earnings. We expect the Commercial & Residential Solutions, that business to continue to be positive, and we also expect our Climate Technology business to do reasonably well. But one market they're struggling with right now is China residential. The rest of the world, they're progressing and doing extremely well. And obviously, you can see some of the profitability coming through in some of these businesses as they've got the restructuring done in the second half of last year and the early part of this year.","From a restructuring standpoint, we're going to be around this, Frank, I think we were talking about $60 million to $80 million \u2013 $70 million to $80 million. We are looking at areas right now where we've seen weaknesses where we will ramp up a little bit more restructuring. What we have is pretty well in focus. As we look at this year, we're also starting look at opportunities as we've now formed the two strategic businesses underneath two leaders of Mike Train and Bob Sharp, and we're looking at programs that we'll institute coming forward in 2017 and 2018 to I would say create a more best cost, structural, global organization and manufacturing process. And the opportunities that we can then look at taking more cost out, both for profitability, but also to increase investments for growth in some of the technologies and innovations area.","So overall, I'm pleased with the opportunities there and look forward to continuing to figure out how we can generate higher levels of profitability in the two core businesses that will remain as we finish the repositioning.","Relative to the repositioning, as we reviewed with the board last night and again this morning, we're making progress. The Network Power program bolt (14:22) is on the table at this point in time. We're looking at either a sale or a spin. Both are viable at this point in time. And the board along with input from the management team are getting closer and closer to making that final decision, and we will be making that final decision. We have filed the initial spin documents, which you have to do, and we'll continue to refine those documents based on input from the SEC. But from our standpoint right now, both options of what we're going to do with the business to create value for our shareholders and value for us as a company going forward are still on the table and are still actively being worked. And it is not a problem. I know people like to speculate and people like to aggravate, but this is a process that's well underway and well in focus and well in line with what we expected.","Relative to Leroy-Somer CT, Control Techniques, again, we have a lot of viable global \u2013 global potential buyers of these assets, and that process is well underway. And even despite the tougher marketplace we see in that market we're selling, we still have a good, good opportunity there to sell these businesses for what I would say a respectable price and exit that and take that money and reinvest it back into Emerson and the two core businesses that we're going to maintain.","We also reviewed today significant acquisition opportunities with the board. One thing good about the world today and the struggle relative to a lot of companies, there are unique acquisition opportunities out there, both from a technology standpoint, both from a commercial and residential standpoint, and also from the automation solutions standpoint. So we're looking for opportunities to reinvest the proceeds, and the objective is to take that money and reinvest it back into the core businesses and eventually get back into a $20 billion-plus corporation, but a much more focused and selective and profitable business.","As we talked about in February, when we come out of this transition, we will be a more profitable business, we'll be a more focused business, and we'll be more very much focused on doing significant acquisitions around these two businesses. And once again, regaining the size that I think is appropriate relative to what we need to do on a global basis.","So I like where we sit today. We're pivoting from significant restructuring to getting closer to growth in orders, significant growth in improved profitability, and pivoting towards the completion of the repositioning of the two core businesses we're trying to get out, and positioning ourselves towards making additional acquisitions, and great progress along those lines. No more specific details than I just gave you, so you can ask and I will say no comment. But that's the flavor we are right now, and good discussion with the board for a lengthy term last night and again today relative to that.","But again, as we wrap up here and open up for questions, again, very, very good execution by the operating folks, from Frank and his team, and Ed Purvis and Ed Monser, and then all the business leaders out there. I truly appreciate it. They're really working this hard and trying to create a higher level of profitability and a higher level of cash flow for us to have the opportunity to reinvest and grow this company again.","So with that, I'll open the mic for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And at this time, we'll take a question from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Good afternoon, Dave.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Scott.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I've got to admit, those Network Power orders popped back a little faster than probably some of us would have thought. Give us a sense, like were there some timing issues, maybe some big projects that got thrown into February or March? Or is it again, just such bombed out comps that we're likely to continue to see some pretty good levels from here?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's a pretty negative approach to thinking about that, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I just have to ask.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You must be watching TV too much, Scott. That's all I can think about. No, it's a fair ask. There are a couple things going on. As you know, when we went through the period of significant restructuring and trying to change the organization, we went through a period of having to develop I would say a more selective type of product portfolio for the market changes and opportunities. It did give us a chance to really have a better package to go out and sell and a more a focused approach with the organization.","And also clearly, the comps got a little bit easier. But the most important thing here is the work that Scott Barbour and his team did over the last couple years in getting their team focused around the different channels, the different products, the different solutions. And now I think that that focus and that cost structure we've put in place really are allowing these guys to compete and win, and it's a global thing. And so that is very good to see. So we have a long way to go with that business, but it's nice to have it healthy and carrying a load right now. So that's what's really going on.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good. Dave, is there a sense, can you give us a little bit of sense on timing? And I know you said you weren't going to give any details. But are we talking about having Network Power wrapped up in three months, or is it more like six months?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From our perspective, if you go the route of a sale, most likely it will be a little longer from the standpoint of a review and approval process. There's a lot of regulation. It's a very, as you know, a global, global business, so a lot of people will be reviewing that. A spin is one that you could have, assuming we don't know what the SEC will do from an input standpoint, but our focus right now if we decide to go the route of a spin, it will be towards the end of the fiscal year, if not just right after the fiscal year. If we have to sell it and have to go through a review process, it could be a couple months longer. But right now, we still look at some time in the September\/October \u2013 end of September\/October\/November time period for that based on the way we go. But that's the timeframe we're looking at there, Scott.","On Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques, again, it really depends. There is a sale process. If we have to go with an international person relative to a potential strategic buyer there, it will take I think from a review standpoint both from the various governments around the world longer. Both the U.S. government and the European government, as you know, there's a substantial position for Leroy-Somer CT in France. So I think that's going to definitely be most likely by the time it's completed in the fourth calendar quarter. But what you'll hear from us some time most likely this quarter or end of this quarter or early next fourth quarter, you'll hear which way we're going. You'll hear from us, sale or spin.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Am I to assume that that's not a gating factor in doing deals, that you'd be comfortable doing a deal even before those things were announced, or do you feel like...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Correct. Our financial position right now is we can go out and do deals right now. And we are doing deals, but we could do several billions of dollars of deals right now if we need to. We have the financial capability. Spin, sale, it doesn't make much difference. We have the capability of doing that right now.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Good luck, Dave. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you. And, Scott, as a follow-up to that, one of the reasons why we did stop the share repurchase in the second quarter and most likely tail it back again in the third quarter is to make sure that we do have the financial flexibility to do the type of transactions. The market is starting to open up, and we just want to make sure we have the capability. And we can always come back and do the share repurchase, which we're now looking at probably around $1 billion this year versus what we've said earlier. So that's another thing we've done.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, we'll see you down at EPG [Electrical Products Group]. Thank you, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, see you.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning, thanks. Good afternoon, I should say. Sorry.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","I was wondering if you could expand on your comments about some of the oil and gas orders weakening or what have you, the pace of activity weakening. And if you could, just expand on what you saw, if it related to any specific type of projects. And if you could, comment more broadly on any repricing of the backlog or customers pushing back on existing orders and trying to reprice them lower. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Relative to the second question, the answer is nothing. We're not seeing that type of pressure from us from that standpoint on a repricing of a commitment from one of our customers. And that's not an issue relative to this space at this point in time.","Relative to North America and particularly the U.S., it's primarily just the day-to-day type of spending that you see on the oil projects, not really big project specific. It's all around the day-to-day type of what we'd call the MRO type of \u2013 normal type of spend. But capital budgets are definitely being curtailed by most oil and gas guys. There are companies within North America, both in Canada and the United States. And so they're continuing to tighten those belts up, and we're seeing that business and that day-to-day business given our strength in this marketplace, which has been hurting us more on what I would call the shorter-cycle type of products.","And the project business, we haven't seen anything there. It's just been more the day-to-day type of situation. And that's been weakening here for the last couple months. And we anticipate that's going to continue for the rest of this year now, as most of the oil and gas companies reported here in the last couple weeks have talked about again slowing down some capital. And we're feeling that on the day-to-day type of spend. That's where we're seeing it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And just on the flip side, given that oil has moved a bit back up, do you think that it actually will be down for the full year, or do you think there's the potential to actually see a lift before the fiscal year end?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't see a lift before the fiscal year. I think that the price of oil, I've talked about my opinion on the price of oil over the months here. I still think there's a chance that we could slip back in the $30s and then start trailing back up towards $50. You've got to see stability in the $50-plus range toward $60 and then a continued growth of demand, which we see today around the world, the demand for oil and gas.","But clearly, the current pricing and the stress that companies are going through right now to make sure they right-size, they're not going to turn around in a month or two and say hey, okay, go ahead and spend. That's not going to happen. I think you're going to see the way we're looking at this marketplace right now is the first part of 2017 will continue to be challenging for our customer base. And they'll continue to be tight in places like North America, and they're going to be very, very tight relative to spending. And I just don't see that bounce back until probably later in 2017 or early 2018.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, David.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move now to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Just, Dave, you've talked a lot about the challenges in making the call for growth investments versus cuts and how to draw that line across the businesses, particularly when we're revisiting your guide. So where are you now in that thinking given how the market has been evolving and the more aggressive, it sounds like, achievement on the cost side that you guys have been getting? So when should we not be surprised about this pivot to growth investment?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that we're starting to pivot to growth on the Commercial & Residential Solutions side already. We're looking at some unique technology investments here, both internally and through acquisitions. On the Automation side, so on the Commercial & Residential side, so I think you're going to start seeing, as we start talking about as we get into the quarters, that business continue to grow. I think that we are looking at unique investments to help grow that business more in 2017 and 2018. On the Automation side of the business right now, we're still going to go through \u2013 I would say continue to downsize and rationalize for some time here.","One of the things as we form the two businesses, we're looking at ways that we can take out cost and create new investment dollars, some to go to margin, some to go internally. But that's going to be more in the 2017 \u2013 2018 time period. So I think you're looking at us already pivoting on part of the portfolio. And the automation part of the portfolio we are still rationalizing, restructuring, protecting profitability, and making sure that we do the right thing to protect the core value of the businesses. And so we're not walking away from the strategic investments there, but we're more in the let's make sure we have this opportunity to get the costs in line, and if we have any weak pieces of the tree and the wood, whatever it is, let's get it trimmed. And that's where we're at right now.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then it looks like \u2013 so you've got obviously flat growth guided for 3Q, and therefore implied flattish growth for 4Q underlying.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Correct.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So what does that mean for your assumptions around the MRO side, small to mid-size projects, because you did call it out again? I'm just still a little unclear on therefore what do we have to see happen for that to be achieved in the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, for the rest of the year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think what you need \u2013 we're seeing some \u2013 it depends on which segment you look at, Steve. I think that businesses are \u2013 just look at the business reporting in the economic reports. They're continuing to really curtail spending. And I think until you see businesses start then feeling comfortable that they can start stabilizing their capital spend versus cutting their capital spend, I think it's going to be a quarter-by-quarter fight in the U.S.\/North America region here. But we're already seeing some increase in Europe. We're already seeing it in Southeast Asia, but the key markets here in North America, they're still being pretty tight. So I think until we start hearing CEOs talk about expanding core capital investments for productivity, not capacity, but just for productivity and for some new products, I think it's going to be a slog. There's no doubt about it.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi has the next question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon, guys. Hi, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good afternoon. So your guidance for the year for China was down mid-single digits. Obviously, there has been some signs of stability, but GC (29:15) was still down 12%. So maybe you can talk about what you're seeing there and what you think for the rest of the year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Our forecast is still to be in that mid-single digit, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% down. From a comparison standpoint, this sucker really turned down hard in the second. I shouldn't call it a sucker, but I did. This market really turned down hard in the second half last year. We had down \u2013 if you think about the second half of 2015, our China destination sales were down probably around 16%; not probably, they were. In the first half of this year, they're down around 12% \u2013 13%. So what we're seeing is we're starting to see some pick back up in certain sectors, and comparisons will be a little bit easier. So if we go flat, it's still not real exciting given the fact how hard it was down last year.","So that's what we see at this point in time. We see the second half being about the same pace, a little bit better, but coming off a lot easier comps because the second half of 2015 was down 16% \u2013 17%. So that's where we are right now. And we see that across some of the businesses where some of the day-to-day spending in Process is starting to happen. We're starting to see the refrigeration in some of the transportation market spending for Climate Technologies. We're seeing the data centers and telecom spending. So we're starting to see some level of improvement there. So I still think that we'll see on average the year being down 6%, 7%, 8% at this point in time unless there's been another shock, which we haven't seen yet. That's where we are right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. That's helpful, Dave. And then Process Management margin down a little bit in the quarter. You're obviously expecting a pretty weak first half of the year. But you do need a fairly steep increase to get to your high teens guidance for the year. So how realistic is that, and could you get there with your current plan? Is mix having a more unfavorable impact than you expected?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I think that Steve [Sonnenberg] and Mike and his whole team have done a phenomenal job of going after the costs, and they're working it very hard. So that cost is coming out very quickly. It started last year, and they've been aggressively after it. So we're going to start seeing more and more savings. They had a very good second quarter profitability, as I saw it, and I think that we're starting to see that flow through. Now we are concerned about the North America I would say weakness because that is a very profitable business for us. But they still have other actions they can take to protect that profitability, and we are set pretty comfortable relative to the whole year, that range we gave you I think back in February. And so I still feel pretty good about that. I think we're reasonably on track.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome, take care.","Operator","And let's move now to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, hello.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon to you, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon. I just wanted to start with Industrial Automation. You talked about pricing pressure in the slides. I think that may be new, so maybe any color around that. And also, are you seeing particularly heavy destocking or something because the order trend is not really improving it looked like February to March? So just maybe give some color on different verticals within that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The big issue there is we have the mix going on from the standpoint of pricing pressure, profitability pressures. The other big issue is our alternator business in North America and parts of Europe has been extremely weak and taken a nosedive down. And so that's been a big issue for us. As that continues to weaken \u2013 and they're basically at this point in time seeing very weak end market demand, our customers, and so our guys are continuing to ratchet back down.","We're getting to the point right now to the pace that's getting low enough, but it's ugly from the standpoint there's not much volume going on. That's where we are at this point in time, in a very \u2013 I mean depth of the cycle. And it took another notch down the last couple months. And I think we're getting really close and we should start seeing some improvement in momentum back up through that. And that's where we are at this time. And again, they continue to take costs out. It's a tough cycle right now for these guys.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. And then just overall, companywide, I think in February you talked about a $335 million savings number for this year, if there's any detail you could give on how much of that was recognized in the first half.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And maybe any sense, when you look at the restructuring plans for the next six months, any color you could give on how much you might be carrying into next year.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Now the number we gave you was what, $350 million for the year, you said? Is that what you said?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","$335 million.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$335 million? Right now we're probably just a tad better than that right now given the second half of the year from the restructuring and the benefits that we're seeing from that. So as we look at the pieces, these are the actual numbers, these aren't the deltas, correct? I'm looking at a sheet here.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Those are the deltas.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","These are deltas. So in the first quarter, we're at a delta here of around $80 million improved from restructuring. Second quarter we're looking at around $100 million. The third quarter, it looks to us like it's going to be probably back around $70 million because now we started to get some comparisons from last year. And then in the fourth quarter, what happens here is we'll see it bounce back up again, probably to over $100 million because the expense is going to be down. So the delta there is going to help us a little bit. So that's how the numbers look right now. And we just had a very good quarter here. I would expect us to have another decent quarter in the third quarter, and then we'll get a big pop because there will be less spending versus last year, which we had a big pickup. So the savings are starting to flow through along those lines.","Next year, now I would say based just on the core businesses left, let's say that we're executing the sale or the spin or whatever of the businesses. You look at the Process business and you look at the Commercial & Residential business left and just the day-to-day restructuring. Those numbers are going to drop significantly because of what's going on. And so when I say significantly, we're going to be under $50 million. I haven't seen the number yet, but I've got to believe it's going to be under $50 million. And then what's going to happen, though, is Bob Sharp and Jim Lindemann are looking at opportunities across the Commercial & Residential Solutions business that we are going to start executing on as we get into 2017.","So there all of a sudden \u2013 we don't have a number yet but we're going start taking that number up. Where that $50 million may be comfortable, we might go up $25 million, $30 million, $40 million, as we look at a two-year program to right-size and restructure and reposition the Commercial & Residential on a global basis to make it really best cost location, best cost structure, and allow us to take some of that profitability to the P&L and also to help us invest for growth. So there are some unique opportunities now that we've put these businesses together, and so that will happen as we get into 2017. But next year restructuring, my gut tells me the core basis will be down significantly.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's a long-winded answer for probably what you didn't want to hear. But that's...","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, that's great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities","Hi, good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities","I think of Emerson as particularly dominant in the larger projects in Process, Industrial Automation. And you're calling out in some of your remarks hope for the smaller, medium-sized projects in MRO, in Process, for example. I'm just curious if you can give us some color in terms of how that may shift market shares or what you're doing to work on the share in the smaller-sized, medium-sized projects?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From our perspective, we've been really pushing resources because there's not as many large, large, large projects out there right now. So we redirect our resources back into the small and medium-sized projects to pick up that business because you're right. If you look at our share, we go very high to large. We're very, very strong in the day-to-day. In the middle, we're probably the weakest, as you said. So we've been shifting some of the resources down from the large down to the medium and go after those \u2013 off to the smaller projects.","From growth in market share, I still feel that we're going to end up \u2013 we'll come out of this cycle ahead. As we did the last cycle, I think Emerson will come out ahead. And we'll be a stronger player in the Process Management industrial marketplace around this space here when the cycle comes out from overall participation.","On the day-to-day stuff, that's being more driven by the corporate world of CEOs being very cautious, worried about cash flow, doing the same thing I'm doing if you look at Emerson. If you look at our capital spending in the first half of the year, we're down significantly from last year. I don't think I'm any different from any other CEO out there, and I think that CEOs right now are being very, very cautious relative to spending, and particularly given they keep seeing weakness emerging in the industrial space. So I think that part is going to be pretty challenging here for the next six months until CEOs feel okay, I can let go of a little bit more money and reinvest back into the company. That's how I see it at this point in time.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities","Got it. And also, you called out the efficiency productivity investments in Process. Where are we in that investment cycle? Is it just beginning? And I'm curious why we don't see that in Industrial Automation in some of those efficiency investments.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Boy, if I could read everyone's mind, I'd be okay there. I think that we are seeing that both on the Automation side and the Process side in Europe. We're starting to see it where Western Europe did not invest for some time, and now they're doing it. They're going after it. We're starting to see a little bit of that in Asia-Pacific. In North America, people are just being very, very tight with capital right now. Even though money is cheap, free almost, people are very, very cautious at this point in time relative to spending a lot of capital.","We're very focused in our capital spend right now on productivity, quality improvement, and trying to get the costs down, but a lot of people are still trying to evaluate where they want to take their businesses. I think there has been an underinvestment, and hopefully we'll see it come back up in the old productivity and improving your efficiency and operations in North America. I'm a little bit disappointed to watch corporate America cutting too far in that area. But that's where they are right now, and I can't push and shove any more to make them do it. I know what we're doing, and we've redirected heavily the capital we're spending. We're spending less capital, but it's all tied basically to efficiency and productivity and how do we get lower costs for the future.","Michael Wood - Macquarie Securities","Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll move now to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, Dave, I just wanted to square your comments on orders bottoming in Process and the fact that things are getting weaker in oil and gas. One of the things that you mentioned in your slides was that the power markets have been getting better, and we've heard that from a few different people as well. So maybe is that the reason why you feel better about the orders bottoming on the Process business? And what specifically are you guys seeing in the power markets?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The Process business, I look around the world. The one place that we've seen increased weakness is this U.S. day-to-day type of spending. That's the one area I see the weakness. The rest of world has continued to start increasing their investments in what I'd call the day-to-day productivity type investments. We're seeing that spending going on. If I look at the order pace in Europe and I look at the order pace in Asia, that trend is turning the right way. So that's why we felt pretty good.","The one surprise we had is in the last couple months we've seen the U.S. spending rate come back down again, which bothers us. And that's what's created probably this delay by one month relative to April, the April target, which we have \u2013 I don't know yet for sure, but just intuition tells me where we were at negative 4% that should have been closer to negative 2%.","So what's going on right now is this is climbing up a little bit slower, and we're having people be a little more cautious in spending. But on the power side, people are having to spend money for the new regulations coming into play. They've underinvested for a while. They have some plants they've had to take offline, and so we're seeing people spend money on trying to move towards gas. And so the spending is there for power and we're aggressively seeing that. We're doing extremely well in Europe. We're doing well in North America, and we'll doing well in Asia.","We are a company that has actually continued to invest and grow and put new technology in. A lot of our competitors are walking away from what I call primary power. And so be it, I love it. We'll gladly make those investments for people. And so we've been investing from technology and innovation and acquisitions, and a lot of companies in our space that we compete against are actually deemphasizing it and walking away from it.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And maybe to follow up there on the oil and gas piece, have you started to see any weakness in midstream? I know that's one area that you guys have called out as being pretty strong for you. Is that attributing to some of the weaker oil and gas spending?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, midstream is fine. I think there might be an element going on. We could be seeing some cannibalization going on. As you know, there was a lot of investments that were done that's sitting out there, used equipment, maybe equipment that was never put in place. There could be an element of that, people going back and digesting and cannibalizing that right now. But clearly, something has happened to create people to back off. Maybe they found a warehouse of stuff that they had purchased for some investments. But clearly they're backed off and so they're using some older equipment or some equipment they found, and that's all that's going on at this point in time.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll move on to Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon. I thought we cut you out of the queue.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Our usual bet, Mortimer? Just kidding. So in any event, in terms of April versus May, given the fact that you've maintained your guidance, it really doesn't matter. And obviously the restructuring benefits have definitely kicked in. But do you feel good, it's just a matter of...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Is it Bob, Rob? Norm (44:30) won't get any dinner for two weeks if we don't get April, so he's out there working his ass off right now.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","But do you think it's a question of you'll start to see that kind of nice pull-through in May \u2013 June timeframe? And how are you thinking about how \u2013 do you feel like the year from this perspective, given the restructuring benefits you've gotten and the most all margin conversion is well intact here?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm looking at Frank. I think we feel good about the profitability right now because I think the operations and I think I know the operations are really, we got on this last year starting real early and they've worked it and we've kept the pace. And as you know, we haven't really slipped off the spending or the savings, and it's really starting to flow through. So we feel good about that.","I feel a little bit more worried about sales because of the U.S. marketplace in particular. I feel better about Europe, as you can tell. I feel a little bit nervous about Latin America because I still think these guys are still struggling. But the U.S., this I would say slow to start turning that nose up really bothers me. But I would say that within the forecast we've given out there for sales, we're still comfortable, but it's probably a little lower than it was below. But I feel good about the profitability from the Power because that's happening. And so it's just we have some markets going our way, some markets are not going that way, and they're not all turning at the same time. And so that's where we are at this point in time.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Admittedly, a very strong quarter on margins and free cash flow generation. I don't think anybody can debate that. The final question I have is just following up I think on Scott's earlier question around the timing of M&A, and there are probably limits to what you can talk about this. But obviously, there's a certain decile of deals that you'd have to use equity for. Would that delay the timing? Do you have to get this exit out of the way before you would consider using equity? Is there a gating factor there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, we don't see it as an issue there. The deals we're working on right now are probably not going to be cash deals. We could do billions of dollars in cash right now. That's not an issue. We've got an ample balance sheet. The operations have got \u2013 they've got the liquidity back in, they've got the working capital back in line. Our profitability is coming up. So I think from the type of deals we're seeing at this point in time we're looking at \u2013 and not some big strategic \u2013 I don't see us moving that way until we exit these other two businesses. But we see opportunities of multiple billion-dollar type opportunities that we could do internally right now just with pure cash. So we've got the position to do that.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","So for a large deal, really that's the gating factor is exiting Network Power, okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Right.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right.","Operator","And now we'll move on to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hi, Chris.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Dave and Frank. So you undercut our nosier questions about the portfolio of Process. But could you just sum up the run rates of Leroy Control and I think it's maybe ClosetMaid combined, how they're contributing this year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Leroy, I would say that Leroy Control Techniques are struggling this year.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","$1.5 billion \u2013 $1.6 billion.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, they're what you call sales there.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","It was $1.7 billion the prior year, but I would say it's probably down to $1.5 billion.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Around $1.5 billion. Profit margin is down a little bit. ClosetMaid I would say is probably somewhat flat.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The margins are somewhat flat this year. So there's not \u2013 and we're not really taking any action on ClosetMaid at this point in time. But I would say Leroy-Somer Control Techniques have not seen the recovery that we thought originally. That business, the backup power area in industrial spending has been much weaker, though we're starting to see the improvements in Europe in that area and some improvement in Asia. So hopefully, we're getting to the bottom of this from a cycle standpoint, but it's been a tough run for these guys for the last couple years.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And with the Industrial Automation segment and your orders and business run rate, are you seeing any issue on customer commitments ahead of the question of who's going to own these properties?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, no, they trust that we're going to do the right thing.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, and then last one on Network Power. You called out the importance of new channels and solutions allowing better winning out there in the marketplace. Already seeing big improvements this year, but you also commented on a long way to go, so I'm wondering if you've now established the guide path for another big step up in profitability here for the segment.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We expect the profitability \u2013 the business used to run 10%-plus type of profitability, and so the goal is to get that back above that. And so as this business continues, the restructuring is getting closer and closer. I think they've gotten the majority of their restructuring done. They probably have a little bit left in the second half of this year. But from the underlying profit, when the growth comes, these guys are going to leverage quite nicely. So I expect them to see pretty good growth in the second half of the year and improvement in profitability in the second half of the year, both from growth and then also from improvement in the cost structure.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll move now to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Dave, just on the restructuring, it sounds like it's tracking according to plan and everything, but the first half was only $28 million of expense. Just conceptually, I'm trying to figure out why that would be a back half loaded restructuring plan. It seems like you know what you need to do and you'd be getting after it earlier in the year. Can you just maybe explain what's going on there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're doing some significant restructuring, some challenging restructuring in Europe, and you have to do it at a very measured pace. That's one of the issues right there. And so it's a plan that you try to get it done within 12 months; sometimes it takes 14 months. Our European process for restructuring is one that you want to do very carefully to get it done without major disruption and major problems with your workforce. So a lot of it is around that European situation. North America is a little bit easier, and that's pretty straightforward. But we have some restructuring underway in Europe that we well-planned out, and we might miss a month or two here as we push around. So that's what's going on at this point in time.","The other thing we're doing at this point in time is also MEA. They are getting their restructuring done and they're actually getting it done at a little lower cost. They're getting their profit. They're getting it done, which is nice to see. If you do it with a measured pace, you actually get it done at a better cost structure and get the work done and it costs us less. But I still think we're going to be doing it around this $60 million \u2013 $70 million this year. And again, as I said, we're looking at some of the Process and Industrial area right now because there's some more incremental things we need to do to be properly positioned as we go into I would say a challenging first half of 2017 at this point in time.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks, and maybe just one more follow-up on the M&A angle. Clearly, as you mentioned, you have the financial strength to do what you want to do. Organizationally, there's been \u2013 obviously, you're undergoing some big changes and also some management has moved around within the businesses. Organizationally, are you in a position where you would want to do something sizable?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, we're ready to go. We're ready to go. From the restructuring, by the time you start the process \u2013 I mean the restructuring, a lot of it will be well behind you as you get \u2013 our acquisitions don't happen in one day or two days. So if you do the process, I think that we're well-positioned as we go into the second half of this calendar year to take on some additional. And if we can pick up couple billion dollars worth of things, then we'd be very excited about that.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","At this time, we will move to Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Josh. How do you pronounce your last name?","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Not like that, we'll try Pokrzywinski next time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. I just wanted to make sure I didn't \u2013 I thought I knew who you were. I thought maybe you got a name change or something.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","I'm trying to revert to old country where we're nationalizing here ahead of any trouble.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We just nationalized? I didn't know that. Thank you, Josh, all pun intended there.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","On Network Power, you called off some of the project strength in Europe, but you sound a bit more sanguine on the business in general. If I pulled out some of this project activity in Europe, which sounds chunky and maybe some detail on when that ends as well, but how do you feel about the other regions going forward or what you're seeing today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Network Power in total is doing reasonably well across the world. That industry does go \u2013 we've got a couple months we're on and then you have a pause. But generally, we're pretty pleased in the last couple months, and it's reasonably broad-based. So we'll see how April comes in. Our anticipation of April is that we have high single-digit order pace. And I think it would be interesting to see which regions come into play again. So if we get a high single-digit order pace in that space, then that means \u2013 that's more than one or two dots. Let's put it that way. So we'll see.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","How far does the European project activity take you out?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Our European project right now is working on the second half \u2013 we work out second half calendar year. So what we're booking right now is really going to start helping us in the second half of this year.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Got you. And just to revisit the April \u2013 May order dynamic here, and maybe one month doesn't make a difference, but it does sound like you're talking about a bit more caution in the business. I guess versus three months ago, clearly easier comps get you a lot of the way, and stability would get you to positive order intake by that April \u2013 May timeframe. But did you actually see orders come in below where you would have thought, comp aside, just a daily order rate?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What we saw was, as I was talking earlier on the phone call or in my initial comments would be the U.S.\/North America oil and gas day-to-day business was weaker than we would have anticipated. On the positive side, Network Power is a little bit stronger. I would say also \u2013 I would say that our order pace in China and some of the other businesses I thought would maybe be a little bit better, but it didn't quite trend that way yet. But I would say the primary reasons I look at the order pace is the North America capital type of spend market, day-to-day marketplace, was weaker the last three or four months. That's probably what's created the slowdown. If you look at the line, it still continued to drift up. It should have drifted a little bit faster the last two months, but it's on a curve now. It's one month behind where I thought it would be.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","So maybe a bit more of a bathtub shaped recovery here versus anything else?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, exactly.","Joshua Pokrzywinski - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","All right, great. Thanks, guys. See you at EPG.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome, see you.","Operator","We'll move along to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, Dave and everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, a couple questions. Maybe we could drill into China a little bit more and resi HVAC in particular. We've seen some mixed data there, Dave. Do you think you have any particular market share issue going on there, or is there anything to point out beyond just the challenging macro?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I don't think so from a residential standpoint. We're not as much of a residential \u2013 it depends on how we mean it. The high-end residential we'd be a player there. But I would say our core markets, our core customer right now just went into a situation with too much inventory, and they're having to deal with that. And the rest, if you look at the rest of China, it's been pretty good for our residential business \u2013 or not, for our commercial, our residential business and the climate business, but there's not much going on there. It's just that market goes in pockets. These guys will go two and three quarters, they buy heavily, and then they overstock and then they cut back. So nothing unusual there at this point in time.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And just back to the portfolio one more time. I appreciate you've crossed the line in terms of planning and strategic thinking afore to where you want to be. But if you really do have the capability to do things on the buy side, so to speak, without getting these deals done, do you really want to be selling these IA [Industrial Automation] businesses in an environment where you're saying they're nose-diving into an 11-year bottom? Does that make sense?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I said one piece of it was at an 11-year bottom, and I don't think I used the word nose-diving. But I would say that at this point in time, if we feel we can get the right type of cash out of this asset, then we will monetize it and move on. How long it takes for some of these assets to come back in certain cycles, we have things we want to do relative to repositioning, so we want to get on with it and do it rather than sit there and manage it.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then on the Network Power side then too, I guess you are alluding to some strategic interest then if you look at maybe finding a buyer or taking longer for an approval process. Are you seeing some actual strategic interest as opposed to just maybe private equity type of interest for that business?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think there have been press releases on this but strategic interest out there? And the answer is yes, there is strategic interest out there.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thanks, see you in a couple weeks.","David N.

Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, just to stay on Network Power on that last point, sale or spin, and maybe there's some nuance here that I don't appreciate. But my understanding is to qualify for a tax-free spin, you cannot have had substantive conversations with outside parties about a sale. So I'm not sure how you can have both these conversations and still have a tax-free spin. So what am I missing?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Deane, I think those rules \u2013 this is Frank. Hi. I think that's specific to a specific party, so that if you were to have conversations with a specific party and then spin it and then subsequently they buy it, then you'd have an issue with the tax-free nature of the spin. It is not a general prohibition against having conversations with parties as you spin the company.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. So that has not been breached then?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. We're very, very careful about how we're going about this.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. And people know that if they have a conversation with us and then they do go to certain levels and then they back off and then they wait for a spin, they have a problem.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it, all right. I appreciate that clarification. And then as a follow-up then, Dave, you surprised us last quarter when you went back into the guidance business, quarterly guidance business, and you're surprising here again with not a range, but a point estimate.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's an approximate point, approximately. Approximately could be a range.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, but that squiggle, I'm seeing the $0.85. But the idea there is it suggests pretty good precision and visibility into the outlook. And so we can't even say where the assumptions on the high end and the low end, but just what's changed in terms of giving you this additional visibility?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","When I say approximately, I mean probably within a nickel. So I'd give you my sense right there from that standpoint. I just think that \u2013 I want to make sure that people understand on the projection we're on from the standpoint of watching people have a tougher time figure out where things are trending, I want to make sure that people understood where we are. So I'm going to make it very clear.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Is it a top line that would provide that range, the high and low?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And would it be U.S. change?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What I said earlier, our cost reduction, our profitability is running at very good levels. If you look at the underlying conversion that we had in the last several quarters, it's been getting better. And then you look at the slower climb out on order pace will create \u2013 clearly putting some pressure on us where we think the top line will be. If the top line was a little bit stronger, then clearly our profitability would go higher and our EPS would go higher. Right now, we're more concerned about the top line sales than we are the profitability because we've got our cost structure in line right now. I feel good about that. We feel good about that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Understood, thank you.","David N.

Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What are you doing? Are you all busy today? Are you working something hard today?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Trying to, pretending at least.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You work pretty hard.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","A couple for me. In terms of, Dave, you alluded to your expectation around oil prices may be pulling back a little bit. Should we think of the back half guidance being sub-$40 in terms of your assumption from a sales standpoint as it relates to...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I don't think right now \u2013 I think the day-to-day sales are pretty much set. It's not price of oil driven. I just happen to be one of these guys \u2013 you know me, Rich. I put stakes in the ground. I put a stake in the ground back in November about April. How many people do things like that? It's just my nature. And so my feel right now, I've always told you that I always felt that price always would run up, would run down a couple times. I fundamentally believe there's a chance it could run back down again into the $30s. I personally believe by the time we get into the fourth calendar quarter this year we'll be around that $50 mark. That's where I think things are going.","People are cutting back. The demand is still growing, but it takes a long time. When you make an investment and you have oil and gas pumping and you've got that capital spend, you don't just turn it off. Typically, you let it run and try and make some cash out of it. Even though you're not making as much as you thought, you're still trying to get that payback. I think that's what we're going through right now. We're still squeezing it out. And I think there could be a bump in the road here down, but fundamentally I think the trend line is back up a little bit towards the $50 mark. And it doesn't make much difference in the next three or four months in sales.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right, okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Volume in sales.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right, fair enough. And then...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean you make calls, I make calls, you know?","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right, exactly.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Here you go.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then on U.S. HVAC, so you had a good quarter and the sell-in data has been very good and the manufacturing data has been a little bouncy. So how do you feel about inventories right now, and you're expecting a good fiscal Q3. Any risks around that based on what you're seeing out there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nothing right now. The channels move up and down. I think that it could have had a couple months where construction wasn't as strong as people did and the inventories being built. Right now, it looks like things are pretty well balanced and the order pace is pretty good in North America. So I would expect us to have a decent third quarter in North America. And depending how hot it gets is how much liquidation goes out and how much you have to build later in the year, which will be a good thing for us. So we'll see what happens now. Right now, it's setting up to be a decent year for us in North America and a decent year for us in Europe and in some of the other parts of the marketplace. But it's good to see. It's good to see.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If it's the normal weather, you feel pretty good about the growth trend.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I feel pretty good about it. I'm not too worried about that segment right now. I'm not hearing anybody jumping up and down at this point. Frank, do you hear anybody jumping up and down?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Frank just shook his head.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we're in pretty good shape there.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And if Frank doesn't jump up and down and shake his head, we're okay.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. I'll see you in a couple weeks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay, good. Thanks. I want to thank everybody for their time today. Again, operations, outstanding job in execution. I thank Frank and Ed and Ed and everybody out there working with the operation guys to get this done. And we clearly continue to pivot towards the repositioning. And our goal is to come out, as we talked about in the February investor meeting, come out a little bit smaller company, more profitable company but quickly add on acquisitions to use the money we're going to generate here to invest in the growth again and get this company back above $20 billion with a 19% to 20% EBIT margin, so a very good business.

[Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded today, February 3, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson.","David Farr","Before Craig starts, this is David Farr. I just want to make sure that everyone realizes this is Craig's first day on the job here and first quarterly announcement. So go easy on him out there and just try not to get too upset and write nasty comments. You can pick on me. You can pick on Frank. But go easy on Craig and his first time. We'll get him next time. Craig, it's all yours and congratulations and welcome aboard.","Craig Rossman","All right. Thank you, David. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on the Emerson's website at Emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 90 days. I will start with the highlights of the quarter, as shown on slide 2 of the presentation.","Net sales were unchanged at $5.6 billion with underlying sales up 6% in the quarter. Underlying sales increased in all business segments with Climate Technologies being the strongest, up 17%. The Americas exhibited strong growth in the quarter with mixed results in other regions. Emerging markets grew by 5%. Gross profit margin increased 90 basis points to 40.8%, while segment margins were up 60 basis points to 15%.","First quarter earnings per share were $0.75, representing a 15% increase over prior-year and a 4% increase above the consensus. Share repurchases accelerated to $518 million in the quarter and the previously announced divestiture of Power Transmission Solutions closed on January 30. The first quarter was a solid start to the year, despite an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, due to a strong U.S. dollar, the significant decline in oil prices and the continued weakness in Europe.","Turn to slide 3 for the first quarter P&L summary. Net sales were flat to prior year while GP improved 90 basis points including the effect of portfolio repositioning and efficiency gains. EBIT increased 210 basis points which included favorable currency transactions of $19 million.","Turning to slide 4, underlying sales growth in the quarter was up 6%, offset by 3% declines from both currency translations and divestitures. The United States and Canada reflected strong market conditions, up 8% and 21%, respectively, while trends in other regions were mixed.","Turning to slide 5, business segment margin expansion was led by Climate Technologies and Process Management, while also including the effect of portfolio repositioning. Favorable comparisons in corporate expenses resulted in a $74 million decrease versus the prior year. Lower operating cash flow reflected primarily timing of working capital investment to aid underlying sales growth in the quarter. Trade working capital improved 50 basis points versus the prior year.","Turning to slide 6 for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales grew by 6% with a 3% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales growth of 3% in the quarter. Sales growth was strongest in North America, up 9%, led by downstream and MRO investment. Demand in Asia was mixed, up 1% with growth in India and China offset by weakness in Australia and Southeast Asia. Europe grew 4% as double-digit growth in emerging countries offset modest declines in mature markets. Latin America reflected robust growth with sales up 26% in the quarter.","Conditions in the Middle East\/Africa were mixed with sales down 1%. Segment margins improved 40 basis points, reflecting favorable currency transactions. Order trends have remained solid and backlog is strong, despite an uncertain outlook in the process industry.","Turn to slide 7 for Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation underlying sales grew by 4% in the quarter offset by a 4% reduction from currency translation, resulting in net sales that were flat to prior year. Strength in North America was reflected with sales up 13%. The increase was led by growth of over 20% in the HVAC-related hermetic motors business.","The electrical distribution and power transmission solutions businesses reported strong growth with the fluid automation business down modestly. The declines in power generating alternators and motors and drives businesses reflected continued economic weakness in Europe which was down 8%. Overall, Asia grew by 5%, benefiting from robust growth in Japan coupled with solid results in China.","Order rates in power generating alternators are expected to slow further as increased pressure from lower oil prices reduces spending in the upstream oil and gas market. We expect market conditions to remain mixed in the near term with favorable trends in North America and continued weakness in Europe.","Turning to slide 8 for Network Power segment results. Network Power underlying sales grew by 1% in the quarter, offset by a 3% reduction from currency translations and a 12% reduction from divestitures, resulting in net sales decrease of 14% versus the prior year. The data center business was up slightly, reflecting mixed market conditions with strong growth in Europe, benefiting from a hyperscale project in Sweden, while growth in North America was offset by Asia, Latin America and Middle East\/Africa.","The telecommunications infrastructure business declined at a double-digit rate with growth in Asia offset by weakness in other regions. U.S. telecommunications customers have curtailed spending referencing uncertainty surrounding potential changes in federal regulations. The margin increase of 70 basis points reflects the impact of divestitures. Demand is expected to remain mixed in the near term with favorable data center market conditions and reduced levels of telecommunications investment.","Turn to slide 9 for Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies underlying sales grew by 17% with a 2% reduction from currency translation. Net sales increased 15% as U.S. regulatory changes that went into effect on January 1 drove residential HVAC customers to build inventory ahead of the deadline. Commercial HVAC grew at an upper single-digit rate which was led by North America.","Global refrigeration had modest growth as strength in the U.S. and Asia was partially offset by a decrease in Europe. The demand for sensors and controls businesses was flat. Segment margins increased 40 basis points primarily from leverage on the increased sales volume. Second quarter order trends in the U.S. will be uncertain until customers consume inventory that was built in the current quarter. Market conditions are expected to remain favorable, driven by end user demand with continued momentum in North America and Asia.","Turn to slide 10 for the Commercial and Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial and Residential Solutions underlying sales grew by 4% with a 1% reduction from currency translation resulting in net sales growth of 3%. Market conditions were mixed with increased demand in the Americas and Middle East\/Africa, while Asia and Europe were down. Increased sales were led by solid growth in professional tools with moderate increases in wet\/dry vacuums and food waste disposer businesses.","The commercial and residential storage businesses decreased modestly. Segment margin remains strong at 21.5%, up 10 basis points versus the prior year. As we continue to assess our portfolio, we recently initiated the evaluation process of a potential divestiture of the Intermetro business. We expect favorable trends in the U.S. residential and commercial construction markets to continue in the near term.","Slide 11 contains our 2015 outlook and guidance. The current state of the global macroeconomic environment is mixed with favorable trends in North America contrasting weakness in Europe and other emerging markets. As we consider the outlook for 2015, we note three main concerns. First, the strength of the U.S. dollar which will continue to be a significant headwind. Second, the continued weakness in Europe which has not recovered from the global recession of 2008-2009, as well as weakness in other emerging markets. And third, the rapid and sustained decline in oil prices which will be primarily felt in the second half of our FY \u201815.","Given our concerns, we have decided to accelerate a restructuring to approximately $100 million which will allow for a selective repositioning of our cost structure. Based on these current business conditions, the following is expected in 2015; underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%, a net sales decline of negative 1% to negative 4% reflecting a 4% to 5% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from divestitures.","Profitability is expected to continue to improve modestly from favorable mix and accelerated restructuring. The expected range of reported EPS is $4.50 to $4.60. This guidance includes a significant reduction from currency translation, an estimated divestiture gain of $0.75 per share and accelerated restructuring costs of $0.05 per share. Additional business segment guidance will be provided at our annual investor conference on February 19.","Now, I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Craig. Great job. Much smoother voice and delivery than Craig \"who\" Fitzgerald, who's, by the way, doing a great job in one of our process businesses now in Louisville and having a fun job back into operations. I'm sure he's enjoying that today. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us. I appreciate your time. We had a very solid start to the new fiscal year with 6% underlying sales growth.","But as I say, the challenge is now beginning. With the dramatic drop-off in oil prices and the resulting capital spending which we'll talk about when we meet in later this month in February, continued weakness in Europe and their only address at this point in time is to weaken the currency relative to doing real structural reform.","The global weakening currencies in emerging markets as these currencies are trying to adjust to figure out how to get growth in a global slowdown. And clearly, a stronger dollar are going to hurt a lot of our exporting customers here in North America as they have problems competing around the world with a stronger dollar. Consequently, we decided to accelerate restructuring.","The world's clearly changing from the last conversation we had in November with a lot of moving dynamics, but fundamentally as we see it today, we see a much slower global growth and we're concerned that there's not a lot of momentum relative to turning that growth around potentially for a couple years. So we feel it's very appropriate to rebalance our SG&A headcount on a global basis.","We balance our global manufacturing and get our cost structure in-line with what we see as a slower marketplace and a changing marketplace as the whole world rebalances with the relative currency changes, the lower energy costs and the uncertainty relative to some of the major economies in the world, be it Europe, be it China, be it Brazil. We know how to do restructuring.","We had built in $50 million originally in our plan and we feel quite significantly upping this to include another at least $50 million, maybe a little bit more and to get on this right away, to help our second half of calendar year 2015 margins. Also, to help 2016 which is very important to get on with this and we're taking action today and we will continue to accelerate this.","From my perspective, we will continue to drive the necessary investments to accelerate our growth, to improve our growth. Growth will be still challenging, but we're going to grow. I still feel comfortable saying our underlying growth rate's going to be in the 3% to 5% range. Clearly, it's not as strong as we thought it was just six months ago with the global dynamics, but we still feel it's pretty solid.","We have a strong backlog. Our profitability is running at record levels. The restructuring's going to allow us to help us protect some of that profitability in the dynamic economies around the world. There are some pluses out there in the world that I think with lower energy prices, you're going to see some of the emerging markets accelerate growth late 2015 and going into 2016. In addition, a lot of these emerging markets have actually lowered their currency valuations to make themselves more competitive.","So repositioning right now makes a lot of sense because you're going to see some of these markets, the India, the China, other parts of the world where lower energy costs are going to help them be more competitive at the same time they have reduced their currency value which will give them the ability to be more competitive. As you know, we're extremely strong in emerging markets position today already from a manufacturing standpoint, a selling standpoint and our ability to compete.","So I feel it's very appropriate to take action and deal with the issues facing us right now and figure out how to drive growth, at the same time to protect our profitability in the uncertain world. We will have the benefit of lower commodities which helps us from a net material inflation standpoint in the near term. Potentially in [inaudible] that will start reversing as we'll start seeing other pricing pressures.","We have the benefit of some of our emerging market positions to be able to accelerate and be competitive on a global basis from an export standpoint and be in our strong position there. So a very strong position from which to protect our growth and protect our profitability.","From a cash flow standpoint, for the year, we're still looking at the range of $3.7 billion operating cash flow. This does not include the impact of a loss of cash and the divestiture of power transmission business which is done, also the tax impact of that which will have an impact on the cash flow on a reporting basis. Cash flow is generally going to be solid again this year. Capital spending is going to be around $800 million as we continue to invest in new products, as we continue to invest in our global footprint and make sure we stay competitive.","We'll get into the segments and what we see in each of the segments in our February meeting coming on February 19 in New York City, but from my perspective right now, we had a good start to the year.","We see some issues out there. We're dealing with these issues. We're accelerating restructuring. We're making sure our cost position stays at the right level and taking those actions allowing us to address some issues that had built up in the last several years and we're going to deal with those. At the same time, I feel we still have some strong underlying growth opportunities. We just have to be very nimble and very quick and figure out where those are and make sure we can see growing the company. The company is very strong at this point in time and we're going into the second quarter in a decent position, but the winds clearly have shifted and we'll talk a lot more about that on February 19.","I want to thank all the businesses out there for delivering a solid first quarter and I want to thank the businesses for taking very strong action so quickly on the restructuring which a lot of it is going to occur over the next two or three months which is very, very important, impacting 1000 SG&A people and impacting at least 1000 hourly people around the world.","So with that, open the line up to take questions and look forward to seeing everybody on February 19th in New York.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","Dave, could you dig in a little bit to China business trends? You guys are a pretty good read on a lot of those puts and takes in that market and the macro suggests slowing, certainly construction doesn't look great. You guys had a tough compare. Just what are you seeing and what's your outlook there?","David Farr","My expectation in China right now is that it will be slower in 2015 than it was in 2014. We had a very good year in 2014. Obviously, the underlying economics have weakened. China started out very slow. We did have some tough comparisons, but just the overall pace of business was more challenging. I do think that it's going to grow low single-digit.","I still believe that looking based on the order pace and based on the project list that we're seeing right now, but I do expect China to be weaker this year than last year and I believe the government is taking actions necessary to, again get their house in order and figure out how to keep that growth going and trying to continue to let air out of what I would call the bubble in certain sectors of the economy.","But overall, I just got back from meeting with my Asia people and they're pretty still positive about China. But my assessment is even though they would think that they're doing as well as last year, I think they're doing a little bit worse than last year, but still okay, still positive growth, still at the growth rate.","John Inch","Dave, a couple years ago I think you had called out a trend of Emerson pursuing more automation as part of your facilities in China. Where do you stand with respect to your operating footprint? Are you happy with the cost structure, where you're positioned there. Do you think there's a little more action you'd like to take just in light of the pending slightly softer outlook?","David Farr","Still on path, John to continue to rationalize our manufacturing footprint in China and I would say that part of the actions we're taking in this acceleration will be to continue to do more of that. So the automation part is continuing to happen across the businesses. I think we pretty much got that done. But right now, what I'm going through is a rationalization of the manufacturing footprint and do we need that capacity or not need that capacity? But you also have to take into consideration the renminbi right now is continuing to devalue again and so we have to watch that. But we're continuing to rationalize that and I would say that the footprint is still declining.","John Inch","Just lastly, the PTS gain, I think you said $520 million, I think previously we thought it was going to be about $1 billion. Was there something about the final closing that made that adjustment?","Craig Rossman","Pretax number John, the 520 is an after-tax number.","John Inch","Okay. So it was just pre versus post-tax.","David Farr","$1 billion gain. Pretax gain. You had the right number.","Operator","We'll go next to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Dave, you made some pretty cautious comments regarding the macro, I think for somewhat obvious reasons, but your guidance still implies some acceleration year-over-year. You just came off a pretty good quarter. What is it that you're seeing out there that's changed and maybe it's the month of January that's caused some concern, but if you back out currency your orders have been pretty good. Just give us a little bit of color on why you've been more cautious, despite the fact the 3% to 5% core growth, if you take the midpoint, would still be your best year in three years.","David Farr","From my perspective Scott, the big issue right now would be what I'm seeing happening to our major oil and gas customers and they are definitely are starting to cut back and we're starting to see that. As you know we're very strong in that sector. We have good strength in North America and the North America guys are going to be cutting back with the price of oil where it is and the pressure point relative to the demand around the world.","I have a pretty good understanding of the process industry. My gut tells me right now that we're going to see a deceleration of orders and sales in the process business that could cause us problems in the second half of this year and also 2016, hence the need for acceleration. I'm being very cautious because I am nervous about that.","Scott Davis","How does -- I think upstream oil we all would -- I think most of us on the line here would agree is going to have some challenges. How does chemical play out as we get into the back half of the year and such? You're also very strong in that world as well and utility as well.","David Farr","Yes, I think that there is a lot of puts and takes with the lower price of oil and gas as you well know, as you were just saying there. Upstream is clearly going to be hurt. National oil companies will keep spending, going in my opinion, around the world. Downstream with the lower feedstock going in both the oil and the gas, will be helped. The question is how fast do they go make those investments?","The question is, I think it's going to be later maybe late 2015 on the calendar year basis, maybe early 2016 that we would see that type of acceleration. They have to go through the process. They have to think about the world and the rebalancing. They have to think about the world's demand. So I think there's going to be a lag to be honest, Scott. Based on what I've seen in the past when we've had this dramatic drop-off in the oil prices, you see a lag. I think there eventually will be a benefit and you're right, but I wouldn't be surprised if there is not a hole there for six or nine months or eight months for some of our businesses as the shift goes between downstream and upstream. We're strong in both bases. We're going to talk quite a bit about that, but clearly there is a hole opening up. No doubt about it. Hence, we're getting ready for it.","Operator","And we'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Just a question on the portfolio, you mentioned divestment sort of potentially underway in Commercial and Residential Solutions. It's sort of the fourth year now of maybe low, mid-single digit earnings growth. Does that make you want to accelerate portfolio change in divestments or does it make you want to kind of slow them down because you're not getting as much organic earnings growth as you may have expected a couple of years ago?","David Farr","From my perspective, we laid out a plan of what we want to undertake in the restructuring a couple years ago and we have a couple pieces left and they are businesses that don't fit us strategically and we're going to get that done.","One of them is we announced we're evaluating Intermetro right now and we will continue to look at acquisitions and when they come up and I think they will come up in this marketplace that potentially could get a little sloppy in late 2015, early 2016 from an acquisition. We're clearly looking for acquisitions, but we're also not going to go crazy. I understand that divesting has an impact on the company, but I'm also repositioning this company for the future. Sometimes transition takes time. The company's extremely healthy right now through this transition. We're investing. The quality of the earnings, the quality of the assets are very high.","I expect my shareholders to stay with us as we make this reposition and then we will continue to figure out how to accelerate our top line growth and earnings growth coming out of this. We know what it takes to grow this company.","Julian Mitchell","And then just on the currency hit to earnings, wonder if you could quantify that at all for this year or say what the hit was in Q1 to earnings from currency?","David Farr","So from the perspective of the way we look at currency, as we look at the way we're balanced around the world, both the inputs and outputs. If we lose $1 of sales, we lose about $0.15 of profits, 15%, and so if we lost 3 points of growth in the first quarter, you can calculate that and you can then calculate what that means on average, we lose about $0.15, $0.16 with the current structure and the current currency makeup.","So can tell you how much earnings we lost in the first quarter. Those things help us sometimes and hurt us sometimes and I'm a big believer in a strong dollar. Right now obviously, it's hurting us, but I'm a big believer in a strong dollar and our objective is to figure out how to grow this company and deal with the fact that we have a headwind, but who cares, we've got a headwind. ","So from my perspective, we're going to deal with it. And so the same thing happens through the year. We just lost, as you know, we're going to lose probably 4 to 5 points of currency growth for the year. You can do the same calculation what that means in EPS.","Julian Mitchell","Very quickly, just a clarification on the -- you made some comments on pricing. Your gross margins have obviously been very, very strong Q1 and last fiscal year. Do you see any potential for that gross margin increase to kind of plateau out because pricing may get tougher?","David Farr","From our perspective right now, the comment I made is we look at the price cost and we're green. With the movement of commodities where they are right now, it's going to help us in the next couple quarters. I know that we will have pricing actions necessary over time and typically, what happens, pricing will catch up and so we'll lose some of that green.","But at this point in time, our ability to manage the price cost and stay slightly green or within that around zero has been very good and I don't see that changing here in the next couple years. Stability will come in commodities and we'll probably have to give some price back, but that pressure probably won't build into 2016, but I still believe that we can maintain our green capability.","We have the infrastructure and management team to be able to do that. So we clearly are mapping it out right now and we have a benefit going, but I also know that benefit will come against me at some point in time, too.","Operator","We'll go next to Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Dave, you talk about increasing the restructuring, but you've also had the foot on the gas with some of these growth investments that you've been increasing recently. What happens to those in this sort of changed environment? Do you keep speeding on those or pull back on a few? Maybe a little color there.","David Farr","From our perspective, we're going through a quick evaluation of some of those growth investments based on the segments, based on what we see happening here in the next couple years. I would say there is going to be a fine tuning, but we're going to continue to invest and protect the key growth investments to drive that growth and re-evaluate our cost structure elsewhere and so we're going to do a balancing act here.","Clearly, one of the things we're going to look at is if we have a segment that's under a lot of pressure and downward trend line for the next couple years, we may pull back on that from a growth investment standpoint and not spend that money. But we're going to keep most of it going forward and rebalance cost structure elsewhere.","Shannon O'Callaghan","All right. In process, we've got kind of the end market look, upstream, downstream. As you look across the different product lines, the valves, devices, systems, is there any difference you expect or you're already seeing or that you expect to see in terms of what parts of that are going to hold up better than others?","David Farr","It's a little bit hard to tell right now. All I can tell you is, someone asked me the first question about why we have insight been in the business quite a bit. We have some segments in the process world that lead this change when the cycle changes and they've been changing now for 60 days and they've been changing the wrong way, down.","So I think that the early cycle parts are already starting to impact and we're seeing that and we're going to redirect our organization to figure out how to make sure we protect our MRO business, how to protect the small brownfield investments and I think that it's hard to say which one's going to do worse. All I can tell you right now is the leading places within the process world have already started turning and directly tell us that we're going to have a slowdown. It's coming.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Pokrzywinski with Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I guess first question on the backlog, how much visibility do you think you have? And then I guess in conversations with your customers, I think to follow-up on the question from last quarter, how long before they start thinking about cancellations in addition to incoming order weakness?","David Farr","Right now, the backlog is holding. As you know, we reprice our backlog every month with the currency and so when you see our orders turn down, a lot of times when the currency impacts those orders down and up and so right now, we're repricing, but the backlog's sitting at higher levels than it was this year last time. Right now, it's at $6.8 billion and so we have not seen any pushback on the backlog.","I think what's going to happen is you're going to see a push out in maybe some of the execution of them. If the project's been awarded and they're procuring materials, there is a lot of cancellation impact there. I think you're going to see a rebalancing from a customer perspective. What's going on right now is they're evaluating where they want to spend their money which projects they want to go forward which projects they want to slow down which projects they only want to do half of. This is going to take time, but it's pretty clear to me, based on the grinding we're seeing at the customer level and the feedback we're getting and also the early indications that there is going to be a slowdown and a push out.","As I said earlier, there is going to be some holes emerging in the process order and sales book and our objective is to figure out how to gain penetration around the world to try to protect our growth. But I know it's going to slow down and be slower and we're going to have some quarters that potentially go negative in the process world. So it's pretty clear what's happening. It will take about six months to unfold and our customer base is clearly working it right now. Most importantly for us is we're getting ready. We're redirecting our organization around the world where we think we need to go to make sure we can maximize our growth potential in the marketplace.","Josh Pokrzywinski","To think about the magnitude of that, I understand it's early, there's a lot of balls up in the air, still not all determined yet, but presumably in your career, you've seen big CapEx downturns by some of your larger customers. Do you find yourself moving at a fraction of that or a multiple of that or kind of on a one to one basis? If you had an E&P CapEx by 20%, do you guys feel it dollar for dollar or maybe less so?","David Farr","It's not dollar for dollar. We're going to take you through, I've asked Steve Sonnenberg to take you through the mix of our business in February, how it mixes out, how we see if capital spending goes down in oil by 15%, what does that mean to us relative to -- we'll go through the details and calculations for you on that. But it's not dollar per dollar. Our current indication right now, based on inputs, is we're going to see the marketplace globally, the market globally is going to be negative. I think in the process world for the next 12 months.","What we've been able to do historically, is we've been able to outperform the market, but we clearly see with the take back, the cut down of certain spending that the marketplace, what we call the process world is definitely going to go negative. The game plan for us right now is how to have growth in a marketplace that's going to be negative for 12 or 18 months coming at us here in the very near future. That's the game plan.","Josh Pokrzywinski","If I could sneak in a non-oil question which I'm sure you're longing for.","David Farr","I like oil. I love oil.","Josh Pokrzywinski","I'll sell some to you at a discount. On the HVAC business, I guess the climate side, related in IA, are you guys able to quantify what the benefit was from pre-buy and how we should think about that versus 2Q and 3Q?","David Farr","The market has talked about 1 million units being pulled up. 1 million units. I can't remember off the top of my head, but it's pretty significant. I couldn't tell you, if you go out I'm sure it's out there, they can tell you who it is and you can go out and find out how many units are out there. One million units were pulled up and clearly that is not for one quarter. That's a pull ahead, they have 18 months to use that buildup.","So the way I look at it right now as we put in the press release, we won't get a feel for this until March, April, what units are being sold and what other type of market dynamics we have out there. We're going to see pretty sloppy North America order pace for climate for the next three, four months. I'm of the opinion that it is going to bounce back and we're going to see a recovery there and we'll get back to some normality. Clearly, that inventory build is not for one quarter. It was meant to be for 18 months and we'll see what happens there.","Operator","We'll go next to Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","On slide 3, I may have missed this, the favorable currency transaction at $19 million, was that a year-over-year or was that a comp? What was the factor there?","Craig Rossman","Yes, so that's the year-over-year.","Deane Dray","Was the impact a year ago? What would have been -- I'm not used to seeing anything currency being favorable in this environment.","David Farr","This is a cost -- this is different type of --","Craig Rossman","In transactional currency, we have the number of contracts, long-term contracts mainly in process that get marked to market for currency. Given that they're heavily into some currencies that are depreciating where we have strong currency contracts, those get marked to market. It's called embedded derivatives. We had a big pickup there in embedded derivatives in the quarter and you're right, it is unusual to see it go in that direction.","David Farr","What will happen is that will zero out over a time period, typically within 12, 18 months it will zero out. One quarter, you'll get it. Next quarter, you lose it. It will zero out. That's why say flag it, so you see it because we know we're not going to keep that forever.","Deane Dray","Now, in the comment on slide 5 regarding higher working capital needs, so with the expectation of some of the softening maybe you can just point to which business specifically you'd see the higher working capital.","David Farr","That was for the quarter because we had underlying growth of 6% and so one of the things we saw was a little bit of higher working capital. As our underlying growth comes down, we'll start taking capital off the balance sheet. So that's not unusual for us to go up and down in a quarter, but that's what he's referring to. He's referring to higher underlying growth rate in the first quarter. That 6% level we actually built a little bit of working capital typically. Even though we had good conversion, it still went up dollar-wise and hurt us in the quarter, that's all it was.","Deane Dray","Just last question, I don't want to front run too much of your Analyst Day.","David Farr","I'm working on that, I'm really starting to get it fine-tuned here. I don't want to give all the facts to you, yet.","Deane Dray","Not looking for facts, but just in terms of thematically, it sounds like you'll give us more color on the oil exposure. Is there anything else thematically you might be touching on?","David Farr","I think we\u2019re going to break up in the process side. We're going to try to figure out if as I said, the market's going to be negative for a period here for 12 or 18 months, how we're going to grow and we're going to talk a little about that. It'll be a big issue there. We'll get into a little bit -- I've asked Ed Monser to talk about international. I think there's going to be a period here now with the currencies reshuffling out there.","You see a lot of currencies, international currencies, devaluing and there is going to be a changing mix right now relative to what's competitive out there in the marketplace and you're going to start moving production around the world. We're going to talk a little about that and how we're positioned and where you see the pockets of growth. I think we're going to give you a little bit of insight there.","And then I'm going to have Charlie talk a little about Internet of Things and where we continue to invest to change our business models that will evolve over time. In this industry, it's a very slow process, but we're going to have Charlie talk about that. We've got some fun things to talk about. We're making investments. We're going to figure out how to grow this company. We've got some good things to talk about.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","So just back to process, I think someone, perhaps Shannon, was trying to get at this a little bit, but I'm just trying to understand kind of the mix effects in the business. And in particular I believe, although I'm not 100% correct, that kind of the strength in North America oil and gas has been very, very mix positive for you. Maybe in general, things have been mix positive because the big projects have kind of been looming but not really kicking into gear. Is that right? Should we be thinking about a kind of meaningful mix down as we roll forward here the next, I don't know 3, 4, 5 quarters?","David Farr","You're exactly right. We're very strong in North America, we're very strong in oil and gas and we've had a good run in North America. Our North America percent of sales for process has gone up the last couple years because of the oil and gas investments. Clearly, one of the things we're dealing with right now on restructuring and the process guys will be restructuring is how to protect our profitability with the changing mix.","Steve's going to go through that with you relative to what we see happening. But clearly, things are going to go on in North America on a negative side, but also things on the positive side. If we have less oil and gas investment in North America, we think, at the appropriate time, you're going to see improvement in downstream investments which are also very good for us in North America.","The problem is not going to be synced up properly. You're going to see a slowdown in the oil and gas upfront. We're not going to see a pickup in the downstream later on. We have to figure out how to get our cost structure in-line, protect our profitability and process with the changing mix. That is, hence, one of the aggressiveness we're trying to take right now from a restructuring standpoint because we've had a benefit in this the last couple years. You're exactly right.","Jeff Sprague","That strength you saw in Latin America and Canada, is that all oil patch related too or is there a little bit of diversity in that strength?","David Farr","In Canada, it's primarily oil and gas. The key issue for us is, I think Canada's not going to back off as much as people think on spending in protecting their oil and gas. They need that income. I think we had a very good quarter. I still think it will weaken but I don't think -- we'll see how much those oil companies protect Canada up there. Right now, we're still expecting Canada to have some growth this year. We had a very good Mexico and the investments have continued in Mexico, primarily not in the oil and gas, but other areas of Mexico and the wild card for us does Mexico hold up for us in 2015? But we had a he very good start in Latin America and that's helped us quite a bit. I think people are probably surprised at how good our process business was in the first quarter and our backlog, by the way, did not really drop in process in the first quarter. So we shift what we knew business. We had a very good first quarter.","Jeff Sprague","Just one quick one, if I could. On climate, the margins are not as high as I would have guessed given the volume surge. Did that pre-buy or prebuild cause you a lot of inefficiencies in overtime and the like? Any color there?","David Farr","No, it didn't cause us a problem there. The issue is just a mix business within the type of pre-buy, the type of product that our customers were buying would be at the lower end of our mix and so, therefore we didn't get as much flow-through in the profitability. We still made decent money because we did get some profit improvement, but you're right it was not what I would call in the sweet spot of our compressor type of business.","Operator","And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Dave, so the $50 million serve up in restructuring, it sounds like process is going to account for the bulk of that. Is that the right way to think about it?","David Farr","No, we're going across the whole company. I'm particularly looking at Europe which will mean I might be hitting network power. I'm going to be hitting industrial automation, I'm going to be hitting process. I'm going to be looking at -- I'm a little bit nervous about Europe. I think Europe had some fundamental cost issues. I don't think those governments are really dealing with it. Devaluing the currency is not going to help them as much in a real cost structure standpoint. They have a lot of inefficiencies there. The fact they're not getting growth is a concern for me. So you're going to see us take some across the board, but it's going to be across all businesses, process and network power will be the two biggest and industrial automation will be the third.","Nigel Coe","Which leads on to [inaudible] power because if we adjust the prior year for [inaudible], then margins are still down year-over-year. I'm wondering obviously your restructuring, additional restructuring will help in the back half of the year, but what is your line of sight in terms of mix or other factors to drive margins back into expansion?","David Farr","There are two issues. There is restructuring from the cost standpoint. We have the new products out. We're selling the new products. The key issue for me right now is continuing to right-size and readjust that organization for the new business model, the new marketplace and that will continue to happen throughout this year and then continue to work on the cost structure of the new products and the new organization relative to deliver that business.","So we're going through a process right now. We're going to have to sort of rebase that whole business. We've got the ability. We've got the products. The question is how do we change that cost structure to get the levels of profitability and I want -- Scott Barber's going to talk about that in New York. That's the key issue for me going forward is we know where this marketplace has gone, we have the capability for dealing with it now, how do we make acceptable profitability?","Nigel Coe","A quick one, Dave on Russia. Sounds like Russia was still up for you in process which is remarkable given all the news flow in Russia. Is that correct? Maybe just a bit of color in terms of what you're seeing over there.","David Farr","Russia was still good for us. Now, we got hit pretty hard with the ruble. But we have a very strong local manufacturing capability and service capability in Russia and given the fact that we have this local capability, it's given us a pretty good competitive advantage.","So we're seeing the company still spending money and so our business in Russia has held up and we had a decent quarter. The question, will that continue to be able to do that from the standpoint of where can they come up with the money? But right now, we had a very good start to the year and we see our customers' spending money.","Operator","We'll go next to Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood","Given how many questions we're getting from investors on process, can you just give us a sense of what declines you're expecting particularly in the upstream business and how you're thinking about it from a sensitivity standpoint versus even periods like 2009 when you saw pretty significant declines in that business?","David Farr","I would rather wait on the 19th to talk about that. I think you're going to -- I'll give you an idea. Right now, we're looking at the market declines because of what we see out there probably in the 2% to 3% range, overall total process market declines about 2% to 3% which is a little bit less than the last one with the shifting going on relative to some of the downstream investments and other investments going on around the world.","That's where we see. We'll talk more about that. But overall, the oil and gas number obviously is going to be a lot bigger decline and we'll talk about that, but I think the market overall is going to be down 2%, 3%.","Mike Wood","I'll wait to hear more on that, then. Just regards to your balance sheet, how are you thinking about where your leverage is now? Why not take a more aggressive balance sheet stance through buybacks or more aggressive, larger M&A given just the share performance over the past few years?","David Farr","Clearly, not happy about the share performance in the last couple of years. From my perspective right now, we're going to buy back at a minimum, $2 billion worth of stock this year. We're also trying to keep our balance sheet ready if the right opportunity comes along from an acquisition standpoint, but we have not seen that opportunity at this point in time that makes sense to create value. We're keeping that balance sheet and if necessary we'll continue to increase share repurchase at the right -- appropriate time. But I don't see us changing the leverage on our company at this point, because I would like to make sure that we have the ability to do a significant acquisition if the right one comes along.","Mike Wood","And then just finally, can you give us any more color on the Intermetro size of the business?","David Farr","It's a little too early to talk about that, but it's more than $200 million.","Operator","We'll go next to Mark Douglass with Longbow Research.","Mark Douglass","Dave, can you talk about some more of the challenges in China? For you, are they more general economy specific to certain market exposures? Frankly which segment has the most China exposure?","David Farr","We're pretty strong in China on all segments but clearly process, network power, climate and then industrial. Network Power is number one, then Process is number two, Climate's number three and Industrial's number four, off the top of my head. I think it's market. There is a general slowdown as they look at where they want investments to happen.","We had a very good period last year across the board and I think right now, what we're seeing at the highest level in China is sort of re-evaluation of where money's going to be spent and how they're going to fund it. So what we're expecting is a step back up as you get into the springtime in China and so we'll get a better feel. Right now, we're still pretty optimistic based on the type of transaction and bidding going on that we're going to see growth this year, but albeit I think it will be a little lesser growth. It's all about where money's being spent and not being spent right now. That's what it is.","Mark Douglass","Okay. And then on Network Power, the big project in Sweden, how much did it help you in the quarter? Is there still some leftover, still over into say the second quarter? Does this imply maybe that Network Power is flat to even maybe down underlying by the time we get to the back half of the year?","David Farr","The product is going to spread out over the year. Actually, some of the project might go into next year. I think from our perspective, the project's spread out and the key issue for us is we've got the capability to win. The question is how do we change that cost structure to win the type in the marketplace we see today. That's what Scott Barber and his team is all focused on at this point in time. We know how to sell. We know how to make money. The question is how to make acceptable levels of profitability. That's why we have them take a hard look at the restructuring. Given the products, given what we need, let's deal with this issue now and get on with it.","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Winoker with Stanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker","Listen, on the slide 11 when you talked about guidance, you talked about modest profitability improvement. We've talked around that a lot. But just the puts and takes, if restructuring sounds like $100 million or call it 180 basis points, I've got FX which sounded like you said 15%, so $25 million or $30 million. I've got price versus commodity which sounds still positive and then productivity and then you've got normal incremental leverage on the volume which is something like $67 million or so.","So I'm just trying to understand what am I missing or how are you guys thinking about the puts and takes? Frankly, what I really want to know is just what is the modest profitability improvement you're look for all-in, net?","David Farr","1\/10th, 2\/10th [ph], that will be the chart. With the puts and takes we've got going on right now, we're going to be fighting for profitability and that's the game plan.","Steve Winoker","Okay. And then secondly on restructuring, Dave, Emerson has done an extraordinary amount of restructuring and cost takeout for certainly, both before the downturn and through the downturn, up until now. I'm as big a believer in lean and benefits of cost takeout -- it never stops. That being said, it's a pretty decent size number we're looking at this year. How do you sort of think about muscle versus fat on this one and protecting the growth?","David Farr","Any company as large as Emerson, you do acquisitions, you make investments, you can get a little less lean. We're going after this pretty hard. We're looking at of all the capital investments we make in the last couple years, sort of which ones can we get more out of it productivity-wise? We're not going to cut anything that's crucial to growing this company, but we have ability to lean this company out and I fundamentally believe we could be facing extended time period where I want to lean it.","We're going to lean it. You're right, we know how to do that. The business leaders have done a great job of reacting to this. I came back from a trip to India in the middle of January and I met with the OC. I said, we need to lean out. That's what we're doing. So Ed Purvis takes over and it's all he's talking about right now is figuring out how to lean this thing out, working with Frank and other guys. We're not going to damage ourself. Always room to get better. Always room to get leaner and meaner just like you are, Steve.","Steve Winoker","One more thing, you talked about downstream chemical opportunity. And I understand the feedstock point, but the spread between oil and gas matters a lot with regard to ethylene and ethylene linking to butadiene, propylene, benzene, et cetera. What are you guys seeing? You're not concerned about the shrinking gap between oil and gas inputs potentially putting new investments on hold?","David Farr","We haven't seen any of that, yet, but that's obviously clear. It's clearly a key issue. I think that's why there is going to be a pause here where people evaluate where everything's going to stabilize, that's why a gap's going to open up. It's pretty easy to put things on hold on upstream. I think they're going to take a little longer to evaluate downstream. We do know some of the gas liquification and those type of materials are going to move forward and things like that at this point in time.","Clearly, there is a lot of evaluation going on and I'm very concerned about it, that's why Steve Sonnenberg and his team are going to be pretty aggressive here to rebalance their cost structure knowing they could be facing an 18 month headwind. So you're right, Steve, we don't know exactly yet, but we do know that it's going to be tougher and we do know there's still going to be huge capital out there being spent. How do we get more of that capital? How do we use our people to get more of that capital?","Operator","We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","David Farr","Hello, Mr. Tusa. If there's a million unit pull up, what's the total number? You know the total, what is it?","Steve Tusa","For what?","David Farr","If you had a million unit pull up in the quarter, what's the total industry in a year?","Steve Tusa","Five and change.","David Farr","Six, yes.","Steve Tusa","So just on oil and gas, you're talking about a market, you said being down in the 2% to 3% range, is that a 2016 comment?","David Farr","The total process marketplace, I think we're going to have a window here of the 12 months going to be down 2% to 3%.","Steve Tusa","Over the course of calendar 2015?","David Farr","Correct.","Steve Tusa","You sound pretty negative, rightfully so. There is a lot of cross-currents going on out here, but 2% to 3% doesn't really sound that bad. Is there a quarter or two here that could get pretty ugly and how should we be prepared for the coming string of orders reports here? Should we be kind of prepped for a couple double-digiters in there for you guys or what's the story on that front?","David Farr","Based on history, Steve, there is definitely going to be two quarters that are going to be tough. Is our next quarter going to be one of them? It's hard for me to tell right now from the reaction around the world. But clearly, we're going to have a couple tough quarters here from an orders standpoint; second, third quarter or third and fourth quarter and I think leading into early next year.","So there is no doubt about it, there is going to be a transition here and the question is how fast we see that transition which markets hold up which industries hold up. But clearly you're exactly right, you're going to see a couple tough quarters and I don't know which ones they are. They're coming.","Steve Tusa","Will you guys be negative, do you think on your core? I would assume, if it's going to happen, it'll happen in the second half and into the first half of next year. Do you see a quarter where you're negative? I would think that if it is negative, it's not going to be more than a negative mid-single digit type of number. Is that the right way to think about it?","David Farr","You talking process or total, Steve?","Steve Tusa","Process.","David Farr","Yes. I think we do not see that yet, but you're exactly right. I would say you could have a negative 5%, 8%, 6%, 7% quarter, yes.","Steve Tusa","This year?","David Farr","Maybe not this year. My gut tells me if I was going to put a gut call right now, based on my knowledge of the industry, it's first quarter of FY \u201816 which is the fourth calendar quarter.","Steve Tusa","Okay. So we can kind of do the linearity on where the 6% you did this quarter and then kind of march it down from there and then maybe march it back up, depending on what our view is on what our call is on where it's going to be?","David Farr","I think yes. I wish I was that good. If I was, I would [inaudible] right now, as would you be, too. But you're exactly right, that's what's going to happen. It's going to march down and march back up. The question is how big does that hole get and right now I know it's coming.","Steve Tusa","The key is pretending to be that good, I think.","David Farr","You telling me I'm pretending to be good? Is that what you're saying?","Steve Tusa","I'm saying for the rest of us.","David Farr","Okay.","Steve Tusa","On the rest of the business, the orders for Climate, some parts of Industrial Automation, I mean, I can't imagine that over the next quarter those are going to look that great either because of the pre-buy impact and then obviously industrial automation you have some oil and gas exposure and then on Network Power you've got the comp to Facebook. Again, I think getting out in front of these orders numbers, I mean, am I missing anything on that front or is the next couple months kind of for the company in total going to be pretty tough too from orders perspective?","David Farr","I wouldn't be a shocked CEO if we don't have a negative second quarter order quarter. I wouldn't be shocked. These things happen. I have a little sign here, I can't swear but blank happens. That's why we're being pretty aggressive right now, looking at the restructuring because we know it's going to happen and the question if it's not the second quarter, it will be the third quarter. Clearly, you're going to have a downdraft here and we have a good backlog and we've had good order pace, but clearly, we're going to have a downdraft. I think the U.S. is going to have a downdraft.","Steve Tusa","One last question on -- you talked about the company in transition. It doesn't sound like there is any -- these divestitures are chunks of the business, not necessarily a big kind of strategic split or anything like that. And then you talked about doing acquisitions, but you said you're kind of holding your fire power for a bigger one. On either front, should we expect something major like a $5 billion-plus type of thing on either side, the divestiture or deal front?","David Farr","Right now, there is nothing of that substance, however clearly, I evaluate the businesses at all point in time. If I feel like a business cannot fundamentally get back to the performance that it needs to get to and we've talked about this, Network Power is one of them that would be a strategic repositioning. However, I also said that we were going to play this out over three years. We're 18 months into that, almost, not quite 18. But so right now, that clearly is a business if I'm not able to deliver value for my shareholders, I will figure out how to get out of that business and create value another way.","Steve Tusa","That's not something you're going to do at the Investor Day. That's not at the Investor Day.","David Farr","Yes, no. We're not talking about something big like that, no.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","So just staying on process for a second, Dave, I appreciate all the --","David Farr","Go figure, process.","Joe Ritchie","What's that?","David Farr","I said go figure, something on process.","Joe Ritchie","Exactly. But I do appreciate all the color you've given us. The question I have is really around the resiliency of your margins in Process. Last cycle, you saw your EBIT decline about close to 20% in the business and Process is a lot bigger today than it was back then and so just trying to get a sense for how you guys are thinking about your cost structure when this downturn actually happens?","David Farr","The big issue will be is we clearly are going to try to figure out how to get ahead of our cost structure, how we're going to cut back where we need to cut back, but we will not damage the business. So historically, if I have a couple quarters of down sales for Process, we will obviously take a cost action to minimize that down profit, but we will not -- this is a very strong value creator for the company.","So we could have a couple quarters like we've had in the past where the margins deteriorate, but I also put pressure on the organization to make sure that we maximize and not waste our investment. So if we do have a couple tough quarters, most likely late this year and going into early 2016, I would say you're going to see a margin deterioration and what we're trying do right now is get ahead of that to minimize that margin deterioration without damaging the core company.","Joe Ritchie","Is there an opportunity for your -- given you've got a larger installed base, is there an opportunity for MRO investment to help soften some of the blow?","David Farr","We'll talk about that. If you look at how many billions of dollars of equipment we shipped the last five or six years, our install base has grown dramatically. So the answer is yes. However, it's always about timing and what comes on and comes off, but you're exactly right, our installed base is much larger. As you well know, part of our investment the last three years has been building out stronger and stronger global service organization.","So we actually have the assets in place to take advantage of this, but the question will be is can you execute on that to offset the other areas? That's our game plan. I'm not going in and allowing my Process guys right now say they can drop their margins, that's not the game. We're figuring out how do you hold your margins, but I also will not damage that company if I see a sudden drop-off.","I will not do stupid things for that business because it is really a strong value creator for Emerson. We have the right position to protect profitability, it's just a matter of can we execute?","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on oil and gas exposure in Industrial Automation and specifically, beyond the breakout, how much of the cat exposure do you think is related to oil and gas?","David Farr","I don't want to give you a rough number off the top of my head, but it is a significant number and you've already seen the bookings get impacted by that the last couple months. If you looked at our alternator businesses, the orders have dropped off. I'll give you an exact number, Craig. If I had to take a wild guess, I wouldn't say a wild guess, but a guess, I would estimate, I would say it's around a quarter.","Andrew Obin","A quarter of the [inaudible]?","David Farr","Yes and we're starting to see it already and we'll talk about that, but they react pretty quickly because those are long lead time-type of products.","Andrew Obin","Just to clarify, it's the quarter of the cat exposure or the quarter of the industrial automation business? Sorry about that.","David Farr","I would say a quarter of the industrial automation. The business would be tied to oil and gas total.","Andrew Obin","Just a question on capital allocation, it seems that other companies that are active in capital allocation are bringing up the fact that private equity is capped in terms of the leverage they can take on for deals these days. How does it change your thinking on, A, sort of making acquisitions because it seems both [inaudible], I think, stated that there's just more opportunity now. But B, also given that private equity is capped, how does it change your view on divesting businesses, if you could talk about that?","David Farr","We got a very good price for our power transmission. I think it was a good deal for both of us [inaudible] and I think we got a good price. We laid out what we wanted to divest. Right now, we know what those do businesses are and I don't think it's changed from the standpoint of what we're looking at right now. We try to find strategic buyers and we'll continue to work that, but I don't think it's changing anything. It's just the amount of assets out there right now. There is not a lot of assets to buy and there's not a lot of assets being sold either. That's why we had a lot of interest in the power transmission business when we sold it.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeremie Capron with CLSA.","Jeremie Capron","David, it sounds like you have pretty high confidence in your ability to grow 3% to 5% ex-currency this year, despite this weaker outlook globally and I appreciate you've had a good start in Q1. We've got a solid backlog, but after all that's been said on the call today, particularly on the Process side of things, where do we get the growth from? Which segments of the company are you seeing are taking us to that 4% to 5% for the remainder of the year?","David Farr","Our largest market's still North America and we still have a very strong business in North America across a lot of Emerson. That business is right now is holding up. We have not seen any deterioration in North America. I still see very good growth for us in Mexico. I see very good growth for us in India. From perspective of China, we're expecting growth. I have markets around the world that are still growing.","There will be a lot less growth than originally thought, but I still believe that we can still have that underlying type of growth we're talking about with the mix of businesses that we have and the strong business presence we have in North America. So that's where I come from at this point in time. If I start seeing North America weakening from an economic standpoint, then obviously that will change because that will hurt us, given our strong presence we have here in North America.","Jeremie Capron","Okay. Maybe finally, going back to the balance sheet, in this environment of slow growth and cheap debt, what do you think is the optimal capital structure for Emerson? I understand the discussion around potentially going after bigger acquisitions etcetera, but outside of this, what do you think about capital structure?","David Farr","We have a very flexible capital structure. Right now, we're running around the mid-30% debt to capital right now. We've taken it down as low as the mid-20%s. I think right now the mid-30%s is an area a that gives us the flexibility we need to deal with and we can flex down quite easily. So I think from our capital structure right now, I think it's a decent capital structure and gives us the room we need.","At the same time, it's given us -- we're sending a lot of money back to our shareholders. In the last four years, we've almost sent back $10 billion to our shareholders. So we're very shareholder friendly and we'll continue to spend money back for our shareholders if necessary and use our capital structure appropriately. So we try to keep it flexible. I think at the same time, we're paying money back to our shareholders. This year, we'll give to our shareholders over $3 billion. I'll say that over $3 billion to our shareholders this year. Last year, we gave them over $2 billion. Year before that, we gave them over $2 billion. So we pay back to our shareholders.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Rich Kwas","Process, the 2% to 3% down for the industry, does that assume any offsets in other areas of process? Because if you talk to some of the industry consultants, they say oil and gas is 20% of the market and there is growth in other areas because of lower energy prices. Chemicals, obviously, is one. But does that assume just -- does that take into account you're overweight on oil and gas? Is that referencing that? Or are you just looking at how you define process and coming up with that?","David Farr","We define the process. We'll show you when Steve's talking about how we go at this. Clearly, it means a much stronger down oil and gas spend number and you're exactly right, there's offsets that minimize that. Overall we still believe, probably the next 12 months, the total process marketplace as we see it today will be negative driven primarily because the oil and gas clearly drop off, coming off very high levels.","Still a lot of money being spent and the key issue for us is how do we get more than our fair share of that money being spent? That's where my focus is for all my team. How do you get more of that spending dollars, even though it's shrinking out there how do you go get some more of it? That's the whole market and I think that is waiting it out. That's just today.","Rich Kwas","Right. On the downstream piece, do you think you'll see orders late in the calendar year early? Late in calendar year 2015, early 2016? How soon does that translate? It would seem like there is some lag there.","David Farr","I think there is a hole opening up. My gut tells me we will be late, late calendar year 2015, maybe the last quarter and more like the first half of 2016 calendar year.","Rich Kwas","Right, but it takes some time for that to turn into revenue right?","David Farr","Correct. The key thing for us right now, as someone mentioned earlier, is we have a very strong MRO business. How do we take advantage of our installed base that we've dramatically grown the last -- if you look at the last 10 years of our capital, our money we've sold in this industry, how do we take advantage of that? That's going to be the key focus point for us because you're going to have a window here where you lose -- the projects aren't going to happen for you, you're going to have to go out and get that business day in and day out.","David Farr","I want to thank everybody for the call. I appreciate it. I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple weeks in New York City. Hopefully, the snow, and we won't have snow again, whatever that thing was called. The mayor called it, was going to be the worst snowstorm ever in New York and I must have missed that one. But look forward to seeing everybody and hopefully everyone stays healthy. Take care now. Bye.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"7893":["Emerson Electric Co.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, February 6, 2018.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Tim Reeves, Director of Investor Relations of Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Denise. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2018 results. The accompanying slide presentation is available on our website.","So I'll start with the first quarter summary on slide 3. Sales in the quarter of $3.8 billion increased 19% with underlying sales up 7%, reflecting continued favorable trends in our end markets and a strengthening macroeconomic environment. We closed out the quarter with December trailing three-month underlying orders up 7% and we expect to stay in a 5% to 10% range as we go forward.","Profitability was strong. In the base business, excluding Valves & Controls, gross margin was up 170 basis points and EBIT margin was up 70 basis points. GAAP EPS increased 9% and was up 18% excluding current and prior-year tax items.","We accelerated share buybacks, as discussed on our November 28 conference call. And in total, we repurchased over 7.8 million shares in the quarter. And together with dividend payouts, we returned over $800 million to shareholders in Q1. Overall, the first quarter performance was stronger operationally than we had anticipated a few months ago.","Turning to slide 4, first quarter gross margin was up 170 basis points excluding Valves & Controls. Margin improvement was driven by operating leverage and the benefits from prior-year restructuring actions. Price\/cost in the quarter was approximately flat. Other deductions increased $55 million due to Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges, foreign exchange losses and higher amortization expense.","Turning to slide 5, from a geographic perspective, demand was broad-based with both mature and emerging markets accelerating in the quarter. Mature markets grew mid-single digits, led by the U.S. and robust growth in Canada. Europe was flat; however, orders are trending favorably and we expect positive results in Europe in the second quarter. Emerging markets were up high-single digits, led by China which was up 23%. Excluding China, the rest of Asia was up mid-single digits. Latin America was up 4%. Middle East and Africa was down 5%, but orders here are trending favorably and we expect growth in the second quarter.","Turning to slide 6, total segment margins, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 70 basis points to 18.6%, driven by leverage on higher volume and the benefits of prior-period restructuring actions. Corporate and other charges increased $50 million, including $25 million of Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges. Operating cash flow was $447 million, an increase of $37 million or 9% versus the prior year. Free cash flow of $351 million was up 13%. Trade working capital, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 20 basis points to 18.2%, driven by execution around accounts receivable collections and payables management.","Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions underlying sales grew 9% in the quarter and was led by North America and Asia. North America underlying sales were up 14%, reflecting continued investment by shale customers, midstream upgrades and high-teens growth in Canada. Asia underlying growth was up 13% with China up 22% and the rest of the region up mid-single digits. Growth was driven by MRO spend and increasing mix of small and mid-sized projects and continued favorable trends in key discrete and industrial markets. Margin, excluding Valves & Controls, improved 120 basis points to 17.8%, reflecting leverage on higher sales and the benefits from prior-period restructuring actions.","December three-month underlying orders were up 7%, reflecting strong global energy-related, life sciences and chemicals markets. We are raising our full-year sales guidance for Automation Solutions. The first quarter results and orders trends support full-year 2018 underlying sales growth of 6% to 8%, up from prior guidance of 5% to 7%.","Turning now to slide 8, Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales increased 5% with reported sales flat, reflecting the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business on the first day of the quarter. Demand was led by Asia with China up 24% and the rest of Asia up high-single digits. North America underlying sales were up 1%, as steady demand for professional tools was offset by difficult prior-year comparisons in residential air conditioning markets, as a period of late-season hot weather led to strong channel replenishment orders in the prior year. Margin increased 20 basis points to 20.1%, reflecting leverage on higher sales and the ClosetMaid divestiture, partially offset by warranty costs. Overall, growth and profitability of the segment reflects a continuation of the cycle that started in the second half of 2016.","December three-month underlying orders were up 5%, reflecting strong global demand in air conditioning, refrigeration and construction-related markets. We are raising our full-year sales guidance for Commercial & Residential Solutions. The first quarter results and orders trends support full-year 2018 underlying sales of 4% to 6%, up from prior guidance of 3% to 5%.","Let's turn to slide 9, which summarizes the impact of U.S. tax reform. On an ongoing basis, Emerson will benefit from a lower tax rate. For the full-year 2018, we expect a consolidated tax rate of 25% to 27% and, in 2019 and thereafter, approximately 25%, which reflects a full 5 to 6 points' improvement from historical levels.","The table on the right steps through the impact of adoption-related items on our first quarter results. A repatriation tax on foreign earnings of $185 million was offset by a $98 million reduction of our net U.S. deferred tax liability and a $130 million repatriation reserve accrued in prior periods. The net impact of these items in the first quarter was an income tax benefit of $43 million or $0.07 of EPS.","Turning to slide 10, which steps through changes to our EPS guidance, the table starts with our November 7 adjusted EPS guidance, which excluded two items \u2013 Valves & Controls' first year acquisition accounting charges and a tax-related loss on the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business. These items totaled $0.07 in the first quarter results and were offset by the $0.07 benefit of tax reform items discussed on the prior slide. As these adjustment items are offsetting, we will guide only on a GAAP basis going forward. As shown here, we are raising the low end of our guidance $0.30 and the high end $0.20 based on stronger operational performance, higher share repurchases and the benefit of a lower tax rate.","Finally, let's turn to slide 11, which outlines our updated guidance. We expect underlying sales growth of 5% to 7% with Automation Solutions up 6% to 8% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 4% to 6%. GAAP EPS of $3.05 to $3.15 is up 20% to 24% versus the prior year or up 11% to 15% excluding the impact of tax reform. We expect operating cash flow of $2.9 billion and we expect to convert free cash flow at 120% of net income.","We are increasing our capital spending outlook to $575 million or approximately 3.4% of sales, reflecting our more positive outlook on the global business environment. In addition, we've provided second quarter guidance of underlying sales up 7% and GAAP EPS up 21% to $0.70.","And now, I will turn the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Tim. I want to welcome everybody, and I truly appreciate you joining us for this conference call. I also want to thank the global Emerson organization for their tremendous performance and a very strong start to the new fiscal year of 2018, with sales, underlying sales up 7%; the margins improving, underlying margins improving; EPS up 9% of GAAP at $0.61, truly having a very strong start to the first quarter of our new fiscal year; and cash flow up 9% at approximately $450 million. So a very strong start.","And as Tim just explained, we're raising the total guidance for the year and we will be going back to the measure that I believe in quite strongly and it's called GAAP. And with the tax reform activity and our performance now and the repositioning running through the company, we now can return back to reporting and discussing GAAP earnings, which I think is a relevant measure for our corporation.","Again, I want to thank the global team for tremendous execution in particular around the final control team under Mike Train and Ram and with support of that, which we'll update you a little bit about at the conference next week, but clearly doing a great job of integrating and getting some great momentum around the orders, the sales and profitability. So a really good job, well done.","As we look at the world today, I feel very good about the trends we're seeing. We always knew our order pattern would have to slow down from the very fast pace coming out of big hole, in particular around the automation business, but the pace of dollars of automation orders are maintaining a very high level of actual dollars, well over $2.35 billion per month on a roll basis. And so it's a good number on a three-month roll basis, is how we look at it and we knew this would happen.","The underlying orders are actually very good around the world, and it's why we've always felt that it would slow down into this band we see right now and will generate, as we look at it, 6% to 8% underlying sales growth for Automation Solutions business. And that is a very good number. I've never felt \u2013 as we've talked about it numerous times now, I've never felt the first year out of the box would be a double-digit year. We did not see that, and we'll continue to not see that; however, we see a very strong two-year recovery here a little bit differently than we've seen in the past. And I've been through several recoveries, as you all know, on Automation Solutions business.","But overall, the trend line is very good. We're seeing very good orders again in Commercial & Residential, maintaining this 5%, 6%, maybe 7% underlying orders and really seeing some pretty good pattern and support. And they're well into their second year now of the recovery and on very good momentum both in the underlying business and also new technologies. As you look at the world of Emerson, Automation and Commercial & Residential in North America continues to be pretty good. We have a very good start. I don't see that changing. I see our U.S. business being strong for the year and I feel good about that and I see continued investments. In fact, as I look at the underlying gross fixed investment trend lines, which have bumped up since tax reform was passed, it does look at a very good pace of business for the next two years in the U.S. and North America around fixed investment, which is very good.","Second, if you look at what we're seeing going on in Asia, China had another very good quarter both in orders and sales. And I see no indication that we will actually slow down. We'll have a very good year in Asia and China. And I expect \u2013 in particular, China, I expect a solid double-digit growth in orders and sales, which at first I didn't think was going to happen, but now as I see the pace of business and investments, I feel better that we should see 10-plus percent sales growth in China, which is an improvement. Relative to the rest of Asia, the order pattern continues to improve. We're seeing the good cycle of businesses and I feel very good about where we sit at this point in time across Asia Pacific, even outside of China.","Just coming back to the Middle East and Africa, yes, we had \u2013 sales were still slightly negative, but we've now seen three or four or five months of orders pattern improving, going positive. And as this expects, we had to fill the hole. We filled the hole and now \u2013 from the backlog standpoint, and now we'll start seeing, I would expect, positive sales as we go into the second quarter. And I think we're on a start of a good run of investments in that region, which we haven't seen for the last couple of years, but I feel good about where we sit at this point in time.","The last key market's Latin America. We've been waiting for the turn and we've got it. We had a positive sales quarter after basically 12 negative quarters out of Latin America, and order pattern looks pretty good. Sales pattern looked pretty good. So it looks like Latin America has turned for us and that's on a positive surprise is a positive for me, as was China. And as I look at Canada, I see that investment continuing to going up there. So there's some things that are positive for us at this point in time.","Out of Europe, our order pattern continues to be positive; and not unusual year for us. We have some quarters that are positive, some flat, some slightly negative. Overall, we expect Europe to be a very solid 5% type of growth marketplace for us this year and we see the pace of business activity going on around that. But clearly, as we go into the second quarter, we, at this point in time, see another good solid 7% underlying sales growth, which will generate good, obviously, double-digit consolidated sales with the addition of our acquisitions and no real divestiture impact of mix magnitude in there. So we see a very strong double-digit top line sales growth with over 7% underlying growth and we're expecting a very solid $0.70 GAAP EPS for that second quarter around 21%.","We're getting ready for our visit to New York and our annual investor conference, which will be held at the New York Stock Exchange this year. Fundamental focus is going to be on reviewing where we see the trend lines heading, which have turned more positive from our review last year. We had a stronger 2017, looks like we'll have a little stronger 2018. So, we're going to give you what we see as the trend line from the 2016 to 2021. Keeping those same measures in place, you can see where we see the pluses and minus takeaways, see the profitability that we see unfolding in the business. And then, most importantly, at the end, looking at the tax impact, the overall impact relative to our cash flow and also impact to our earnings, which both will be positive from the perspective.","We want to show the core businesses, what's going on, the impact of this faster growth, stronger marketplaces, and then the impact of the tax reform on overall positive impact to the numbers that you'll see coming out of Emerson over the next couple of years.","So, as I look at it and wrap it up and go into Q&A, very strong first quarter. Rate the year, we have momentum, we have good order patterns around the world. Everything is slightly better than I thought. I am okay with the order pattern. I know people might be panicked because things roll, but we fully expected this and we expect this thing to trend into this line and we'll talk further about that next week, but, overall, we like where we sit today.","I am not going to talk about the long-term numbers here today because that's all about what we're going to be talking about next week, but I'm here to talk about what we see in the quarter. But needless to say, the OCE, we're very pleased with the operations and the performance in the two platforms in this first quarter, and we look forward to continue to have a very strong total fiscal 2018 based on a very good start to our first quarter.","So with that, I'll open the floor up for the first question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Farr. We will now begin the question-and answer-session. Your first question will come from Robert McCarthy of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, Dave. Hey, everybody. Congrats on the strong quarter.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey, Rob. Thanks.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Looks like decent momentum across the board and you called some turns in some areas. So I guess the first question I would have is, with respect to China, you've put up some great growth recently and after there's been very volatile data set probably in the last 18 to 24 months. But given what we've seen with the market pullback here, I mean obviously, there's some concerns about rates, but there's also concerns about overheating in China. And could you talk about maybe the risks you see in China throughout the course of the year? How you feel about the pace and momentum of the business there? Just give us some comfort and color around any kind of China risk.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. Given I'm an expert in what's happened in the marketplace in the last three days, I'm sure I can help you here. But from my perspective, clearly, we've seen a very good investment in the two businesses. On the Commercial & Residential, it's been tight around refrigeration, it's been tight around the environment, and the issue around trying to improve the quality of air.","And from the perspective \u2013 can it get overheated because of the government trying to push an issue too hard? The answer is yes. As we see it right now, we do not sense that. I'll be back over there in another month. I feel good about it right now, but there is a concern from the standpoint of the investment period that maybe is a little too aggressive. And historically, what's happened is that they would dial it back, but we don't sense that at this point in time. But that will be a concern for us as we look at this.","On the Automation Solutions side, it's very broad-based, so it's not just one type of technology. It's not just one type of industry. It's a very slow, steady type of investment that they're making both for improved quality of their products and quality of their facility inside their country; not only for their own country but also for some of the exports around the world. So I don't sense any overheating there at this point in time, but the one area I do concern about is the government trying to \u2013 on the Commercial & Residential side, trying to drive the environmental issues. And at some point in time, they'd say, hey, we drove it too hard. Let's back that off. And that could create that downturn.","But right now, based on what I see in the order pattern, based on the customer pattern, I would say we're going to probably do 8% to 10%. And now, we're talking most likely we're going to be doing \u2013 I think we're going to do double-digits coming out of China. And clearly, with the Commercial & Residential business this quarter, they did a 20-plus percent in this quarter on top of last year's 40% quarter. The odds are extremely high that that's going to get tougher and tougher as we go forward here in the second half of this year and early next year, but they're still going to have growth opportunities throughout Asia, as I look at Commercial & Residential. So they're growing across the whole region. So obviously, a concern, but I feel decent about it right now.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","As a follow-up, obviously, I think you talked pretty definitively about the positive impact of tax reform here and what it could mean. And I think there was an uptick in your own CapEx and the level of business and fixed investment spending across the board. But maybe you could just talk about what are you expecting to see, qualitatively, across certain end markets or geographies, driven by tax reform here that would drive the underlying macro numbers higher, specifically? And why it gives you confidence that perhaps growth can accelerate and extend here.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From the U.S. manufacturing base, we were given a very, very generous tax reform package. It's very much focused on investments in this country from a technology standpoint, capacity standpoint, something that we have not seen in this country for over 30-some-odd years since the mid-1980s. From the perspective of the companies that we communicate with and we obviously serve, they see this as an opportunity to be encouraged to make those investments and they're going to make those investments. The underlying demand in the U.S. right now is good, so from a demand standpoint, for the first time, we see both the demand and then we're also seeing incentives to make investments. So, what we're hearing and seeing is the upward pace of investment will continue to go in a positive way, and that will \u2013 as long as the demand stays here, both here and internationally, you're going to see these investments continue across our customer base.","Now you're going to see in different industries that investments will be stronger than others. Seems like the oil and gas industry and some of the pipeline industries you see in the United States. That's a good thing. You're seeing some downstream. We're seeing a lot of good projects down in the gas, in the downstream marketplace right now in the Gulf region. So in general, we're seeing a lot of our customers are talking about increased investments. We're still seeing a strong focus right now in the short term, what I call quick payback-type investments, especially since you get fast depreciation in the United States.","We're starting to see some of the small or medium-sized projects start getting on the books, which will be more for the second half and later part of this year and early next year. And we're seeing the discussion of the longer term projects, but they all see the benefit from a balance sheet standpoint, lower taxes, faster depreciation. And I firmly believe U.S. industry is not going to miss this opportunity. We are not going to miss this opportunity to invest in the infrastructure in this country to drive faster growth, to drive the productivity, and to drive our competitiveness.","We were given an opportunity to demonstrate that we were not competitive, and we were given the opportunity to demonstrate that, okay, now do something with it. And I firmly believe that business leaders in this country are going to do something with it. And if not, then shame on us because then we deserve every hit we get coming out of Washington. From my perspective as a CEO and as a leader of the National Association of Manufacturers, we are increasing our investments. We are focusing on the next several years where we're going to take advantage of this. And I think our customer base will begin the same thing, Rob. And we're going to try to continue to get this information out when it becomes more and more knowledgeable. But if you look at the gross fixed investment numbers, they're trending up and I expect that that will continue here throughout 2018 and early 2019.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks very much. See you next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you next week, Rob.","Operator","The next question will come from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on Automation Solutions. You highlighted MRO and small and medium-sized projects. I would imagine these are very good for margin. What kind of visibility \u2013 you've sort of highlighted you're starting to see big investments coming up in the U.S.? What kind of impact will these projects have on your margin?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The normal cycle \u2013 our margin \u2013 when we have funds (25:40) scheduled out for the 35%, we're looking at the 35% flow-through profitability on the Automation Solutions. It takes into consideration that balance between as we go into those projects, into the larger projects. So we're well into tune that they're very large projects, which won't really start hitting until late 2019, 2020. They will obviously put more pressure on margin. But by that point in time, our facilities are running a little tighter, a little more productive. And so typically we can absorb that. There's nothing unusual in the cycle right now, Andrew, other than, I would say, the sustained period here we're going to have because of the tax law relative to small or medium-sized projects. So I don't worry about the margin and the business. Especially if we see strong investment in North America, which is our core market, the actual \u2013 the pressure will be in the positive side of the margin, not in the negative side of the margin.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you. And just a follow-up question. I think in your press release, you sort of highlighted that you would consider looking at, I guess, wages in North America. But how should we think about inflationary pressures in 2018, given that a lot of other companies actually are also announcing wage hikes and you have raw materials going up? How should we think about inflation and price\/cost? Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. We've been \u2013 and I think you guys heard me. We've been seeing underlying salary and wage increases going up now for the last nine months. At a trend line, we're above 3%. We are not a minimum wage company. We are a company that pays for high skills. And so we have to make sure that our compensation structure, from a wage and salary standpoint and benefits standpoint, we stay competitive and we will have to adjust. We are in a period here that clearly it's very important for us to keep our price\/cost in line and make sure we keep ahead and we start having to tweak our prices on upward basis.","As we see the commodity pressures building up, we see the wage and salary pressures building up, which are all good things from a mild form of inflation. But clearly, what we have to do is stay ahead of this. And the sections that Frank and Steve will be having with the two platform leaders is we're going to have to be talking, okay guys, you've got to keep putting the pressure on the price increases because we will see the upward pressure on the commodities, the upward pressure on salary and wages. And we must make sure we keep our pricing in line as we go through this time period. We've gone through a period where we were behind the eighth ball. And right now we are in sync. And it's very, very important now as we stay, and we stay in sync here over the next couple of quarters.","And I think, Andrew, this is an issue that I ultimately talk about it. And at this point in time, we are ultimately talking internally because we see the pressure is increased material, increased salary and wages. And therefore, we're going to have to slightly bump up our prices. Now that will create, obviously, a higher growth rate at the top, but also we have to make sure we have the resulting cost reductions and price actions around these. So this is an interesting time period, which we have not seen for a while. But we do know how to operate in this time period, and I feel good that we are well inside the scope of where we need to be right now.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you. Very good. Good questions.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Hey, guys. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","So just on kind of the cash flow and the dynamics around CapEx, when do you expect to kind of hit this run rate? And you look like you'll a little be under the kind of 3.5% this year. Will you be above it for any of these years over the next couple of years as a percent of the sales?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I think that if you look at \u2013 okay, if you look at our capital spending, if you go by quarter, we typically start slower and we build up in the year-end. It's how we decide. It's the way the company is set up and what goes on inside the company. If you look at the overall, I would say that our capital will be \u2013 is lumpy. We could \u2013 this year, we could be a tad under 3.5%. Next year, we could be a tad over 3.5%. We have similar projects that we might be looking at new capacity, a new facility somewhere, that we'll start working on late this year and make your capital occur in 2019. So I think on average we'll probably be somewhere in the 3.3%, 3.4% range over the five-year time period.","But the key issue for me is, as I told my board, unlike the government which clearly had shovel-ready projects all over the place, we don't have shovel-ready projects inside Emerson. If we have a project that we need to do, we do it. But what I'm looking at right now with the stronger demand in our key couple businesses and a shifting where that demand is coming around the world, we're going to need to make some different type of investments here in North America, in particular the United States, to be more productive and have a lot more flexibility around our facilities which we haven't built into them in the past. So I think this is going to build and I would expect 2019 and 2020 will be bigger capital than this year as I look at it based on what I see and feel right now, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","As a percentage of sales, right, you meant?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","As a percentage of sales, correct. And the dollars are still going to go up, yeah.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","And so \u2013 and when you look at your cash flow statement, there is this kind of other account. I think there might be some \u2013 that's where you kind of adjust for perhaps your cash taxes versus your book taxes. I don't want to be knit picky, but is there anything now with the lower book tax rate? Anything in that kind of other account that's been a couple hundred million bucks in the last few years and would the new portfolio have \u2013 does that shrink in size or does that go closer to zero, is it less of a factor? I am just trying to kind of get to what the run rate conversion is here going forward.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 I'm going to try to grab the chart, Steve, that you're talking about, okay? So I know what I'm talking. Is that in the press release or is it in the slides?","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","No, just from your 10-K. It's 2015, 2016, and 2017 from the 10-K.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh, from the 10-K. I'll look at it.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","I'm just trying to get at what the sustainable conversion is here because you guys \u2013 you've talked in 2021 as it being like 105% to 110% or something around that. Now CapEx is bumping up a little bit. You've got some of this tax coming through, so maybe just a little bit of clarity on that.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve, I think what you're talking about in that add back is mainly the GAAP pension expense gets added back and then we have the cash contributions that come out of the cash flow and then it's equity comp that gets added back as well. So, no, I don't expect...","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't expect there's going to be...","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","So, that's sustainable?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","...a change in that as a function of tax reform or the different configuration of the portfolio.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Great.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So let me \u2013 Steve, it's a good question, given all the challenges around this world today about quality of cash and earnings, so let me \u2013 as we get ready for next week...","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","I don't know what you're talking about.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Me either. I just made a statement. You know me. I just made a statement. I got my rally monkey. I've got my bull here. I got a baseball bat and these guys \u2013 it's amazing what they say when they're thinking. But let me \u2013 let's take a look at what we're going to \u2013 because we're going to give you a cash forecast and we're going to give you obviously P&L forecast next week, and let me take a look at what we think the sustainable rate is going to be. As you point out, and you've pointed out to me numerous times, I have a unique window here right now because I have the final control cash opportunities, which we are obviously starting to execute on, which is going to run now for three or four years. I have some increased amortization because of software companies coming on board from that perspective. So, that helps us from a cash flow standpoint.","So the question is, as we go through this cycle, we're going to be able to run at a little bit higher rate on a conversion basis than I have historically, and I think that's a very fair question. It's also a very challenging question for me to answer, but I think that I owe you that and the shareholders can we run 110%, 115% conversion? This year, we're talking about running around 120% again, which is a good number. And I do have some things helping me right now, but the question, as we go out of this cycle, is the number going to be 105%, 110%, or 112%? And I think that's a very fair question to ask.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","And then one last quick one just on R&D. Are you kind of full up there on R&D investments, or RD&E? Or is that going to tick up and trend up as well?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think the key issue for me, as I've talked about the trend line of our orders, our trend line of the sales, is in the two key areas. If I see Automation Solutions really starting to take on some bigger projects, they want to bring in some new technologies, then we're going to have to ramp up some R&D. But that will be commonplace if I start seeing our \u2013 our sales order would mean this year, we're going to be more in the 8% range, and I see a pretty good filler relative to projects coming at me. Then we might start ramping up at a couple of new technologies to make sure that we can satisfy that demand that we see coming from our customer base for 2019 and 2020, in particular around our Plantweb Internet of Things.","So I think that right now, we're good. But if I start seeing this growth rate pick up a little bit, which could possibly happen, then you're going to see me tweaking a little bit more engineering moneys into here because I want to get ready for the next-generation technologies that our customer base will be going towards as they go into 2020 and 2021. That's what we're going to be watching now. That's the next pivot point that we should be at, and that's the place you should be pushing me.","Relative to Bob Sharp's business, I think at this point in time we've continued to give Bob the moneys he needs as he is running at very high levels of profitability. He had an unfortunate situation of a quality issue in the first quarter that we had to deal with and we dealt with it and one of his products, I think, in the thermostat area, and we've dealt with that. But we're giving him the money he needs relative to that next-generation investments to really \u2013 to pull through his digitization in the cold change stuff which you'll hear him talking about and \u2013 so I'm making sure he's got the money he needs right now because there's some good growth opportunities there for that business. So, that's what I see.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Makes complete sense. Thanks, as always, for the comments.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","The next question will come from Steven Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks and good afternoon, all.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve. Are you legitimate; we can talk to you? Or what \u2013 are you back in the game here or are you still on vacation?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Come on, Dave. I assumed you'd read every single page of that report.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh, oh, that one. That \u2013 oh, I used that one to put myself to sleep with over the weekend, I'm sorry, I did read that.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Oh, thanks for that big eye. I've got to consider that next time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh, gosh, Steve, I look forward to seeing you next week. Come on up and say hi to me for a change. You've been a stranger for a couple of months.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just following compliance. Anyway, out and good and all that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I am full compliance. I mean that's why I got my rally monkey. I got my dog here. I've got a bull looking at me right now. I'm full of compliance.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm straight and up, straight up in the air. So listen, I just wanted to chase up the cash flow discussion a little more with regard to 2018, not the longer term. On page 16 on the presentation, you just give the 150% operating cash flow conversion on GAAP, right, step-up from 130%. So I just want to make sure that...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Operating cash flow.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, so I just want to make sure that that \u2013 the key drivers are there in terms of the change or to what extent \u2013 what are the biggest components of that step-up?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's \u2013 you're going to have taxes there.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, you've got taxes there.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","For our guidance.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So the \u2013 yeah, that's the differences primarily. There's two things going on with the taxes and a little bit improved profitability overall. Those are the two numbers right there. As you know, given our level of profitability, if we grow a little faster and our margins are \u2013 obviously we're saying we're going to have a better earnings, that helps us. But the big chunk there is the taxes.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then as you said, you'll give us some more color around that hopefully in terms of longer term. Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're going to try to make sure, Steve, because there's two big moving parts in what's happening to Emerson versus last year at this time is we have stronger underlying performance from a sales standpoint, economic standpoint, and then we have a tax reform. So I'm going to try to be as I thought, Tim worked very, very hard to be transparent with you guys on it. You guys may not think that was transparent in all his charts he gave you, but we're trying to be transparent relative to how these numbers are impacting. We'll try to do that again next week for you, so you can get your models set up because there's a rebasing going on right now you're going to need.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then secondly, maybe diving in a little bit to the Commercial & Residential side of things, on compressors, you're talking about pricing and the need to keep pace on pricing versus cost and how hard that is. And you've been through this multiple times before. Some of the folks in that area are certainly saying that they believe they have a little more, I think a little more pricing power themselves and comfort level with their supply base in terms of their ability to kind of hold costs as well. What are you seeing in that part of the area relative to competition and your ability to get price in that area?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're in it for the long-term and our customer base know that. And so we work very closely with them. We do get the pricing and we clearly have to make push shoves back and forth, sometimes in and out of sync, sometimes in sync. I think, overall, this will be \u2013 with the \u2013 when you look at copper, you look at steel, you look at the continued commodity increases going on, on the Commercial & Residential side, there's going to have to be a trend line upward across the whole industry. And they have to be very careful from the standpoint \u2013 and we understand that. And that's why we work closely with them. We don't want them priced out of the marketplace either in the end market. So I think that there's some pushbacks always, but I think, over time, we figure out how to make those tradeoffs with changing our products to get them the price point they need and then we can change our products to make sure that we get the cost price points that we need.","And as you know, there's not one \u2013 just talk of compressors, there's not just one compressor. We can make changes within a compressor to get what they need and to change that price\/cost structure. So there's a lot \u2013 there's going to be a lot of give and take. I think the industry knows right now we're looking in the period, as someone pointed out earlier, potentially we could have higher inflation here. And so we're going to have to start making tradeoffs for both of us to make sure that we both don't get eaten alive in this whole price\/cost situation. I think that being a major supplier in this industry, we have that ability to do that with our customer base, and we'll continue to work that.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","And you forced mixed up in the past as well, which has helped. So I'm not sure if you see opportunity there too, mixing up the...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We have a window here again with \u2013 in the commercial standpoint in refrigerant that we will mix up in that space as the transition happens. And the residential side, it's a little bit different this time. I think we're going to see more of a mix up on the commercial in the channel in the next 12 to 18 months in North America. So it's going to be a hybrid approach here. We're going to be making some pushes and shoves. And in the end, we want to come out this ahead, just like they want to come out ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Dave. I'll see you next week, and I want to hear the critiques on that report.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Definitely. I will dust it off. It must be underneath my pillow right now.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Good. As long as you have it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hopefully, I didn't get too much drool on it.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","That's all right. Better than most.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. See you later, my friend.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So on Automation, with regards to investments, with oil where it is, it's up much higher than a year ago and investments have picked up, but you talked about being able to maintain the incrementals at a pretty healthy level without having to make significant investments. When do you see that starting to play out? And I guess that gets into some of the KOB1 projects starting to get booked. And so any color around KOB1? What mix of the orders it is right now? And then, how you see these investments getting layered in over the next year or so?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think what we're seeing right now \u2013 and we're going to share with you basically our project business and what that funnel looks like. We're going to give you the snapshot, which clearly is going to be bigger than the last time we shared with you, which I think \u2013 Tim, when was that? The last conference call, wasn't it?","Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, it was in November, I think we did.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","End of November. So we're going to give you the snapshot and basically, it's consistent measurement across the board. What we're seeing right now are the initial phases around the world of larger KOB2 type of projects where people have done initial expansions or part and now they're going back and they're dusting that off. And that's coming back in the funnel on a rebid or just moving forward depending on where they feel comfortable relative to the cost of the project and the timing of the project. That is already starting to flow. We're starting to see that. And I would expect to see more and more of those bookings as you go forward here this year.","On the larger KOB1 projects, which we're starting to bid and talk about, and I know Ed Monser is going to try and talk about one project that he sees going on right now across the final control in particular, we're going to start seeing more and more of that come late in 2018, early 2019. Yes, there's going to be one or two projects out there, but I think that those projects really won't \u2013 starting to play into 2019. So when I'm talking about higher incremental investments is if I start seeing our growth rate sales \u2013 and I see sales, and obviously, orders before the sales, if I start seeing that number clearly looking like it's going to be at the high end of the 6% to 8% and potentially have a chance to cut across that, then we're going to have to start this year.","Now, the question will be is, if we're growing faster, we're going to obviously leverage. And obviously, the numbers will look okay in the short-term and when it will come back to haunt us will be in 2019. But if we're starting to see this happen and we're starting to see the larger KOB2, that's what I'm going to trigger off, not the KOB1, because if I start seeing the larger KOB2, which we're going to talk a little bit about next week, that's where we're going to have to start putting some money into play to make sure we protect ourselves from a customer perspective, both from a manufacturing, sales and service organization, because this business, as you know, comes up. And these aren't small products or projects. And so we've got to make sure we can produce them and then deliver them.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So the earliest is really next year is when you would start to see the impact?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. I mean you're going to see \u2013 you'll hear us talking about it, but the dollar, that will be next year.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then on V&C, outside the amortization, you're still tracking to exit the year in the near double-digits on an EBIT margin basis or is that coming in better?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I think we'll be there. I have no reason to say we won't be double-digit as we -- this year. And I want Ed to talk a little bit about that. Ed Monser is going to give a presentation on what he sees. The team's doing a great job. We are this month starting \u2013 in January and February, we're moving off of the Pentair OMT system, which is \u2013 that's sort of like jumping off the top of this building in a corporate here without a parachute and hoping you can land without breaking a leg. And that's going on right now. So, that's my concern this quarter is to make sure that these guys can get off that into a normal operating system and get away from that Swiss model. But overall, I like where they are from a margin standpoint, sales and order standpoint. And they're starting to talk, which I'm really excited about, technology and where they can bring some new technologies and make some investments in technology, which that business hasn't made in a long, long time.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, how about working cap, real quick on that piece? Anything...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They're slightly ahead of schedule. I would say that \u2013 I would say for the year, they're going to deliver \u2013 my gut tells me that final control will deliver very good cash flow number for us this year. I fundamentally believe that we will have a $2.9 billion. It could be a $2.92 billion. I think we're going to have a good operating cash flow this year. And it's going to be driven off of the work final control does. I mean everyone else is important in the company, but the real delta is there. And I think that Mike Train and his team and Ram Krishnan and his team have a focus on that. They know they have a chance to deliver cash flow to us and we'd really like to see that happen because that makes a big difference in the returns. It also gives us the flexibility that we need from a standpoint of dividends and then share repurchase.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Right. Great. All right. Thank you. See you next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you next week, Rich.","Operator","The next question will be from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Jeff. How are you?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Doing well. Hey, just a couple more things on V&C, Dave, if I could.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Could you just give us a sense of what's going on with their orders? Are they primed and ready to take orders, so to speak? Or you're more focused on integration here in the near term?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're focused on orders. Clearly, there's things we want to get done from an operational standpoint. But we \u2013 if you look at our V&C business right now, we're growing. It's the combination of final control and V&C. It's around 10%. And what's very important to us right now is getting them into the site, which goes back \u2013 I think it was Rich asked me the question. On the projects, so what I'm trying \u2013 we're trying to get them engaged on the KOB2 projects on a full capability. And that's what we're trying to do at this point in time because the early stages of projects are starting to happen. We are building out, as we've talked about, a final control solutions package. And now for the first time, we are going out to the global customer base and saying we have, here it is.","And if you look at the projects, some of the biggest componentry is typically around the final control package. So, that's pretty important to us. We don't want to miss the initial phases, those upticks. So, yeah, we're focusing on restructuring, repositioning and making sure we're delivering the profitability and the trade working capital. But in reality right now, what we're also out there working really hard and why Mike Train and Ed Monser and Ram Krishnan \u2013 Ram works so hard on trying to make sure that we got the global sales organization in place. This is so important to us right now, Jeff, because this cycle is happening and we want to get back on track and it'll make a big difference for us relative to recapturing market share that, unfortunately, was lost in the last downturn when the lack of attention in this business. So I like what we see right now and if we can maintain this level of growth in underlying orders, the projects are coming and this will really set us up for a very strong 2019.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just on the V&C financials, Dave, the $25 million of acquisition charges, is that inclusive of the run rate amortization or is that more like step-up in other type of...?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The last piece of the step-up of the word counting rule I've ever seen in my life, as Frank knows, where you have to re-mark or write-off the profit and inventory and the backlog. And so they had a lot of backlog and they clearly had a lot of inventory. And this is the last phase, the last piece \u2013 Frank said I maybe have a couple of more million left next quarter, but I'm not talking about it. This is the last piece of that. That's what that is right there. That's the last piece of that accounting revaluation of backlog and profit and inventory.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one more for me. I think some folks are viewing the strength as almost a glass half empty. Demand is good, therefore you need to spend capital, therefore that's a negative. I think I heard you say at the beginning of this call that even with higher spending you're quite comfortable that your incremental margins can traffic in the mid-30s. Does that hold looking out into 2019 and 2020 when you're looking at these higher levels of CapEx?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we're going to \u2013 we're on track to get back to the levels of profitability, the 19% EBIT margin that we talked about last year with the V&C. We are on track to get that in the same cycle, so even with a higher growth rate, I still feel very good at the stronger growth rate, we're on track to get the mid-35s, the mid-30s on the incremental margins. We feel good about that at this point in time. The only place I see that we'll have to start spending money is that growth rate goes up, but given the fact that what's going to happen is if growth rate goes up, our spending will always be behind the growth, so we're going to probably have pretty good leverage. It's when those rates start coming in sync.","So I feel very good about the margins, incremental margins out of the Automation business for the next couple of years. The cycle started, and we have bumps and things in a quarter or two, yes, but overall I see no reason right now that we're slightly ahead of last year for margin, we're slightly ahead this year and I think we'll get to that 19% that we talked about in the Automation Solutions with V&C by the 2021.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great.

Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, the reason we called out the hybrid is because if I look at the underlying industries that use a lot of the hybrid technology, those industries have been the strongest places for investments, say for a classic example would be a pharmaceutical. Now from my perspective, I think that you have a clear group of leaders in the hybrid space today. There's three or four of us that are pretty strong. I think there's \u2013 if you look at the \u2013 and we'll talk a little bit about, as you look at the breakdown of others in this industry, I think there's some consolidation efforts and some squeezing that could happen here. There's room to grow for the four major players and to take out more share within that space, and I think that you're hearing a lot of the key guys in this space talk about it and I think there is plenty of room here for the next three, four, five years for us to gain into that space.","But from my perspective, I think the initial phase is some of the hybrid investments underway are good and you're going to start seeing some of the old line process automation areas of investments happening later this year or going into next year, but right now the hybrid space is what took off earliest and I think that's good and there's room for it to run.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great. And then a bookkeeping question. On the walk from the prior adjusted EPS, you have the $0.05 to $0.15 adjustment for operations and repurchase, but you add the low end of that $0.05 to $0.15 to the high end of the prior range. Is that just conservative or if you're seeing the stronger markets will you fund more restructuring or something?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. We'll pay for (54:12). We just had a good first quarter. We beat and we raised more than we beat the first quarter. I want to make sure that we're not setting ourselves up to some number we can't make happen. So that's what's going on here, Chris. I think that there's no additional restructuring underway. If we have \u2013 there's nothing hidden in here from the P&L. If we can get a little faster growth and margin conversion, you're clearly going to get the earnings. There's no hidden. There's no incremental investments I'm trying to hide here. I'm trying to make sure that we put a forecast out for you that we can deliver, plus or minus the pennies that we talk about every quarter, and that's all it is. And it was a good beat and we raised. And I didn't feel like I have to go crazy on a raise.","Tim Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","And mechanically, we're bringing the bottom end up, so that's a bigger number.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Right. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No good deed goes unturned. Okay. What was that? Sorry. Go ahead.","Operator","I'm sorry. The next question will be from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hi, it sounded, no good deed goes unpunished on Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that is true.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I guess if I don't want to be the heat, I should quit being CEO, but I sort of enjoy being CEO. It's a lot fun.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, you must enjoy it. It's been some time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Almost it's 17 1\/2 years.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So maybe my starting question here is on just this incremental margin discussion specifically around Automation Solutions. If I pull out the V&C impact this quarter, I get to like a high 20s-type incremental margin, which is a little bit lower than I would have guessed just given you've got sort of...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I think it's more like 40% \u2013 35%, 40%.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","More like 40%?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I mean we could take you through that. Frank, you've got the numbers there. We've seen it. I saw people talk about that.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Yes.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","If you take out the acquisition impact and some currency headwind that we have in there that's not obvious, it's mid-30s \u2013 mid to high-30s.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. All right. Okay. Got it. So, that ticks that box. And I guess in terms of just you guys have been talking about price\/cost being neutral for the quarter. I think, Dave, going back to like last quarter, I think the initial assumption was that it was going to be slightly negative in the first half of the year and maybe making it up in the second half. So is there a chance then that price\/cost can be positive as we progress through this year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I thought \u2013 I wouldn't bet on that one. I think going back to, it was a very good question somebody asked me but if you look at the pieces that go into the cost side of this, there's more pieces on the cost side that are going up than we've seen in a while. So we're going to have to make sure we keep that price piece moving up with it. It's not going to be big dollars, but we're going to have to \u2013 we had pretty good mix from the standpoint of some of the KOB3 type of stuff. We had some pretty good mix in some of the businesses in Commercial & Residential. Right now, I think if we can \u2013 I will consider this a win for us this year if we're $1 green. I mean, I'll buy everyone a drink on that one because this is what's going to be, I think, the most challenging thing for us, Joe, this year because of the fact that we see a lot of moderate inflation pressures coming at us, but I feel very good that we could offset that because we've been getting ready for this for a while.","And I'll repeat it again. We're going to have to work very closely with our customers here to be doing some mix and the matching and some changing here to help them solve their cost price, and they're going to have to help us solve our cost price because this is not something that's going to be a brute force effort here or that'll come back to haunt both sides, which I don't want to see happen, as you can imagine.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, that makes sense, Dave. If I can maybe fit one more in here, we haven't talked about...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Go ahead. I ain't going anywhere. I'm still CEO.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","17 years and counting. If you take the $3 billion or so that you have on your balance sheet right now and you talked in the past a lot of that is international, are there any \u2013 is there any hindrances to bringing that cash back and getting it invested? Is there some type of timing that we should be thinking about on that cash?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll let Frank answer that first and then I'll give you my two cents.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No, Joe, we're expecting to bring back little over $1billion of it this fiscal year. I would expect to bring back a substantial chunk in the second quarter and then probably another amount that'll take us over $1 billion later in the fiscal year. So, no, there are no impediments. We'll be bringing almost half of what we have overseas back in the next year or so.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. So we \u2013 one of the good things the tax reform does for us is it gives us that freedom to make that call when we want to do it. We only have a couple markets in the world that really our cash will get trapped. It's hard to move it around into one of those markets. In China, basically every about 12 or 18 months we get cash out. We've brought out over $3 billion since I've been CEO out of China. And so we've a lot more freedom, a lot more flexibility under this whole new tax reform. That gives the U.S. companies a lot more competitive opportunities here which we have not had in the past, and that's one of the advantages. And I'll say it again, if U.S. companies don't take advantage of what Congress passed in this tax reform, then we're flaming idiots.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. On that note, thanks, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","All right, Joe.","Operator","The next question will be from Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane. Where you hiding out today?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Just downtown Manhattan here. Living the dream.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Living the dream!","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes, sir.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You got like your feet up on the desk having a drink, Mai Thai or something like that right now, Deane?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, no, no. That's for later.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, still \u2013 we got to drill down in something as exciting as the tax reform and just to follow up on Joe's last questions there. Were there any surprises as you kind of work through the angles on tax reform? We had you pegged coming in around 27%, and it looks like that benefit is significantly better for you. So, what were the kind of puts and takes as you went through that? And what's that step-up and further benefit in 2019?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. I mean as you know, I was a very much engaged in this process as the Chairman of NAM and working with the Congress and the White House. And then also, Frank's team was right with me the whole time. I think that from our perspective, we've always felt it was going to be around 5 or 6 points of just pure rate benefit for us and there was \u2013 in fact at the 11th hour, they took a little bit away from us where we \u2013 from the standpoint. But overall, we \u2013 it pretty well came in line where we thought it was going to be. I was pleased, and we've been positioning ourself now for the last 12 months. So from the pure payment, we're going to have to pay the government over the next eight to nine years. I think that number, we can minimize that number a little bit. The overall sort of restatement off what I'd call fixing the deferred tax on our balance sheet, I think that's \u2013 we're clean there. We didn't have anything hidden in there that we had to write off.","And then the other benefit that Frank and his team did is when we did the sale of the two \u2013 the businesses, we made the decision to go ahead and book the tax costs. So, that gave us a big benefit that when we waited to bring the money back that we're actually saving about $125 million of actual cashes on taxes here because we waited because of the lower tax rate. So overall, Frank and his team, they knocked this one out of the park. And so from our shareholders' perspective, they've got a lot of benefits here both this year and then next year, we're going to obviously get a lower tax rate. And then you look at my competitors which are international companies, we're going to be \u2013 on a tax rate now, we're right there. We're competitive to anybody, and I'll take my cost structure and my flexibility on anybody any day. So I like where we are right now, Joe (sic) [Deane], and I think we're in a pretty good shape.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And then if you could just clarify on the CapEx spend increase, how much of that might be influenced because of the tax advantages on CapEx?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Deane. I thought it's Joe. I apologize, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No worries.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From my standpoint, there's two things going on. Long-term, the way I went in and I was pushing so hard working with Congress is we have a aging workforce in North America right now. And as we see the underlying demand come into the next generation of products in Automation, we're going to have to invest to make sure our facilities are more competitive from the flexibility and the type of stuff we want to do with our manufacturing. So the increase in capital we're going to see is mainly around Automation and some incremental capacity and flex-type of capacity that we're going to need to serve this U.S. marketplace because our strategy has always been we stay local for serving.","So we manufacture here in the region here just like we do in Europe, just like we do in Asia. So I think what we're seeing we're going to have to do is spend a little bit more money on the Automation side of this company and that means we're going to have to spend some incremental capacity. And I would say that we'll also bring some bricks and mortars because we're going to have to reconfigure our facilities, which always means new bricks and mortars at the same time. So I think it's going to be pretty good for non-res here for the next couple of years.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good. We'll see you next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you next week, Deane. I apologize for calling you Joe.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No worries.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Operator","The next question will come from Gautam Khanna of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Gautam. It's good to talk to you again. You've been hiding on me?","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","A little bit.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Don't comment on that one, Gautam. You just ignore me on that one.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's fair.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's fair. I just gave you the only thing I wouldn't take.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, yeah, I agree. Couple of questions. I guess, first, you mentioned one of the milestones you're sort of tracking on the V&C integration this month, but what else can we look for over the next 12 months? What are the big milestones we should be kind of paying close attention to as you integrate the business? Anything you can give us on that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. There's three things I'm watching very closely. One is the ability for us to create the solutions packages in the final control that when we're going out to bid, it gives us a competitive advantage. And what that will mean is the order pattern opportunity within the final control should run higher rates than the rest of Automation Solutions. And that gives us a chance that means we're \u2013 from my perspective, that means we're regaining some of the lost presence that we got lost in the \u2013 they got lost in the last cycle.","The number two thing we're tracking very clearly that you'll be able to see is the fact that we're talking about, from a margin standpoint, yes, V&C is still diluting to our margin, but a less dilutive impact. And therefore, as you go into the second half of this year, you start seeing the positive impact of the V&C as we wrap around it because you're going to start seeing that live now as we get in that second half. So another milestone we want to watch and something that I'm watching to make sure this team gets their job done.","And the third issue, from my perspective, is all around the cash flow. If the cash flow at corporation continues to outperform in the upside, and it's a function of we're still growing nicely the profitability, but because the final control organization is able to get the trapped cash and off their balance sheet from the receivables and the balance sheet from their inventory, if they continue to do that, that will be the third thing. So you'll keep hearing us talk about better cash flow over a quarter or over six or nine months and that tells me that they're getting the job done.","Those are the three things I'm watching for the final control organization out there. And that's why we want to see happen because that means they're really bringing a better flow of cash and return and growth to the corporation and hence for the shareholder, which two things are happening. Given the fact the tax rate went down and we're delivering on the savings and growth, that means the return for my shareholder is going to be better than initially planned.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful color. And maybe just a last one to dovetail to your cash flow discussion. You've done a number of tuck-in acquisitions, Cooper-Atkins, you mentioned cold chain, and what you'll talk about next week. But can you characterize how the M&A pipeline looks right now? Do you have any \u2013 what does it look like in terms of size of opportunities, what you expect might actually transact over the next year in terms of dollars spent? Any sort of color around that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Yeah, I'll give you some color. Right now, from our perspective, as we look at the transactions today, these are very much transactions which are private transactions. We are engaging with private owners. They're part of a private equity firm trying to come out. They're part of a large corporation. And so right now, we probably have $2 billion to $3 billion that we're actively engaged in. And what we'll report to you is we're trying to get another $500 million, $600 million done this year. What I'd like \u2013 in reality, what I'd like to see if I look at today versus the end of this calendar year, which is the end of 2018, I'd like to see us, in reality, get closer to $1.5 billion to $2 billion done. That's the type of magnitude we're working on right now.","We have \u2013 because of where we've been through our repositioning, we probably got ahead of a lot of our competitors and where we are relative to our ability to absorb because we've got the divestitures done and we've got a good head start in V&C. So, what I would call the right number for me right now is not $500 million for the next \u2013 rest of this year. I'd like to really see a number, which is more like $1 billion to $1.5 billion to $2 billion type of range before the end of this calendar year. And that would be, to me, where we should see and that's the type of activity we're working on right now.","Now, we may not get them done, but that's what we want to do. We want to try to get that done and that would make our plan all the way out to 2021 a lot easier to execute on because that's front-end loading the acquisitions.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, guys. See you next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Gautam. And I'll see you next week and thank you very much for the time.","Operator","The next question...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","With that, I'm going to wrap it up. Any more questions? Is anybody out there?","Operator","There are a few more, sir, if you want to take them, or we can move to the closing if you'd like.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll take one more question since you got me trapped. I'll take one more question.","Operator","I'm sorry. It will be from Andrew Kaplowitz of Citi. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","On second thought. Okay. Andrew, how are you doing my friend?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Dave. How are you doing, man? Just getting under the belt. I like it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Andrew, you got your tail underneath the door.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Absolutely. So, I just wanted to ask you about Europe in the sense that it was down, but you've mentioned that orders are positive there and it should be better. Europe has had very strong GDP growth, as you know. So is anything going on there, is any reason why it shouldn't grow low- to mid-single digits as you go forward here in 2018?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, there's nothing going on. From our perspective, it's more of a timing. We had some very large businesses over the last couple of years and we're having to fill that backlog in the Automation Solutions side. On the Commercial & Res, we're doing okay in Europe. It's just a function of timing on the projects for us in Europe. And clearly, from a competitive standpoint right now with the dynamic change in the dollar, we had a slow start to sales in the first quarter, but the orders, I feel good about it. When we talk to the projects, we see things going on. I feel good about that, so nothing unusual.","Now, if I have another quarter that I'm disappointed in Europe, then I'll be starting to say, okay, what's going on here. But the only other thing I could tell you that it probably created that weak in the first quarter in Automation Solutions in the first year, if we had our main distribution center in Germany went through an Oracle conversion in the last six months, I can tell you right now it's not gone well and so we struggle with shipments, but that's my bad and my mistake as a CEO and we'll fix that, but overall we're doing okay and if we have another bad quarter, then we're going to figure out what the hell is going on, but right now I feel okay because I think everything is being done right.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, Dave, and that's helpful. So just in Commercial & Residential Solutions in North America, I just wanted to follow up. Last quarter, you had some hurricane impact and maybe there's some reconstruction work to be had here in 2018, so have you seen any impact from that and maybe just talk about the visibility into that particular market? I mean it was up, but it was up marginally. What do you see going forward there in North America?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We see a very good non-res marketplace from the rebuild going on. I think in the housing market, there's a lot of issues relative to around labor and ability to execute, but the timing of replacement market, the timing of the new technology, I mean we really have a situation for the next 12 to 18 months that should be pretty good for us in the U.S. marketplace both in non-res and residential, so I mean we have to continue to execute around that and I like where we are at this point in time in North America in non-res, and again as it wind up nicely for the Automation Solutions in North America, Commercial & Residential should be lined up nicely too for the rest of this year going into 2019 based on the factors that you just threw out there, Andrew, so I like where we sit at this point in time. We have to execute around that.","The key issue for us at this point in time is we have to make sure we're starting to make those incremental capacities both in capacity from equipment and also in people, and that's something that we're decent at. We've written it down and now we want to write it up a little bit here, so I like where we are and we should have pretty good winds to our back in this one.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, Dave. See you next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","See you next week, and again I want to apologize for cutting you off there, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","With that, I'm going to wrap it up. I want to thank everybody. Tim, great job with the charts. I mean for Mr. Transparency, probably can't even spell transparency, but good job there, and Frank, thank you very much and the organization out there. Really good quarter and now we've got to deliver the second quarter, folks, because our shareholders are expecting better and since they've said I sandbagged them on the upgrade, I hope they're right, but we'll see what happens after that second quarter.","So everyone, you take care and I'll see you in New York next week, and pray for no snow unlike Boston a few years ago when we moved to Boston and got five feet of snow, what a heck it was and so you all take care and we'll see you next week at the Stock Exchange.

Following the presentation the conference will be opened for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today August 06, 2013.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the Company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information and factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Patrick Fitzgerald","","Thank you, Camille. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2013 results. Our conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for next three months.","I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. Third quarter sales declined modestly to $6.3 billion underlying sales decreasing 1%. While this macroeconomic conditions continued through the quarter with cautious levels of business investment globally.","Sales growth is also affected by the difficult comparison mainly from the Thailand flooding recovery in the prior year. Emerging markets grew 2%, which was more than offset by material market leading us. We announced this morning than an agreement as been signed to sell the 51% stake in the embedded computing and power business to Platinum Equity. The transaction nearly monetizes the business and shifts focus to our core businesses.","Transaction proceeds of approximately $300 million and repatriated cash to be deployed for incremental share repurchase of $600 million. Charges related to business were recognized in the quarter totaling $0.70 of EPS. Excluding these charges earnings per share were $0.97. Strong cash generation continued with free cash flow up 20%.","Moving to slide three, P&L summary. As we mentioned the slow macroeconomic environment limited growth. Gross profit margin was flat as cost containment offset unfavorable product mix and volume deleverage. Operating profit margin declined to the higher stock compensation and pension expense as well as mainly high leverage in the prior year from the flooding recovery. Goodwill impairment was recognized in the embedded computing and power business.","Other deductions increased to $37 million, non-recurring dumping duty gain in the prior year. EBIT decreased sharply due to these items, leading to reported earnings per share of $0.27, and $0.97, excluding the goodwill impairment of $0.65 and income tax charges of $0.05 related to earnings repatriation.","Moving to slide four, underlying sales by geography. By geography, underlying sales have decreased in the U.S. by 3%, in Europe by 6% and in Asia by 3%, including a 4% reduction in China. Sales grew in Latin America by 8%, in Canada by 4% and in Middle East and Africa by 18%. Total underlying sales declined 1% divestitures and currency deducted 1%, while reported sales declined 2%. Excluding the embedded computing and power business, underlying sales were essentially flat with modest growth in China.","Next slide, cash flow and balance sheet. Cash generation was robust with operating cash flow up 17% and free cash flow up 20% which represents the conversion from earnings to 121%. Working capital as a percent of sales increase from prior year due to high receivables, but improved sequentially by 120 basis points.","Moving to slide six business segment details. Business segment margin declined to 130 basis points due to flooding recovery and dumping duties in the prior year, as well as higher pension expense. The increase in corporate expense is due to the previously mentioned impairment and higher stock compensation expense. And tax rate reflects one time income tax expense repatriate earnings from the embedded computing and power business. Excluding this impact the tax rate would have been 29%.","Next slide Process Management. Process Management sales grew 3% with an approximately 7% point impact in the Thailand flooding recovery in the prior year. By region, North America declined 4%, Asia grew 8%, Europe was flat, Latin America grew 17% and Middle East and Africa grew 24%. Oil and gas, power and chemical end markets continue to grow. Underlying orders were up 8% led by double-digit growth in systems and solutions, improvement in North America and 13% growth in China.","Segment margin declined 160 basis points, which was also effected by flooding recovery comparisons. Global project activity remains robust including solid growth momentum in the next year.","Moving to slide eight, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation sales decreased 7% with North America down 5%, Asia flat, Europe down 13%, Latin America down 4% and Middle East and Africa down 2%. Industrial goods and markets remained weak globally especially in Europe. Business was most pronounced in the power generating alternators business with channel inventory destocking is beginning to slow, and orders are expected to turn positive soon.","Excluding $37 million in dumping duties received in the prior year, margin remained unchanged as cost containment offset volume deleverage. Demand for industrial goods appears to be stabilizing, but is expected to remain slow in the near term, particularly in Europe.","Next slide Network Power. Network power sales declined 5% with North America down 2%; Asia down 13%; Europe down 4%; Latin America up 6% and Middle East and Africa up 19%. Slow demand continued in global information technology and telecommunications end markets. And Network Power systems business declined slightly as growth and data center infrastructure was offset by telecommunications weakness.","Embedded computing and power business declined at a double-digit rate. Segment margin contracted 220 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable price. End markets appear to be improving, with difficult comparisons from prior years (inaudible) project in Australia will limit near-term growth.","Next slide, Climate Technology. Climate technology sales decreased 2% with North America down 4%; Asia down 2%; Europe down 5%; Latin America up 3% and Middle East and Africa up 21%. U.S. Air conditioning business declined modestly as the residential markets paused due to mild weather and inventory destocking. Asia sales declined as China decreased after double-digit growth in the previous quarter. Europe market conditions remained weak. The global refrigeration business improved for both recovery and the transportation business. Segment margin expanded 80 basis point as cost containment offset unfavorable mix. Growth is expected to resume in the refrigeration businesses in the near-term.","Moving to slide 11 Commercial and Residentials solutions sales declined 2% reflecting a (inaudible) adverse impact from divestitures. Underlying sales grew 4% with North America up 6%, Asia up 3%, Europe down 4%, Latin America down 1% and Middle-East and Africa down 11%.","Residential investment in North America continues to grow more than offsetting slower commercial demand. Segment margin remained unchanged from prior year. We expect growth to continue the solid residential and improving non-residential demand in the U.S. as well as stabilization in Europe.","Moving to slide 12, consistent with previously communicated intentions, today we announced an agreement to divest the 51% stake in the Embedded Computing and Power business to Platinum Equity, the terms allow us to immediately monetize the asset focused on our core business, while also participating an upsize from repositioning of business.","Emerson will receive approximately 300 million in cash and retain a 49% non-controlling interest. The transaction is expected to close in the next three to six months. The $300 million of transaction proceeds and approximately $300 million in repatriated Embedded Computing and Power earnings will be used for $600 million of additional share repurchase to offset EPS dilution. The businesses sales and earnings will continue to be reported in Emerson's consolidated results until the transaction close.","Next slide full year outlook. The economic environment is beginning to stabilize and improve, but orders growth resuming in June after declines since February. We are expecting, near-term business investment will remain cautious but slowly improve.","Specifically we anticipate energy and residential markets to remain solid with slow but improving demand for industrial growth and information technology and telecommunications infrastructure.","Based on current conditions the revised 2013 outlook is as follows; reported and underlying sales growth of approximately 1%; EBIT and pretax margin approximately equal to prior year, excluding the goodwill charge in each year; earnings per share excluding goodwill and tax charges trending toward the lower end of $3.48 to $3.55 or $2.78 to $2.85 excluding charges; operating cash flow of approximately $3.4 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2.7 billion.","With that I'll turn over to David Farr. ","David N. Farr","","Thank you very much, Pat. Welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call. I also want to thank all the operating executives out there for delivering what I would call very solid operating margins and some very strong cash flow and a very difficult quarter from the standpoint of comparisons from last year which we\u2019ve referred to a couple of times in the press release at the Thailand flood. We always knew this was going to be our most challenging quarter given what, ho we recovered last year.","On the negative side throughout the quarter, prior to the last four or five months, we've seen weakening of the global economies and that weakness really start to coming true as we move through this quarter. And the good news though, if you look at where we stand right now, June orders were positive. Early indication right now July orders are also going to be positive. So it looks to us that things are starting to shape up with a little bit upward trend to finish the year with a strong operating performance in Q4, to get through well I call, it challenging fiscal 2013, but overall it was a tough quarter.","We had a lot of moving parts. Several of the businesses are doing well. As you can see, coming up our electrical products group meeting. The big exception clearly is Network Power systems which continues to see weaker sales coming from a weakening China, other parts of Asia Pacific, also very weak IT demand both coming out of Europe and the United States. Companies have not really increased their spending at any significant levels yet to see that market place pick back up.","We also had some very bad mix throughout the quarter, through different business in particular China which is a high margin business for us is really weak. And our repositioning and restructuring continues to take hold and it\u2019s starting to pay off.","In fact I just came back from Europe and we saw our European business is stabilizing and actually start to see positive order growth in our Network Power Systems business, a very important, we\u2019ve signed restructuring of all the restructuring and the new management team we have put in place up, a good first sign that things are starting to turn.","Negative side also of this business, was weak government spending. We have a government spending arm here and that business was down obviously with a pullback in the government spending.","Overall, the business did not turn out what we thought it would at the electrical products group. Clearly the margin for the whole year will be weaker than we said before. Well I am starting to see as you've seen in orders , we're starting to see the Network Power Systems business pick back up and I feel we will be going out this quarter, fourth quarter doing better and then really going into a stronger 2014 as the economy continues to I think moderately improve but not robustly.","But relative to the other businesses, we're all operating pretty well, pretty much along the line if we thanks a lot about EPG. Process management has been continued strong order growth, with some very difficult comparisons last year. Underlying sales and orders were up close double-digits this quarter. When you take out the impact the Thailand flood, we\u2019re seeing a good business coming around the world. We\u2019re not really seeing any delays at this point in time, and the technology investment continue to go forward. The other good sign there is we\u2019re continuing to work a lot of nice bolt-on acquisitions in the space, which will help as again as we finish this year and going into next year.","On the Climate Technology, it is a little bit more volatile than we normally would see. We had a very good quarter last quarter, a little bit weaker this quarter, but net-net, the orders have turned up and what we\u2019re seeing coming out of Europe, out of Asia, the United States is the trend line is positive and I expect setting up for a pretty good fourth fiscal quarter and hopefully a strong first quarter going into the next fiscal year.","Industrial Automation clearly continues to be impacted by. One of our large customers out there continues to do a lot of inventory destocking, but overall, again, I\u2019m starting to see a little bit more improvement there and I feel better. As we come through this quarter, and get into the fourth quarter and go into next year that will eventually turn to positive growth. Even when you look at the business, underlying business where the volume down, they were able to protect their profitability once you exclude the impact of the one-time pick-up we had last year from the Byrd Amendment callback.","So, that business is doing really well. North America business in commercial residential, as we\u2019ve said, the housing market is still strong, people are spending a little bit of money and the business is still growing in that 4%, 5% range, which is very good.","Very positively, over the last six months we\u2019ve been working extremely hard. I\u2019m trying to come with an appropriate exit strategy for our computer and power business, which has had four extremely challenging years. It is good to get this behind us, and moving forward we\u2019ve got a solution that\u2019s right for the management team, right for the business and right for the Company. And I feel good about where we sit right now. We need to get the approvals from the governments around the world, which should not be problem, but that takes time.","Most importantly, as a management team and the Board, we want to return back with $600 million that we\u2019re getting out of this business and returning it back to our shareholders and share repurchase. And that\u2019s very, very important from the perspective of giving money back to our shareholders.","From the cash flow standpoint, we are going to have a very strong year and a very strong quarter with almost $1 billion in operating cash flow. And what we see this year is pretty record levels of operating cash flow, over $3.4 billion and hopefully $2.7 billion of free cash flow. With the share repurchase of $850 million we\u2019ve already have planned, the $600 million is an incremental number to go back to the shareholders. So this year we\u2019ll be \u2013 we are obviously doing a lot more share repurchase on the next 12 months.","Acquisitions are very moderate this year. We\u2019re only be doing about $100 million. However, with the pipeline and the deals we are working on right now, I would expect that number to bump up on bolt-on type of acquisitions to about $1 billion level when we get into 2014. We do not have any large strategic acquisitions at this time on the table and we\u2019re working very, very diligent on the bolt-on acquisitions in our core space to strengthen our Company.","A tough quarter, but certain things are starting to turn relative to orders, the cash. I think that you are going to see a stronger operating execution here in the fourth quarter and we are setting up for a solid fourth quarter with a good movement going into 2014.","It\u2019s good to get this from behind us. It\u2019s really good get the agreement with the sales of computer power system business and it will be good to see return to positive top line growth and solid order growth as we go forward during the coming months. It\u2019s been a very difficult three or four years here with very moderate growth environment, which has created a lot of pressure relative to the growth. But the business is in very good shape from the restructuring standpoint, cash standpoint and the position of the business at this point in time.","So with that, I want to open the phone line up for questions and I want to thank everyone for joining us today and again I want to thank operating executives for working hard and delivering a good quarter in a very challenging environment.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019d mentioned in the release that you are encouraged by the emerging market investments. You had 2% growth overall. Are you able to talk a little bit more detail in terms of how these investments are paying off so far and what the GFI backdrop is in the emerging markets that you are achieving 2% growth in?","David N. Farr","The reason we said we are encouraged by, because we\u2019ve seen very good growth in our Latin America business. We are seeing good growth in our Middle East business. The big issue that we\u2019ve seen in Southeast Asia, the biggest issue we have seen so far this year is Australia which is not emerging market, but China and from our perspective investments we make in these markets are continuing to growth. The China one will obviously continue to see, evaluate how much more we are going to put in there. But I would, for the GFI going forward here for the next couple of years in the emerging markets, it\u2019s most likely going to be in the 4% or 5% range.","It\u2019s not going to be all that strong. It would be better than you\u2019re seeing in the mature markets, but still kind of weak. But one or two quarters, we have things moving in and out based on what\u2019s going on in large projects, but overall it was a reasonable quarter except for what happened in China, as China weakened significantly throughout the quarter and hopefully that will start turnaround here in the coming months and quarters.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","And as a follow-up, are you still seeing the credit issues in China that I think you mentioned last quarter?","David N. Farr","That theme has stabilized a little bit. I think there was \u2013 now they\u2019ve tightened up for the banks. I think that\u2019s now starting to settle down. I look at our receivables. I look at our outstanding receivables. That\u2019s improving. So, overall I think that\u2019s okay at this point in time. We are just looking at for where they are going to invest and we had a pretty good quarter excluding embedded power and computing business in China. So, overall I\u2019m looking for good second half this year. On the calendar year basis the things start to stabilize little bit there.","Mike Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thanks, and good morning, Dave and all. Congrats on the deal with Platinum.","David N. Farr","","Thank you very much, Steve. It\u2019s afternoon now unless you\u2019re some place different than I am.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Yeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m been working (inaudible) early this morning. It\u2019s afternoon. So, the transaction detail, just a little bit more clarity on the dilution of this, or on the exit of that 49% over time and we\u2019ve seen this with IR and Tyco and others, to kind of get into these deals. They deconsolidate and promise to get out and then they get diluted over time and we don\u2019t really see a lot happen over time. What are your expectations, I mean, how many years should we think about this, is this longer-term for the remaining stake or how are you thinking about it?","David N. Farr","We are visioning as we talked to the Board about three to four years. I mean, we will get out of this business the way we structured from the standpoint of books and the residual value. I think the intention of Platinum and the management team is obviously to transform this business and clearly get their money back out, but it\u2019s going to be, I would say, three to four years that we\u2019re looking at this point in time.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay, great. And just maybe stacking up a little bit. With all the news on Invensys and Schneider going after Invensys, we know that obviously Emerson is a very strong competitor in these areas, but my question is more about to what extent Schneider\u2019s reinvestment in the Invensys installed base sort of potentially slows down share gains or impacts the industry more broadly over time? I mean, how are you thinking about that one?","David N. Farr","From my perspective, having Invensys going into the hands of Schneider is, I think, will bring some stability to the marketplace, to be honest. I think that Invensys was not large enough to have a critical mass. So I think it\u2019s having a large global customer like we have with Honeywell, like we have with Siemens, like we have with ABB or Yokogawa, I\u2019m not worried about another one. In fact, I think it\u2019s a positive time from our perspective.","From the installed base point, Schneider doesn\u2019t bring a lot of technology to the systems, but they bring other things. So I think they are going to have to spend time and figure out how to integrate their type of system technology with the controls business technology and that will take time. So I think that if I look at the opportunities from market share, it\u2019s still going to be out there, because you are going to have customers wondering about Schneider, how long they\u2019ve been in the control market space, are they going to be \u2013 they could be the right guy you want to pact with. So I\u2019m not too worried about it at this point of time. I mean, Schneider is big competitor and we compete against them. I look forward to it and, I mean it could be a lot worse scenario.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on and get back in line.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much, Steve.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, John. How are you doing today?","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Doing well, doing well, enjoying the summer. There\u2019s been obviously some false starts before, over the past three or four years, I mean, you\u2019ve called it out. Just what gives you the conviction that these markets, never mind if turning up, but they\u2019re just \u2013 we\u2019re finally at long last at the bottom. I mean, you\u2019ve done this a long time. Why do you think now is sort of this inflection point versus simply a pausing before we step down again.","David N. Farr","I\u2019m not forecasting low cost growth. Let\u2019s put it that way. I am forecasting, I mean, from my perspective right now, I\u2019ve seen the disinvestment, let\u2019s just take Europe for instance. Disinvestment for almost two years in Europe and to the point now that businesses need to put some money back in. So if I look at what\u2019s going on in Europe, we\u2019ve been going negative for almost two years. You are looking at a sort of slight positive, just going from negative 3% to a plus 1% type of situation. I just feel what we are seeing right now, is people do need to put the money back into play. You are seeing some of that same thing happen in United States and you are going to start seeing that happen in other markets around the world.","I think you got the money going in Japan right now, where the government trying to encourage business investments and that\u2019s going to have, I think, a positive impact throughout Asia Pacific. So I mean from my view right now, if I look at the world and I look at where we are relative to world and GDP growth the GFI growth I\u2019m looking at basically a moderate growth next year, maybe a slight tick higher, but not much more than that. I just think right now people are going to have to put some money to work here and invest on the capital and reinvestment in productivity.","I\u2019m not expecting a sharp turn here. But I\u2019m expecting a slight upward momentum and that\u2019s what I\u2019m feeling right now and that\u2019s what I feel and that\u2019s how we\u2019re planning. So like all moderate lift. But it\u2019s a tough market, as we talked about. I think it\u2019s going to go on for a couple more years.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That makes sense. What kind of projects, if you could give a little more color on the projects that you are seeing in process. I guess one of the themes of quarter has been kind of the resurgence here in oil and gas spending. Are you seeing that too or just anything that might provide sort of your level of how this thing is going to play out over the coming quarters?","David N. Farr","We are continuing to see a lot of oil and gas investments per se. We\u2019re also seeing a lot of investments in power in both Asia and also North America. Our power orders are pretty good this year and have continued to strengthen and it\u2019s a function of people having to figure out how to upgrade their power systems, maybe not putting new capacity in place, but how to upgrade their systems. So, we\u2019re seeing a pretty good area relative to power.","We\u2019re seeing good money relative to downstream work going on right now too, the oil and gas \u2013 Sasol investments and that we\u2019re seeing a lot Louisiana that type of investments. So, we\u2019re seeing a large project coming off oil and gas. We\u2019re seeing the oil and gas investments and we\u2019re starting to see a return into some of the power investments. So, overall, I\u2019m very pleased.","Now, we\u2019re not seeing \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen a lot of, what I call MRO, which we had a lot of last year, which I\u2019m hoping from the capital standpoint that we\u2019ll see that pick back up here in the coming months. So that\u2019s in the weakest part this recovery and this year versus what we saw last year. But the prices are pretty broad in there, pretty global and the pipeline is as big as it\u2019s ever been.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And large projects are picking as well is that what you just\u2026","David N. Farr","Correct. Correct.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just one last one. Eaton, called out I think large data center improvement for the Network Power businesses in the second half or starting in the second half. I think we talk a little bit more constructively on the system side. Are you seeing that as well as there is something about their mix that makes them perhaps a little bit different? I know they have got a couple of products. I don\u2019t know maybe there\u2019s some channel fill or something?","David N. Farr","I don\u2019t know. I think what they are seeing is the same thing we\u2019re seeing. We are seeing a lot of coding going on right now. Theirs is a large project that has been held back for quite some time and we are seeing that coding activity happening right now, same thing.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Take care.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","","Dave, just wondering what the restructuring is for the year now and for next year, because it sounds like you are talking about maybe 2% to 4% organic next year if I\u2019m reading properly. So wondering how you view the margin opportunity in these contexts?","David N. Farr","We\u2019re looking at probably $85 million restructuring this year and I would say we are going to be looking about the same level next year or two, $85 million, $90 million, $95 million right on that range. We are just starting that real process. From my perspective, what the biggest issue, I think was just talking to John about it was getting \u2013 if I can get Europe to actually turn from going negative to positive, the restructuring that we\u2019ve been making in Europe will be a very positive from the standpoint of getting that margin to top back up in Europe, which you need that growth and that cap in there. So at this point in time I think that moderate growth, about same on restructuring we should reserve on next year.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","Got it, thanks. And then just looks like a pretty heavy CapEx pick up in the fourth quarter, is that just timing?","David N. Farr","Timing.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","Okay.","David N. Farr","Timing, and typically right now I would say $700 million is the number. I bet that it would be closer to the last year's number. But I can't call that plus or minus $20 million in capital. But I would say right now probably won't quite hit $700 million. I would say the operating cash flow will hit 3.4, but we won't hit $700 million. This one get done.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer Securities","Thank you.","David N. Farr","You're welcome.","Operator","","Our next question is from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Hello, Dave and everyone.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Jeff. Long time no seeing.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","","Yeah, absolutely. Hope you are doing well.","David N. Farr","I'm alive.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good. Keep going, keeping on. Just back on process, you\u2019ve also called out water, I mean not in the strength in power and water that you're exciting actually is very different from like the flow through and (inaudible) missing on slow on the water businesses and power gas struggling. You said on powers, a lot of restlessness, is it upgrade is it coal or is it something standout there and what is it in water that actually think.","David N. Farr","Okay. On the power side we're seeing mostly gas right now, we're seeing gas systems being upgrade a lot of conversion going on there not much going on in coal at this point in time, no one is touching that coal, it's pretty tight but they are actually going and doing power additions for gas, and that's been going on and that continue to go on.","We've also seen a lot of investment going on in security. There is a lot of new regulations and relative to security of your power plan, and we have very strong security capabilities and systems capabilities, which we've been going and upgrading, so they meet the code which has been a positive thing for us.","As you know, when we bought the Westinghouse power business, we actually picked up a lot of business. We picked up our water business relative to the systems that go into the waste water systems, new water systems, and we also picked up a system out of our Brickell acquisition too which works now we put that together.","So there have been investment on upgrade in the wastewater systems, a lot of laws coming out of EPA and so we've been getting good, what I call medium, small sized projects throughout the United States and throughout the world relative to water process. And so we've seen a little bit of a pickup there too. But nothing really talk much about because it's not the biggest driver of our control systems in that PWF, but we've seen a pretty good recovery there longer the power.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's right. And just on the climate, the tolerance does sound a little bit better. I wonder if you could just address the competitive landscape, and how we feel about where you're at with kind of variable fees in product line and rollout. And in particular, just kind of have my eyes on the Japanese wondering if you're seeing any particular kind of emerging threats in those guys, if given a (inaudible) again.","David N. Farr","Okay. From the standpoint of the overall system right now, as I look at the roadmap and the under investment in Europe, it\u2019s primarily refrigeration, it's not a AC marketplace that business does appear to have actually can start trending upward, which is good to see after a couple of top years. Asia the AC system refrigeration investment that\u2019s doing pretty well, we're starting to see some of that pickup back and again transportation as people starting to invest back after couple of years being off.","And North America the competitive environment really hasn't changed much in the last three or four months. We got very, very strong quarter last quarter than this quarter we backed off. The orders have been reasonable this quarter and we're starting to see some of the other commercial businesses pick back up.","Relative to variable speed in your case, this time Daikin coming on Japan obviously everyone is working right now on bringing of what I'd call competitive variable speeds in United States, we clearly are working with them to do that, nothing has changed at this point in time. I don't think you're going to see any significant product until sometime middle of next year.","Now Carrier today has a high-end product which is very good business, it's a small part of the marketplace, we need to get into this into what I call mid sized marketplace, mid price point. But I think we're all working on that right now. But it looks like the reason will trend for the next couple months and hopefully next couple of quarters. But it\u2019s clearly variable speed is the key issue that we have as a company understand and that's why we're making electronic investments and products are coming out we've been doing pretty well in Europe, doing okay in Asia, and the next game will be in the United States.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Beyond Diakin, is there anybody Toshiba, Hitachi, others that you\u2019ll need to keep an eye on or worry about as competitors yet?","Patrick Fitzgerald","Toshiba has worked of course obviously their close relationship with Carrier. But Carrier obviously has an option there working with Toshiba, but they always had and we work sort of duel together. But I would say in my perspective Diakin has the most competitive capabilities out there.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thanks a lot guys.","David N. Farr","That's Jeff. Hope we will see you soon.","Jeffrey Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good afternoon everyone.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey Dave just on this idea of getting Europe to turn I mean, you mentioned a couple areas I think in Network Power and climate that you saw turning positive getting the whole picture to turn positive what are kind of the lagging pieces and maybe just fill that thought out a little bit.","David N. Farr","Well, from our perspective we've been watching this now because for the last several months, all the leading indicators in Europe are have been point consistently now, I want to say three or four months, I'm talking about (inaudible) month is five so, as I look at the European structure at this point in time, it\u2019s been actually from a leading and it's actually been almost six months and industrial numbers have been up three or four months.","So, from my perspective what we're seeing right now is the longer the bank the stability to access our money. We're going to start seeing in the medium and small customers coming into play and start investing again. And so I think that's the key sign, from Europe perspective right now process had a good quarter in Europe, and we're starting to see some of the other industrial businesses come along with that. But again, I won\u2019t go back it's not going to be what I call robust turn, what I would envision next year would be probably 1% type, maybe even a little bit better than 1% type of growth, which versus two years of negative growth that's going to be a nice win to our back.","So key to me is the financial institutions struggling to lend the money out feeling comfortable in the money out, and I think that obviously the general election coming up, I'm hoping things will stabilize here and we'll continue trend up, but right now those bring going up for several months and I would say the indication is that this will lift up the boat and have a little bit more positive view of Europe next year, again not robust but more positive.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on some of the restructuring benefits I mean industrial automation you've done a really good job offsetting the volume deleverage with restructuring cost take up, you've done a heavy restructuring in Network Power too, but it hasn't really panned out there in terms of offsetting the volume deleverage. Is that a function of the mix in Network Power or the restructuring savings taking a longer to show up or maybe just give us a sense of why it's been so much more effective in industrial automation?","David N. Farr","Industrial automation we actually had laid it out a little bit earlier, we saw the European thing coming down quite rapidly, and so we had laid it out, in the last couple of years we've done incrementally so we got ahead of this power curve, and we got a couple of key last restructuring on Europe, and a couple of key ones on United States right before the startup here, so that's been helping us cover this.","On the Network Power the biggest issue for us has been the European dropoff right after we bought Chloride, we start pushing it together on the cost of the restructuring, disturb the restructuring, it's been a more painful process relative to recovering that profitability through the restructuring, we need to get the growth back in, and as I said earlier, we're staring to see the orders grow, guarantees on the sales growth but that trend line continues and we'll start seeing that positive. But that's been the biggest issue as the timing of restructuring just as the marketplace start turning down the sales turned down rapidly. We're behind the power curve because of the downturn where we\u2019ve got ahead of the power curve with IA. That's our normal gain but we've just done a big acquisition started and we've got, unfortunately we've got behind as one and to you have ever done surfing and so forth, the way we are actually top of here.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got you. All right, thanks a lot.","Patrick Fitzgerald","Okay. You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, David, haven\u2019t heard you use a surfing reference before, is that a summer activity?","David N. Farr","No, I was in the North Carolina, I was a young kid, I used to surf, most people didn't realize that, but I'm going to bad news I don't do that anymore. But I used that analogy all the time you don\u2019t get \u2013 if you have ever surfed you get behind that wave, it may hurt when the board hits at top of the head.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Absolutely, on the climate side, may be just expand your comments about the pause and some de-stocking in the residential HVAC side, because you have the OEs areas posting pretty good high single-digit sales this quarter, and just try to reconcile those comments?","David N. Farr","Yeah, if you remember last quarter we had a huge recovery. So we put the product out there we always start using, and then probably make start selling, so we had a very strong second quarter in North America residential, and that so as the OE start obviously integrating that inventory and starting to sell, they slowed that down a little bit. And right now looks to me like things are running reasonably well, we got to back in the strength, a little bit more, we're starting to see some pick up back in the transportation area as well. It took off very rapidly. And how strong we were in the first, second quarter.","Patrick Fitzgerald","It was over 20% North America residential.","David N. Farr","","So we are 20% North America residential in the second quarter. We got a base going one quarter and then they've been digesting it. So if I look at this quarter right now, I'd say we're going to be in mid-single-digit, I think we're in a pretty good right now it looks like that way.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Good. And then just a couple of follow-ups on the embedded power sale maybe take us through decisions about, did you ever looked at selling it in pieces, and is it probably a source or take us through the economics on repatriating that cash?","David N. Farr","Okay. Yes. We didn't look at all in pieces, but from our perspective to give the business a chance, and also to get the best value for our shareholders after a tough couple of years. We felt of doing the total business together that gave enough flexibility to make out a viable company and to grow and make a good return down on the second half of this piece. So, we look at all different ways. We looked obviously strategic and this was a best option for our shareholders.","Relative to repatriation a lot of people from Astec, which I ran. Astec has historically has been a very profitable business even though we've had a tough couple of years here, if you look at the run we still had a slightly positive return on investment, but the last couple of years have been pretty tough and we had some write-offs.","We had a lot of cash in earnings obviously we never repatriated. And so with the transaction like this we have to bring those earnings back, we have to pay taxes on those earnings, and that cash but we are going to bring it back and we're going to bring part of that's going to be going back to our shareholders and that's why - some of them we had no choice, but we have to do that.","Any else to add up Frank?","Patrick Fitzgerald","No, it's clear.","David N. Farr","That's where it is.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","And that was all the cash that would be coming back related to this transaction?","David N. Farr","You've got it.","Deane M. Dray \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr","You're welcome Deane, all the best, you have a good summer.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On industrial automation the margins are holding in pretty well considering the environment. So when things start to pick up, are you going to have add some cost back in infrastructure, how do you feel about incrementals when volume actually start to come back?","David N. Farr","I'm hoping incrementals are pretty good initially, then they continue to grow then we will obviously put some money back into it because we've done a lot of restructuring. But a lot of restructuring was taking out what I'd call excess capacity or repositioning it. And so there was a permanent, obviously we did do some prior call incremental type to restructuring from a standpoint personnel that we have to put back in this business strengthen. But I'm hopping to have good leverage as this business recovers, and get that margin backup. It trades a little bit higher, the good times are here. So I think we can do a little better than and also starting invest in the business plan.","Rich M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And step back on climate. You had a couple of guys OEMs talk about better mix, but they are seeing on the residential side in the U.S. Are you starting to see that in your order flow at all in terms of the mix, have products starting to come through because I know that's been a headwind for a little while now?","David N. Farr","I don't specifically have the knowledge to myself I mean I could find but I don't sense I mean we obviously we had if you look at our profitability of the business it's pretty good. So I would say we probably have reasonable mix this quarter. If I look at the margin we just delivered and we're going to deliver probably records margins of a whole year. But I haven't seen, also difference in mix, if we can get transportation in our commercial business have start taken back up that will be even more positive mix for me.","Rich M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, okay, great. Thank you.","David N. Farr","Thank you Rich. Thanks. All the best to you.","Operator","","The next question is from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Hi, thanks. Yeah just a question on the Network Power decremental margins generally very high and you call out pricing as a reason, is that within just embedded computing or in the past you\u2019ve talked about precision cooling as well.","David N. Farr","Yeah. We saw a couple of pricing excluding the embedded we saw clearly there is a mix going on right now in the type of cooling and we are having to reinvestment in new product line of cooling, which is coming out of different price point and there is going to be some aggressive restructuring as area here as we try to change the cost structure of that business from a cooling stand point, because we are very happy to carry out how to make the capital profitability on the new levels of the cooling.","In addition, we have a mixed price mix relative to some of the shifts we saw in China as that China business weakened slowdown, we saw a little price pressure there but other than that primarily as the cooling side we saw that like you said.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC","","Thanks. And then within the process management, your U.S. sales were down for couple quarters now, but you talk about orders improving. So I just wanted to see what's happening say in the after-market business in the U.S. within process management when do you expect that to start showing up in better or an improvement in revenues there?","David N. Farr","The after-market business in process this year in the U.S. has not been good and the orders have not really that par the order places not to back up yet. And so we had a phenomenal after-market business last year and it looks like a lot of business went in, they're starting to obviously working on installing it.","Based on what I see where we are in a stock right now in North America, I would now expect our after-market close to pick back up this fiscal year, but again, I\u2019d called it wrong last year but I would say right now, it\u2019s going to be small projects and not necessarily after-market business. So, obviously not as margin wise but we still got some good growth out there.","Julian C. H. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, thanks.","David N. Farr","All the best to you Julian.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Hi sorry.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Good afternoon. You mentioned Europe quite a bit and just next year you talked about I guess low single digit or 1%, are you referring to your sales or you referring to like some index of investment there?","David N. Farr","I'm looking at my sales right now. I would say like until we see anything above 2% underlying growth, to say in the investment environment, we'll be in that 1% to 2% range. If you go above 2%, then we'll start seeing a premium to that, but right now I think you're seeing moderate investment growth at the GFI level that means we'll have that moderate growth levels at 1, or 1.5 or 1 in the quarter that's safe to understand.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","And then one \u2013 Dave that's great color. I guess when you think about I guess you talked about emerging markets kind of a mid single-digit growth rate, overtime would you expect to outperform that or is that something that again is kind of referring to what your business can do?","David N. Farr","From my perspective, if we could see a 4% to 5% then we have historically got premium to that into that space. So I would say we won't get the same level of premium when the premium go up to 6%, 7%, 8% that premium gets wider as you know.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Right.","David N. Farr","I would say that we're at 4% or 5% we should get a point or two on top of that.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Okay. And then finally just kind of like, slicing it up this year, I guess a year-to-date your U.S. businesses is growing low single-digits, that's just an average growth rate, just a lot of moving parts there with network power and climate. Ultimately you guys are going to finish I guess in the low single-digits in the U.S. this year, you are reflecting somewhat of a little bit of recovery in resi this year just now booked. Would you expect that to accelerate in the U.S. or you just kind of just a solid and you are just more of a consistent rate of what we've seen this year?","David N. Farr","Our U.S. business should be better next year. It was extremely strong last year U.S. and stronger than last year in U.S. and then weakened I think we saw certain business this tale-off after the strength last year.","I think you are going to see an improvement in both in the U.S. and Europe. I think this next year goes to the material market actually be do a little bit better from a standpoint of underlying growth, that's my gut feel right now Latin America pretty good I think China will be low single-digit next year and I think Asia-Pacific will be high single-digit.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","So, when you say U.S. you know little better does that mean like 3% to 4% some like that or even better than that?","Frank J. Dellaquila","I wouldn't think I would say 3% in the U.S. is a bigger number.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Okay. So that kind of blend you guys into that kind of 2% to 5% range","David N. Farr","I think by tomorrow but I think in my mind, it\u2019s probably 2% to 4%, yeah.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Okay. And one last question, just on the Network Power stuff. So the cooling business you are kind of restructuring that, so does that mean you're restructuring it to make the margin that had made historically or you're restructuring positioning the business to where the volume is and that maybe a lower margin I didn't quite understand what does it mean structurally for that cooling business?","David N. Farr","All right. We are intended to restructure and get the margins we used to making it.","Stephen C. Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan & Co.","Okay, great. Hey thanks a lot for detail. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr","All the best to you. Bye. Next?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi guys. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Andrew.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","As we look at process into 2014 and specifically in North America, how concerned are you guys about ability to do stuff on time given the labor shortages obviously by people who would build this up? Sorry.","David N. Farr","Yeah your dominant skill in selection base.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, right.","David N. Farr","That clearly will hold back, but we haven't seen a problem with it yet I mean I think that probably made the pause this year because of people being working on what they try to work on last year, but we have not seen a problem yet relative to our customer based or our based or even own self having to do these projects yet but it's actually very, very strong growth that's caused that problem at this point in time, so I have not seen that in North America yet.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I am just thinking about capital redeployment be on buyback. I appreciate the focus from smaller deals, but what keeps you away from doing sort of deals over $1 billion and what's the framework there going to next year?","David N. Farr","Nothing keeps you away from that. From a standpoint I have nothing right now that I find worthwhile from the standpoint that make sense for us in the business and strategically and so we can do big deals, we got plenty of capital to do it. It\u2019s just right now nothing is possible so these deals are in $100 million to $400 million levels right now that we're working on, and that's where the focus is right now, but if the right one came along, we will obviously work on it.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","David N. Farr","You're welcome. All the best.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joseph A. Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Joe.","Joseph A. Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","So just piggybacking on Steve's question earlier. He went through some of the regional color for 2014, but what are some other puts and takes we should be thinking about at this point it seems like there would be a tension tailwind, but perhaps some color on price costs and I know that you're spending an incremental, call it $100 million to $120 million in stock comp this year?","Frank J. Dellaquila","Okay. This is Frank speaking Joe. Pension, if the interest rates where they are now when we finish up our year September 30 should be in order magnitude of $50 million pickup next year. With respect to stock comp, another corporate items that's probably in the range of $35 million to $50 million as well, as we come off the overlap year for the stock comp. So we should have some tailwinds next year in those areas.","David N. Farr","Relative to price costs is the point that I get my top seconds coming in. I would say the point of inflection on price cost this year, sometimes in the next quarter or two. We've had a very strong net material inflation environment which has been helpful for us, materials have really dropped and there is some stability around the world and I am talking about, there is some stability around the world. You should start seeing some I would say less negative net material inflation, so we have less benefit there.","The last couple of quarters as we have seen the negative net material inflation come into play, we are starting to see some negative price overall. And so what that tells me now we've had appeared the net material inflation is helping us, a slight negative price is hurting us overall. And we are netting out that we call green.","However, typically what we are watching right now at this point of reflection had happened where this thing is going flip and we go to make sure that we are paying attention to this where the net material inflation will start going other way, the price that you get rid away from, you might get too negative than you go red, which we have seen several years back.","So, right now I'd say Joe we are at a point of inflection for our company, its all hands on desk. Frank and Ed Monty have been talked about this for the businesses. I see it pretty clearly. If it not this quarter, it\u2019s going to be next quarter. And so what we're trying to right now is make sure get ahead of this and make sure we do not go into a red quarter sometime in 2014.","Joseph A. Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's really helpful Dave. And then specifically on that point as it relates to each one of your businesses which business do you think are going to be most impacted by and may be talk through some of the actions that you're taking?","David N. Farr","Clearly on the Network Power side, it\u2019s a short way and have been most negative impacted by that and so we further got to make sure we stay ahead of the net material we got to keep driving that down that net material. Getting embedded power and executing other will help us from the standpoint because they're a little bit more volatile.","The other area that we obviously have to work on very carefully will be the climate technology because of the large metal content in there. So the metal prices have been depressed and so we have to make sure that in our pricing, we look forward and we've had the positive net material inflation and we've been having obviously support that.","Those are two areas and we have to make sure we keep ahead of that from a price point and we just know it\u2019s coming, you have to figure out where you're hedging don't hedging things like that. So there is a lot going on right now as we go into that mode.","Joseph A. Ritchie \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","David N. Farr","All the best Joe.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","John Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity Inc.","Thank you, good afternoon folks.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon John.","John Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity Inc.","First on Network Power, back to Europe in the data center question of, it looks like demand is firming and improving. Can you talk about the competitive situation when you look for growth in the coming quarters there, talk about the split versus organic versus maybe share gains, also I know you get the new precision there, stuffing come out. But just qualify it for us in terms of the competitive growth there?","David N. Farr","It's very hard for us to say when you're losing in a quarter and you don't take long time to see that. So, right now what we're seeing is we're going back into our install base and going back up and upgrade in our install base to spend money. So, I'd say right now, we are going to be reminding the current core space at this point in time. It's hard to say exactly get through this period, do you pick it up or lose, but it's really hard to stay there John from that perspective and I don't from the standpoint I don't break out the individual product line so it's something that I'm not going to do there.","John Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity Inc.","Okay, thanks. And then my last question back to the M&A point for next year and your relative, I guess some of the targets are unattractive here, is it just purely evaluation or some of the good properties are spoken for or just give us a little bit more detail about your thoughts about M&A?","David N. Farr","I mean I think in the larger deal I think the evaluations are over a little too high at this point in time. I think the smaller bolt-on deals where you could actually have a little bit more synergy and there is a lot more flexibility I think that those deals right now are in play and where the large \u2013 kind of expenses at this point in time.","John Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity Inc.","Great. Thank you, David.","David N. Farr","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nigel Cole with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. Hi Dave, how is it going?","David N. Farr","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","","So when you put together your comments about company that is set on CapEx investment so a long time and there is some desire to reinvest and then you put that together with your material comments then it seems a bit more bullish than I guess your GDP type growth forecast for 2014. I guess as you are obviously planning for 2014 right now, are you trying to step up investments entirely for next year?","David N. Farr","I wouldn't say material but our initial investments will be up into the mid 700 range from standpoint of our capital. So right now we're planning if we did around 685 this year I would say our plan to be between 750 to 760 next year.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah and that\u2019s a pretty poor base, would you expect to pickup investments in Europe today?","David N. Farr","Yes, across around the world.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then going back to capital allocation. You mentioned in the PR this morning the $800 million plus run rate for share buyback and $600 million on top of that, so you've always said that next year M&A is going to remain face more both on probably a bit more than we did this year. But is the ambition for next year to do sort of the same level of basis we purchased with top of that?","David N. Farr","So, our plan for the next year as we build the plan, we showed the Board today is that we do somewhere between $800 million, $900 million next year again, ignoring the $600 million. So, this year\u2019s base was $800 million or $900 million, so we expect to do $800 million to $900 million next year plus we're going to do we're going make the special one-time $600 million buyback.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and one more if I can you've talked about the next span issue for the last couple of quarters now. The full key set up is for margins to be I guess inline or actually better than they were was last year 4Q12 was extremely good margin quarter. So I'm wondering how comfortably is that the mix is going to work for you in 4Q and even if it doesn't do you feel you're going nothing in hand from restructuring savings to offset those potential mix headwinds?","David N. Farr","Well, we're planning on that that's where the game plan is right now and I'm hoping that the volumes continues to trend upwards and we've got the power structures in place and typically our fourth quarter we leverage quite nicely. So I say right now we're setup regionally well have a very good profit quarter and good cash flow quarter.","Nigel Cole \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks guys.","David N. Farr","You're welcome. All the best.","Operator","Our next question is a follow up from the line of (inaudible). Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Going back to Industrial Automation you mentioned the continued negative impact of destocking at one of your large customers for alternators, could you give some color here in terms of the extent to which this is impacting your top line this quarter?","David N. Farr","I would not given out specific numbers on this but it's quite significant from the standpoint it's a very large billion dollar plus customers. So we have not, I've never told people how much per quarter per se, but if you look at what they're being doing relative to their inventory levels and they're taking out you can see how much that's impacted but as I said at EPG I think this trend is getting close to reversing and I've expect that as we end this year we're going to next year we'll start seeing some more positive inputs there.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that's great. And as a follow up, just quickly on the drive, the new drive that you launched earlier this year. Is this having any material impact on the P&L as of yet?","David N. Farr","Yeah. I would say the drive business starting to turn and they're very European centric, but right now it's starting it's a profitable business so it's starting to get better and I'd expect 2014 will gain a lot more momentum in that area as those drives take all the industrial drives. So I think that, I'd like the first 12 months of it and it's starting to have a positive impact there and it's starting to turn.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","David N. Farr","You're welcome. All right. Thank you everybody for joining us today. I appreciate it, good questions, and look forward to see everybody in the coming months here and have a good rest of the summer. Be safe. Take care now.

Conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson\u2019s website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.","I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. First quarter sales increased 5% to $5.6 billion, underlying sales growing 6%. Sales trend were mixed across the end market in geographies, but the strongest growth in Process Management driven by robust energy in market and favorable comparisons with the supply chain disruption in the prior year.","Gross margin of 39.7% improved to 100 basis points and EBIT margin expanded 160 basis points, a 13.1%, strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefits offset mix headwinds. Earnings per share of $0.62 increased 24% from the prior year.","Cash generation was strong with free cash flow of 115% to $439 million.

Operating cash flow grew 66% driven by strong earnings and lower working capital growth. Free cash flow was up 115% reflecting 97% conversion from earnings.","Working capital as a percent of sales increase 90 basis points, a strong payable performance lower inventory was more than offset by high receivables.","Next slide business segment earnings. Business segment margin, which reflects $12 million of incremental pension expense, improved a 130 basis point.

Interest was down $4 million and the tax rate was slightly lower then prior year.","Moving to slide seven, Process Management. Process management net in underlying sales increased 24%, U.S. up 26%, Asia up 25%, Europe up 11%, Latin America up 44% and Middle East and Africa 36%.","The oil and gas, chemical and power industries continued strong growth particularly in Asia where orders grew 11% in the quarter. Segment margin expanded 520 basis points, a strong volume leverage and cost reduction benefit offset less favorable project mix especially in the US. The near-term outlook remains solid supported by energy and market strength and high backlog.","Next slide, industrial automation. Industrial automation reported sales decline of 7% and underlying sales decreased 6% with the U.S. down 7%, Asia down 7%, Europe down 9%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Global demand for industrial goods remained anemic which was particularly pronounced in the power generating alternators business. Business continued in the electrical drives and industrial motors business as well, which was partially offset by solid growth in the hermetic motors business.","Segment margin declined 40 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage. Industrial automation\u2019s cost structure is well positioned for the expectation for continued sluggish demand for industrial capital goods in the near term.","Moving to slide nine, Network Power. Network power reported an underlying sales decline of 2%, U.S. flat, Asia down 3%, Europe down 8%, Latin America up 8%, and Middle East and Africa down 2%. Softness continued in global telecommunications and IT end markets, especially in Europe. AC power systems were strong in the U.S. and Latin America, and sales were flat in the embedded computing and power business. Segment margin declined to 7.2% as volume deleverage and unfavorable mix more than offset cost reduction benefits. Order trends have started to improve, supported by telecommunication infrastructure investments and we expect solid margin expansion in 2013.","Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies reported sales grew 2% and underlying sales increased 3%, the US up 1%, Asia up 7%, Europe up 2%, Latin America down 4%, and Middle East and Africa up 32%. Strong growth in Asia benefited from improved residential air-conditioning end-markets particularly in China and US growth reflected more favorable conditions in residential end-markets as well. Global refrigeration demand remains weak particularly transportation. Segment margin declined 20 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable mix from the residential growth. We expect demand to remain steady in the near-term from continued recovery of residential end markets in the U.S. and Asia.","Moving to slide 11, Commercial and Residential Solutions. Commercial and residential solutions reported sales declined 1% while underlying sales grew 4% as the Knaack business unit divestiture deducted 5%. By region, the US was up 7%, Asia down 2%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 6%, and Middle East and Africa down 14%.","U.S. residential end markets continue to remain steady led by robust growth in the food waste disposers business. Segment margins improved 30 basis points, benefiting from the Knaack divestiture and cost reductions. The recovery in North America residential end markets is expected to continue in the near-term.","Finally, in slide 12, 2013 detailed outlook. We reported the underlying sales to grow 2% to 5% due to margin expansion up 10 to 20 basis points despite pension and stock compensation headwinds, and earnings per share growth of 4% to 7%. We also expect strong operating cash flow growth of 8% to 11%.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much Pat. First I want to thank everyone for joining us today, and I appreciate your time. And also looking forward to our Investor Conference, next Monday and Tuesday in Columbus, Ohio where we\u2019re going to share a lot more information relative to our business segments and also some of the impact into our Network power systems business.","Also want to thank all of the Emerson employees around the world for their excellent performance and a strong execution in our first fiscal quarter. Obviously the first fiscal quarter is always very important relative to delivering the full year. Last year that we really struggled with the supply chain issue, but this year performance is greatly improved and on track to delivering what I think in a very strong exceptional 2013 in all levels.","As we look at the global economy today and the environment around the world, we did slightly better than 60 days ago, but still below trend line and still not a typical recovery that you would see from the typical economies that we state and serve around the world.","We\u2019ll talk more about that next week, but fundamentally the trend is positive, but the trend is not going to be a short recovery and I think that clearly strategic investments can be very, very important to drive growth again, as we move into 2013 and 2014.","I also want to remind people out there, that Emerson presents GAAP numbers, which means that we include all pension costs, all impairment of intangible amortization and our performance share stock programs and the consolidated numbers represent GAAP numbers.","Also I want to make sure people understand in the business segment, we include the pension costs and goodwill amortization and other businesses which is also a very appropriate given they are making investment and those employees are creating the business well for it\u2019s shareholders going forward. So I feel it\u2019s very appropriate that we hold them accountable for those costs and delivering the profit improvements across those business segments.","We will be funding our pension plan again this year at $150 million level, about the same number we funded last year. And I think that\u2019s very appropriate given what\u2019s going on around the world in a low interest rate environment and to make sure that we keep our pension plan, which is not a huge cause in line to what I think is appropriate for the employees that have built this company over 130 years.","Again I\u2019m looking forward to our investor conference next week. We have a lot of interesting things to share you, the time to spend with the management team and to talk about what\u2019s going on across this company and the exciting opportunities that we see as we move into 2013 and 2014.","And one last point before I open up for Q&A, I want to remind the inventors as I said on the last conference call, remind the investors as I said in the last conference call that 70% to 80% of our earnings this year, EPS delta will occur in the first half. 70% to 80% of our earnings delta will occur in the first half. We just did the first quarter, a delta $0.12, pretty easy to calculate what the second quarter should be in the range of.","Now with that, I\u2019ll open up the phone line to make sure that we answer some of the interesting questions. But also I will not get into a lot of great detail about the business segments now, because we\u2019ll be doing that in Columbus next week on Monday and Tuesday. We shared with you more detail on that one page of the financial chart that we normally would give you at the conference, but I thought you should have that as you finalize the numbers coming out on our first quarter and look into your own models for the investors out there for the whole year. And now I have to wait until the next week. So that's what we gave you that one page with all the detailed information in there, so you can factor that into your own financial models.","With that, I open up the lines. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks a lot. Yes, so first I guess just on the more positives that were heard throughout last year, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about what's driven that if it\u2019s something you\u2019re seeing in the January order intake or something in a specific region?","David N. Farr","","As we\u2019ve been reporting in monthly orders, we've been little bit more positive on the monthly order statements for the last couple of months. Since September, October our order trends have turned up in some of the businesses now in climate technologies, network product systems, residential solutions that have all now become a positive and driving a continuing basis on a three-month role. So from my perspective it's been improving, I would say moderate amount of improvement from that standpoint, but just a global economies at stabilize and feel more comfortable for the financial institutions, and I think money is again flowing and people are starting to make those investment. Though it\u2019s not a real robust economic environment out there, just look what happen on an average in the second half of the United States economy. And so in total, it\u2019s still basically you\u2019re looking about 2%, 3% top the growth. And we'll get into the various regions that we are on next week. But I still see 2%, 3%, 4% ROI and growth in the general economic trend that we'll be facing this year.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks. And then just secondly, the issue of kind of mix comes up a lot in the slides in the different segments, and how that affects your margin? How do you see that playing at over the balance of the year? I guess, as you emphasize the margin growth is very front-end loaded, is that because there\u2019s mix or something you think will carry on weighing on the margins over the balance of the year?","David N. Farr","Now Julian, I think from my perspective, our business in particular Process business or the Climate business or the Residential Solutions business in a given month or quarter, we could have a surge of sales, shipment from the standpoint of the systems, versus our intimidation. I would say the last three quarters not most recent quarter, last three quarters we've had pretty good mix, and from last year as a profitability from these businesses things went our way, and so climate will have down sales last year we had pretty good mix from the type of business. And therefore they had to improve on profitability.","Same thing with Process, you look at the underlying quarter process had a very, very strong systems and solutions, orders and shipments in the quarter, intimidation a little bit weaker driven the process came in quite strong, a lot of that will create a lower margin in the process world.","Same thing in the Climate Technologies, we expect that mix to come back as we look at our order books right now, we look at the order pace. I would expect that margin to come back that's why we still believe that we will have 10 to 20 basis points improvement consolidated. And I will give you the business margins by each of the segments, the forecast next week, but it's not in common, you hear me talk, we will have a quarter the mix goes the wrong way, quarter goes the right way, and I would say we had good margin improvement this quarter, it could have been better with the right mix, but we will make that back up as we go into that second quarter, it just moves around, that\u2019s what happened.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it thanks. And then just lastly just\u2026","David N. Farr","Yeah.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then lastly, just quickly on the Network Power specifically, the decremental margins have been pretty severe in the last six months, is that again mostly kind of just mix related?","Frank J. Dellaquila","It\u2019s mix related and we expect that will start turning here, it is starting to turn as we see that business starting to recover as I expect that will continue to improve now as we move into the year in the second quarter, yes.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much Julian.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hi, good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Mike.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Could you elaborate a bit more on the comments that are expecting the Asian orders to gain momentum and in particular, what\u2019s your visibility like in front of the Chinese New Year?","David N. Farr","Well, we have pretty good visibility. We are doing business a long time, we see the order pay this, I mean it\u2019s on the business as well, we will not have a good couple of weeks before the Chinese New Year then it will come back. Clearly every year the Chinese New Year just comes out a different time. We just came Ed, Mark and I just came back from an Asia trip talking versus this couple of months ago. You are seeing a recovery now in China, pretty broad across all of our businesses, early cycle guys have already started coming into the play. I would say what you will see for our businesses right now is a recovery will start happening in the second half for the more the industrial Network Power systems and process and client will go earlier and starting to move right now.","So that visibility is pretty good relative to order pace and just what\u2019s happening, so we feel good about that, same thing in India, we see that recovery going on right now. The one market, I think it\u2019s going to be weaker for us this year will be Australia, because of huge investment in the last couple of years. But overall visibility right now in China, India, Southeast Asia pretty good. The order book is pretty good, and I think that we\u2019ll progress things will get better assuming the economic progression continues to happen as it is, we\u2019ll get better as the year progresses. I think you\u2019re going to see in the second half that really get better, much better.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. And you also called that in a press release, a negative margin mix in process from the lack of higher-margin maintenance type projects. Is that already in the results this quarter or\u2026?","David N. Farr","Yeah.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. So we saw that impact?","David N. Farr","You mean what happen is with a lot of discussion and I was just talking to Julia a few minutes ago same thing. In a quarter, we have things up. Clearly the MRO business, which have been extremely strong and North, South America for us prior to last quarter with \u2013 people got a little nervous about what was being discussed and concerned about the U.S. economy. So they really pull back a little bit, and I would expect as we go forward, you will see that term lose, but that make that\u2019s already build in the quarter. That\u2019s a pretty quick MRO as a pretty quick type of situation for us.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Thank you.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Thanks and good afternoon. So you took up the top line, you held at the top end of the top line, you held EPS, maybe just describe a little bit of your thinking on that front?","David N. Farr","I think from my perspective, we just looking at the general mix and I\u2019m not getting carried away with my earnings forecast.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay, all right. And this process\u2026","David N. Farr","I barely grown my spin back from what you guys said to be last year. You\u2019ll see it\u2019s been grafted on just want to say, how it grew it a little bit.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","All right, but I\u2019m sure just as handsome as always.","David N. Farr","I wouldn\u2019t go that far.","","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Is process fully caught up with the backlog?","David N. Farr","Oh yes, it caught up pretty well much last year, if you push and shove last year, it's hard to track, but by the time you finish it was there, it might be a (inaudible) there.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","So now you're just in a natural demand shipping mode then?","David N. Farr","Correct. Yes exactly right, projects moving in and out and things like that, and the key thing for me right now to be honest is the last gentlemen asked that question on the MRO, it\u2019s North America that is, we need that to come back a little bit, people I think were a little bit cautious in the first three months, and I'm hoping as we get into this deep into the second quarter, we\u2019ll start seeing that MRO business activity comes in. If you remember correctly, we grew over 20% last year in North America and process and so the question is to get to digest some of that, maybe the first six months this year could be kind of slow, that's what we are watching carefully right now.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay and then just on receivables maybe a quick comment on just the higher level this quarter?","David N. Farr","we are still versus last year, we are still catching up, we did way headway relative to the receivables we got at the end of the fiscal year, we will continue to make headway here as we go forward, part of the receivable delta is about, a third of it is basically prepayment from the large projects, and basically that's good thing, I mean we got large projects coming down the road in Network Power systems, and also process so that creates the balance sheet as you force, but that's a good sign, but we are making good head way, we had good cash flow, I feel very good about the cash flow this year, and if we have a strong second quarter we will start record year in cash flow in 2013.","Steven E. Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay see you next week thanks.","David N. Farr","See you there, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray \u2014 Citi Investment Research","Thank you, good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Deane.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Hey David, you don't often talk about Hermetic Motors but maybe give us some color about the HVAC market there and how does that relate to the compressor side and how the inventories look?","David N. Farr","Well, our Hermetic motor goes in every compressor we sell. So and that we basically will cap the business here, and from that standpoint you saw in the quarter, our Climate Technology business did grow and we had a good record orders. Our Climate Technology orders are above the line as we say, and I expect then we see the January numbers would be above the line. I do know in January they had another good global order books, so from my perspective Climate Technology had turned, and we had two top years after one really strong year and I expect them to have a good growth in 2013 and 2014, we\u2019ll talk about it. We maintained our investments in a big way in that Climate Technology area and we're going to start seeing some pay back in that and I think in 2013 and 2014, I'm very positive about that right now.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","How do you feel about the compressor inventory in the channel today?","David N. Farr","Well. And I don't think by the way I think they expect us to serve them without rebuilding compressor inventory. I don't think they're going to rebuild the inventory, I think they expect us \u2013 we\u2019ve shipped within days. They expect us to rotate, move round change your lines and go. So I don't worry about that too much, but I just put the way just of all.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Good to hear. And then any comment, update on the sale of embedded power, how is the process?","David N. Farr","We\u2019ll talk about next week, but it\u2019s moving forward and the documentation will be going out to a select group of people and it is a process I would say looking at calendar year, I don't want to rush. I mean we\u2019re into this right and but its moving forward. And the business had a good quarter, and I think they\u2019re going to have a very good second quarter.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Great, thank you.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Jeff. Good to hear you. Haven\u2019t seen you a long time, hope you\u2019re doing well.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Doing well. See you next week in my home state.","David N. Farr","Ohio was your home state?","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yeah, you never knew that.","David N. Farr","No, I did know that. So you\u2019re a big guy.","","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I know.","David N. Farr","You didn\u2019t go to the Ohio state, did you?","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","No, I did not. I wish I would.","David N. Farr","Good, that\u2019s good, I can talk to you again now, I won\u2019t catch you up next.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","So a question on process.","David N. Farr","Yeah.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","You characterized the backlog as strong, although it seems like orders have softened and you\u2019ve had that huge revenue surge. Is the actual physical backlog strong or just what we see coming in the pipeline kind of didn\u2019t propose a work, any color you could share there?","David N. Farr","I would say both the physical is very strong, and the pipeline is very strong. One of the things and somebody asked me the question earlier, you know we raised the top line a little bit. Sales growth, we\u2019re going to have the currency that\u2019s going to help us with this year, finishes, and that does not give you a lot of margin as you now. So that\u2019s one of the reasons why as we said that earlier that we look at that, the dollar definitely right now is a little bit weaker and therefore it helps us, but we don\u2019t get a lot of earnings out of that. The backlog from the same point of the process is still at record levels, maybe not quite as high that was (inaudible) below September and the pipeline that we see is very, very strong around the world. Not a lot of \u2013 I hear about delays out there to other people, we have not had a lot of delays. The short-term impact to us has been more than North America MRO businesses, those guys slowed down a little bit and that is digesting all they did last year, but right now it looks pretty good. I expect to have a good second quarter. We\u2019re coming off very \u2013 I mean, we grew 50-50, and we added $1 billion a year for two years, those are big numbers. And so we still expect a solid single digit growth in the process sales this year, sales in single digit and I expect pretty good profitability out of them.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Are you seeing kind of the downstream kind of more gas driven I guess, below and gas driven projects moving forward on people\u2019s drawing boards, you think there is delays there?","David N. Farr","Right now, we are not seeing delays. The projects are moving forward. We are bidding on, we are winning them. That\u2019s going to help it as the year progresses and as we move into 2014, in particular North America, the oil and gas downstream projects are enormous and that\u2019s why I am so excited about trying to get the pipelines open, why I believe in having natural gas shipping, even exploring natural gas, we need to have that natural gas flowing out there to make those investments happen. I just came back from South Africa, this is India and we are all seeing the downstream numbers coming both around the world and then also here in North America, which I am pretty good excited about.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And maybe just finally, any thoughts on kind of M&A versus share REPO, you started kind of lean into the share REPO a little bit more here, what\u2019s the thought for the year, any change?","David N. Farr","No change. I expect share repurchase to be in the 600 million to 800 million range. No changes at that point in time, pretty much in line what we did last year. At this point in time, we will talking next week, I do not see any big, big acquisitions. I expected to spend somewhere around $400 million, $500 million this year. When I look at the quality of assets out there, that\u2019s not very high at this point in time and therefore we are going to generate very high levels of cash, we will pay the dividend, we will buy share repurchase and keep our balance sheet ready to go for an acquisition, but right now it\u2019s going to be both. We are going to be passing backlogs, as 50% of our tax to our shareholders in 2013.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Great, thanks. I'll see you next week.","David N. Farr","See you next week Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","All right, good afternoon guys.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Scott.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","I want to go back and talk a little bit about the drives and the motors business, so I mean I think there was a new product launch that you guys were doing. I just can\u2019t recall the timing and how that may be impacting results, can you update us there?","David N. Farr","We will talk again about this next week, but the new drives are coming out there, they are being under, we\u2019re starting to take orders. Our motors and drives business right now is being negatively impacted by the strength in Europe, we are very, very strong in Europe and that's been a tough marketplace. But the new drive launch is going, it\u2019s going to be very positive, and it's going to expand our serve market. I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll start seeing that impact more in the second half of 2013, in particular in 2014. It started therefore we typically have a lag of people wait, the new drives. So with the European slowdown and that product launch it is pretty predictable that we would have about \u2013 I would say about five, six quarter slow down. That\u2019s where we\u2019re right now.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks. And it looks like embedded had a pretty good quarter and it\u2019s a positive surprise versus, I think most of the supplier expecting it to continue to believe down for the year, I mean is this kind of low water mark, you said this quarter, I expect to have another quarter, and how do you, and since you\u2019re just talking about revenues, what about profits, are margins picking up there?","David N. Farr","Yeah, they've gone through enormous restructuring. My hats off to Jay and his team here. I mean first of all we announced that we\u2019re going to sell, that's hard to do. We took out a lot of what I call deadwood business. We\u2019ve got two things going on the customer base like Dell, HP, guys like that, those are few things going out there. And you know from my perspective it looks to me like the order pace is actually turned up, you can't see that yet. We will shelf this next week. I think we\u2019ll actually show you a curve. And here we\u2019ll see that the true curve for, embedded has actually started to turn up, it\u2019s still negative, but it\u2019s getting, I think it might cross the line really soon. So I expect growth to start happening and I expect profitability to improve.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay that's great.","David N. Farr","","It\u2019s actually still low single-digit. I mean we\u2019re talking pretty low margin business here.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. That all I have. Thanks guys.","David N. Farr","","Thank you. See you next week.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Good afternoon guys.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Hey Dave so what about your own CapEx, I mean it was down a little bit year-over-year in the quarter. You are talking about taking it up a little bit, but not a lot for the year. What are you looking for to sort of losing the pulse strings a little bit with your own capital spending, what would you need to see?","David N. Farr","Serious top line growth and growth speaks investment on the world, which we haven\u2019t seen. I mean, you haven\u2019t seen it at all. And our forecast is for this year global GFI will probably be up somewhere around 3%, 4%, 5%. And we can cover most of that, a lot of that with productivity. So I mean, I expect us to have a little bit increase, will be, it\u2019s declined a bit, as it continues to trend nicely and other business come along. We can only increase as it goes down. We have the catch, but I\u2019m just going to be very careful mitering out that, that capacity that we don\u2019t need, until we need it. So that\u2019s what (inaudible) me. We\u2019re running at around $700 million, which is not a bad number. And I think it\u2019s going stay that way if we got the opportunity to grow, let\u2019s say the growth start to coming up nice, then you\u2019d see us, may be take that up a little bit. But right now, I think the growth rate we\u2019re looking at were in pretty good shape.","","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Okay. And then just in terms of thinking about Network Power margin improvement through the year, I mean, some of the pickup in orders recently has been in telecom, which is in quite as favorable mix as data center might be. I mean are you, I think you thought the mix would get a little better from here, but is it mix or is it the restructuring benefits from last year falling. So how do we think about what drives the margin improvement for the year in Network Power?","David N. Farr","Well, you guys see the restructuring kick-in and we\u2019re also starting to see some of the better mix of products. The telecom business is, yes, is improving. But the other parts of the business is starting to have pretty good standpoint. The other issues, in the first half of the first quarter particularly last year, our China Network Power Systems business was extremely strong that\u2019s a very profitable business for us.","And it really start tailing off last year, including this quarter here and the quarter we just finished that business order pace is starting to pick back up the mix, it starting to pick back up. So I\u2019d expect this as getting the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter that business going to help us and that will help us mix up, and also grow. So there are couple of things that are starting to kick in the gear that will be really help us as we get into that second half of the year.","I keep reminding everyone, we have 78% of our earnings per share in the first six months for the region, we had record, record levels of last year. So those mix is going to come and help us, but I want a driver, most of our earnings opportunity is really in the first half and we got hit last year with the Thailand flood situation. So, things are starting to mix right way for us.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr","Thank you, see are you going to make it?","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Yeah, I\u2019ll be there. Thanks.","David N. Farr","Promise?","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Yeah, I\u2019ll be there. Thanks.","David N. Farr","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks good afternoon Dave.","David N. Farr","Hello Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah. And so by the way your comments on GAAP earnings are well taken?","David N. Farr","Just one point, I mean a lot of people (inaudible) segment were GAAP.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right, okay.","David N. Farr","Our pension cost down the businesses and they don\u2019t like it, but that\u2019s where the cost is and we also push the amortization and we did acquisition and I expect them to recover.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","So there is certainly a drift we got in the sector. So just interesting in your comments on China, you definitely called the recovery fairly early in 2013, but I think you have been quite skeptical about the sustainability of the growth beyond 2013, do you still feel that way?","David N. Farr","We will talk about it next week. I have a lower growth expectation in China for \u201814 and \u201815, though I still expect it to grow a very solid single digit. I like the way they are unfolding this, to be honest and I do \u2013 I think they are not trying to fine the pump way too fast, I like what they are doing right now, they are being very measured and I like some of the actions being taken by the new leadership team. And so right now, based on \u2013 and I will be going back over there early in March.","I am very encouraged by what I see right now and if that continues for the next three or four months, then I will feel better about that \u201814 and \u201815, but right now we are going to have a pretty good recovery here as year progresses in \u201813 for sure.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then on India, I think it fits on to positive comment in India, so at least a year and half to two years, so just wondering what you are seeing over there right now?","David N. Farr","The current election.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Same as the U.S. I guess. And then","David N. Farr","They are going to put money out. India has been a tough place for the last couple of years. I think 2013, maybe in the first part of 2014 for us will be okay, then I get concern again, but right now they are prime and pump and there might be in the stand and I look at my order pays, that wasn\u2019t great in the first quarter, but I look at what\u2019s going on, the activity, the bookings and I see India will get better as the year progresses.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. And then a question for Frank perhaps, the corporate expense, just the one (inaudible) this quarter, is that a good run rate for the full year?","David N. Farr","Franco?","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Frank there?","David N. Farr","He is laughing. Yeah, go head.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","The corporate expense was just 1.20 or so this quarter, is that a good run rate for the full year?","Frank J. Dellaquila","No, that is going to ramp up as we go through the year because the overlap and the performing shares is just going to be more back-loaded.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, great that's fantastic, see you next week.","David N. Farr","Good thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi good afternoon Dave.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon Rich.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Have you moved to St. Louis or you are still on \u2013 where are you located?","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","I'm in Baltimore.","David N. Farr","Baltimore?","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah.","David N. Farr","I thought your headquarters is here in St. Louis, what are you doing on Baltimore?","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","We got a bunch of different locations.","David N. Farr","But your headquarters is in San Francisco?","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","David N. Farr","Are you part of this St. Louis okay I just wonder where you were hanging out these days, so you're actually working so I can report your boss, you are actually working.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yes you can do that for me.","David N. Farr","I clearly noticed noted that Rich is working, when I see your boss, is that all right? (Inaudible) did you?","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","No I did not. Quick one on the macro China, I think last year when you gave initial guidance you said China for you would be up 5% to 10% in '13, and when I\u2019ve seen the presentation you have a GFI expectation of 6% to 7%, and that assumes maybe growth on multiple over GFI, for you but I mean is that 5% to 10% changed or is that your potential room for upside later in the year depending what you see.","David N. Farr","Right now my answer to be no change if it unfold the way I\u2019m seeing it unfold we could probably have some upside, but right now it's too early to say from my perspective because I think that the changes we are seeing in China are just starting to happen, as you know I try to be very open and I see this and I feel better about it, and I'll be back there in 30 days. So if I walk away and see better about, the answer will be yes, we should be a little bit better as we more like towards the 10%. But we\u2019ve got to sort of get in there first.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, understood. And then just looking at the euro assumption here going forward?","Frank J. Dellaquila","We\u2019ve been basically looking, I mean around 130, 132 and that was obviously 135, but that\u2019s why part of the raised, guy who said earlier. But we\u2019re already talking about 130 originally in the plan and now we\u2019re now it\u2019s up a little bit.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Currency\u2026","Frank J. Dellaquila","Currencies are helping us in the second half. I mean we will not have much currency impact in the second quarter, but it\u2019s going to start ramping up to add over point in this third and fourth quarter.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. But you\u2019re not assuming the spot rate for the rest of the year, 135, you\u2019re assuming 132?","Frank J. Dellaquila","I mean, right now, I raised a little bit for like 135.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","Frank J. Dellaquila","Second half of the year, yeah.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Say at 135, okay.","Frank J. Dellaquila","That\u2019s one of the reasons there\u2019s a five and similar thing there as well.","","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah, yeah. Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thanks.","Frank J. Dellaquila","See you and welcome. Okay, thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Inch with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, David.","David N. Farr","Hello, John.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. So Europe kind of continues to disproportionately drag your ops, this quarter seem to hit industrial automation network power, are you seeing these markets begin to inflect perhaps more possibly any aspect of this, and I know there are a lot of structuring there, I mean presumably when you start to get some of these volumes, these margins could ramp back at pretty high incremental, is that a fairer statement or maybe we should be thinking about it somewhat differently, how do you think about it?","David N. Farr","I think we can get, we have a reasonable level growth. One or two points, the growth aren\u2019t a lot of ramp to a factory, all of sudden, I feel better about Europe today than I did 60 days ago. So I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we don\u2019t grow our European business doesn\u2019t grow in the second quarter. So what I think they will get the significant margin improvement in Europe, you got to get about 5% underlying growth for us. I mean at 2%, 3%, 4%, that\u2019s not enough to really ramp at margin, but if you start getting up above that 5% with a restructuring underway, we should see a pretty good margin improvement and that will help us obviously in our overall business, but that\u2019s where you have to get it. I don\u2019t have a forecast that Europe is going to grow 4% or 5%. So I think that\u2019s kind of the growth you need to see and I don\u2019t see that happening for a while.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","But does Europe forecast assume, it not seeing better in the second half, I wonder?","David N. Farr","Yeah. We assumed our European business starts to have growth. And like I said, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, we don\u2019t have growth in the second quarter. But it\u2019s going to be moderate growth, probably like ones you choose, which is not a whole lot of incremental volume. Right now when there is no growth and there is negative growth that you deleverage pretty hard with cost reductions, because you have cost inflation there, but with the \u2013 you get above that 2%, 3%, I start feeling better when you get about 5% that really feels good. But right now I think we are talking about once you choose this as business recovers in the second half.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That make sense. I\u2019m going to say the European strategy questions for next week, but I did want to ask you about China restructuring. You called out I think a year ago, you planned, so auto making China and as you are seeing these markets turn out the only company that\u2019s done this. Does that suggest from a similar question to Europe, does that suggest as China comes back, which presumably can back a lot more forcefully than Europe that your margins there in terms of contribution benefit do much better than they have historically?","David N. Farr","The answer is yes, they should. If we got the restructuring and the automation done properly in the right location, we are pretty profitable in China already, but it should help us be more profitable and more competitive.","So from my perspective, I think profitability we're talking about this, I think we have room to go in this cycle on profitability. This year we've got a couple of things, we have to overcome, and we're working our way through that in the pension standpoint, and then also from the performance shares and amortization, but we'll work through that. And then if don't, we don\u2019t add any additional costs, you're going to see us continue to leverage quite nicely. So I feel good about upward mobility and profitability to get into that 2014, 2015 range. And that's what I\u2019m going to tell you we are going to be setting pretty good margins in 2014 and 2015.","John G. Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right, thank you. See you next week.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon. How are you doing. You would be there next week, Steve?","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","I will.","David N. Farr","Good.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Not sure I have heard the term handsome used on a conference call before, but there is always something...","David N. Farr","Borrowing your red sweater from last year...","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","I got a black one.","David N. Farr","You\u2019ve got a back at Columbus, I will wear black too then we\u2019ll look like twins or something like that Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hi, it's to recognize the profitability of the embedded power?","David N. Farr","Okay. Hey you are a very dark guy.","Frank J. Dellaquila","Jay, so ignore what he just said there, Jay.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, just a question\u2026","Frank J. Dellaquila","I understand you with this recent with climate guys, did you harass them or will you good to him?","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","No, I didn\u2019t meet with the Head of the Business, that is kind of kicked around, and that was met with the Goodman guys, the LG guys, and carrier guys, all the big guys. So just on process management there's a lot of noise in the numbers here. What was the \u2013 again the ultimate tailwind I guess year-over-year from Thailand this quarter?","Frank J. Dellaquila","I mean it\u2019s hard to measure, because it\u2019s now in counties up in number. But when I look at the overall for the total Emerson, you\u2019re looking the underlying growth rate was applying to 1% to 2% range.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay.","Frank J. Dellaquila","And so how I look at it, I mean that we\u2019ve tried to keep track but it\u2019s impossible to say what you\u2019ve didn\u2019t ship in a quarter or first six months of the year and what we ship back I mean is \u2013 I did not want to create an accounting nightmare of this. But this is sort of our \u2013 we looked at and so on and so forth. So obviously we did grow 24% underlying in the core of the process, but there is still very solid in the quarter.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Yeah, so then you said it\u2019s going to be mid single digits for the year, Europe 24% I guess your orders are kind of comping flattish right now. Will there be a quarter this year with the touch comp in the back half where the process is negative?","David N. Farr","Right now we don\u2019t see it. When I\u2019m talking for the year, I would say that we\u2019re going to be up somewhere between I\u2019m saying 6% to 8% and right now we do not see \u2013 they get real flat. Frank give me the details of progresses. They get real flat by the fourth quarter. So if they had a bump in the fourth quarter, you could have a top line underlying negative fixed rate, then they are going to get currency of them too.","So I would say the one result here right now is the fourth quarter that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on the 7% to 8%, because we had a \u2013 as you well know very strong fourth quarter\u2019s things clicked in and the reductions in the sales and stuff like that. And so I get little bit nervous about our fourth quarter. From a profit standpoint, growth standpoint was a phenomenal quarter last year. But I think that would be the one quarter I\u2019ll be worried about the process.","","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And the margin there I mean again a very strong second half, you had stuff that we\u2019re shipping, we did have kind of an unusual benefit to the margin, I mean it didn\u2019t lower from an incremental perspective, you\u2019re still 35% to 40% incremental there in the back half.","David N. Farr","Yeah.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Which is pretty damn good but kind of normal, so is there any weird comp on the margin that we have to think about in the second half of at process?","Frank J. Dellaquila","I think Process had a phenomenon looking EBIT margin, they had a phenomenal; their EBIT margin in the second half was close to 23.5% and if I read this correct. And so I see yeah, so we\u2019re rightly going on forward here is that they\u2019re going to trend towards, they\u2019re basically from an EBIT standpoint, they were round 20% last year, and I expect them maybe slightly higher than that to a whole year, and clearly, they need to make good margin in the first half from an EBIT standpoint. And then they\u2019re going to struggle for a comparison\u2019s standpoint in the second half.","So that\u2019s why, I watch him right now, I would expect them to be down in the second half in EBIT margins, and up significantly in the first half. The other thing we had in there last year the best that we can tell probably about $40 million of costs, when we made the decision to protect our customer base at all costs, we\u2019ve spent a lot of money to do that and we haven\u2019t overcome that $40 million this year. And so a lot of that going to work our way of it. Right now, in first half, good margins, second half, I think to be down slightly to the whole year there will be up slightly.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Got you and then on the Network Power\u2026","Frank J. Dellaquila","Should we have forecast of that\u2019s pretty quick, you want me to do it for you?","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","And then on the Network Power ramp that you guys are expecting, I mean you said it\u2019s going to be up year-over-year, but we\u2019re obviously starting from a whole down 100 bps this quarter, I mean you kind of snapped back last year, I think you averaged 30% to 40% sequential incremental, a little above or around the line, but anyway, I mean should we think about last year as the appropriate sequential from a market perspective or is it little more back end weighted or how do we think about the network?","David N. Farr","I want to see these guys to be honest, on an EBIT standpoint, I want to see them close to 10% in that second quarter. Now they don\u2019t want to hear that, but that\u2019s where I want to see them. And then you are going to start moving up from there on a sequential basis like we did last year. So maybe if you go 10, you go 12, then you are going 14, 15 stuff in the fourth quarter. So that\u2019s based on how I expect them to see that unfold, but I really would hope they are going to get close. They may not get quite 10 in the second quarter, but they are going to be closer to 10 than they are 5.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, so that\u2019s almost 300 basis point increase sequentially?","David N. Farr","Well, (inaudible) so if you can \u2013 I am hoping to get to above nine and close to 10, that\u2019s where I like to see, yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","David N. Farr","I feel that, that\u2019s how we have to move it. Again, our first and second quarter, we have going on right now and you\u2019ve been around a long time, you watched us. We have different segments of our business starting to ship into play here as I always refer to them horses. And climate shift upfront now, I have got Pat Sly\u2019s business, Residential and I have got Network Power systems and Network Power starting to improve. The sales are going to be down slightly, probably in the second quarter still, as we rake off, but they are going to start improving to positive growth in that third and fourth. But I still feel with cost reductions and the right mix that we should have a better second quarter than we had first quarter profitability.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, thank you.","David N. Farr","So only network power guys out there be thinking about that.","C. Stephen Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks.","David N. Farr","You are welcome. See you next week.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten from Longbow Securities, please go ahead.","David N. Farr","Hi, how are you doing friend.","Eli S. Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Not too bad and yourself.","","David N. Farr","Not too bad. Again nice to meet you today, it can be kind of brutal on me.","Eli S. Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","If I got to survive next week I got to be nice know that.","David N. Farr","Well I got plenty of guns I'll bring next week, so I am protecting myself.","Eli S. Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","Just a quick question, I mean we listened to the evening call earlier today and they were sort of talking, bragging, they said they decided to (inaudible) but they've gotten a lot of work, there is going to be a lot of wind. Is there anything going on in the dynamics of that marketplace? You know, you can claim that, they had a bunch of wins now or is it just the timing in peculiar for certain contact?","David N. Farr","","It's just the timing, I think the marketplace is really stable right now and I think we I could talk, I could brag a couple of wins to. So I don't feel worried about at all. I think right now we'll present you guys next year I think we have very strong hand and recovery plan underway and so network power systems orders are green, they are above the line and that's a good sign. So I feel good about where we are right now. We are on a good progression there and I want to share next week how we\u2019re building this business and how we are going to make this a very strong value creator for our Emerson shareholders going forward.","Eli S. Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","And with climate beginning to trend one other big complaints we hear from the English, or the people who are involved in that part of business, is the adverse shift down where to lower share products that's continuing and not changing. Is there anything going on in the market place or anything you have to do to reflect the big change that seems to be going on and it looks like it's almost, it\u2019s semi-permanent at this point of business.","David N. Farr","","We created the product for the product here, our analog performance tougher product but what we have is a pretty broad offering between both from residential up to the commercial to the transportation. So we have a broader offering capability than something like an IR. So I don\u2019t think that \u2013 we\u2019re still running pretty good relative to profitability I expect us to run record levels to profitability this year, even with a mix that we\u2019re going to, I think residential were to be very strong, but you\u2019re going to see a good story. Where our things have taken off and that\u2019s what is making in the cost reductions that will show that we will have again a pretty good growth year, and coming back, and then also we would have some good profitability. So I think we deal with the mix every day that weaken our business and we work (inaudible).","Eli S. Lustgarten \u2013 Longbow Securities","All right, enough. See you next week.","David N. Farr","","See you next week. With that, I want to thank everybody. I\u2019m looking forward to see you next week and again thanks for joining us here today and thanks.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today, November 3, 2015.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most and recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead, sir.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Caroline. Today I'm joined by Dave Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will available on the website for the next 90 days.","I will start with the fourth quarter and fiscal year summary on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 15% to $5.8 billion with underlying sales down 7%. Net sales for the fiscal year decreased 9% to $22.3 billion with underlying sales down 2%. Both the quarter and the year were significantly affected by number of economic headwinds. The continuation of lower oil prices resulted in both capital and more recently operational spending reductions by our global oil and gas customers. General industrial capital spending was slow throughout the year, particularly in energy related markets. Emerging market growth was sluggish with weakening conditions as we exited fiscal 2015.","In response to the weakening demand, we accelerated our restructuring programs in the fourth quarter with a total spend of $128 million, which exceeded our August conference call guidance by just over $40 million or an impact of approximately $0.04 cents per share. For the fiscal year total restructuring expense was $221 million.","During the quarter we also incurred $52 million of costs and taxes related to the spinoff of Network Power, $10 million for transaction costs and $42 million of income tax expense for planned repatriation of earnings in 2016. On September 30, we announced the completion of the divestiture of the InterMetro business resulting in a gain for our shareholders.","Reported earnings per share for the fourth quarter increased 69% to $0.98. Earnings per share adjusted for the divestiture gains and Network Power spinoff costs decreased 29% to $0.93. Reported earnings per share for the fiscal year increased 32% to $3.99 while adjusted earnings per share decreased 15% to $3.17. During the fiscal year, the company returned $3.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase.","Turning to slide three, gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 170 basis points to 40.7%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable business and product mix. EBIT margin reflects the impacts of the accelerated restructuring, the Network Power spinoff costs, and benefit of divestiture gains. Fourth quarter margins were up 270 basis points on a sequential basis versus third quarter EBIT margin of 15.2%. During the quarter, approximately 9 million shares were repurchased for $460 million.","Turning to slide four, global demand was mixed during the fiscal year with underlying sales in the Middle East and Africa up 3%, Canada up 2%, the US down 2%, Europe flat and Asia down 5%.","Turning to slide five, business segment margin declined 450 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expenses. Operating cash flow reflected solid conversion of earnings and working capital.","Turning to slide six, Process Management underlying sales declined 10% in the quarter. Capital and operational spending remained at reduced levels within the oil and gas industry. Upstream markets are under the most pressure while downstream activity in chemical and power markets continue to provide growth opportunities. The Middle East, Africa region grew 2% with mixed but generally favorable activity levels across the region. Accelerated restructuring activities resulted in spending of $52 million in the quarter, an impact of 230 basis points. Demand will remain under pressure for most of the fiscal 2016 as the expectation for lower for longer oil prices will keep industry spending at reduced levels.","Turning to slide seven, Industrial Automation fourth quarter underlying sales declined 12% reflecting the continued weakness in industrial spending, upstream oil and gas markets and European demand. Demand was down in all regions with North America down 20%, Europe down 2%, and Asia down 8%. We will continue to evaluate the potential divestitures of the motors and drives and power generation businesses during fiscal 2016. Market conditions will remain challenging in the near term with an expectation of improvement in the second half of the fiscal year.","Turning to slide eight. Network Power underlying sales declined 4% in the quarter as global demand for data center infrastructure and telecommunications investment remained mix. Within the geographies, Europe was up 10% while North America was down 10%. Asia was down 5% as strong growth in India and Australia was more than offset by demand weakness in China. Accelerated restructuring activities resulted in spending of $33 million in the quarter. We continue to expect the spinoff of Network Power to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2016.","Turning to slide nine. Climate Technologies' fourth quarter underlying sales were down 5%. North America was down 3% as our results were impacted by challenging year-over-year comparisons stemming from the US residential air conditioning industry pre-build in 2014. Asia was down 10% as slowing demand in China more than offset growth in other regions. Segment margin increased 10 basis points, primarily supported by cost reductions and favorable materials cost containment which more than offset increased restructuring expenses of $12 million. We expect modest growth for the Climate Technologies segment next fiscal year as global demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets is expected to remain favorable in 2016.","Turning to slide 10. Commercial & Residential Solutions' fourth quarter underlying sales were up 3%, benefiting from favorable trends in US construction. Growth in food waste disposers and wet dry vacuums was substantially offset by a decline in the professional tools business which continues to reflect spending reductions in energy related markets. Segment margins were down 100 basis points but up 10 basis points when excluding the impact from the increased restructuring expense. The favorable trends in US construction markets are expected to continue, supporting our outlook for moderate levels of growth and profit improvement in 2016.","Turning to slide 11. We expect difficult market conditions to remain in effect through at least the first six to nine months of fiscal 2016. The continuation of the headwinds faced in our key served markets during 2015 will reduce underlying sales growth across our businesses, resulting in an expectation that net sales will decline 6% to 8% in 2016. Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5% excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each.","As previously discussed, the sales in the first quarter will be challenging when considering current market conditions and difficult comparisons to the prior year. We expect first quarter underlying sales to be down approximately 10%, excluding negative currency and divestitures of approximately 6% in total.","Cost structure alignment and the strategic portfolio repositioning will remain a key focus for Emerson in fiscal 2016 where structuring expenses of $50 million to $70 million are expected in 2016 with most of the activity occurring during the first half of the fiscal year. We also estimate that we would incur expenses of approximately $300 million to $400 million related to the spinoff of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the motors and drives and power generation businesses. The level of activity surrounding the evaluation of an acquisition of key strategic assets will also increase next year.","For EPS guidance, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be $3.05 to $3.25 when excluding the portfolio repositioning costs. Finally, in support of our commitment to returning cash to Emerson shareholders, the Board of Directors has approved an increase to the first quarter dividend to an annualized rate of $1.90 per share and a new program authorizing the repurchase of 70 million shares.","And now I'll turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Craig. Welcome everybody this afternoon. And Frank, thanks for joining us today. Glad to be with you and glad to get this fiscal year behind us. It's been a very challenging year. And as we know, we are in a global industry recession for our businesses right now. We just incurred our third negative underlying sales growth and we will have two more, and I'll talk a little bit about that.","I want to thank all the global corporate and business teams for their support and efforts throughout this year as we dealt with a year that started out very strong with underlying sales growth in the first quarter of over 5%, to immediately going into an extremely tough marketplace throughout the year. Restructuring efforts, the cost savings, the announced sale of two businesses getting done in one year, the announce of our repositioning with Network Power being spin or sold and\/or the sale of Leroy-Somer CT this year. A lot going on.","As I look at the effort and the performance the last several months, we're starting to see the stabilization of some of the markets. We're also seeing the benefits of the restructuring, which we started back in February aggressively and ended up spending over $221 million as the year got more challenging, we're starting to see the benefits flow through. We had a fourth quarter of over 20% operating margin in a very difficult year with a lot of down sales and a lot of challenging currency and price costs.","As I look forward here, I see the underlying order pace running around this 10%, 11% negative probably for the next several months. As Craig highlighted, I firmly believe as we've talked about for several conference calls now, a very challenging first quarter. We had a very good first quarter last year with strong topline growth, strong margin and strong cash flow and strong earnings per share. This year we'll be facing negative, probably negative 10% underlying sales growth, with negative 7% currency and divestiture impact, with a lot of issues around that because of the price costs, because of the global trends and all the issues. And I firmly believe a lot of other companies are starting to struggle, and the question will be how much they will do in the month of December.","But we're ready for it. We've been getting ready for this tough time period for the several months now. The restructuring is really starting to take hold. We have about $60 million to $70 million more restructuring to get done that will benefit 2016. It will be front-end loaded. It's worked extremely hard program by program. We will get it done in the first five or six months, and we're ready for what I would say, the first negative quarter and then the second negative quarter, which I believe underlying sales could be down somewhere in the 5% to 6% range. And then we'll start coming out of this both from an easy comparison but also seeing some stability in the markets we serve.","So right now, in the industrial recession that Emerson faces, we will have down five quarters. We will then have the restructuring kick in, really starting to improve our profitability as we get into the second and third and fourth quarters, then we'll start seeing the improvements of the global markets we serve. We will continue to drive hard to get the spin or the sale of Network Power done within the fiscal year of 2016. We will continue to drive hard to finish the divestiture on Leroy-Somer CT in the fiscal year, and then we'll come out of 2016 with a very strong core business churning up with very high levels of profitability.","Again, a lot of work across this organization to deal with the challenging economic environment we've been facing, and I'm very pleased to see the work done. I'm very pleased to see the effort relative to the cash flow and the balance sheet. And the balance sheet will be, what I would say, in acceptable condition. It's strong today, but even better when we get into the second quarter as we continue to manage the balance sheet and get what I would say a little bit extra working capital built up in that balance sheet from the past downturn. But we are transacting very hard right now in this tough environment. The organization is focused on generating the earnings and the cash we need and repositioning this company to have a strong case of growth when the economic recovery happens.","In the meantime, acquisitions, we're very strongly focused on the two core markets and the opportunities, working those acquisition opportunities the best we can, and we're underway to hopefully consummate several acquisitions throughout 2016 as the opportunities come about.","But we're going to be facing a challenging next six months. We know that. The business leaders know that. The board knows that, and we're taking the actions necessary to protect the company overall from a technology and profitability standpoint and the financial capability and positioning ourself for a strong underlying growth recovery and a strong acquisition tuck recovery once the repositioning effort is underway.","We chose to increase the dividend slightly this year. We have the cash flow. As you look at the new business, or the new Emerson when we come out in late 2016, early 2017, the cash flow generation of the company is very strong and we can support the dividend at the same time supporting any acquisitions or share repurchase necessary.","So right now, we're very focused on getting through this time period of the next six months, getting the nose back up and getting the company positioned to recover strongly for our shareholders both the top line, profitability and cash flow. But the same time, yes, we had a very difficult year last year. Yes, our underlying sales were down over 2%. Yes, our reported sales were down 9%. But we did generate nearly $3 billion of operating cash flow when you adjust for the extra taxes we paid for the divestitures, and we generated over 17% operating profit margin in a very challenging environment. And our goal is to again generate that same 17% as we go into another down year in 2016.","The environment is what the environment is. We deal with it. But we're going to try to control what we can control, and we're going to control our profitability, our cash flow, our returns and any acquisitions we can get done. And we will get the spin\/sale done if necessary as quickly as possible, and we'll get the sale of CTE \u2013 Leroy-Somer done as quickly as possible.","That's where we sit today, and I want to thank the global organization for what they've done and where we're positioned. We'll give you a better insight around the segments as we get into our discussion in February, which I believe is in Austin, Texas. I mean there's no snow in Austin, Texas. Maybe a little rain, but not typically in February. So hopefully I will see a lot of shareholders down in Austin, Texas, so they can see the core process business we have down there and explain to you what we're going to do as we come out of this industrial recession we've been facing here for the last several quarters and will face for the next two quarters.","With that, I'll open the line to take some calls. And I appreciate everyone's support and engagement as we go forward here in the coming months and year. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good afternoon. Just a question on the notion of organic sales maybe turning back up again in the June quarter of next year. As you said, that's after five quarters of decline, so are you just kind of taking the template of prior downturns that lasted around that long and applying it this time? Or are you seeing something specific in the orders in either energy or broad emerging markets that you think support that improvement?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","First of all, we look at the pace of how fast we came down. We look at historical trend lines. At that point in time, I see nothing that early that far out relative to the pace. It's just, I look at what we've gone through, through some difficult economic downturns over the years. Sometimes it's four, sometimes it's five. The more challenging ones typically are five. I am not assuming there is a global recession. I'm assuming the global environment is very similar to what we're facing today, challenging, in certain markets doing okay, certain markets not doing okay. But we get to a point that you get low enough and our pace of business and the type of marketplace we serve, they will start investing in certain space again. So that's where I come from, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And then just around Network Power, the clean profits, stripping out restructuring, I think were still down about 40% for 2015 as a whole, down 30% something exiting the year. So I just wondered how that plays into the spin decision and at what point you think we might start to see the earnings in Network Power stabilize.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From the standpoint of spin, I think what's unfolding in Network Power is still within what we planned. When we look at 2016, it's still well within its plan. So we can either spin or we can look at a potential strategic sale. From my perspective, as I look at the pace of orders and what's going on right now, we're starting to see some stability. And I would expect to see that nose turning up as we get into the early 2016 calendar year based on what we're seeing trend line from these guys at this point in time.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And just a very quick follow up. Any color on the price net of raw materials impact on margin in 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, the price cost, it's pretty neutral at this point in time. My gut tells me it'll probably potentially be a negative, what I call red as we get into 2016. It's always a function of pricing pressures and the currency trends we see in the net material inflation. But right now, it's pretty close to being neutral. But, I guess I would say this year probably could end up being slightly negative as we get into 2016 just based on what I see out there from a competitive standpoint.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's something we can manage, to be honest.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Johnny Wright with Nomura.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hi, Johnny.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. So maybe just kind of following up on that question on the inflection second half of the year. Looking at the slides, you talked about expectation of improvement in Industrial Automation. What gives you confidence on that sitting here today? And what really are the key risks to that kind of coming through in 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's really a function around how much people cut back spending for the last 18 months, and looking at the trend lines in the customer base, and looking at some of those reinvestments that will start happening. People are not going to keep \u2013 they're going to eventually have to reinvest some money. And we do have a pretty good installed base out there. So that's where it comes from. And we're not talking about a very strong recovery. I mean, after you go down for three tough quarters, after we go down 10% this quarter, after we go down 6% the next quarter, it's not unusual to see historically a company like Emerson, who's globally well established with installed base quite significant, to have a little bit of recovery coming in that sixth type of quarter.","So I mean, I'm not looking at anything unusual from a marketplace standpoint. And we're again, I'll say, we are expecting the economics environment around the world to be slightly weaker or about the same as we are facing right now. So the risk would be if we truly went into a global broad recession, then you clearly say okay, the industrial space will be a little bit weaker than I'm thinking. But I don't see any indication we're going to go to a global broad recession at this point in time.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on Process Management, the margin front for next year, clearly a lot of restructuring had been focused there. You've got a tailwind from that. Can you just maybe talk about some of the other dynamics, particularly out on the pricing front and where you're going to be seeing margins coming out next year for Process?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You know, from my perspective, the restructuring underway and the work that Steve Sonnenberg and his whole team have done has been extremely good. And we will have clearly I would say the most negative pricing environment we've seen from those guys in a long time. However, we do have our unique installed base part, so basically our day-to-day MRO, small project business will help us there.","So with the restructuring effort underway, we expect our margins to be trending upward in Process based obviously after a shocker this year with the restructuring, but we expect our margins to move back up on a comparison basis versus this year. Even with down sales, because the effort, the restructuring, the effort that these guys have undertaken to get the costs out and assuming a negative price environment, which we are assuming with Process, we're expecting our underlying profitability this improve next year in Process Management obviously relative to this year, but at pretty high levels relative to historical levels.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Sure. And when you say that, are you talking about in terms of reported margins, so including the restructuring in both years?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, exactly.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You see, the Process Management team, if you look at the restructuring they got done this year, they got a lot of restructuring done this year, and they have some left in the $60 million or $70 million next year. But they have got the big part of it behind as of right now, which is a good position to be in. So what was the total restructuring for Process, Craig, this, for the year? What did they do? You got the chart there.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","I have to pull it out in front of me. Sorry.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","(24:26)","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Rossman, you already gave us those speeches, have a beer.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","He's tracking down lunch, have a beer.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean and then Farr hits him with questions.","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","$90 million.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","$90 million.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","$90 million, so they got $90 million done. They've got a lot of restructuring done this year, and so of the $221 million, they got $90 million. So I think they are in good shape going into next year. It's going to be a very difficult first half for Process. They had a very strong first quarter, but I really feel good about what they've got accomplished from the restructuring standpoint and the costs taken out.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks for your time, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","And next we'll go to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, Dave, Craig.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. So I wanted to start with you expect $250 million of savings from actions that you took in 2015, which was $221 million. How do you get more restructuring benefit than what you actually spent? I'm not suggesting you won't, I just want to understand how that's going to work.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Depends on the costs you take out and what type of programs, type of cost layers you take out. I mean, we went in pretty hard to get overhead costs out and some redundancy costs out and we typically get a good payback for that. So we went after it.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","David, this restructuring, do you think it can hold? Like in other words it's a little bit of a question of say the mix of variable adjustment versus structural and how \u2013 do you have to give some back to the customer? Does some creep back as the business trends better? Maybe you could just help us peel the onion a little bit in terms of what you've done, because it was obviously very aggressive in the quarter. So just trying to understand.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's been aggressive the whole year. We just didn't do it all last month. I know people think that, but it's actually worked its way through and a lot of it's been planned for since starting in February. I mean, I'm not going to go back and tell you exactly what we did. It's clearly that's what I would call our own information. We did spend the money. We will get the savings built into it, and there will not be a creep. We have built into plans. We know the pricing will be tough in certain marketplaces next year, but that's why we're working the restructuring as hard as we've done.","It will stick, and from a standpoint of profitability, we generate very high levels of profitability. And I'll say it again. Despite a very challenging year in 2015, we did generate 17.3% operating profit on down sales, and we're planning on trying to generate 17% of operating profit next year on down sales. So we know what we're trying to do here relative to profitability, John. So this is one I'm not going to give you any more details. You've got to trust me. We know how to manage our cost structure at Emerson.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Maybe just lastly, Dave, can I ask you, post the spin of Network Power, so I realize you've also made comments that you're looking to pick up the pace of M&A a little bit. But in theory, right, post the spin of Network Power, then Emerson's a smaller footprint. Do you modify then the dividend accordingly? So you say, well we're now 4\/5 of what we were, so we'll modify the dividend in some manner by that? It's not really a leading question to be negative, it's more just trying to understand how this is going to work with respect to your dividend, because the dividend's very important.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I've been very clear on this. We will not be reducing our dividend. The new company, the new Emerson that comes out when it comes out in 2017, let's say it's around $15.5 billion in size with margins of over 19%, margins generate very good levels of cash flow, more than enough cash flow to justify the current dividend payment and continue to increase the dividend and doing share repurchase and doing acquisitions. So the business that stays behind is a very strong operating performing return company that can generate enough earnings and enough cash to pay the dividend as we're structured right now. We are not going to be adjusting our dividend payout for the new Emerson.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks much.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome, John.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good afternoon guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Dave, what are the actual underlying GFI growth rates then that are embedded in your guidance for 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","On the global G7 basis, I'm embedding around 2.5% basis growth. This year is around 2%, 2.1%, we're in slightly improvement and a global basis. So it's slightly \u2013 about the same on the GFI. This is the G7, the bigger markets, so that's what we're looking at. If you look at the overall forecast out there, it's much higher than that right now and I don't believe it at all. I think we're going to be trending in this low 2%s.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right, and then \u2013 but you still have that picking up during the pace of next year, right?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, as you go into the first half of the year, you're probably looking at what we've been seeing the last six months, in the low 2%s, around the 2.2%, 2.3%, and then I think you then start moving that up in the little bit higher 2%s in the second half of the year as people start turning back into \u2013 they've got the stability. They've got the restructuring. They've got the needs they need to start investing in. So I'm not looking for a big sudden spike but I'm looking that to start trending up toward the mid to higher 2%s.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And you talked about -","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","By the way, that's not what the economic forecast is, as you know.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes, that's why I'm asking you and not a bunch of economists.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I am a dumb unliked CEO so what the hell are you asking me for?","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So you mentioned increased activity in evaluating the acquisition of key strategic assets. You talked about consummating several for 2016. Where is your head and current thinking in terms of the size and directionality in Process and Industrial versus Commercial & Resi? So what kind of expectations should we have on what these things look like?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Most of them are going to be \u2013 right now what we're pushing pretty hard are what I would call more of a private type of companies out there. I really would like to consummate, even though we're talking only about \u2013 I'd really like to consummate over $0.5 billion within the industrial process, industrial automation area, and I'd like to consummate maybe $100 million, $150 million over on the Commercial & Residential area as I look at 2016.","These are actions that we're going out and encouragingly, we've been talking to private shareholders and companies that we've been courting for some time, and given the tougher marketplace right now, they are much more receptive to it. At this point, I do not see any big strategic, say public type of transaction underway, but we're going to keep working the knits around the corners. And particularly, I'm going to start working pretty hard in Asia, too, because I think Asia's got some opportunities that, with their markets being stressed right now, that we want to go after, too.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","]>: Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So we've got the businesses working real hard. Primarily I would say 90% of the money will end up in the industrial asset base over the process world.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, and one more thing. I know you don't give quarterly guidance, but just given your commentary in this call and you talked about basically 20% year-on-year decline which is more \u2013 higher sequential than the usual amount and decrementals, I'm assuming of about 30%, and then you've got the restructuring offset. I mean it sounds to me like we certainly, in the tough comps, certainly should be having a number down here well less than $0.45 to $0.50. But just directionally?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I would directionally, I'd be more around the $0.50 range. I mean last year we reported $0.75, the year before that we reported $0.65. Our sales, I mean if you think about 2014, coming off that 2014, where we had $5.6 billion in sales and we had a OP margin around 14% and then $0.65 EPS, we're going to be about $1 billion below that in sales, but we've got restructuring underway and helping us. So I think we'll get pretty good flow through. I would be thinking around a $0.50 number for that first quarter.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, guys. Thanks. Good luck.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Now I'm doing that one time, that's it. I'm not giving quarters out.","Operator","And our next question will come from Mike Wood with Macquarie Securities Group.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","How you doing, Mike?","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","I applaud the aggressive restructuring actions. Just a question first on Process. You mentioned downstream providing growth opportunities. Curious if you're seeing growth there, and if you can give some color in terms of what subsectors are growing on the downstream side.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, what we're seeing is continuing the investments going on in some of the petrochemical areas, the chemical areas, some of the pharmaceutical areas, sort of the areas that people are making those investments using the lower cost of energy both on the oil side and the gas side. We've been seeing the proxies go through. They're not as large as we thought originally, but they're still going forward. And I don't see people backing off on that. I mean, the projects that Sasol has underway going down in Louisiana, which is a big customer base for us, that's moving forward. So the opportunities are out there.","And I anticipate as we get into the spring and early summer of 2016, some of the companies that have been cutting back on capital and cutting back on, what I would say, necessary investments are going to have to let the money go. I mean, they've got other costs adjusted. So I think that our underlying MRO, which is a good business for us, will improve and get better as we get into 2016. So, it's not totally dead out there. The big oil and gas projects obviously are struggling. But the other investments around the chemical and petrochemical are still happening for us.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And you mentioned the restructuring. I may have missed this. Did you quantify how much you do in the first half of next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're going to do, let's say we're going to do $60 million to $70 million. I think what, Frank, we're going to do 60% of it?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","About 60% to 70% of it in the first half, yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","70% in the first half.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll to Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I'm trying to get a sense, I was in China a few weeks ago and I walked back pretty darn embarrassed. And it seems like there's some sequential slowdowns there. And if you look at your numbers, it shows exactly what we saw. And do you have any sense of, I guess a couple things (35:12-35:16) as much of an inventory destock as anything else? Or are things sequentially getting worse there and that concerns you as you go into 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, we are planning for a down 2016 in China. From my perspective, we've had two very challenging quarters. I fundamentally believe there has been a destocking going on. Basically what we can tell, Scott, right now I think the worst of that is behind us. I do believe we will have a challenging first quarter because we had a very good first quarter last year. So I mean it's probably going to be strong double digits down in sales. But I personally don't think it's getting worse. I think that they are trying to reposition. And I expect that we will have a down year next year. But we'll manage our way through it, get a little bit better as we go forward as they start reprioritizing their investments.","But right now, I mean we had a down 18% in the fourth quarter. We're probably going to be down around 15% again in the second quarter, or the first quarter. And I think we'll probably be down around 10% in that second quarter, and then we'll start getting better as we go forward. But we're going to be down somewhere around 3%, 4%, 5% for the whole year in China. So it is going to be a tough year. I'm not looking for any sharp bounce back there. I agree with you.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And just as a follow up, I mean, is that the region? I mean, you cited some price risk versus raws next year. I mean, is that the region where you are the most concerned about excess capacity and price?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm not concerned about that is much there. My price risk comes into play in the large global projects where monies are being spent. There are projects being done out there. And clearly the pricing risks will come in on those projects. And you clearly are trying to protect your customer base. You're trying to protect something. So that's where I would see the pricing pressures on the industrial side. On the commercial side, the Commercial & Residential, I would say Asia would give me the most price pressures. But I also typically have the most cost opportunities there too. So my price pressures, I don't worry about China next year as much as I worry about the big global projects. There are not that many out there, and people are going to be hungry fighting for those projects.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Good color. Good luck, guys. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Take care, Scott. All the best to you.","Operator","And next we'll go to Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. David, to follow up on that last comment you made, have you seen any of this price pressure yet in the orders you have been recording? Or is that something that's still on the comp?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We see it today, and we have continued to see it. You know, our net material inflation has clearly been helping us from an ops (38:01) standpoint, because the inflation environment we've been feeling for the last three years has been negative on materials, so that's helped us. But at the same time, I've had three years of what I would call it, negative price. I think that the pricing pressures has already happen on the bidding. Our customer base knows that the global marketplace is a challenge. They know that commodity prices have come down and they are utilizing that.","And obviously, we work that very hard. We're aware of that. And for my cost structure standpoint, and we've been able to make that up, but I would say we will probably have in the end, when we add up all the numbers next year, my gut tells me we have a slightly negative net price material inflation to hit us a little bit. Not big, but slightly. I just think it's going to be there as we all work this issue for the next six months or seven months to get through this transition. So it's there, and I'm openly talking about it, and it's happening, so that's what's going on.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then you already addressed the China question, but I was just curious, elsewhere are there any regions where you're actually worried about another leg down, a more significant step down in demand where things could get substantially worse?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The only place I see right now on the markets is we're already seeing the impact in Eastern Europe and Russia. We've already seen that. I'm a little bit worried in the Middle East as our big Middle Eastern customers both in oil and gas and petrochemical investments, if they cut back even more to protect their cash flow for various reasons, whatever they need the money for. So I would say that market for us, you're talking about a $1 billion marketplace, I would say that has the biggest risk at this point in time. I think we've taken a big hit in Latin America and Brazil, Mexico. I still think that will be negative next year, but I think we've taken a big hit. My concern is the Middle East. I think there's a risk for a bigger down than we're planning. We're planning it down, but I think it could be a bigger one.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And one last one. At Climate Tech, do you expect to start to comp positively as early as the March quarter as you lap this year 2014 pre-build? Or when do expect that business to start to see positive?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I would expect the comps to turn positive in the second quarter.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We watch our customer base report, and we know they are working through that inventory. They have done a great job of managing that inventory, and getting it out and getting the sales. So I would say we'll have a negative first quarter, and then we'll start comping more favorable in that second quarter.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. Take care. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","And next we will go to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave. So you mentioned something very interesting. I think when you mentioned that the bulk of the channel destock is behind you, I think you were talking about China specifically. Could you maybe just broaden that out in terms of what you're seeing globally on inventory destock and when you think that might be behind you?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","My inventories in Europe are \u2013 I look at our channel and it's pretty good. Because of the channel partners and the channel you sell into, money was hard to come by so the European channel's in pretty good shape. I look at my channel in North America, I would say it's in decent shape right now in the businesses we sell into. The last piece of this working through would be the climate areas is all the pre-build we have there.","But I would say the channel is in decent shape. Probably as we get through this calendar year, it will be in really good shape. And so we saw the inventories being built and people anticipated the second half being stronger. We saw the destocking happen this quarter. I think the plan in, we have built into our plan for this quarter where underlying sales might be down say 10%. I think that will work its way through it on the destock from my perspective, as I see the channels.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So as we get into calendar 2016, that should be behind us?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, I would say yes, unless you had a step down and overall a recessionary environment. Right now, I think people are planning for very, very, very low growth and they're getting their inventories down and they're working it very hard. It's the same thing we've been doing as a company here. I'd say we have one more quarter basically of getting our inventories down, and then typically we're no different than the global distribution channel anyway. So I think that's exactly right.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Very helpful. And then just in a similar vein, Dave, clearly the MRO spending is still pretty tight with the oil and gas companies. Any sense on when we might start to see some of that action coming through?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't think you'll see any action in that space until the second half of calendar year 2016. That's why I think Process will be down in growth next year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Dave, just a follow up on the Climate. So in terms of it returning to growth, when you get past the SEER comps, which make sense, but China was down 27% Climate. I mean, is that going to be an offset to that, or can you explain a little bit what you're seeing in Climate in China right now?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, Climate had a very strong first half of the year in China as they built inventory up in the channel, going back to one of the previous questions. And they're quickly taking it out right now. So I think what will happen is the typical plan in China is they over-build, they take it back down, and then they'll start building back up again. So I would expect that China would start seeing some improved second half numbers, most likely still negative for the first two or three quarters, and then getting up and positive in that fourth quarter. So the destocking is still underway. I think the major destocking will be done by the end of that first quarter in China.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just obviously the pressure is significant now just sort of across the business and a lot of restructuring to do. But typically when times are difficult like this, Emerson likes to invest and take share and come out of the downturn even stronger. I mean is that happening, or are there examples you would give sort of across the portfolio where you feel like you're playing offense even though there's obviously a lot of restructuring to do as well?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We are continuing to play offense. I will share a lot with you in February on this issue. We are not cutting back in certain strategic areas where we think we have unique opportunities to gain share. So yes, we are restructuring, but we're restructuring in an area and areas that we feel that are not strategic relative to gaining that growth opportunities. And so we're continuing to invest and restructure Emerson. Very good at this gas pedal and brake at the same time. And so we're playing that game because what we want to do is come out of this and continue to grow our core markets in particular on the two strategic businesses we're going to have when we finish this in 2016.","So the board has been keenly interested and tuned to what you're saying there. They do not want us to get to the point that we're cutting really strategic growth opportunities and opportunities we see out there. So we're working it very hard. We'll share some ideas with you in February. But suffice it to say that our game plan is get the costs down, which we are right now very quickly, and then take advantage of those opportunities when they come back at us.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","And next we'll go to Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, Dave. How are you doing?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Bob.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, so I guess the first question I'd have is with respect to kind of monthly order trends. And obviously, you're not disclosing those anymore but you're still tracking them. Could you speak to what kind of month you would see as kind of critical to think about whether we would see the kind of growth that you're talking about for the plan for 2016 versus potentially something worse? In other words, when does that comp kind of appear in terms of the backlog, in terms of the order trends where you can declare victory or think about something incrementally worse?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. First of all, we will continue to disclose our orders once a quarter, and so the next time where we disclose will be in?","Craig M. Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","December.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","December. So we will be putting orders out there. This month-to-month stuff, given that we're the only one doing it, it was kind of crazy. We will disclose it in December, and then we'll true them up in February when we report the quarter. So you'll still get access to them. But what I'm looking at as I map out the year, I just unloaded, or unfolded for you all on the phone earlier is what I expect is that we should see on a comp basis, in order for us to have second half underlying sales growth, I have to see my order pace start getting above that line, across that line, the zero line as we get out of that second quarter.","So when we report orders in the end of, let's say the March quarter, the March timeframe, you should start seeing that number approaching that 0% range. And if not, and if it's still negative 5% or 6% then we'll go back to the conversation I had earlier that we will not see the positive recovery in that third quarter, and then we'll have a sixth down underlying sales quarter. So that's the benchmark you need to look at.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Understood. And then just moving to Process Management and just given what you've seen \u2013 this has been picked over a little bit \u2013 but given what you've seen about what you expect in terms of behavior across the board in terms of potential cuts, and you mentioned the Middle East as a potential negative there, do you feel like you have a good sense that we're going to see a bottom here and the implications for margins here? In other words what is baked into your current plan?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think right now we expect the market we see today is going to continue to be weak in front of us for at least two quarters. That's what's baked into our plan. And then some stability, and we will have down underlying sales in the year of 2016. The restructuring effort is based on down underlying sales. I believe I've talked about down 3%, 4%, 5% with process underlying sales. And so we baked in that type of down, say down 5% underlying sales, into the cost expectations in trying to get the restructuring done so we can try to deliver improved profitability in 2016 and continue to make the strategic investments we need to make.","So I expect Process to be facing some pretty challenging headwinds for the next couple quarters. We will start seeing, as I get out in February or I get in January and talking to various investors, I'll be able to start seeing some of the early parts of process on the MRO, the instrumentation side. If I start seeing that improve, that will give me a good feeling that we've reached that bottom and we have a clear visibility to that second half as we leave 2016.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","The final question real quick is just in terms of the Network Power, in terms of this parallel process, I mean obviously there's limits as to what you could say about it. But I guess how do you think about the decision around price, timing, etc. versus going the spin route versus a potential sale to a strategic. I mean what are kind of the qualitative factors that you are stressing? Is it speed in terms of exit or is it valuation? How should we think about it?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From my perspective \u2013 I have one perspective. It's called valuation, producer responsibility to my shareholders. Maximize the value for my shareholders as I look at, and the board looks at do we do a spin versus if we have a strategic alternative with a buyer coming in and asking us. That will be the key issue for me, is strategic valuation for my shareholder. If we think we can make more money for my shareholder doing a spin versus a sale then we'll go that route or vice versa.","If we're going to have this done by the end of this fiscal year, then we'll have to make this decision sometime in late spring, which way, we going to go left or are we going to go right. And so that's the type of timeframe that we're heading on. We just reviewed this with the board, the timeline and the approaches and keep them up to speed. But that is the decision making process. It's all about maximizing the value for my shareholder, which I am one of.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, one quick point of clarification before my question. You said to an earlier question you've had three years of negative price. Did you mean three years of negative costs?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, I think the price. If you look at the underlying pricing of our, I believe we've reported three years of negative pricing as a company.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","This has been unusual. And we're about to go into the fourth year, I think with 2016. Even though the Fed is giving free money to everybody, the environment out there has basically been pretty tough in overall pricing of a total company \u2013 this is total company. And so I've had negative pricing basically, and net material inflation's helped us protect our profitability. And I think that we're going to see that next year, I think the negative pricing will be slightly higher but my net material inflation will be higher because of what opportunities are out there. But that's what I see and that's the type of market the industrial world has been facing for a while.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Right. But you were not in the so-called red in 2015 but you will be in 2016, by your estimation.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Right now we're not red. I think there's a good chance that we could have a slight red to that, Jeff, to be honest. My gut right now, that's all it is. I play this by feel. I know the pricing environments out there, I know the net material environments out there. You could have a couple of things go a wrong way and you could have a slight negative net material price pressure, but it's going to be very, very slight if at all.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","The main thing I wanted to touch on is cash. We haven't really talked about that yet on the call other than the opening remarks. So historically, your cash flow has actually been a lot less cyclical than your earnings, not surprisingly. We didn't really see that play out in 2015, and you made a comment about getting the balance sheet ironed out by Q2 of next year. Obviously you had the SEER build and all that going on. Can you just give us the lay of the land on how you expect cash and kind of the working capital dynamics to play out for next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, historically, we get hit like we got hit in the second half of the year \u2013 typically it takes us two to three quarters once that hit happens. So we had a very good fourth quarter from a cash flow standpoint. I'm starting to see that if I look the overall inventory levels and I look at where we sit at this point in time, trade working capital is now starting to get back into line where should be, where the normal progression to see what I would call the healthy,. what I look at the 11% to 14% percent of sales of cash flow.","But I think right now we're in pretty good shape. It was a tough year last year. We also had the extraordinary thing last year, we had some tax payments that we had to make in the sale of the divestiture which goes to the cash flow which mucks that up a little bit. But overall \u2013 let me see your calculator there. As I look at the cash flow last year, we did $3 billion \u2013 operating cash flow we did $3 billion, and we had $22.3 billion of sales, $23.3 billion of sales. So we were around 13.4%. I look at next year, we're going to be up around that 14%, so we are moving back up to where we need to be next year. I think it's well under our control. I think Frank and Ed Purvis did a good job and got the businesses focused, and we've pretty well got a forecast in front of us right now that makes sense, which I laid out to you and that allows us to really work that balance sheet.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And in that construct, Dave, are you including the cash repatriation you are expecting from Network Power in it?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, we're not. That will unfold \u2013 I mean first of all, I mean that cash flow is already inside the company. It's been earned over the years, but we have not incorporated movement of cash flow, which is quite significant from both the sale\/spin of Network Power and\/or the Leroy-Somer CT. So there's going to be some cash flow moving around. We will be repatriating cash flow in 2016 and probably early 2017 on this whole process, which would bring to money back into the United States and we'll end up paying the taxes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just one last one, same topic, is just the cash costs of what you're trying to execute in the repositioning, you've got this $300 million to $400 million marker? I am assuming some of that might just be asset impairments and the like. Can you size that for us?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. If we had an impairment, we would have to take the impairment now, Jeff. The accounting is pretty straightforward. If I thought that we were going to have an impairment, I would have to take it now. The cash flow that you saw, that number is what we're going to spend on transaction growth. Some of it's tax, some of it's advisors, and that's true cash flow that's going out. There will be another bit of cash invested in some of the investments we may have to make in IT, with some the investments we have to make in other areas, but that's not a big number overall. Probably we're looking at another $100 million, $150 million of additional cash investments that we might have to make on top of the expense spend, to the point you're getting at.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Great. I appreciate it, Dave. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay, you're welcome. Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","And next we'll go to Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Just wanted to dive into understanding another one of the numbers used, the $250 million benefit to the global cost structure. Is that just the savings or does that also incorporate some of the benefit from lower restructuring expense?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's the savings, just the savings.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So there's another tailwind from the lower expense, then?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So we're trying to protect our operating profitability at around that 17% range despite the fact that our sales will be down again next year on top of this year. So that's what we're trying to protect right now.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then from a kind of very broad high level view on the energy markets, how is consolidation phase of that cycle shaping up from your perspective, either on the supply chain where you play or in the producer complex? And is that kind of as expected so far, or how is that staging up?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","On the customer base, I think it's still early. There is some action going on right now, but I still think there's more to come based on what unfolds and when you see that, when you see what happens to the pricing, the price and the demand out there. From our perspective as a supplier in the marketplace, I think it's really early. I think you'll start seeing more opportunities happening in 2016 and maybe even all the way into 2017. Early stages still.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","And next we'll go to Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Industrial Automation, should we think as it's currently constituted, should we think of margin improvement similar to the cadence in Process that you're anticipating on a year-over-year basis? I know you didn't do as much restructuring last year in IA, but just how should we think about that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we are right now, because of our Industrial Automation, the makeup of where those assets fit, and as we said, there's a lot more international. So there is a lot more being done here in the first and second quarter. But we do anticipate I mean margin improvement next year from the standpoint of what's been accomplished and also what we're doing regarding executing right now here in the first quarter. So do we anticipate, we actually do anticipate underlying improvement and margin improvement in Industrial Automation. I do not expect the top line growth to be as negatively impacted as the Process as these guys have gone through a lot of the shake-out and build-out. And so, their basic day-to-day business will stabilize. So I think that the Industrial Automation will face a little bit better top line marketplace, not quite as negative. And their restructuring they've got done will help them pick up their profitability in fiscal 2016.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that will be back half weighted, probably more so?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. Yes. That's a good way to think about it.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. And then just on US construction, you had a comment there for C&RS around you good construction markets. It sounds like you think resi and non-res are still going to be pretty good in 2016. What's your latest on that considering there has been some moving data points out there on the macro front?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that resi, residential market, will continue to progress at a good pace. The way I look at the resi, I look at the GFI, it's been the last couple quarters, it's been 8%, 9%. And I think that's going to continue to be that 8%, 9%, 10%. I personally think that the non-res investments on the gross fixed investment have been trending downward. I think that trend will continue to come downwards and stabilize in the low single digits. It'll still be positive, but I still think that the trend line is not up but down, even though I think that people think that it will turn around in the second half of 2016, I am not of that opinion. Our forecast is built on the fact that it doesn't, it bottoms out and stays there.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is that energy contagion influenced in your view?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, it is. Yes, it is energy contagion.","Richard Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, I think it's.","Operator","And next we'll go to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So you said $300 million to $400 million in the cost. Does that include the assumed taxes you would pay on the, not the Network Power stuff, but the other stuff you're selling out of Industrial Automation? Or is that a different bucket?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes, we have it, if we sell the assets of Leroy-Somer CT, then and we have a tax gain, that will be separate based on what we sell the price for. That's not included in the numbers. What we're talking about is all the reorganization of trying to get these assets repositioned either for a spin or a sale, a network and also reposition for L-S CT. So that does not include that. So if we get a good value for the sale of Leroy-Somer CT, then we'll have some incremental taxes, but we'll also obviously have a cash and a gain at the same time, too.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Can we use the Power Transmission sale as kind of a guide for the book value dynamics on those businesses? Or was there something unique about the taxes that you paid on that divestiture?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that this asset, people do want this asset. It is a unique asset from the standpoint there's a couple things that will make it different. One of them being that you have, the alternate business has a strategic, one large strategic customer. I think that I don't see the multiple, or the same type of multiple. Although it will still be a good multiple, it will not be the same dynamics that we had. And we bought these assets later in say the life of Emerson. The Power Transmission assets were bought, of lot of it was bought in the 1960s and 1970s, a little bit in the 1980s. But if you look at Leroy-Somer, that acquisition was done in 1989 and then a lot of the alternate business was done later, say in the 1990s and the 2000 time period. So I'd say the basis is probably higher.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then one last quick one, just on the Network Power side. I look at the EBIT contribution and the EBITDA contribution, and it looks to be, I don't know, around like 10% to 12% of the total. But a few people I've talked to say that the free cash flow generation of that business is higher than average. It outpunches its weight relative to EBITDA and profit. Is that correct? Is there something unique about their ability to generate cash over and above what they do on EBIT versus the other segments for any particular reason?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, one of the things, issues is on the Network Power businesses, there's amortization going on there which is not cash flow. So they do have because of that. So what you see, there is good cash flow bent generation. You're exactly right, Steve. There's good cash flow generation, better than you normally see, because there's amortization. It is a good cash flow generation business.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So we take that into consideration when we look at the total (63:31). It is different than most people would think because of that issue. You're exactly right.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome. With that, is that it?","Operator","We have no further questions.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Thank you. I want to thank everybody for calling today. Good questions, and I appreciate your input and support. And I tried to give you a little bit more clarity on what we see here for the next two to three quarters. Hopefully you have a better understanding for that. Look forward to meeting with you in Texas, and I guarantee, you will not have a foot of snow in Texas like we had a foot of snow in Boston a couple years ago.

A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.","I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Second quarter sales grew slightly to $6.0 billion, underlying sales increasing 2%. Results were mixed across end markets and geographies as slow global economic growth lowered confidence and suppress business investment especially in mature markets.","Gross margin expanded 30 basis points at 39.8% and EBIT margin of 14.9% improved 20 basis points led by 50 basis point of business segment margin expansion. Earnings per share of $0.77 increased 4% and free cash flow grew 18% to $477 million. Second quarter results reflected solid execution in a business environment struggling for certainty and momentum.","Next slide, P&L summary. Net sales of $5.960 billion grew 1% limited by macroeconomic sluggishness. Operating profit decreased 3%, as an increase in gross profit was offset by higher pension and stock compensation expense.","EBIT increased 2% with 20 basis points of margin expansion, up by lower restructuring and currency gains. Earnings per share grew 4% to $0.77 benefiting from 156 million of share repurchase in the quarter.","Next slide, sales by geography. Underlying sales in the U.S. grew 1%, Europe decreased 3%, Asia grew 2%, Latin America grew 8%, Canada was flat, and Middle East and Africa was up 19%. Total underlying sales increased 2%, currency translation and divestitures each deducted about 0.5%, hence the net sales increased 1%. Strong growth in emerging markets of 6% offset slow market conditions in mature markets.","Moving to slide 5, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 6% and free cash flow grew 18%, reflecting strong year-to-date cash generation. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 50 basis points from prior year, but improved to 140 basis points sequentially after a slow start to the year.","Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin improved 50 basis points, including a 30 basis point headwind from higher pension expense. Corporate expense increased $20 million primarily from the stock compensation program overlap. Pretax was up 2% and the tax rate received a small benefit from the R&D tax credit.","Moving to Slide 7, Process Management. Process Management net sales grew 8% and the underlying sales increased 9%, but the U.S. down 1%, Asia up 14%, Europe up 7%, Latin America up 13%, and Middle East and Africa up 36%. Solid investment continued in oil and gas, chemical and power end markets, and growth was led by the Systems and Solutions business. Underlying orders grew 3%, led by Asia up 16%. U.S. demand had slowed due to higher natural gas inventory and robust growth in the prior year.","Margin expanded 170 basis points benefiting from volume leverage, cost containment, and currency gains. Unfavorable mix remained a headwind due to lower maintenance investment in the U.S. The rate of growth is moderating, but should remain solid in the near-term supported by near record level backlog.","Next slide Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net underlying sales decreased 6% with the U.S. down 1%, Asia down 3%, Europe down 15%, Latin America up 11%, and Middle East and Africa flat. Industrial goods market conditions remained weak especially in Europe with the power generating alternators business the most challenged.","Industrial motors and electrical drives demand remained soft as well. Growth was solid in the hermetic motors business driven by HVAC compressor demand. Margin contracted 140 basis points as volume deleverage more than offset cost containment programs. Non-recurring dumping duties received in  the prior year resulted in a 30 basis point headwind as well. We expect weakness in global capital goods end markets to continue in the near-term.","Moving to Slide 9, Network Power. Network Power, net and underlying sales declined 4%, with the U.S. down 2%, Asia down 6%, Europe down 3%, Latin America up 8%, and Middle East and Africa down 10%. Weakness continued in global telecommunications and IT end markets.","Underlying sales in the Network Power Systems business declined slightly due to sluggish data center markets. Demand in Europe continues to be a headwind. Sales declined at a double-digit rate in the embedded computing and power business.","Margin declined 110 basis points as volume deleverage and other cost increases offset cost reduction programs. Data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending is expected to remain slow until macroeconomic growth accelerates.","Next Slide Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies\u2019s net and underlying sales grew 7% with the U.S. up 8%, Asia up 4%, Europe up 8%, Latin America down 5%, and Middle East and Africa up 26%, both were  strong in residential air conditioning markets with the U.S. up 23% due to data residential construction and favorable comparisons.","The commercial air conditioning and refrigeration businesses were soft, with transportation particularly weak. Comparisons eased in Europe as well. Margin expanded 50 basis points, as volume leverage and cost containment offset unfavorable mix from lower margin residential growth. Residential air conditioning markets are expected to moderate but grow  steadily in the near-term, commercial and refrigeration demand is expected to remain slow.","Moving to Slide 11, commercial and residential solutions; commercial and residential solutions\u2019 net sales declined 4% while underlying sales grew 2% as the Knaack business unit  divestiture deducted 6%. The U.S. was up 5%, Asia declined 5%, Europe declined 3%, Latin America grew 3%, and the Middle East and Africa decreased 39%. U.S. residential markets continued to reflect steady demand. Growth in the residential storage business was particularly strong. Margin expanded 30 basis points benefiting from cost reductions and a divestiture mix impact. Modest growth is expected to continue in North America residential end markets  in the near term.","Finally slide 12, 2013 outlook. After weaker than expected end market demand in February and March, April orders continued to trend downward with trailing three-month underlying orders expected to be negative 5% to 0%. Business confidence continues to deteriorate, and global economic growth lacks strength to drive an increase in business investments resulting in a productivity trap. We do not see an obvious catalyst to improve economic growth in the next six to nine months.","Based on current conditions, the revised 2013 outlook is as follows; reported underlying sales growth is now expected to be only 1.5% to 2.5%. EBIT and pretax margin are expected to be approximately equal to prior year, and earnings per share are expected to be $3.48 to $3.58, up 3% to 6% from prior year. An updated outlook by segment will be provided at the Electrical Products Group Conference on May 20, 2013.","With that, I\u2019ll pass it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much, Frank. Welcome everybody to the conference call. I appreciate you joining us. I also want to thank the tremendous support of all the OC members, the business leaders, and global presidents, and all the corporate key staff members as we drove through this first half and the second quarter.","Yes, we delivered growth of sales earnings and cash flow this quarter, but clearly not at the pace that we wanted to see as we left the quarter, in particular March. Late March and all throughout \u2013 late February and throughout March, we saw orders weaken, and now we\u2019ve seen April orders in the last couple of days, and they have continued to weaken.","The second half of February and on, we\u2019ve seen a significant change in the pace of business spending  around the world. Yes, there are pockets of growth like U.S. residential, Middle East oil and gas, Latin America oil and gas, but other part of the world had clearly taken a step back and are waiting to see where they want to spend their money.","In April and in particularly in the last couple of days, we went out and really pushed hard to find out where things were coming and the orders came in worse than expected, and we quickly realized that based on March, based on April, and what we\u2019re seeing with also the push out of improvements in gross fixed investment forecast in the most recent quarter and also the next quarter, we clearly see there\u2019s going to be a slowdown on our sales, and potentially, actually a negative sales quarter here that we\u2019re facing this quarter.","Over the last 30 to 60 days, this GFI slippage really has bothered me, given the words you keep hearing that things are getting better, and now all of a sudden you\u2019re seeing businesses are holding back and are pushing out their spending. they\u2019re spending money, but are being very cautious just like us. Our capital spending in the first half of the year is slower, just working on replacement, new products, and smaller increments of new capacity. As I referred to that productivity gap, basically our underlying sales growth right now is less than our productivity improvements, and hence we don\u2019t have to spend nearly as much capital and I believe every business out there based on the levels of profitability and productivity are seeing the same thing, we\u2019re not alone in that area.","Therefore, after seeing the March and the Q2 close results and now the weakest April orders and the GFI spending improvements being pushed out, we had to reset our earnings and sales expectations. Underlying sales now, we were talking about being in the 2% to 5% range, now we will be in the 1.5% to 2.5%. EBIT margin would be basically flat plus or minus a tenth. EPS will be in the $3.53 or going from $3.53 to $3.63, down to now $3.48, $3.58 basically our nickel off our forecast that we have presented in February.","It clearly is a step down in the pace of business. Still growing, still delivering profitability, but the activity level is significantly lower than you would expect just 60 days ago. Our asset management and cash flow remains extremely strong in the first half and we do anticipate record levels of operating cash flow and free cash flow. With our current capital allocation of about $1.2 billion going to dividends, about $0.5 billion into acquisitions, we now have increased our share repurchase into the 800 million to 900 million range, probably closer to 900 million this year for fiscal 2013.","Here is our intention to return  a minimum of 60% of our operating cash flow to shareholders in 2013 given the slow growth environment and given that we do not see any significant acquisitions that we must accomplish this year. The same fundamental issues that we have been working on and discussing in February are still there.","So we are dealing with a much slower growth market. Europe has continued to weaken, more negative than before. We most likely will be \u2013 our sales will most likely best be flat and most likely slightly down. Brazil has weakened, but still growing and China has weakened but still growing. Again, we are seeing pockets of growth and what we are going through right now as we drive towards this 2% underlying sales growth, which is less than last year\u2019s 2.6%, we are having to go and reallocate where we want to put our money for those growth programs and for the investments we want to see to drive the improving growth as we go out in the later years. We are driving record levels of profitability, EPS, and cash flow, but growth will be the big issue. We will continue to focus on improving Network Power and also to continue to free up resources for the rest of this year and set up and improve investment  in other areas for future growth and improve our profitability as we go forward ending in 2013 going into 2014.","Net-net, second quarter was not nearly strong quarter as we wanted, but the first half came in almost exactly what we thought. The big issue for us right now is based on orders and based on the current expectations of the GFI in the next two quarters we cannot deliver the 2% to 5% underlying sales growth. Therefore we\u2019re going to have to pull back our earnings per share growth and our second half will not be that pick \u2013 stronger pick up that we initially had forecasted.","Overall, it will be a good year, but the growth is going to be the key issue for all us in the business and we\u2019re not seeing it right now. The consumer spending business has been very cautious. Our cost structure is in good shape. We are reallocating some of our cost reduction and restructuring efforts, but fundamentally we\u2019re in good shape from a profitability standpoint, and we feel good about what\u2019s going to happen here as we go forward though it\u2019s going to be a lower growth.","I mentioned back in November that I actually did expect one negative growth or EPS growth this year, and I said most likely to be a third quarter, I believe it will be the third quarter. I believe that will be at best flat most, likely slightly down in sales based on the three months rolling underlying order pace, which will again be more negative when we get April numbers finalized and present them in the next couple of weeks.","And that will drive most likely the lower sales or flat sales, and because of a very, very difficult comparisons of profitability last year as we recovered from Thailand, the third quarter profitability is extremely tough hurdle, and I would say the most likely we will have a down third quarter earnings per share and then recovered as we go back in the fourth quarter. I said the same thing back in November and now that we are here in the order pace that\u2019s what kind of happen as I look at this point in time.","So with that I want to again thank all the people around Emerson for the hard work they put into the first half. Clearly, growth is a big issue for us and we\u2019re having to redirect our resources to deliver that growth and find that growth.","And with that, I\u2019ll open the lines and take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi, thank you.","David N. Farr","Hello.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi. So firstly, I guess on the Network Power, you called out other costs being a drag on the earnings year-on-year in Q2, the decremental margins in Network Power has been pretty big sort of 40% or 50% for three quarters in a row now. Can you just talk a little bit about those other costs, what\u2019s going on in the mix and if you think that we can get a year-on-year growth in EBIT in Network Power in any quarter this year?","David N. Farr","Yeah, I mean from our perspective as we look at it right now, if you look at this quarter in particular, we did have some very challenging mix from the Network Power systems business in particular as they looked at a slowdown here in projects in North America and a further deterioration in Europe. We have gone out and launched as this quarter finalized some new incremental restructuring efforts that will have an impact for us in the second half of this year that would drive an improvement in the second half profitability. But as I look at the basic Network Power systems business profitability, it will improve as it has historically in the third and fourth quarters and we\u2019ll see a little bit of improvement in the sales as it historically has done, and that\u2019s the way that seasonal business works, but we do expect continued improvement as the year goes on, and the restructuring has really been launched and that will help us in the fourth quarter.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks. And then within the Climate Tech, you talked about some moderation maybe in some of the stronger markets recently like U.S. residential. Is that just in comparison to the 23% growth number you called out or are you saying there is a general kind of market slow down as well in HVAC there?","David N. Farr","From our perspective, right now what we\u2019re seeing is, April is very cold and wet and so we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we had a good three or four months in U.S. residential, and now a slowdown is occurring because of the weather more than anything else. So our customers are keeping their inventories very tight and they are driving back and forth based on the pace of what\u2019s going on in the weather in the near-term and it\u2019s not been very  good. Overall, Climate Technologies has had a good couple months in orders and I now expect their orders to actually be negative as we get into this month and next month because of more of the weather related than anything else.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. And just lastly, quickly on process, you have a \u2013 you pulled out the mix from U.S. aftermarket being weak. Is that something you think can come back, it just a short-term thing and as long as the facilities are running, aftermarket should snap back soon or there is no visibility really on when that could happen?","David N. Farr","Historically it does go in lumps and we had a very long and we -- it stayed up longer than I thought last year on the North America MRO. There was a lot of investments if you remember our process business last year was up well north of 20%. I would expect that we will start improving as the rest of this year, maybe not this quarter, but the next quarter, the fourth quarter and going into the next year as our customers digest what the money they \u2013 the capital they did bring in and putting in place, and so this is pretty normal. You had a surge, and then also may back off and they surge  again. So I would expect probably another quarter of tougher comparisons in the OEM or the aftermarket and then maybe the fourth and first fiscal quarter next year getting better.","Julian C. Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Thanks, and good afternoon","David N. Farr","Good afternoon.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Dave, could I just make sure I understand also in terms of how you articulated the change over the last couple of weeks, the thing that really moved you to lower guidance relative to where you were a couple of weeks ago? Was it really the April -- just what you were seeing in April quarters?","David N. Farr","Yeah, I think there are two things that could cause me to change. I watched the close and seeing how things closed as we closed in early March. And then the April orders and the third thing, as I looked at the push out of the forecast by quarter, as we\u2019re seeing the economics come in the last couple of weeks. What\u2019s happening is they keep saying GFI around the world is going to improve. But they keep moving it a quarter. And so, I mean they did the same thing to us here in the  second quarter, so there wasn\u2019t any incremental improvement in actually the second quarter GFI that we look at, and there was going to be an improvement in the third quarter, last third quarter has now been pushed out again.","And they haven\u2019t changed the year much, but they just keep pushing it. And therefore, the combination of those three things as I sat there after we put out our 8-K, did look at it. This thing has not been coming back, and then when orders came in, I said, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that we have the next couple of months, the next couple of quarters could be challenging, and we better address these issues. That\u2019s why.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay. And the second question is around the margin expansion on the volumes. So the reported number was 20 basis points. But then thinking about pension and the Industrial Automation issue and the stock comp and all of this, I mean what were you thinking, you achieved on kind of a more normalized basis in the quarter and what does that make us think going forward particularly as I recall, you\u2019re talking about those price cost tailwinds that you currently have and used to have and the question whether those will continue. And how does that come out and how are you thinking about it?","David N. Farr","I don\u2019t really -- Maybe Steve, I don\u2019t go -- we don\u2019t go normalizing taking stuff in and out, because what happens is things hit us  from time-to-time. And so, we have to absorb that, and so I don\u2019t look and say, hey, we really did five tenths improvement. But clearly, we had a little bit higher margin improvement, EBIT margin if you take those things out, but the way I look at it is, I\u2019m trying to figure out how to improve my EBIT margin all in, and that\u2019s the way I look at. So I don\u2019t sit here and peel things back to make myself feel good about a higher margin. We firmly delivered to our shareholders, this EBIT margin for the quarter, and that\u2019s how we look at it, 20 basis points improvement and that\u2019s how we looked at it.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay.","David N. Farr","I mean, if I parse this thing, I can make myself feel real good all the time.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay. So how about the price cost side of it then?","David N. Farr","The freight cost right now, I mean the costs are coming down. There\u2019s no doubt that the input commodities right now what we call our net material inflation has actually continued to get better for us or lower, so therefore the issues, the costs coming in or better. And therefore, the price environment for us at this point in time, you know the gap is okay, and I most likely will have a situation as the material stay down there, and I am going to have pricing will be tougher for us to get and to hold, because we expect the net material inflation to start getting higher as the year went on and now it\u2019s starting to be more negative.","So (indiscernible) now as the year goes in the second half as people look at the pricing for some of the commodities. So right now, it\u2019s okay, but I really deal with the more negative net material inflation than trying to hold back price than trying to deal with a higher inflation environment from our perspective right now. Does that make sense?","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Yeah, it does. And your typically lead time, when do you start seeing that material inflation steadying and the prices lead time or lag time, so that is -- usually you can hold it for a quarter or two or a couple of quarters?","David N. Farr","You are looking at one quarter typically.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Yeah.","David N. Farr","Some business it\u2019s one quarter, some businesses it\u2019s two quarters. So it\u2019s on average let\u2019s say three to four months.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC.","Okay, great. I\u2019ll hand it off. Thanks.","David N. Farr","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Mike Wood from Macquarie.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Hi, good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Can you talk about your China and other emerging market trends, the 6% growth that you reported there? Do you think about that as a function of the market growth or is this the investments that are leading the outperformance there and if you could just talk about the outlook for those markets?","David N. Farr","The emerging markets look pretty good to us right now. We continue to make investments. In the emerging markets, you can have a good quarter, bad quarter, and you move back and forth, it is a little bit more volatile, though I could say the same  thing about Europe. But right now when we look at our emerging markets, we see China continue to grow. We\u2019ll probably see China grow somewhere between 4% and 5% this year and across the board based on the markets we serve doing pretty well. So a little bit less I would have thought we were going to be more like 5% to 8%. But I think the underlying economic environment in China is a little bit weaker.","Southeast Asia continues to grow nicely for us, high single digits, a little bit weaker because obviously China impacts there a little bit. India is a marketplace that\u2019s holding up, but I\u2019m very nervous about it, but it\u2019s still holding up for us as is the Middle East and Latin America. So overall, our emerging \u2013 I see pretty good growth in the emerging markets for the rest of this year. What we are concerned about is, obviously, now we\u2019re going to have a negative out of Europe, which we thought maybe would get us to breakeven in sales growth, but it\u2019s going to be negative and I expect the weaker U.S. marketplace. So the actual from my perspective right now based on the recovery in the U.S., which has been pushed out and muted a little bit, and then obviously Europe continues to weaken. So the emerging markets are going to do pretty well based on investments we\u2019ve been making on the last couple of years.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. And then you also mentioned the rationalization in embedded, is this just procedures you are going to before selling the business or is it something that you might decide to hold on to trying to improve the profile that embedded business?","David N. Farr","We\u2019ve been \u2013 we started this process last year and as the market continues to hit, we thought the market will stabilize as we start our fiscal year, but that was a fake and is continuing to drop down as you see in the near-term in the embedded customer paid. So what we\u2019ve continued to do is take our product lines and customers that this do not support what we can do the profitability and the cash flow needs that business. So we have continued to take out business and therefore hurt our sales that we think it just makes no sense long-term for this business. We\u2019re making decisions in this business, there are right decisions for other [orders] or the future owners are going to be.","Mike R. Wood \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Okay. Thank you.","David N. Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Chris.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.","I have a bigger picture question stepping back on network power. If you look at the CAGR\u2019s you\u2019ve laid out in February for 2012 to 2015, you\u2019d be backing into network power having the strongest performance in 2014 and 2015? And wondering just, if that remains reasonable or some of the data center growth drivers of the past have kind of played themselves out maybe take the cycle off?","David N. Farr","In the last (inaudible) our new forecasts are 2014 and 2015. But clearly, the spending need of this industry is still out there. I just think people being very cautious right now. I still believe that we will come back and it has \u2013 there is always \u2013 there is a lot of trends going on, but we try to take those in consideration both the positive and the negatives. So I haven\u2019t really looked at 14 or 15, again in 60 days, but I, I mean, my feeling is that business will return to growth and as we get \u2013 as we move out of the embedded power computing business, we will some reasonable growth in the Network Power Systems business, so I still say we\u2019d come back.","David N. Farr","Okay. I know you more position now as agnostic between transformer (inaudible) data centers?","Unidentified Company Representative","Oh, yeah, we\u2019re \u2013 our transformers products out and has been now since six, seven months ago. So we\u2019re in very good shape there now, and we have that capability around the world.","David N. Farr","Thank you.","Unidentified Company Representative","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","What you said about kind of your deal play folder and share repurchase kind of explicitly suggest deals are not a priority and that\u2019s obviously not a new statement relative to what you said in the few months or so. But just stepping back and looking at the portfolio, I mean, there are somethings you maybe have to do, change the complexion of IA is probably kind of a biggest one. How should we think about how you address that if there\u2019s urgency to do, are you going \u2013 there\u2019s kind of a practical way you to get at that relative to what the targets might be?","David N. Farr","Yeah, I don\u2019t think it changed \u2013 I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, I mean, we continue to explore different ways, to try \u2013 to add to that space be it through ventures are going to acquisitions and \u2013 but at this point in time, it\u2019s not my priority at all. My priority is to continue sale and finish the sale of the embedded power computing business. And then finish the stabilization of the Network Power Systems business and get return for my shareholders. So at this point in time, we are doing small pipeline acquisition, we\u2019re continuing to work on those and we will continue to work on those. But those are primarily focused right now on our process management climate technology and that will be the focus for the next six to nine months. And as we generate the cash, we\u2019re going to pass it back to the shareholders at this point in time. Our balance sheet is extremely strong and if one of the opportunities that we\u2019ve discussed in IA comes forward, an opportunity comes up. I discussed it to the board a couple of times a year. We\u2019ll move forward, but right now that\u2019s not where we\u2019re focusing on.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then just thinking about the share repurchase announcement than they have sold 70 million shares, call it roughly $4 billion, maybe more than that of today\u2019s prices. You are doing 900 this year, should we assume this is kind of a four or five-year process then they get that much stock out or give them a (inaudible) have while we will be discussing that out.","David N. Farr","Right now from my perspective, it\u2019s going to be a four or five-year process just like it took us almost five \u2013 not quite five years, the last time. I mean we did it five years ago, same thing. If we see \u2013 I will make one change in it. If we see that the market stays at moderate growth and we do not see the acquisition opportunities and we continue to generate the cash, then clearly we could look at taking that up a little higher and accelerating that. But this point in time, I still believe that you\u2019re going to see some acceleration improving the underlying market growth and we will continue to push acquisitions and one of them will pop as they always do. So from our plan base we said, four or five years, it can be faster. But right now, it\u2019s four or five years.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right. And then just one other final one if I could, so it sounds like there is a process backlog that\u2019s still pretty strong. I guess near record means it\u2019s down a little bit. But more importantly, what does kind of the margin mix look like coming out of backlog the next year or so between projects and after-market, I mean how should we think about margins?","David N. Farr","I mean the process margins right now are going to be \u2013 they\u2019re going to be operating this year about the same level they operated last year. It\u2019s not that much change. We have a quarter. the flow through this year \u2013 this quarter was not that exciting, but I mean, we had less North America. I mean, obviously, if you had a strong North America; you\u2019d have a higher margin. but right now, I would say their margins for the year at the EBIT levels has been very close to what it was last year, probably up slightly and the backlog looks pretty good. The backlog actually, if you just look at our peer backlog was actually was flat with last year if you adjust for it, and so our backlog is versus last year, is down slightly, versus the first quarter, it\u2019s up slightly. So we have the backlog right now, the question is executing it. And so from my perspective, our backlog did improve slightly in the second quarter across the board and it\u2019s still a little bit down versus last year when we had, we\u2019re observing that obviously the time and time across the whole company. So we have the backlog. my concern is this the last five or six weeks, this underlying order pace and it\u2019s not just one if you look at the order line, order trend chart, all the businesses are trending downwards, and they have been quite significantly and so \u2013 and with the GFI moving out, it\u2019s pretty clear to me in the near-term, we\u2019re not going to overcome that, and it\u2019s just the fundamental of what\u2019s going on at this point in time.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","So it will be just like 2008 here?","Unidentified Company Representative","No, we\u2019re not coming off that high level. No\u2026","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Unidentified Company Representative","I mean, there has been very little recovery in the market space, [Ben]. This is like, we get a couple of good months or maybe a couple of good quarters, and then things soften up again, so it\u2019s a very tough world out there right now.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yeah.","Unidentified Company Representative","And what we\u2019re trying to flex around our resources for growth and our restructuring base, what\u2019s going on our capital at this, they are all \u2013 there\u2019s a lot going on, lot of moving parts.","Jeff T. Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Great. Thanks, good luck.","Unidentified Company Representative","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays. Please go ahead.","David N.

Farr","Yeah, we\u2019ll go.","Operator","\u2026from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hey Dave good afternoon.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon. Thanks.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","I\u2019m wondering, how do you think you performed in the quarter versus your market that you serve? Are there areas where you think you did better and other where you think end markets \u2013 maybe performed a little faster than Emerson?","David N. Farr","My feeling is about a quarter; it\u2019s very difficult. I feel like overall excluding and better power in computing, we did very well this quarter. I mean I know in climate, we did very well from a growth standpoint. I know the residential guys did very well this year. I know that on a global basis, the Network Power systems did very well and process obviously did I think that\u2019s extremely well again this quarter. So I look those trends, I feel very good. And I look at more \u2013 I don\u2019t count outperformance against anything in the sense \u2013 12 month because in choir doesn\u2019t make much difference. But overall, the underlying growth at 2% in total is pretty good given what we face in the macroeconomic downturn. So it\u2019s not enough to drive, I would say incremental margins and incremental higher margin, incremental growth for us is bottom line because we\u2019re running at high level of profitability right now. We are running at high levels of cash flow and we\u2019re fighting, trying to find the pockets of growth, and as soon as you find one, you use another one. So overall I feel pretty good about it.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Go ahead sorry","David N. Farr","And the other big issue is our largest customer has been in a huge inventory reduction now for two quarter, Caterpillar. That\u2019s taken a significant growth out and we understand. And we participate in that and we\u2019re closely associate with them and we deal with that issue. But that\u2019s hurt us a lot in that whole industrial segment because of what they\u2019ve done with inventory. And that will come out and they\u2019ve taken a lot of inventory out of that company in the last two quarters.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Will you mention order slowing since the end of February? And s you mentioned that it\u2019s broad, meaning it\u2019s touching all your segments. Is that \u2013 did you see kind of an accelerated pace of project activity being pushed to the right or was it\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","Not project, it\u2019s more day-to-day.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah.","Unidentified Company Representative","It started really, we started towards the end of February and really \u2013 so really hard in the second half of March and we see in throughout April. it\u2019s not a project; the projects are moving pretty well as we anticipated, the project wins, the project order to close, the projects still. We see they haven\u2019t changed. It\u2019s the day-to-day spending that we\u2019re seeing people being very cautious where if I\u2019m going to add some kind of incremental capacity am I going to do this, I am going to do half of it, and I am going to slow it down. And it\u2019s no different than way I\u2019m acting (inaudible) Emerson right now to the honor.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Yeah. It makes sense. So what happened if we get to six to nine months out and the world hasn\u2019t really changed from Emerson standpoint, would you consider, I mean, you guys have a lot more flexibilities on other companies right through balance sheet and so forth. Would you consider more of say broader action solution to try and (inaudible) things up, I could be say, a bigger restructuring action in Europe or something else or..","Unidentified Company Representative","I don't think so, I don\u2019t \u2013 from a standpoint, picking thing, I am trying to go out and do so big acquisition, the answer is probably not. I don\u2019t see (inaudible) I can figure out how to create value or two, from a restructuring standpoint, we have been restructuring quite heavily, do you know from 2008 or late 2008 until early this year and I think from my perspective, our cost structure is in very good shape. We\u2019re running at very high levels of profitability right now. So the cost structure are repositioning around the world is very good. And so we\u2019re going to be trying to mind the pockets of growth and try to get \u2013 how to get some growth. And I think that gains can be playing out here, it could play up for a couple of years, you\u2019re right. If we see no fundamental improvement in demand or underlying growth, then we\u2019re going to be looking for those pockets of growth out there.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s makes sense. And just lastly, how does your China business do sequentially? It looks, it\u2019s not easier to compare year-over-year, but what happened to China as the quarter progressed?","David N. Farr","I think, I mean, they are going to look at the hard numbers. My gut tells me China did better in the second quarter.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Isn\u2019t it?.","David N. Farr","Yeah, we did slightly better in the second quarter.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Industrial automation, how are you thinking about the business? I know you took a fair amount of restructuring out, just from a margin standpoint, you\u2019ve got the CAD issue right now, and that will play itself out. But when you start to see some growth, how do you think the leverage plays out there, it seems like it\u2019s running pretty lean in your position for some pretty decent leverage once you see \u2013 start to see some growth?","David N. Farr","I mean, we saw \u2013 last year we leveraged as we came back \u2013 and I think that we will leverage right back up again. It\u2019s a business that has a \u2013 from a restructuring standpoint we got a few things we\u2019re doing this year, and they will be done, and so our cost structure is going to be really finely tuned. So I think from the standpoint, as we see caterpillar come back on, we would stay well, don\u2019t get the inventory out and correct it, as we see some of the other industrial base tick back up. We\u2019ll see that profit margin will pick back up again. I feel good about that. Our cost structure right now, I mean they are holding their deleverage pretty well right here with the cost structure they have. So I feel good about that, so we\u2019ll come back up like we have historically.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","And then back on the M&A, you talked potentially about doing bolt-ons, $500 million or less, what\u2019s your view on that now?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, (Inaudible) I mean, I think, we took a deal to the board today for a little bit over $400 million bolt-on.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, so that\u2019s still intact as you look out to next several months.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, the number of ones, we\u2019ve been working, we have a pool and we work a lot, a lot, a lot and in this environment right now, we\u2019ve not been able to get a lot of \u2013 broken free, but we have double on the process, we have one in the Climate where we are working right now and nothing more else at this point in time. So from my perspective, we\u2019re going to continue to try to find the bolt-ons, and in quarter we\u2019re going to work them because that\u2019s I think in the marketplace that will be the best chance to one to get unique technology, a new market space and have more value from our shareholders.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, and last one from me what\u2019s the updated CapEx number for the year?","Unidentified Company Representative","Right now, we didn\u2019t change it, it\u2019s $700 million, but last year I think we did around $665 million, the $700 million, well, my directors asked me today, what do you think and I said it could be somewhere in between there.","Richard M. Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay.","Unidentified Company Representative","I mean, they are trying to make sure that I am not stripping our capital unnecessarily, so I \u2013 there is no reason. I think we\u2019re \u2013 our plan is pretty well set, and my gut tells me it will be less than $700 million, it will be more than $665 million.","Richard M.

Good afternoon.","Unidentified Company Representative","Hey, Dean.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Hey, Dave, I was hoping when you talked about the color regarding April orders it was interesting you didn\u2019t want to blame it on one geography and lot of people have been finger-pointing at Europe, but could you just give us a sense how the fall off in orders trended from the major geographies?","David N. Farr","I don\u2019t have that detail, I mean, I\u2019ll be very (inaudible) I don\u2019t have that. I went out early and got them because first of all, I had a board meeting yesterday and today, and we also wanted to announce the earnings and \u2013 and start the quarter up for the year","Unidentified Company Representative","I mean, I can\u2019t get \u2013 I know what it was like in March, but I can\u2019t \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s hard for me to say, I\u2019ll have that by the time we get down in the EPG stock. Give me some more dates for that to come in. They won\u2019t be coming here for \u2013formally coming in for another two or three days. So I don\u2019t have that.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Qualitatively does it feel like it\u2019s broad based or is it more centered in Europe?","Unidentified Company Representative","I\u2019d say what I would say based on what I saw in March I would say April is the same and it would be Europe, it would be some in the U.S. Industrials, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I didn\u2019t see some weakness in Latin America and Brazil. But I think China is okay. I think Southeast Asia is okay based on what I\u2019m hearing from people. Frank Dellaquila and I came back from Europe and that\u2019s not doing very well at all right now.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","I just want to go back to your answer to Jeff\u2019s question regarding whether it\u2019s also line 2008 and I was thinking that it would be a question that was long lines of the pace of the deceleration, the types of orders that are falling off and said your comment was, were coming from that higher level. But maybe you just talk about how much it feels like 2008 or whether it doesn\u2019t and it didn\u2019t sound like CapEx projects we are getting pushed out a bit more of the short cycle. But just could you verify that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Yeah, I mean I look at 2008 we\u2019d keep in mind 2008 we had a very strong economic environment coming out from \u201907, \u201908 and then just the bottom fell out from our perspective as you looked at that. This one here, we just started coming back up, the industrial business has just started coming back up since late 2012 as I look at the businesses and then it sort of came back up in a moderate level and they sort of flatten out and then they saw and they rolled.","Nothing I see or feel as you are going to have sharp, I don\u2019t see a sharp drop off, I see it fighting at low levels of growth, and if you even look at the \u2013 indicators would tell you that you don\u2019t see a lot of expenses, you\u2019re going to be dissipating some negative growth and some positive growth, that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now, but not a sudden drop off. I do not see their contraction. 2008, the market is constructed very rapidly as all of those rents geared about money. And so we all start spending so rapidly, I don\u2019t see, that\u2019s up to same thing right now, we\u2019re being cautious, I\u2019m still spending money, but I\u2019m spending at a pace a lot less than we originally thought, it\u2019s a different feel for us.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And just a last one from me maybe for Frank, is there a lot of the companies this quarter have been showing a bigger benefit from the R&D tax credit. But yours did not look as meaningful to preserve anything going on there?","David N. Farr","No.","Frank J. Dellaquila","No. Nothing, it\u2019s just the usual. It\u2019s just not as big for us as it is the sum.","David N. Farr","Yeah. Maybe we got a moderate pickup. we\u2019ve probably get as much offshore as we did onshore, so it\u2019s very moderate.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Investment Research","Okay. Thank you.","David N.

Please go ahead.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr","Good afternoon, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Hey, Dave, you mentioned freeing up resources to invest in other areas for future growth. I think, can you maybe fill that out a little bit in terms of what you mean by freeing up and what a kind of units, the priority areas to deploy?","David N. Farr","From my perspective is, if I see the market improvement delaying and say, in some of the industrial space or even certain pockets, the Climate space, Climate Technology space. We\u2019re taking some of that money and redeploying it from some of that incremental growth programs back over to process or back in some of the emerging market space at this point in time. so the business leaders, we\u2019ve set up that $45 million, $40 million of strategic money every year to begin the year. and then the business if there is an need with the OC members and Charlie, Frank, myself, Ed, and Craig, all will debate with the business there. And we reallocate, we\u2019ll pick the money back out of one area and (inaudible) hey, we\u2019re not going to spend nearly this year, things aren\u2019t picking up, we should just hold off from that, and we\u2019ll reallocate that back over maybe into some of the other emerging markets or some of the other technology play. So that is something we\u2019ve learned how to do the last couple of years is this what I call the chart topper marketplace and we\u2019re going through that right now as we get ready for the second half of this year and as we get ready for the beginning of next year. And then things \u2013 again will push the money back over, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now, Shannon, and that\u2019s what I am talking about.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","So process and emerging markets are kind of the two big areas that you\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","I\u2019d say this, the two guys right now getting it.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Okay. And then I understand that productivity trap, but I guess, just from a macro standpoint, I mean, there has been so many things weighing our business confidence, what do you think the current priority is in terms of things that are really holding people back?","Unidentified Company Representative","In the U.S., it\u2019s primarily the onslaught of regulations coming out, and things that we are all trying to digest both from I think from a customer standpoint and my standpoint and most likely the customer standpoint. In Europe, I think that the fact that money for the small medium sized businesses, which a lot of our customers, it\u2019s still extremely hard to get and they are being very cautious at investing, so \u2013 because they can\u2019t get the money from the bank, so that will be the European scenario.","China, I think the big issue is they have plenty of excess capacity and going back, Frank just point to me so there are two things that always are a little bit of a struggle on our customer base as to healthcare costs that are coming out. We know it\u2019s already starting to hit us and so my customer base is right now (inaudible) they\u2019re going to have to spend a lot more money there. And then finally, I think will be the tax policy. I think people are still been hoping that we get come kind of clarity and tax policy relative to where we invest and how we \u2013 maybe we can reallocate our cash flow around the world. But right now we\u2019re getting no clarity on that. So I think businesses are going to be extremely tight with our money. And a lot of these businesses are going to expect \u2013 sending that money back to the shareholders and the balance sheets are getting stronger.","Shannon O'Callaghan \u2013 Nomura Securities International","Okay, great.

Just a follow up on the process margin comment from earlier, I understand you said that for the year, you\u2019d still expect to be up a little bit. How did \u2013 is that frame out in the second half? Obviously, the margin comps there are a little bit tougher and then if the top line of the story by the make up from Thailand as well?","David N. Farr","Yeah, even on a normal basis, as we look at our normal process trend line, they historically have higher sales in the second half. And so we expect that to happen even though \u2013 if you try to look at comps last year, (inaudible) on me in here. If you look at \u2013 cough it on me, if you look at the first half, the second half typically, we would see incrementally higher volume and then \u2013 and therefore we leverage it. So if you look at our first half EBIT, we ran 17.6, is this correct, Frank? 17.6 and then a 20 point quarter-to-quarter. And then \u2013 so we are going to be running in the low 20s, then a little bit higher 20s, mid 20 \u2013 towards the mid 20 by the fourth quarter. That\u2019s just based on the normal volumes that we see in that business. So I don\u2019t see any change there.","Joshua C. Pokrzywinski \u2013 MKM Partners LLC","Okay. So maybe flattish margins year-over-year in the second half?","David N. Farr","Oh, you\u2019re looking at that? Okay. No, the third quarter margin in last year was phenomenally strong. We do not \u2013 I think you\u2019re going to see more of the normal type of margin. Typically we see a slight margin improvement from second and third. And so, we did 20%, you are going to see, let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to be around 21% for the third quarter and then typically the volume picks -- we usually have a fourth quarter volume pick up. It happens initially in the fourth quarter. And then you see a couple of more points pick up. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Last year we had a huge pick up in the third quarter. That\u2019s not going to happen this year.","Unidentified Company Representative","I\u2019m sorry, I just explain to me, my fault.","Joshua C.

I think one of your quasi competitors in this space had had some business loss. I\u2019m wondering, I wanted to see if that was our \u2013 or that plus 23 was just pure organic?","Unidentified Company Representative","There is real growth, let\u2019s put that way.

Process management, if I could in the back half when you\u2019re looking in growth remaining stable. Can you break that down for us by end market specifically? Oil and gas, obviously we know the dynamics. But utilities especially, domestic, international have you seen any softness refer to lot of chatter out of Europe on utilities just shutting down, CapEx is in process. So can you break down a little bit for us?","Unidentified Company Representative","Actually utility business is doing pretty well. We\u2019re not the major player in Europe. So we have two companies that are a little bit stronger than we are, and you could probably name who those two companies are in utility industry. We\u2019re doing pretty well in Europe, but we\u2019re not the major player. Our Asia business is extremely strong right now in China, we\u2019re very strong in China and Korea. And we are \u2013 we have a very good presence in North America and we\u2019re seeing pretty good pace of business in North America right now. So we have not seen any slow down and our utility business and the key markets we serve. So I expect to have a very good year in the utility markets and then when we saw that system, we get obviously the instrumentations goes and that control valves go along with that.","And oil and gas, we see that continue to grow. Right now, I think, I look at Latin America still do well this year, I still think that we\u2019re going to see a very good business environment for Middle East and Africa, it\u2019s been very good for us. I think the China has been continued to be very good for us in the second half of our book orders in China. We\u2019re very strong in the first half. We had a good sales growth but I expect our China to be driven by our process business and Southeast Asia has done well. So, yeah, I think the actual two weeks is markets for us for process are going to be Canada and United States because we had such strong growth last year. (inaudible) some recovery in both Canada and United States, but I think you\u2019re going to see our international business driving our process management in the second half of this year.","John Quealy \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","All right, thanks.

With the mixed concern of projects and the paperwork that you have deal with projects, we created some of the problem and then some of it is just our customers using us as a bank, but our receivables actual, what we call past-due receivables have come down from their peak and we expect that to continue to come down. So it was part of our cash flow improvement from Q1 to Q2 and I think that will continue to be the focus for us in Q3. We reviewed in detail with the board today, and I have to say the guys I called out here are doing a great job and we had a call to action and they did it, and I feel very pleased with them.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.

So should we kind of then imply that you really extended out competition there and that you guys have won the battle if you will and it\u2019s still stable\u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","Well.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","\u2026or is there still some volatility there ahead?","Unidentified Company Representative","We did very well in the first six months this year. We have several new products out within the Asian marketplace both in variable speed and some of our new compressor, not, variable speeds and the fixed speeds stuff, so that\u2019s helping us. So we actually \u2013 we did gain in China in the first six months. Relative to China, I never count my chickens or eggs until we got them into the oven, and so we\u2019re going to keep working at that from a technology standpoint, we\u2019ve got to stay ahead of this and make sure we do well. But we did well as you saw in the first six months. Purvis and his team did a great job there. And now in North America, we obviously had a very strong start, the inventories were low. We did pickup a couple of new accounts and we see some new technologies coming to play on the HVAC side. My concern right now is the weakness in transportation and in (inaudible) and then we are hoping to see that come back late this calendar year, which will help us get into 2015. But right now execution wise on the residential on a global basis, it was a very good six-month and now we got to keep it going.","Scott R. Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then last Dave, do you think we\u2019ll expect or do you expect at least to have some finality through embedded in the next 60 days, 90 days or is it more a couple of quarters out?","David N. Farr","We wanted to drive this to be \u2013 to confirmation before this fiscal goes out. So yes, we are moving \u2013 that\u2019s what we are moving, we\u2019ll update the board that we will move in that leg.

Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my call and question. You guys have been known to give aggressive guidance, would you consider the guidance you just gave out for the rest of the year gives the ability of your dog even jump over?","David N. Farr","I\u2019ve gotten in a mode now as the first guy (inaudible) Dora. We tried to give guidance as Dora can jump over.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. This conference is being recorded today, February 2, 2016.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Craig Rossman","Thank you, Alisha. I'm joined today by Dave Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2016 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's Web site. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the Web site for the next 90 days.","I will start with the first quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation. Net sales in the quarter decreased 16% to $4.7 billion with underlying sales down 9%. Our results reflected a continuation of the difficult economic conditions that were experienced during most of fiscal 2015. We continue to find ourselves in the midst of a global industrial recession, and recent economic data suggests that capital spending by industrial businesses weakened during the course of the fourth calendar quarter.","In the energy sector, lower but equally as important uncertain oil prices continued to impact both operational and capital spending by our end customers. Reported earnings per share in the first quarter decreased 29% to $0.53. Adjusted earnings per share, which exclude $24 million in separation costs, were better than our previous expectation of $0.50. These separation costs relate to our portfolio repositioning actions, specifically the planned spinoff of Network Power and the potential divestitures of the Motors and Drives and Power Generation businesses.","Overall, the first quarter results were slightly better than our expectations, and the company remains well positioned for a challenging 2016. Turning to Slide 3. Gross profit margin in the quarter decreased 70 basis points to 40.1%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. EBIT reflects the impacts of unfavorable currency transactions of $27 million and portfolio repositioning separation cost of $24 million. Additionally, the aggressive restructuring actions initiated in 2015 are beginning to have a positive impact on profitability.","During the quarter, approximately 12 million shares were repurchased for $554 million. The company still plans fiscal year share repurchase to reach approximately 1.2 billion. Turning to Slide 4. Underlying sales were down in all regions except Europe, where our euro based businesses are becoming more globally competitive.","Turning to Slide 5. Business segment margin declined 170 basis points to 13.3%, primarily due to volume deleverage and unfavorable mix, partially offset by the savings from restructuring actions. Operating cash flow was down 15%, reflects the impact of lower earnings. Similar to many industrial manufacturers, capital spending was reduced due to lower global demand. Capital spending was down 30%.","Turning to Slide 6. Process management underlying sales declined 11% in the quarter. Energy sector spending remained at challenging levels as lower and increasingly uncertain oil prices further pressured spending, particularly in upstream markets. Upstream projects underway will continue to completion but new projects are facing potentially further delays. Downstream markets remained favorable in the U.S., Europe, and Middle East, mainly on small to medium size projects in the chemical and power markets. We will continue to shift our resources to capitalize on more favorable business activity levels in downstream and life sciences markets.","Turning to Slide 7. Industrial automation first quarter underlying sales declined 15%, reflecting continued weakness from a global industrial recession and reduced levels of spending in upstream oil and gas customers. These conditions are expected to continue into the second quarter with improvement expected in the second half of the fiscal year. Turing to Slide 8. Network Power underlying sales declined 1% in the quarter as global demand for data center and telecommunications infrastructure spending was mixed. From a regional perspective, Asia had growth in Australia, India, and South East Asia, while Latin America reflected favorable data center activity levels, particularly in Mexico.","Segment margins increased 90 basis points to 8%, benefitting from restructuring actions. Recent order trends have reflected improving conditions in both data center and telecommunications investment. Turing to Slide 9. Climate technologies underlying sales declined 10% as global air conditioning sales decreased driven by higher U.S. residential demand in the prior year resulting from regulatory changes. Global refrigeration markets grew modestly, as growth in the United States and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. Demand in the air conditioning and refrigeration markets remains favorable, supporting our outlook for modest levels of growth in 2016.","Turning to Slide 10. Underlying sales in the commercial and residential solutions segment were down 2%. Favorable activity levels in U.S. construction markets resulted in growth in both the wet\/dry vacuums and food waste disposing businesses. Segment margins improved 20 basis points to 21.7% from the favorable impact of the divestiture of the InterMetro business. The favorable trends in U.S. residential and commercial construction continue to support our outlook for modest levels of growth in the segment.","Turning to Slide 11. As we have indicated, we expect difficult market conditions to persist throughout the fiscal year, but we do still see a bottom forming in both sales and earnings by the middle of 2016. We will continue to execute on our operational plans while diligently working to complete the important portfolio repositioning actions that were announced last June. Taking into account our first quarter results and recent order trends, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2016 guidance.","Underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 2% to 5%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. We continue to expect adjusted earnings per share of $3.05 to $3.25, excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $250 million to $350 million, which are approximately $50 million lower than our previous expectations. For the second quarter, underlying sales are expected to be down approximately 4% to 6%, excluding negative currency translation and a deduction from completed divestitures of approximately 2% each. Adjusted earnings per share of $0.60 to $0.65 are expected excluding estimated separation costs of approximately $75 million or approximately $0.11 per share. Our long-standing commitment to return cash flow to our shareholders will be supported by an expected increase in 2016 operating cash flow to approximately $3 billion.","And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David Farr","Thank you very much, Craig. Thank you very much for joining us today. I appreciate that. We are looking forward to seeing our investors and analysts in Austin next week, and we will talk a little bit more about that in a second, but looking forward to really seeing everyone down there and sharing our plans and ideas to the group. I also want to thank everybody across Emerson relative to the execution in the first quarter. Clearly, this is only the first quarter, and we have a very detailed undertaking ahead of us relative to sequentially improving our sales, our profitability, our earnings and cash flow for the remaining part of this year.","As I look at the plans, we started back from restructuring back in February and I look at announcement of repositioning that we announced in June, we continue to make very good progress. But it is clearly all about executing around those plans that we put in place and making sure we get it done from the standpoint of driving costs, standpoint of repositioning this company, and looking forward to how, as we go through a very challenging global economy, very challenging industrial recession that we see today and coming out of this a stronger company and one that can continue to add assets once we reposition to a new Emerson platform.","Looking forward to giving you insights of how we see the 2016 unfolding from an economic standpoint, how we see the numbers happening from the cost of the repositioning, how we see the issues that we may see from a risk standpoint and what we are going to have to do about those that we see additional risk. Those are all things that we will be talking about. I will defer those until we get together next week. Also looking forward to having Bob Sharp and also Steve Sonnenberg talk about the two key business segments, business platforms that we are moving into. The commercial residential solutions and that also the automation solutions, those two individuals will give you insights to what we see the strength of these platforms, what we can do with those platforms and where we are going to invest going forward.","Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas and industrial marketplace right now but it's nothing new, we have been there before, we know what to do to deal with this issue. That\u2019s why we started the aggressive restructuring last year. As we talk amongst the business leaders, the OC and the board, if the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring. We will continue to make sure that the cost structure of this company stays competitive and that we can deliver the highest level of profitability that our shareholders expect from us.","That is what we are all about, right now. Executing around that and getting things forward. As I look at our current marketplace, the last 30 days have been what I would call the most unusual in my time at Emerson. I have never seen a marketplace go so volatile from the standpoint of the end markets, the stock markets, the interest rates, I guess the attitudes. It's just a very amazing marketplace right now and one that clearly global CEOs like myself have to deal with and be prepared for whatever comes at us. But we are now basically in our fourth quarter of the recession. I see, as we will talk about next week, I see at least one more quarter, maybe another quarter. But sequentially our game plan is to improve the business, cycle this business back up and start improving the profitability and that\u2019s what we are all about here.","So with that I will open the floor. I am glad to have the first quarter behind us. I want to again thank the organization. They did a great job executing on the plans we put out there. We are making great progress and clearly it's only one quarter, we know that. And our game plan is sequentially improve sales, the profitability, earnings and the cash flow to our shareholders and establish the premium valuation that this company deserves. With that, I will open the floor.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Johnny Wright of Nomura.","Johnny Wright","Good morning, guys. ","David Farr","Good morning, John -- because I didn\u2019t have anything because of the board meeting just ended, so I had to give something to my body here. Be an on the [nerve] [ph] CEO.","Johnny Wright","Sure. Back in August, I think on the earnings call, Dave, you talked about process order stabilizing but if oil moved below kind of $30 or better off, looking at words to that effect. So here we are, oil is around $30. I'm just wondering how you see that playing out for process if oil stays at these levels both this year and then into FY '17?","David Farr","Let me see. Chevron reported a loss. BP reported a loss. So I would say the market is stressed. So from my perspective right now, I would say the capital market in oil and gas is going to be lower. Our expectation for our process business will be lower, and we will have to do additional restructuring. We are looking at a situation, in my opinion in the oil and gas marketplaces, that will not recover until well past middle of '17, maybe late '17. Fortunately, we have 75% of the business that doesn\u2019t serve oil and gas marketplace. So even though we will talk about this next week, oil and gas spending is down, it is not going to zero. It will be a tougher marketplace and we will have to work harder at it. And clearly there is a lot of uncertainty around this, but the game is we are going to have to figure out how to get the sales, how to get the business, and get our cost down. And it will clearly be a tougher year in '16 than we thought. That\u2019s the game. Pretty straight forward.","Johnny Wright","Okay. Great. And then I guess in the quarter, I guess January you guys announced a big project with Tahrir Petrochem, I think $150 million. I am just interested to see you guys taking a preferred equity investment in that customer. I am just wondering is that reflective of the competitive environment where alongside price you are now kind of having to think of other ways to win business? Or how do you think about that and how should we think about it going forward on other kind of big, large projects?","David Farr","We have done some of the things in the past. This is unique. This is very strategic for the country of Egypt, and we felt that as with other people, we are not the only one that did this. We are probably the only one who has gone public with it, but I think that you will see this happening from time to time. It's a huge opportunity for us, and it really is all about forming a relationship because I think once this project is done and is successful, there will be future projects and it will happen. But it's not for every customer. It's not for every marketplace. But this one, we worked on it long time, and I have met with the CEO, and we had long conversations, and I feel that this makes a lot of sense for us relative to strategic relationship going forward. So I don\u2019t think -- it is just our commitment to making sure that these guys are successful, and we are going to have a lot of business with them for many years to come.","Operator","We will go next to Josh Pokrzywinski from Buckingham Research.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Dave, just looking at the order trends here and process in December. Obviously, the month to month can be volatile with different project activity and what stays and goes rather comp [walks] [ph]. But maybe just comment on how that month looked and any kind of body language you've gotten just with the last $10 move? Obviously, projects don't go forward on a day, a week, or even a month of oil prices, but maybe what the psychology has been with this last move down?","David Farr","I think to be honest, I think the psychology is very nervous and tense within the big oil and gas investors at this point in time. I think that we see, from our perspective what we are looking at is that we will talk to you next week. We will try to encompass what we think the downside will be relative to oil and gas in the process businesses. But I would say December quarter for orders for process were not that bad. We pretty well had that factored in what's going on. I would say that my concern is the psyche of a Chevron or psyche of Exxon Mobil, psyche of these Shells and the BPs and things like that are going to kind of freeze up some of that spending level. They can't go to zero, but I think it's going to make it tougher. So my gut tells me that it is going to be more challenging in the near term and [old] [ph] process, order pace will be a drag in this, and the other businesses will start pulling back up. So that\u2019s where we are at this point in time.","We will give you an update on what I think the process segment is going to do. In fact it will be more negative based on \u2013 because the the first question, I did say that when the price of oil got down to that level, it will be an impact. And I think right now our underlying sales will be more negative in the process than we thought originally and hence we are going to have to cut more costs there. But the psyche is not good in that space right now. Fortunately, there is more investments going on in the parts of the marketplace, and it's a big part of the marketplace, but the oil and gas investment area is not very good right now, and I think it's going to hurt us from the second half of this year.","Josh Pokrzywinski","And obviously you'll touch more on this next week, but I think maybe looking into last quarter, the expectation on being able to hold the line on price somewhat and being able to hold the line on margins this year. Assuming all that plays out what we're seeing today, I would imagine those two items are also part of that discussion that maybe goes out of the window as well?","David Farr","It's not gone out the window. From the standpoint of -- the pricing right now -- let me make a forecast for, we look at ranges. We have ranges you know. There is a reason why we go 2 to 5 or other ranges in the underlying sales, we look at also pricing environment changing too. The pricing environment today is still within the range that we laid out when we put our plan together back in August and September and just talked to you all in November. The net material inflation has continued to drop down, so we are going to give you a forecast. We are going to give you a range of what it looks like right now. But it's well within our range. I would say the one negative will be, underlying sales of process will be more negative and the profitability will still be very good. And we are going to have to take some additional restructuring both for the '16 and '17 in that space, because the recovery will be longer.","And we are going to see what our customer base does right now. As you said, man, they don\u2019t move that fast but I know the psyche is not good. You just have to look at the reports that came out in the last three days or four days relative to two major oil and gas providers.","Operator","We will go next to Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Dave, on last quarter's call you talked about the expectation that we might see one more quarter where inventory in the channel could be worked down and then by 2Q destocking could be high. It could be behind Emerson. Did you see -- I assume you saw continued destocking in the quarter, do you think inventories in the channel are low enough where the destocking for the whole company should end as we go through fiscal 2Q and in the second half of '16?","David Farr","I would say what my knowledge is right now, inventory levels within the channel including ourselves, our levels that, they are pretty good levels, low. And so the pace of business right now and the run rate where I see, I would say the inventory levels are pretty good for us. I don't see much of a downward draft on that now. I think it's pretty well over with, probably very minor downward draft. I think it's pretty well there, around the world. I've been in Asia, have been around the world and I don't see the inventory being a big issue for us right now. So that's a good thing.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. And then just asking about China. You talked about China in '16 maybe being down mid-single digits on your last call, and maybe down 15% in 1Q, but you actually did down '13. So do you think China has stabilized a little bit for you in terms of the decline and are you still expecting mid-single digits for '16 to hold down in single digits?","David Farr","Well, first of all, I called down '13, I would say that's a pretty good forecast call right there without knowing what was going to happen. So I know if I could do that maybe I should go into the investment mode but, just joking clearly. I think that China in my opinion today, the forecast when we put that out there, I still think it's going to be that mid-single plus digit. I think it's going to be in that 5%, 6%, 7% range negative. I don't see it changing. I would say my China organization is more optimistic than that. They are less negative. But I think that looking at what I see going on in China and the marketplaces around the world, I think that that's going to be a tough one for them to do though they are working through the inventory that was built up in the first part of 2015. But my gut tells me that I would not be surprised if we don't finish at minus 7% or 8% in China when it's all said and done.","Andrew Kaplowitz","It's helpful, Dave. Thanks.","David Farr","Write that down and you can see how good a forecaster I was.","Andrew Kaplowitz","We'll hold you to that.","David Farr","I know you will, you guys always do.","Operator","We will go next to Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","And, Dave, we'll welcome you over as an analyst any time you want to come to the dark side.","David Farr","I didn\u2019t say an analyst, I said investor.","Joe Ritchie","Oh, investor, got it.","David Farr","You know I am not that good of an analyst. You know that. I would fail. I would be fired within one week. As an investor that\u2019s a whole different story.","Joe Ritchie","All right. Well, just keep your day job. So maybe focusing a little bit on your commentary about the last 30 days never being so volatile and just taking a look at the order trends. It's interesting as you look at the trends you think about the last 30 days, it's interesting that you haven't really updated your guidance for the underlying growth rate for the year. I recognize that comps are going to get easier as we get through the year but why not maybe be a little bit more, I guess, conservative with the underlying order trends or with the underlying organic growth trends for 2016?","David Farr","Because I think that when we put our plan together we had certain assumptions relative to the volatility of the marketplace and what the market is going to look like. And as I look at all analysis and I look at the upsides, the downsides, I think right now we are still well within that boundary. And to come out and to widen that boundary right now is not what I find acceptable. I think our organization at this point in time, we are well within that even with the 30-day risk. I mean the risk in the 30 days is more around one piece of the company and the standpoint, I mean, Europe's not that case it's primarily around the oil and gas, the price of oil and gas investments. So it's not the whole economy but it's definitely -- I mean we encompass what we thought could possible happen to us. Now, it could get worse and I will talk a little bit about that in Austin but right now I think we are well with inside the boundaries of what we put out there.","Joe Ritchie","All right. Okay. Fair enough and maybe talking about--","David Farr","By the way it helped that. We got ahead a little bit in the first quarter so it did help a little bit there that we made progress better than I thought. So, clearly it helped me a little bit. But it's obviously our easiest quarter. I mean I am not a fool, I know that.","Joe Ritchie","Sure. No, that makes sense. Maybe talking about the cost actions then for a second, I just want to make sure I've got my numbers straight. You spent a little over $220 million in restructuring in 2015. I think it was another $13 million in 1Q. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits that came through this quarter? Clearly they are helping the margins a little bit and maybe your expectations on cadence as we progress through the year?","David Farr","Yes. I think that what we see right now, around $80 million improvement came through in the first quarter. There will be -- from the standpoint of restructuring, there is still a big number in the second quarter. My gut tells me that we will probably be on restructuring around $20 million in the second quarter. And then we are going to be increasing this. The question is, can I get it done in the third or fourth quarter. Is it going to be more in the early part of next year? But, clearly, I think you are going to be looking at the 20 page for each quarter now as we start pushing in anticipation of concerns that we may have in the marketplace out there.","Savings wise, you are going to be building from this 80, incrementally be coming up towards I would say the 90 level by the time we get into that fourth quarter. And that\u2019s basically how we see that happening per quarter.","Operator","We will go next to Mike Wood of Macquarie Securities Group.","Mike Wood","Good job executing in a very tough back drop. I'd like to follow-up on an earlier question on the price. Have you actually began to see the increased price competition in process and has that been rational? Just given the fact there's very little project activity out there, I'm just curious how you actually measure that price change.","David Farr","Well, we measure the price change, obviously on the contracts we also measure the price change that we have to give on short-term actions from the standpoint of a day-to-day business. So it's very measurable because we can see the average pricing within the structure of the business. But you are right. There has not been a lot of big bid around what I would say the oil and gas or the other big projects. So the pricing has been rationale. The other issue is right now, like our European competitors, we are also major player in the process [world] [ph] of Europe. And so we get the benefit of that too. So what I see going to happen is we are going to be seeing sales shift to our European operation because we have been working for this last 12 months. You know the dollar really started appreciating last year, well over a year ago. So we have been working to get our rebalanced cost structure which we will continue to do. So our USP in the organization right now is seeing the benefit of the lower cost structure, so they are winning in, I would say, you are going to see other regions of the world. So we are pushing around the world just like our European competitors do. And that\u2019s one of the benefits we do have relative to having a broad manufacturing spaces on all these businesses.","So I feel reasonably comfortable right now on the forecast we are going to give you for price. I mean we track this extremely hard. I don\u2019t know how long you have been following us but first when I met in the early 2002-2003 timeframe, I can't remember exactly when that was, we got side swiped on how fast this things move. But now we have created a lot tougher tracking process and so I can tell what's going on across this company. And it's going to be a little more negative this year than last year but well within what I thought we are going to see and well within the net mature inflation level. And people are acting rationale. It's going to be an interesting year to see. A lot of people are trying to improve the profitability on down volume. And dropping price in a down volume to try to prove your profitability does not work. Economic 101. It does not work.","Mike Wood","Understood. And given the recent volatility you mentioned in crude, how does that impact the downstream businesses and MRO and your investments that you are making.","David Farr","Two things. I am concerned that\u2019s why I think we are talking about we need to get our action together and think about, if it takes longer to recover as we go into late '16, early '17 in the process side. Because I personally think what will happen is, there will be a freeze. A little bit right now relative to a lot of our customers, as they say, okay, we are reallocating capital. We are cutting capital again 10%, what that number is going to be we will see the next 30 to 60 days. And that will create a pressure on, I know, our base relative to smaller projects and the MRO projects. So the initial reaction is, I think we are going to see a slow down and then hopefully as we get into the year, we will start seeing that capital freed back up. It can't to go zero. It's not going to go to zero but they are clearly going to reallocate and they are doing that really fast right now from our customer base. So my concern right now is, we are looking at downward pressure relative to our total sales in underlying process. We need to take capacity offline. So from my perspective right now, initial phases for the last 12 months is very much focused on people, on restructuring the overall overhead cost.","And now where I want to look at -- if we are going to look at a long recovery here in this particular part of the process world, we are going to look at taking fixed assets offline. And so now that\u2019s Frank and Ed Purvis and the business leaders at their upcoming reviews which start, I think, a week or two from now, look at what extra capacity that we may need to take off permanently if we are looking at a different environment and where should that capacity be and not be. So I think that will lead to higher level restructuring later this year to early '17.","Operator","We will go next to Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","You mentioned earlier that your though process would lag a recovery in some of the other businesses. But I guess if we look at industrial automation, it does seem if it's got pretty bad. So maybe just comment on how you say IA playing out. And related to that, any color you can give on orders in January?","David Farr","I don\u2019t have orders for January yet. This is February 2, so I don\u2019t have that yet. It's a little bit quick for me and the company. But relative to IA, I think IA got hit harder, sooner relative to the space they are in. And so there might be a little downside risk in IA but not that much. I think these guys are sitting really down, pretty far right now. I mean things can always go down further but my gut tells me they are pretty close to that cycle right now. The process guys because of the type of business they have, they are still coming off some of the wins and things they won last couple of years. So I think that they will continue to Slide a little bit here. And that\u2019s my biggest concern right now. If I look at the '16 forecast, I always have little IA concern but my biggest concern would be the process guys at this point in time.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then Network Power, orders look a little less bad than a few months ago. Margins are up. You have a big project in Europe you are working on. But outside and beyond that, do you think that you have succeeded now in sort of stabilizing the earnings in Network Power and the rest of the year we should see that stable margin play out?","David Farr","Yes. Yes. I think if you look at the underlying order pace of our Network Power business, is actually noses up. And as of right now even, I was talking to Scott Barbour today and his team is doing a great job out there. The nose is up, continues to move the right way. Profitability continues to move the right way. These guys took some serious actions, hard actions the last 12 or 18 months and right now I feel good about, it's a broad base and I feel good that these guys are heading the right way. As of right today that\u2019s what I feel. So I feel good about that. I think they had a very good first quarter. I mean it's a long way to go but they have been noses up right now. That\u2019s a good place to be in any business as you know.","Operator","We will go next to Steven Winoker of Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Dave, given all the commentary and sort of how obviously the volatility is right now, what's going on with the process, the capital deployment process or should I say the sale process for industrial automation, some of those assets and the separation activities for Network Power. Is that delayed in anyway?","David Farr","The Network Power asset, there is no delay going on. We have the fuel path looking at strategic buyers within that business. We also have the fuel path of moving right down towards the spend. So that half is well underway. On the industrial asset, automation assets, I would say that based on what we see right now, we are probably two to three months behind where I want to be relative to the discussions with strategic buyers. So I would say Network Power heading okay. Industrial automation, given the tactical customer base, a lot of my potential customers or buyers are clearly are seeing some tough times too. So I would say that one is a little bit delayed by couple of months. But that as of right now today as I report to the board.","Steven Winoker","Okay, Dave. And then also the combination of process and industrial, in other words the future structure of the business, the future Emerson here. Are you taking actions already to combine overhead or other elements of these two businesses yet or is it just standalone, frankly, until you got that other process down and then you will go down this one.","David Farr","We are -- I would be very careful here -- relative to this business we are taking some actions early on the combination. Not totally across the board but in certain select areas in preparation of it. So that will be, by time we get into the middle of this year, those actions will underneath way. On the commercial residential solutions business, we are embarking upon it as we speak. And so both are well on their way. I made a commitment to the board, I made a commitment to the individuals and I think I probably told you guys that by the end of the second, halfway the third quarter, we are going to have these things structured properly. Now it doesn\u2019t mean are things done but that\u2019s what the game plan is at this point in time.","Operator","We will go to Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Securities.","Eli Lustgarten","One quick question on the process side. You talk about the upstream projects, some on completion new projects. What portion of the business at this point still relates to the upstream projects that are being completed and how much does that disappear. In what sense does that go to as you look through the year? Does that basically go to a very minor part or how do we handle that?","David Farr","I don\u2019t have those exact numbers. I can't give that. I can't break it out that way. I know what our oil and gas percentage will be this year in upstream. I mean I know it's still going to be a significant percentage of or total business and it will be next year too because it's not going to zero. People just don\u2019t stop it. We will give you our best feel or it on next week. I have some ideas where we think the segment is going to go. But they don\u2019t move that fast. So it's really hard to say because what we talk about, what you think about are not necessarily how everyone looks at this business in a day to day standpoint. So I can't give you that information to be honest. And its [indiscernible]","Eli Lustgarten","I am just trying to sense, is that the part that\u2019s disappearing. Are you trying to say are we closer to bottom of that impacting or sort of indicating that by middle of the year?","David Farr","No. I don\u2019t think it is. We will talk next week.","Eli Lustgarten","And you talk about having to do more restructuring in process because of market that's quite easily understood. But can you talk about whether you're starting to look at industrial automation in the same way? I mean it's a very weak market. Conditions or so that there's more of, or a second level of restructuring there to try to hold profitability better because that profitability could be under a lot of pressure if the demand stays in the current way.","David Farr","Well, we have laid out the restructuring that we have intended to do this year relative to the industrial automation business and that\u2019s well on our way. I am also in the process of selling that business. So from my perspective, I mean I believe that there is more additional restructuring most likely [indiscernible] from the potential buyer of the company. I have a business plan laid out which is being worked out right now. I don\u2019t see anything at this point in time. If we make the decision we are not going to sell this industrial automation asset then this [owner] [ph] right now, we are down the path, then if we are going to sell that asset.","Operator","We will go next to John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch","So last quarter you called out, in general, incremental concerns possibly about Middle East. Has your thought process changed because there's obviously been some conjecture around possible efforts to curtail production and you called it volatile. I'm just curious, has anything changed in the last few months with respect to your perspective on Middle East?","David Farr","No. My perspective on the Middle East hasn\u2019t changed. I think that the risk I see today in the world for spending, and your talk about say the oil and gas, the type of spending that goes on and just the process of spending. North America, China and Latin America. Those are three concern areas I have relative to the spending around that industry. I was just coming back from the Middle East. I mean the national oil companies have to spent a certain level of money and they have been cutting back and I think we probably have that build in. So I feel okay there right now, as of right now. And I see some major crisis going to erupt in the Middle East, you know things falling up and stuff like that. But right now, I feel reasonably good about that. But concerns are North America investments and the concerns we are going to have on companies that may not make it or be consolidated. And then China, clearly concerns. My forecast of China is worse than probably most people would say out there. So I am a little concerned about that one.","John Inch","No, that makes sense. Dave, a year ago at the analyst meeting you made comments that you thought Canada's petroleum industry was probably going to be better than people expected because there were a lot of obviously reasons for it. Efforts to support domestic businesses, that sort of thing. Do you think that's changed? The dollar has collapsed a lot and I guess debatably it makes that country a little more export competitive or what not. I'm just wondering if you think because it's such an important trading partner with the United States, if you think the outlook for Canada is kind of where you thought it was before? It's sort of a similar question on the Middle East, only for Canada.","David Farr","I would say it's worse. One, they have a new type of government there that doesn\u2019t necessarily care for this industry. And secondly the price where it is right now, it's not good. So I would say, from our perspective what we have been doing is we have been restructuring and downsizing in Canada. I mean it's an important market but strategically it is going to be a tough market for the next two years.","John Inch","Just lastly, Dave. You obviously touch an awful lot of the verticals, right, lots offer different things. So kind of ex-petroleum, do you think that, I mean are you guys tracking maybe some end markets or verticals or other things within Emerson that actually could be contributively positive or surprise kind of to the upside, let's call it in the next, I don\u2019t know, 6-12 months?","David Farr","Yes. I am going to give -- we are going to give you a different view of the verticals and the growth rate next week. And I think the answer is yes. I think there are some verticals that are going to do better than people think. And that\u2019s where -- you know we started talking about this last summer. We have been reallocating our resources, really pushing hard to reallocate our resources. We had a very very good run in oil and gas upstream and we gained a lot of growth, gained a lot of market share. And now what we are doing is refocusing those resources and so we will talk a little bit about that next week because what you just said is exactly right. And there are markets out there and the whole organization in process management is focused on how they can go after those markets and re-energize their workforce to go after that.","Operator","We will go next to Robert McCarthy of Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Maybe we can just go back to, I think kind of a question I asked on the last call. But just given what you see in process and obviously your commentary throughout the last 30 days, I think implicit in your guidance for fiscal '16 was some firming of order trends in terms of kind of the March-April timeframe. I'm not trying to put words in your mouth, but I think it was to that effect. And then you know...","David Farr","I mean exactly what I said -- you are not putting -- and I will tell you again today that I will show you a chart next year that I am saying we will, I'd say right now the call April 1, our orders go positive. It's total [positive] [ph]. I said that last time on the call, I am still saying that. Now for whatever, you know what but I am making that call and I will stand by that call.","Robert McCarthy","All right. And you don't want to move the call to April 2, maybe but...?","David Farr","Well, because it's April fool's day, so I can get that.","Robert McCarthy","Okay ","David Farr","I made that call back then, I am standing by that call.","Robert McCarthy","Okay, fair enough. I guess the only other question I have is, you did mention, and this dovetails with the question I just asked, but I think you did mention like we've come through four quarters of what looks like an industrial recession. You think there's about one to two left. Are you seeing anything in the GFI or just the order patterns or trajectory, absent process management vertical where it's obviously dynamic and tied to the commodity price, where you can kind of point to an upward trajectory or reason for recovery there in terms of the macro?","David Farr","Yes. The answer is yes. And the call is April 1. And I am talking about the April orders, you know that. And then we are right now, Frank and I will sit here, we will tell you we believe that our underlying sales will go positive in the third quarter. Based on the -- I felt that all along, and Frank has crossed his fingers over there, he is a great CFO, he really stays right behind us. He is right behind be with a gun to my back. But, no, I still believe that. And the key issue, now keep in mind, if you are paying attention, we said that first quarter underlying sales will be down, probably 9% to 10%. We finished a little bit under 9%. Last time I talked on the phone I said underlying sales will be down 5% to 7% in the second quarter. I am now, Frank and I believe that our underlying sales will be down 4% to 6% in the second quarter. So the key issue for is, as we map out and we get together, we will give you the insight on orders when we are together next week. We are trying to get orders, somebody asked me a question about January, we will try to get those so we can at least have a sense on where to go the next week. [indiscernible] would stop going to play basketball so much and watching Lebron James. Maybe we could get them but. So I think right now I am standing behind that. I mean the chart is going to say, April, orders to above positive and third quarter sales will have a plus in underlying sales. And we will not be standing there talking to me.","Robert McCarthy","Well, we've got our line in the sand. I'll see you next week.","David Farr","I like to draw lines. You know me.","Operator","We will go next to Scott Davis of Barclays.","Scott Davis","I'm trying to reconcile, I think like everybody else, I mean you're bearish but you're still calling things getting better in April. And I think the angle I want to take is that, and there's a good and bad here, and the good is that you mentioned the comment fixed assets off line and we've been writing and we think the entire industry needs to do this. But you guys are the only ones that are really doing it. So how do we get out of this mess if you're one of the only companies that's willing to admit that it's a, for lack of a better word, a bit of a site-show out there. How do we get out of this mess to where even if your orders turn, call it slightly positive, I mean it's probably more flattish than positive to be more realistic, but how do we get out of this. I think...?","David Farr","It will be above the line. I have actually got my nose above the water, it [counts] [ph] Scott.","Scott Davis","Well, what's it going to take to get us out of this mess is my question really, Dave. Because again unless everybody capitulates, which we saw in 2002, we saw it in 2009. Doesn't it just start to bleed into different components of the economy and different businesses that you sell into that aren't being impacted right now start to see impact as we get later on in the, call it cycle?","David Farr","You know, I can't speak to other people. I mean they've got to be looking at the same issues from the standpoint of too much cost, too much capital, fix that investments invested. They've got to be looking at that and so eventually they are going to have to say look, we've got to take action. A good leader -- if they don't take action I think there will be some other people coming and working on that issue. But from our standpoint I feel quite strongly as you know. We're trying to deal with this issue. We make calls. I make calls, as you know my for a long time. I make a call. Sometimes I call right, sometimes I call wrong. But you have to make calls and say we've got too much capacity, things are going to be down longer, you've got to deal with it.","And we started seeing this happen last year and I think other people are now maybe just starting to see it and starting to deal with it. But if you don't have the capability of dealing with it sometimes you just sit there and tread water and watch your profitability get hit. I think there are several companies out there in my opinion in the industry right now that are doing a good job in dealing with this issue. There are several companies that are not and you know that. You can see it. And I don't have that magic call. I can tell you what we could do. And so I know right now that certain things are going the right way. I have a feel for what things are but I do know that given right now, given where the price of oil & gas is and potentially where it could go, we fundamentally will have a capacity issue on that industry which we didn't have say 12 months ago. And so we have got to think about how we deal with that issue and as you know it also takes time. But that's on the table right now and no one wants to deal with that because that\u2019s really a hard thing to deal with. But you got to deal with it period.","Scott Davis","Yes. Understood, and I'm encouraged by your comment on price being relatively rational. It was in the last cycle as well but there's always little tidbits out there. Caterpillar has been talking about the alternator contract they have with you guys and trying to drive price down. You view that as more of a one-off or do you have multiple situations going on like that but you've been able to hold on price because the competing bids haven't been any better?","David Farr","From the standpoint I think most people are being rational on this thing. Our contract, capital as a contract, and the contract is set and they have the right to go do what they want to do, but the contract is set. And so from the standpoint of the overall industry I would say the biggest issue right now is because volumes are dropping for people and they have excess capacity, trying to fill plan up with a lower price is not a very smart thing to do because it doesn't work for you. That's why I think it's been more rational here. And so far we mapped it out and Frank and Ed Purvis and all the business leaders laid out a plan what they thought last summer, early fall. We will look at it again right now on the pricing and it's pretty well in line and I feel good about it. But like I said, 10 years ago, or was it 12 years ago, I got really side swiped and so that's why we spend more time on it than probably the average company.","Operator","We will go next to Shannon O'Callaghan of UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Hey, Dave, just within the process spending that you are seeing, I mean we went through this period which seems like in a lot of cases we are still in where seemingly everything was getting cut upstream, mid-stream, downstream, maintenance spending. The spending that you are seeing happening, whether it's some of the downstream stuff or the chemical, what are the projects exactly? What are people willing to spend on right now?","David Farr","On the big projects, say upstream is that it's a project to certain in time that they see that spending -- I will make a number up, a billion dollars more to get cash flow. The customer is going to move forward with that because if you are stuck 75% of your projects and you stop it, you got a problem. Because the project won't be that good but the time you come back to it in five years or whatever it is. So most people you see and those monies will get spent. Now every time they go through a process they are having to cut capital within that industry, that will fine tune that. But most people are taking advantage of the environment right now to go out and improve, I would say the efficiency of the facility. So spending on small capital projects, upgrades will help to get more out of the facility, higher quality, higher yields. So that\u2019s what they are spending right now to get more of each facility. So I see them still spending money. It's just an interesting process. They are going through the process of being very selective. When things were going their way they threw a lot of money at everything. So the money is still being spent but it's definitely being a lot more selective and it's going to be much more on how can I prove the investments we have made over the last ten years. Get me more money out of that given the fact that my oil prices or down or my inputs are down, what can I do. So they are being a lot more selective along on those lines. Which is a good business for us but clearly you don\u2019t have the big projects which give you a lot of top line growth for the big bank. But there is money being spent out there.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. And then on Network Power, nice margin result there in the quarter. It's been a while since Network Power margin has beat my expectations. Is that a function of having kind of cleared any major part of the restructuring or just a lag of getting this stuff to kind of show up in what you're shipping in terms of the numbers, or is there a reason why it sort of finally came through now?","David Farr","I think that across Network Power, from the standpoint of actions they started undertaking last summer and started flowing through. And they exist in that, we have been working them. It's really starting to come through in the final P&L. So it started actually around the last month or last year or the fiscal year September and it's [preceding] [ph] each month. So our expectation is that this will continue to take hold based on what we see happening in that market. So we should see a sequential type of margin improvement in that business. Which would be good because Scott and his team have really attacked this. They are getting out of certain business, they are investing in other businesses. I think they have done a great job in evaluating where they want to be and the cost structure they have. And now they are executing around that flexibility. And my hats off to that team in a very dynamic marketplace. So I think they are heading the right way and I feel good about that. They did a great job executing the first quarter.","Operator","We will go next to Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo.","Rich Kwas","So, Dave, just broadly speaking, given what's going on in oil & gas here in North America, are you seeing any signs in your other businesses of meaningful contagion in CRNS or climate. Anything that you would point out here? You talked about the last 30 days being volatile. Just any thoughts there because obviously there's a lot more concern in the market in the last 60 days or so?","David Farr","Yes. I would say we have not seen it yet, Rich, from the order pattern that we saw in December. I don\u2019t know, even the forecast for January, I didn\u2019t see anything. It could take a little while but we don\u2019t see it yet. I think the marketplace has definitely been very volatile. I think the marketplace is starting to see numbers that we have been seeing. Now we have been -- if you look at the fourth calendar quarter, the third calendar quarter, they were pretty tough quarters for companies like Emerson. And so the market is now digesting that news as they saw it come out in the earnings report and the comments people are making right now. Let's say a little bit more negative about 2016. So I would say that we have been trying to get ahead of that and at this point in time I feel that we have got that size. I don\u2019t see the knock on effect of what we saw the volatility both from the marketplace and then also the commodity place in January. We will have to watch it very carefully, unfold. And if I look at the construction, residential construction, the residential spending, the consumer spending in the areas that we are, they are still holding up pretty well right now. So we will see. I mean 30 days is pretty short. You guys give us a few more days here.","Rich Kwas","Understood.","David Farr","I know you are very quick compared to me but.","Rich Kwas","On process in terms of M&A, you talked about deploying some capital there for this year. With what's happened here, incrementally more interested or less interested? How should we gauge that over the course of '16 in terms of the opportunities you're seeing right now?","David Farr","I am interested. Higher interest. You can never call what time to buy and from my perspective right now, I think that there unique assets out there that I would like to buy. And our cash, you know Frank is over here working on how we are going to get cash back in the United States with the spin, the divestitures. And we are going to talk a little bit about that next week so from my standpoint, I will look at this as a buying opportunity. And I talked with my board today and the board is right there. They are on me, on is to make sure we execute and we execute as hard as possible around this repositioning, the restructuring. And then spend that money to make Emerson a better company long term and we have got opportunity here and let's think how hard we play with it. So that\u2019s what we are all about.","Rich Kwas","Okay, thanks. By the way I thought Rossman was up for the [cavs] [ph] coaching job. I guess that didn't play out.","David Farr","He just missed it. They called me at it. They called me and I said, he was questionable with his leadership capability and I also felt that he would have a hard time coaching a guy that\u2019s seven foot tall.","Operator","And we will go next to Deane Dray of RBC.","Deane Dray","Just thought it was interesting how in a period of significant volatility we have all been questioning you about what you're seeing here, but you're also giving quarterly guidance. That's not really what -- Emerson didn't used to be in the quarterly guidance business but where is the additional confidence, where's the additional visibility? I mean it's certainly welcome, but it's a change.","David Farr","The change, I may go back, you know me I have around few years. It's all about right now that we are on a detailed plan that we started executing last June and I want to make sure you guys understand where we are relative to that transition. And I want to make sure you guys get clarity around what I see sequentially happening each quarter. And the management team has been working, is very aggressive right now. We have been discussing with the board and I think it's very important for you all to understand what I see happening each quarter. We see happening each quarter and that clarity. Now once we come back to normalcy in the marketplace, we may go right back to -- necessarily I don\u2019t believe in quarterly guidance but just go right back to old way. But right now I think we are in through this transition period. I think it's very very important for you to understand what's on our mind and where we see standing [indiscernible] how we are positioning each quarter. And so we are going to actually give you clarity on things next week on the second quarter which you probably would never get from us. I think it's important that we stay joined in the hip here. Some of you are right there with me, some of you don\u2019t necessarily agree with us. It's all about execution. Can we execute and I am telling you what the roadmap looks like, what the band looks like each quarter and I will get through this quarter and I will tell you the third quarter.","Deane Dray","Yes. It's a great perspective and it is a change and in a period of this uncertainty to have your line of sight on this is appreciated. And then just have a niche follow up on commercial and resi. It was interesting for professional tools, you wanted to blame that also on upstream spending and I just never thought professional tools was as tied to that, but maybe I'm wrong.","David Farr","Now you are talking to one of the former presidents of Ridge Tool.","Deane Dray","I know.","David Farr","And the former president of Ridge Tool that went through a last recession, a really tough recession we had. We have a significant part of that business that sell specialty tools and equipment to the oil and gas producers and users, upstream and downstream. And if this whole industry stops spending and the first things is that it just drives right up, around the world. And that is a big chunk of our business there and it's significant enough from the standpoint it's big and it's also profitable. And all I can tell you is I thought I was going to be fired at the division president in my first 12 months when I came in here and oil and gas hit me back in the early 1990-1991. It's tough. That\u2019s what it is. It's not made up, trust me it's there.","Deane Dray","Understood. See you next week.","David Farr","Look forward to guys. I have to get going. I apologize. I know we have a lot of questions. We have got to cut some people off. I don\u2019t have any idea who I cut off. I didn\u2019t look at the list. I was no selective here. I want to appreciate everybody for calling and I appreciate the questions. And I am going to try to be open and honest as possible in this situation, give you an idea of where we are trying to go. But clearly, I am giving the clarity that I see what my management team right now and it's our call and that\u2019s what we are going to do up here for this year to make sure we are all on the same journey together as we come out of 2016.

Year-to-date, we've repurchased over 15 million shares for a total of $1 billion and we've returned over $1.9 billion to shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.","Turning to slide 4, third quarter gross margin was up 220 basis points. This improvement includes a tailwind from prior year Valves & Controls purchase accounting charges. This tailwind was partially offset by timing of the V&C acquisition, which closed in late April last year, resulting in two months of dilution from the acquisition last year versus three months this year.","On a comparable basis, that is, excluding the impact of the prior-year purchase accounting charge and the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, gross margin was up 180 basis points.","Reported EBIT margin was up 180 basis points and on a comparable basis was up 140 basis points. Again, that is excluding the prior year purchase accounting charge and the extra month of V&C dilution this year.","Turning to slide 5, from a geographic perspective, the momentum we've seen this past year continued in Q3 with broad-based demand and favorable trends across the world areas. Mature markets were up high-single digits led by North America. Europe returned to growth in Q3 after a flat first half, reflecting steady growth in air conditioning and refrigeration markets and improving trends in key process automation markets. Emerging markets were up high-single digits in the quarter led by Asia. Latin America grew 7% after being down slightly in the first half, reflecting favorable trends across both business platforms.","Turning now to slide 6, total segment margin was up 40 basis points, including the aforementioned timing impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, total segment margin was up 100 basis points.","Operating cash flow was up 19% to $924 million driven by high quality earnings and strong working capital performance. Trade working capital improved 150 basis points driven by receivables and inventory improvement.","Turning to slide 7, Automation Solutions underlying sales were up 12% in the quarter. Strong growth continues to be driven by MRO, small and mid-sized projects and turnaround activity across our key end markets. North America continued the trends we saw in the first half with both the U.S. and Canada up in the mid-teens. China likewise continued strong growth with broad-based investment and project wins across our key end markets. Outside of China, modest growth continued across the rest of Asia supported by solid MRO demand and improving investment activity, especially in India.","Europe turned positive this quarter after being flat through the first half reflecting oil and gas investment in Eastern Europe and improving industrial investment across Eastern and Western Europe. Latin America was positive this quarter after being down slightly in the first half, and the region continues to show some signs of stabilizing and improving. Middle East and Africa growth was supported by strong MRO and improving investment across the region.","Automation Solutions segment margin was up 170 basis points including the timing impact of the V&C acquisition. On a comparable basis, excluding the additional month of V&C dilution in the current year, segment margin was up 250 basis points. This improvement was driven by leverage, the benefit of prior period restructuring actions and operational improvements at Valves & Controls.","Now please turn to slide 8 and I will hand the call over to Mr. Mike Train.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, Tim. Pleasure to join the call again. Steven had asked me to provide a little bit of an update on our large project funnel, we shared that with you at the February investor meeting and we've updated it for today's discussion.","On slide 8, you'll see for August 2018 we're at about $6.8 billion in funnel size. That has increased significantly since the February timeframe. We've seen projects going into the funnel really across all the different industry types that are listed there. I would say at this stage of the game, we're probably not anticipating the funnel to grow anymore given that there're smaller projects that don't make the funnel and there's investment decision dates beyond 2020. Right now, I think this is a very good set of projects that we're working with.","There have been awards against this funnel probably on the order of $700 million to $800 million that we've been tracking over these last six months. Emerson has won a good number of those. I'm very satisfied with our hit rate on those awards. And generally, those have to be engineered by EPCs before they become orders and then ultimately become sales rec. So there's still a little bit of that out in front of us for the large part.","We are seeing great take-up at our main valve partner concept. We've launched that here in the last year. Talking to customers as we've built up larger Final Control business. We are already seeing some very serious discussions around that and I think there's going to be end users and engineering contractors that want to take advantage of that.","All in all, I think again the project pace is strong. I think the activities are there. I've been around the world twice in the last four months, talking with EPCs and customers. We see customers stationed at the EPCs. They're doing the pre-work, the pre-feed, the feed work. And it looks pretty robust I think as we look forward. So that is slide 8.","Slide 9, I just wanted to kind of pull in some other indicators from around the industry, if you will. Left-hand side talks to the CapEx across the oil and gas value chain. So it's the upstream, the midstream and the downstream. And really based on what we're seeing in the global data, we are seeing that CapEx numbers are starting to lean forward, grow positively. I think there's outlook and expectations for that. I think those will firm up as people start talking about their 2019 year here in the next quarter or two.","And then down the right-hand side of the chart, just some of the different perspectives, BP is trying to add to their net oil capability, raising the production; TechnipFMC is one of the many engineering contractors that were recently announced their expectations. They're seeing their backlogs move higher. We've seen that with a number of others as well.","And then laid out a little bit of what's going on in Mexico here. We've had some change in the government regime there. They're already starting to lean forward into some of the investment activities they want to put forward here, which I think are going to be pretty robust for Emerson as we move forward here. So I think the insight from customers, what we're seeing across the market, I think it all suggests that we've got a pretty strong automation marketplace, certainly over the next two to three years.","Tim, that's it from me.","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, Mike. So we'll continue now on slide 10, in the Commercial & Residential Solutions, underlying sales were up 2% in the quarter. In North America, air conditioning demand accelerated versus the second quarter, underlying demand and macroeconomic trends remain strong and we expect air conditioning growth to further accelerate into Q4.","Growth in China was impacted by timing of government subsidies for heat pump units. Outside of China, demand remained strong across the rest of Asia in air conditioning and refrigeration markets. Solid growth continues in Europe reflecting steady demand for professional tools and strong growth in air conditioning, heating and refrigeration markets.","Margin decreased 80 basis points as material inflation and unfavorable mix was partially offset by operational leverage, higher price realization and the benefit of prior-period restructuring actions and aided by the divestiture of the ClosetMaid business which was sold in October of 2017.","And now if you turn, please, to slide 11 and I will hand the call over to Bob Sharp.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, Tim. First of all, I'll give everybody an update. We closed on Textron Tools & Tests right at the beginning of the quarter. So as Q4 is reported, you'll see it's starting to come into the numbers. And I'll say we're off to a very good start here, a very good combination. We have merged RIDGID Tool and Tools & Test together into a single professional tools organization with a singular management team. That's well underway.","A lot of activities now around our global footprint, especially from a sales coverage and customer standpoint at the beginning. A lot of work right now with optimizing our North America sales presence and, again, good progress on that. We'll be having some actions here soon.","Focusing heavily right now on the spend, you saw a lot of opportunities we presented as far as margin potential. Materials is a big piece of that. We've already done a heavy analysis of the material buy of the Tools & Test business combined with RIDGID and have a number of activities underway, certainly, applying Emerson's terms around payables and other things with some very good quick progress there.","So overall, good organization. We've had several meetings with these management team and employees throughout the sites and we've been in all the factories, doing a lot of work in the factories around safety and operational activities. And I'll say there's a very good vibe right now as far as people feeling the combination, both from the RIDGID folks, as well as the Textron Tools folks recognizing that this is a very obvious cultural combination, if you will. And everybody's seeing some good opportunities and really good reaction from the customers as well.","So we've talked about synergies. You see synergies around $40 million, a lot of that cost driven, also a number coming from sales in the time. And then cash flow, these two businesses combined generate very good, healthy cash flow and we see a tremendous opportunity to increase that combination over the next four or five years as we have the plan that plays out. Good start there.","Chart 12, I think it is, on Asia. Certainly, China was a change. We have enjoyed a very nice string of extreme growth, I'll say, in China and certainly had some amount of a pause here in Q3. Very much timed to heating. As they start getting in focus the heating season and releasing government contracts and subsidy activities and things, clearly some pause in that activity. I will say, July was a good month. August is looking well and, as we show here, we're expecting to be back on a double-digit track in Q4.","For this year, cold chain, commercial AC, heating, all 20% plus kind of growth dynamics. Residential AC up in the 10% territory. So certainly, we would have liked to seen a stronger number in Q3, but do not see that as any sign of any fundamental change right now. The market is going well.","And as we've talked about recently, the industrial heating side of things is really actually kicked in quite a bit and we certainly see quite a bit of visibility on that one \u2013 as that one, frankly, is just getting started after the residential play.","So overall, you could see the map here shows there's a number of areas in the coldest environments, the low ambi environment up north. The scroll technology we have is a very good fit for that. When you get into the south and more in the sanitary and residential where the performance factors aren't quite as critical, a good presence in total.","We also continue to have some very excellent solutions activity, a major convenience store chain in China, we've been working with on a monitoring solution that pulls in information from their refrigeration as well as the HVAC, lighting and other parts of their locations. There is a number of other franchises and customers that's relevant to. And then certainly with the coal chain activity going in China, supermarkets and all the other infrastructure build-out remained strong.","Here is highlighting some integrated scroll rack solutions and Cooper-Atkins is also playing into both of these kind of opportunities as well as we have the chance to internationalize that business. So, again, we would have liked to seen a stronger Q3 in China, but fundamentally feel good about how things are playing out and how Q4 will get us back here.","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","All right. Thanks Bob. So, turn to slide 13, which steps through our changes to our EPS guidance. The table starts with our May 1st GAAP EPS guidance of $3.10 to $3.20. As shown here, we are raising the guidance range $0.05 for stronger performance and $0.24 for our one-time tax benefit in Q3 associated with clarifications on U.S. tax reform implementation.","The $150 million tax benefit in Q3 drove a 6% GAAP tax rate and reduced our full year expected tax rate from 25% to 27% to approximately 19%. Also included in the guidance update is $0.06 in Q4 for purchase accounting and restructuring charges associated with the Tools & Test and Aventics acquisitions. For these acquisitions, we expect to have little, if any, additional purchase accounting charges carry over into fiscal 2019.","And finally, as discussed on our call \u2013 on our Q1 call, in response to U.S. tax reform legislation, the company reviewed U.S. comp and benefits programs and has enacted numerous improvements. As part of this, in the fourth quarter, we will take a charge of $24 million, or $0.03 per share, for discretionary one-time 401(k) contribution to every member of our U.S. workforce. The net impact of these changes is to raise our GAAP guidance range $0.20 to $3.30 to $3.40.","Please turn now to slide 14, which outlines our updated full year guidance, and please note that this framework now includes the sales and earnings impact of the recently closed Tools & Test and Aventics acquisitions. We expect total Emerson underlying sales to grow 7.5% with Automation Solutions up 9% and Commercial & Residential Solutions up 4.5%. The GAAP EPS range of $3.30 to $3.40 represents growth of 30% to 34% compared with the prior year. This guidance assumes a neutral price\/cost impact, as we continue to offset material inflation with price realization and cost reduction efforts.","The expected effective tax rate for 2018 is reduced to 19% due to the one-time benefit in Q3, and we expect the tax rate in 2019 and thereafter to be 25%. The fourth quarter will be our fifth consecutive quarter of strong sales and earnings per share growth, as Q4 of last year was the first time since our strategic repositioning that we delivered both strong sales growth and earnings per share growth.","In this fourth quarter, we expect 7% to 8% underlying growth and earnings per share of $0.86, plus or minus $0.05, including the $0.09 of acquisition charges and one-time 401(k) contribution shown on the bridge. For 2018, we expect free cash flow conversion of 110%, reflecting our high quality earnings. This guidance is in line with our prior guidance of 115% excluding the one-time tax benefit in the third quarter.","And now, please turn to slide 15, and I will hand the call over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Tim. I also want to thank Bob and Mike for joining us today and updating everybody. They'll obviously be on the call to answer questions for the people that want to ask questions.","As you look at the order trend chart, the trends have continued to stay within the band that we outlined in February of 2018 at the conference in New York. In total, I expect this will continue in the fourth quarter. I would expect us to be at the high end of this band as we've moved up towards that greater than 5%. Automation Solutions orders will continue to do well.","From the standpoint of both Mike's business and Bob's business, Mike is now starting to come into tougher and tougher comps, because last year at this time, he had a very strong July and it will start to continue to bounce up against that. Bob's business clearly has been positive in the 5% to 10% range, and now it's a little slower over the last couple \u2013 two years. And so, his comparisons are getting tougher and tougher.","But overall, I feel very good about the momentum, the pace of business is not slowing down, our growth and opportunities are out there, and we're seeing our customers continue to spend. We are seeing the impact \u2013 the positive impact of the new tax law in the United States, and people are spending money and we are clearly getting that piece of business. If you look at our North America sales and orders, they've been very strong since the enactment of the tax law. But I want to thank everybody for joining us today.","One thing you might have noted from the first page, we had a recent STEM program and I was addressing my new employees, and I had one in the front row here in the little green outfit, you'll go back and look at that photograph, and she was asking me a great question. Her parents are shareholders and she was asking me a very delicate question. She said Mr. Farr, are you going to break the dividend string in 2019, and I said, I see no reason to break the dividend string in 2019, so \u2013 and she said, good, I'll be able to afford to buy more milk or whatever I need for eating here. So, she was very diligently asking me questions about the dividends, which is quite interesting.","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Good shareholder.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. She's a very good shareholder. I like those type of shareholders. As you know, one of the things that we've been doing and working across the company since the new platform structure is to make sure we have the right benefit structure, the right compensation structure across the global world. Clearly, we're trying to make sure that we're making the right enhancements to stay competitive.","And as we said in the press release, we have continued to make changes to our package and \u2013 both on the health and medical side, also parental leave improvements, better vacation plans, and now the most recent one is the improvement in our 401(k), and we're making a one-time contribution to our U.S. employees which is going to cost us around $24 million. But it's all about making sure we have the best group of employees that we need around the world as we continue to enhance our benefits around the world. And in today's competitive environment, this is very, very important and we wanted to make sure that we did it. We'll continue to tune things a little bit, but the major actions have been undertaken and we'll continue to make sure that we stay competitive on a global basis, so that's extremely important to us.","If you look at everything that's going on, it's been a very good six months. If I look at the improvement of sales, I look at the improvement of orders, I look at our gross margins, our EBIT margins, our cash flow, both businesses are operating at very high levels of performance. We had two days of planning conference with the new Final Control business. The total integration of V&C was outstanding. They are ahead relative to sales expectations. Our orders this year in both businesses are growing. We did not expect the orders of V&C would recover so fast, but they're growing in line with the Final Control and the whole Process business, which is exciting to see. We're seeing improvement in profitability. We're ahead of our margins that we expected and we're seeing a very strong cash flow as you can see in our cash flow conversion from the total company. But a really great job by both Mike's and Bob's organizations and around the world, and I want to thank his teams globally for doing an outstanding job. Mike and Bob, really appreciate that.","If I look at the global market today, we have all of our global businesses now basically in the markets growing. We have the various marketplaces showing positive growth both in orders and sales. When we first started the year, we still had a couple markets that had not recovered, started growing. But now, in total, you're seeing all our markets growing. And as I look at the order pace and I look at the interest in business right now, that's a good thing to have as you move into 2019. You'll remember, we talked about that initially the mature markets would take over and grow first, which we've seen. We are now starting to see the emerging markets take off, and I would expect to see our emerging markets sometime in early-2019 outgrow our mature markets. Our mature markets will continue to grow at a good pace, but I expect the emerging markets to take off as the investments continue to go forward.","As you look at the performance, last year at this time, our underlying sales were growing around 4%. We grew underlying sales 8%. As we go into the fourth quarter, last year, our underlying sales were growing 3%. We're talking about underlying sales growing around the 7.5% range at this point in time. Comparisons are getting tougher, but the pace of business remains to be very strong and we have very good momentum across this company in many areas. So, I'm very, very pleased about that. But I know that Bob now has his hands wrapped around and his team have their hands wrapped around the acquisition of the Textron Tools & Test business.","They're quickly going about how they can integrate, they're quickly going about how they can grow this business, how they can improve the profitability. You'll clearly see, like we saw in V&C, the profitability in the segment will be hurt by this acquisition, because it's clearly a lower profit margin than we have today. But they have plans to get that margin back up and stop it from being dilutive in a relatively short time period. I also see improvements relative to cash flow, which is very important to us relative to that acquisition. But equally important, their organizations are working together very quickly and it's really exciting to see.","We closed Aventics a couple weeks ago, and Mike and his team reported to the board today, as did Bob in his acquisition, and talked about what they see and what they see after the first couple weeks, in Bob's case, after the first 30 days. A lot of opportunities here and they're continuing to work it, and both of them will have a negative impact on initial margin, but will work its way through to make sure that it contributes to overall profitability as we move into 2019. But from the standpoint of where we stand with V&C and these two other major acquisitions, we've done a lot of acquisitions in the last 18 months and I would expect us to have bolt-on opportunities going into 2019, but I would \u2013 not the same magnitude of what we've done here in the last 18 months, but very strong performance, earnings and cash flow. And I fully believe that, as I said early on in the year, V&C will contribute to our overall earnings for the year and they will contribute very strongly in cash flow and their margins are getting to where they need to be as we've talked about, in fact they're ahead of plan as we move forward here, so really running well going into that fourth quarter.","I would like to make one other comment relative to the corporate organization and in particular around Frank's team and Alex Peng and his team relative to the tax. The tax planning with the new tax laws, we were really well prepared and we were able to take advantage of our tax laws and really minimize the impact of the overall cost to the corporation. The true-up of picking up this much money, $150 million, both earnings and cash over time, but really reducing our rate for the quarter, again, investing in people, investing back in the company.","But really this is a great job by Frank and Alex and the whole team down there, on behalf of all shareholders, to make sure that we have the right rate structure and make sure that we're doing the right thing on a global basis for tax payments, and really helped us for the quarter and also for \u2013 as we move forward into the coming years. Our effective tax rate will be in this 25% range. That's down 5 or 6 points from where it used to be. And so, that's a lot of value creation, and the question for us is how we put that money to use to grow the company a little bit faster, more profitable, and using that cash flow to also pay back more money to the shareholders over time, too. So, I'm very pleased, and Frank \u2013 and you know the team has done a great job down there. I appreciate that.","As I look at that fourth quarter and I look at where we're heading into the fourth quarter, as we sat here three months ago talking about the third quarter, we talked about a quarter that would be plus or minus, I believe, around $0.85 \u2013 I said $0.85, plus or minus $0.02. I mean, that's basically how I think. I'm thinking within a $0.05. It's difficult for us to call it a $0.05. And I know people always thinks when we say plus or minus, it's always going to be plus. You should never think that. When I say that, I'm trying to give you the best range that I can give you at that point in time.","As we look at the fourth quarter, we feel the momentum right now gives us about 7.5% underlying growth. We see pretty good growth relative to acquisitions. The currency will hurt us as we end the fourth quarter, but I still believe that we'll be over 10% on a GAAP basis. And clearly, the comps are getting tougher and tougher, but we have strong momentum going into this quarter. I expect this quarter to be, as we're saying here, around $0.86, plus or minus $0.02 to $0.03. Clearly, we'll push for the quarter ending and see what we can do, but that's about the range we see right now in the pace of business as we look at everything that we're dealing with across this company.","And again, operations are doing well and we're performing well, and it was a very good quarter and we hope to continue to drive this in the next couple quarters. And I don't see any reason why not, at this point in time, but as every day is a new day in this world and we'll see what happens. But the momentum is on our behind, really with us right now and also from the standpoint of strong opportunities around the world for orders and for growth and for profit improvement. So, I like what we see at this point in time. And so, we have a lot more positive working for us than we do against us.","So, with that opening the phone for calls, and we'll take some Q&A and look forward to talking to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Nicole.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, I guess last quarter, on the second quarter call, you commented that you expected Automation Solutions organic growth could accelerate in 2019, and we now have another quarter under our belt, things are stronger than expected, order growth was really healthy. So, I guess, would you sit here and make that same comment today, Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. The issue was I've always said from the early on in the beginning of the year, Nicole, what I saw \u2013 I looked at this as a two-year type of band of growth. We always felt that the growth was going to accelerate throughout the year. We thought this year would be more of a not double-digit, we didn't think we'd cross that 10% mark. Clearly, now as I look at the two years, I've always felt that we would have somewhere around 16% to 18% to 19% combined growth. We have a lot of momentum right now. And so, we have a stronger front-end load.","And so, from my perspective right now, I'm looking probably equal years from the standpoint. I don't see \u2013 there are certain things that our customers can work on, and as Mike said, as we see the funnels come up towards this top number, it could go up maybe a little bit higher, but at some point in time, we only can work on so many projects. So, the momentum is pretty strong. We're going to have obviously a stronger year this year. We're getting closer to 10% for the whole year underlying growth rate for the Automation business.","And therefore \u2013 so, I'm looking next year probably going to be in that 9% to 10% range now, because I'm looking at that \u2013 I look at the two-year cycle for this business and it's not any different than I said last year or earlier this year. I said if we have a 7%, 8%, then I expect us to be a 9%, 10% next year. So, now I'm looking more equal-equal, Nicole, for the year just based on the way our customer base.","And Mike, do you want to add anything to that?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd say we've seen very strong KOB3, the aftermarket business...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...throughout the year. It's been probably stronger than we even anticipated in February, and it's been good for our business. It's a relatively fast turn business. I think that's helped contribute to the second half here in a major way. The KOB1 projects, the greenfield projects will come along. They have their pace as you've indicated. They've got to get engineered. And I think \u2013 again, I think there was a lot of pent-up demand on the KOB3 side and we've seen a lot of that come through here as these customers have felt better with their cash flows and where they're sitting. So, I can't tell you that it can't be a double-digit year next year, but I think something in that 7%, 8%, 9% range right now feels about right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","We always have to play it out and see what happens.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. I mean, historically, we have seen a two-year cycle, if you look back our cycles, we're typically when we're taking off on combined basis is at 16%, 17%, 18%, 19% on a 24-month time period. So, that's how I look at it. I thought we were going to be less front-end loaded. Now, it looks like we're stronger. But it's going to be a good year anyway you look at it, Nicole. Right now, our backlog \u2013 our growth in orders are strong. So, we're very positive about it. Now, we got to make sure we've enough people. That's a big issue now.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, Dave. And I guess for my follow-up, I know you've talked about in the past that one of your top concerns from a macro perspective is trade war. So, I have to ask, have you quantified the risk to Emerson from the tariffs that have been enacted to date? And I guess, just level of flexibility on your supply chain, your manufacturing footprint to handle what we're seeing today?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We have quantified it. We've not gone publicly. It's not that huge of a number relative to what we're doing. The teams have done a great job of offsetting both with material containment or pricing actions. We're staying slightly green. I think that will be the case for the fourth quarter and again next year. Obviously, Bob's business is more challenging. He has less flexibility in the short-term, but over the long-term, he can adjust. We have the flexibility around the world. We talked about this with the board, where today one of our global strategy is to have that flex manufacturing capability and we've had that flex manufacturing capability.","Fortunately our businesses are not in, let's say, the bull's-eye of a lot of the tariff activity. So, it's smaller and we can react to it. So, just as much as \u2013 maybe some of our competitors are hurt, we're hurt, and vice versa, it's been a pretty good trade-off. But I don't like the way it's unfolding and hopefully things will settle. But right now, it's manageable as we told the board. And next year, what will happen is we'll have to have more material containment, we'll have to have a little bit more pricing, and clearly, it's creating an inflationary environment which helps us both at the top line, faster growth, but also forces us to do a lot more material containment around it. So, it's very manageable at this point in time even with the current actions underway and I have much bigger issues in the world than that.","Nicole Deblase - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon. Maybe a first question just on the incremental margins in Automation, I think you've been pretty clear on the top line drivers. Your incremental margins in the third quarter, I think were close to 30% or so. So, just wondered when you're looking at the good progress on Valves & Controls and the changing mix of sort of revenues in AS over the next 12 months, do you think that 30% level is a good incremental margin to aim at?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","If you look at the true underlying performance, we are around 35% for the quarter. And as we talked about \u2013 this is Julian, correct?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Julian, as we talked about is what Mike is having to do right now with the faster order pace running at 12% \u2013 10%, 12%, Mike is starting to have to \u2013 and we talked about this, he'll have to start adding some incremental people around the world to deal with the projects. So, I feel very comfortable in this 30%, 35% range at this growth level. If growth level slows down, then we'll expect that to go up a little bit higher. But right now, we're having to put people in place, we're having to make investments both from the capacity and from a capital standpoint and to take care of some of this growth.","Many of Mike's businesses right now in North America are actually getting back to peak performance in last cycle in its actual sales. So, what that means is we're having to get our plants geared up, we're having to get the people geared up, and that's something that we got to make sure we stay ahead of given our presence around the world and given how fast we're leading out of this relative to our competitors. I feel very good about the margin at this point in time, but Mike and I also have to keep having the debate back and forth what's the right balance of adding new people, adding new capacity, and it's a debate that we have a lot, but I think our margin right now \u2013 this quarter is around 35%. I think we're going to stay in this 35% range. And if we have to drift it down a little bit for Mike, then we'll do that, but also if he slows, we're going to take it back up. So, that's how we see it right now.","Mike, do you have anything you want to add from Julian's standpoint?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","No. I think that's right. Again, we've had a very nice mix of business so far.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","(00:36:44) North America...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Correct.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...all have been...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Very good.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...all have been very positive, very good for us.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We don't see \u2013 going back to both what Nicole asked and what you're talking about here, our project load right now, if you look at it, it's still very KOB1, KOB2 centric. The big projects have just started coming. And as you know me, Julian, I like to take guesses. So, as I look at the project funnel right now, what Mike is talking about and his business are talking about, it looks to me like it's really 2020, 2021 that the KOB1 mix are really going to put pressure on us, and then \u2013 but we have to get ready for that up to that, because it looks like that's where those bigger projects are heading.","I mean, if you look at classic example, if you look at what happened to ExxonMobil last quarter, I mean I've always felt that our industry is underspent and was not ready for the downturn. And you saw that from the standpoint that now people are having to spend \u2013 quickly have to spend on maintaining their facilities and the production is having to come up much faster. And if they had not maintained their facilities or are not ready for this, they obviously suffer. And this is happening across the world in this case, and it's something we saw because they cut so deeply from a capital standpoint. So, that's where we are.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And then, just maybe for my follow-up switching to Bob's business, the North America growth has been pretty soft in the last few quarters, I guess, in Commercial & Resi.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I mean, it looks like the \u2013 in Residential HVAC, at least the OEMs have seen high-single-digit growth on average in the last couple of quarters. So, just wondered is there just some timing that's weighing on the Commercial & Resi North America numbers, some market share moving around or just kind of what's going on there and when do you see that North America piece reaccelerating?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Before I turn it over (00:38:39), keep in mind too also, our OEMs have been getting price now for 18 months. They've been going out with some very large price increases. And so, some of those numbers \u2013 they had good underlying volume, but some of those numbers also are price inflated. So, Bob, you can answer the question now.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","Right. I think you're going to see that pretty heavily. I mean, I think everybody knows that we've got material clauses that we do with our \u2013 especially the large U.S. OEMs on pricing. And when the \u2013 in the deflationary time, we enjoy that a lot. If you remember back in 2016, we had over 2 points of EBIT margin improvement for Climate, and obviously now that's in a different zone, but again that's kind of normal. That is certainly widening the sales reported numbers as well. I think we've got a pretty strong presence in the industry. We think we know very well what's going on. We don't see participation issues. Frankly, there are some advantages. You've probably seen in the industry a compressor manufacturer very recently announcing that they're going to be moving away from the industry. And frankly, there's a lot of activity right now, we're involved with, with helping out some customers respond to that quickly. So, that's good news for us.","Three to one (00:39:53), there are some compressors coming this way. We don't ship compressors from here to China, but there are compressors that come in this way from some of the competition...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From China to here.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","...from China to here. That has also created some conversations, let's say, with OEMs. So, again, there's a gap right now, no question. We model it a 100 different ways, and frankly, I can't say we ever found the perfect way to correlate between what we report and what they do. There's distribution, there's timing, there's prebuilds, there's a lot of things that play out. But overall, again, we think we understand our position in this space and it's playing out pretty normally, I guess.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, Julian, it's \u2013 we watch it very closely, because we know everyone reports around this space here and we play with all the players. I mean, I would expect Bob's business here to probably be up pretty good for the next five to six months a good order pace as these guys do a lot of moving around and shuffling and replace the backlog of the pipeline. So, overall, we feel very good about it and we'll see how it unfolds, but it's definitely a different mix this year than we've seen in the past. Service levels, service type of \u2013 several products have been different this year and how service has been doing, and it's a good year overall. So, I mean...","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","That's good. And Q4 has been a warm quarter and we feel good about the way this quarter is playing out as well.","Julian Mitchell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Great. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hello, David.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve. How are you doing?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Looks like a...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I had to bring a couple friends to take you on today. So, I've got three guys here. I've got my baseball bat. I've got my Rally Monkey. The Rally Monkey is really keeping a very close eye on Tim, because...","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","It's really staring me down.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's staring Tim down right now, and so...","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","It's making me nervous.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. He's right behind Tim's head looking at him. What can I do for you, Mr. Tusa?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It must have been nice to have that kind of engaged and thoughtful crowd in that auditorium versus some of the Investor Days. This looks like an engaged crowd there, so.","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","(00:42:04)","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","A new audience for you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve she not only had iPhones taking pictures of my charts. You'll notice I had the one chart rolled up, because I was afraid to show her, because she wanted to take it home, it was our dividend history.","Timothy Reeves - Emerson Electric Co.","Leave it there for a fortnight.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Nice to refresh the audience every once in a while, that's key, got to keep them fresh. How many years has it been now \u2013 I mean, jeez?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No funky sweaters on, either. Nobody had those little funky sweater shirts on, either.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Anyway. Anyway. On this Climate thing, what will your volumes grow in kind of North America Resi for the year now, kind of on a seasonal adjusted basis? I mean, I guess your fiscal year is kind of aligned with the OEM's calendar year. I'm just curious what that number will be ultimately? What do you think it will be when all is said and done?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What will the volume numbers be for this year?","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Like, mid-singles? I mean, it just seems like \u2013 I just want to get a number on the board.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. We'll be in the mid-singles.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And to be honest, the compressor shipments this year are hitting an all-time high for us.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we are hitting an all-time high. And so, the plants are running pretty strong right now and a lot of our customers are starting to level load more production, Steve, versus where they used to try to cycle. We're starting to see more and more customers to try to keep things level, which smooths us out more. So, we're not seasonal. It's a different view than we \u2013 we're starting to see some different habits from our customers now.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","In the last few years, we've had quarters where it's been down in a quarter, and we've had quarters that have been high-single and double-digit. So, even quarter to quarter, there can be several point swing.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I guess, I'm just kind of struggling a little bit with the fourth quarter, because you said about six ways from Sunday $0.86 and maybe plus, maybe minus. Normal seasonality to us looks more like $0.90 and I'm just trying to figure out, if Climate is bouncing back and the orders here at Automation quite frankly accelerated, did you pull something forward here into the third quarter? It doesn't seem like that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. No, we didn't. You also got to keep in mind that $0.86 we're taking care of the one-time accounting stuff for Aventics, we're taking care of the $0.03. And so, I mean...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...those are two restructuring. So, you're right I mean normally. But we're also taking care of some issues as we close some deals and as we do the one-time 401(k). So, that I mean \u2013 as you well know, Steve, I really can't call a quarter within $0.05. And so, when I look at that and say that feels about right and it would be, as you say, the normal seasonal thing would be around that $0.90 plus. That's why if you \u2013 that's what we have to deal with relative to the...","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...that's what's going on. So, you're not that far off. It's just \u2013 don't forget about the $0.06 and the $.03 from what we're doing there.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. And then, I guess just as a follow-up to that, on Climate, you guys have these kind of escalators that I guess that would mean your pricing is going to kind of lag by maybe a quarter or two, a quarter plus relative to raw materials. It's not necessarily like, hey, we're an OEM and we're going to do a price increase at the beginning of the year, and then this kind of unusual price increase in the middle of the year. You guys are a bit more on a rolling basis. So, I mean, if raw is kind of stabilized here, can you be in Climate green at some point here in 2019 and start to kind of flip the other way for a period of time, given the way your escalators are working?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. It depends on the timing of when it happens. Again, if it happens later in the year, it's difficult, because we're still carrying that drag. But, again, you saw it happen when it turned unfavorable on us about 18 or so months ago. Like you said, it takes a quarter or two to sink in. And as it subsides or even stabilizes, that's about the same kind of a lag timing to go the other way.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We'll start seeing the benefit \u2013 you'll see the benefit next coming now in early next year, 2019, so.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. So, that's a good guide.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...outside of the lags, we are green already.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Got it. Got it.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","And it's going to play out that way again through next year.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve we work a very fine line with our OEMs, because we know that we're trying to make sure they stay competitive, we stay competitive, but also we're trying to keep it really tight around that plus or minus line relative to price\/cost type of situation.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. One last one for you, Valves & Controls, what kind of revenues will that business finish at in fiscal 2018 or?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't think the revenue is going to change much. I think they're going to be slightly \u2013 on a reported basis, they're going to be slightly down, because of the divestitures in the product lines we got rid of.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","But the underlying growth rate is now growing. So, now next year we're going to have a growth. And so, the underlying order growth is around 9%, 10%. So, they were slightly down because of what we divested and what we're getting out of, but now they're coming off. And if you look at the order pattern, they're growing faster. So, now they're going to start growing. So, overall, we're going to grow that business and it's going to be \u2013 we got a good couple years here between that business and what we're trying to do with it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Looks like it. All right. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Steve. I appreciate it.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Take it easy. Yeah.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Steve Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks and good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","How you doing, Steve?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Dave. I can't resist also on that front page, I know you guys turn over every stone for new investors and applause, and on that one, it looks like you got both.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's definitely. And as Tusa said, this is a little bit more friendly audience, other than the fact that they never shut up. I mean...","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Well, that's not that different. Anyway.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...but that was an unbelievable time we had. I don't know how many kids we had, 400 kids in that room? I mean, Tim was around here. Tim the Toolman was around here somewhere, too. His kids were there.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. You should let the analysts bring their kids next time, too. Probably it'd be a better day.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. In New York \u2013 yeah, we're doing it in New York. You can bring your kids in. Now, have your kids heard anyone swear before?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","All the time, because I let them play \u2013 I play your replays for them, so.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","(00:48:33)","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Anyway. So, listen, on page 8 for you and Mike, that large project funnel, I just want to go back to that, and the resilience of that sliver, there were large, large projects in the 2018 timeframe through 2019. How resilient are those in terms of the decision dates? All of this macro turmoil, you've already addressed it a little bit. Once these things get started, they're very hard to stop. And how deep into that do you think we are for the kind of KOB1 and KOB2?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","(00:49:10)","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","So, I'd say for the, we'll call it the megas, the big ones that we showed you a little depiction of that when we were together in February. If I drew that chart again, it would look similar, some megas and a lot of smaller projects, and kind of the positions timing-wise similar. The big space there is the L&G space. There are 10-plus projects there that are on the mega sizes. They are gearing up. Again, I've been around the world to meet the EPCs that specifically touch those projects. They are doing a lot of work right now getting ready. We're doing a lot of budgetary quotations to them, so they can plan their projects.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're talking about trying to tie up some capacity?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I told them they better start reserving capacity. You can just see this bow wave coming at us and they need to start thinking that way.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","They want all of our valves, they want all of the engineers to work on these projects, they need to get in line with us pretty early and they're doing that. They are doing that.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","And how does that relate to that $700 million to $800 million number that you gave in terms of awards versus your wins? And should we think about therefore that piece of it stepping up significantly?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. The largest ones, they're still out there.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. The big...","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","A lot of the awards are been on the smaller size.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. He's been \u2013 most of the awards have been in the $1 million to $10 million range. You've got a couple bigger ones, but most of them are smaller.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. They're not in the $100 million plus, but we've had \u2013 and when we get an award, it could be for a piece of the business, we might get systems early, we might get the valves early. So, we're tracking all of the puts and takes around that. So, take $800 million out of the funnel, we saw about $2 billion go into the funnel to kind of make all the math work out. So, that's what I kind of think. I don't think we'll see the funnel getting larger, because I think anything that works at $78 a gallon oil is identified, it's out there and if it's going to have a decision date within 2.5 years, it's got to worked right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve, what goes on at the CEO level on these projects, and I'll give you my perspective of what goes on here is the projects, they have them prioritized right now, but the prioritization will change. And what will happen is the CEOs, the executives will look and say, okay, the people, the location in the world, there might be issues popping up in regions of the world or they need more gas, they need more oil or we need more issues relative to our own manufacturing, they will move some of these projects, you can see a project move six months in, six months out. These projects will slip moving in and out, but what we see is we track them and we move them back, when you can see other ones come in front.","So, right now what we have been seeing is the projects have been moving around a little bit. So, we're \u2013 it's like a motion. This doesn't look like a motion, but those things are moving. But the funnel is pretty tight and consistent, and where some of these projects are moving around is pretty good right now. But what we didn't have in February and we don't have it here now is that we had only a few of what we call the big megas sitting in 2019, early-2020. We now look at that chart and there's a lot more of the megas coming in late-2019, early-2020. So, that tells me when I made my earlier statement, I think our KOB1 business is really going to start getting up there in that level in the late-2020, 2021 type of period, because that's what's going to happen. That's where we're right now. The funnel is shaping up pretty nicely. We might get up to $7 billion total, but that's a lot of work going on out there at this point in time.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","And Dave, I don't think you put a finer point, but if you could on the July order experience in AS and maybe in C&RS, too?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Mike was real close around 10% and ARS (00:52:40) was probably very consistent with where we were before I think, in the 3% to 4% range. That's very preliminary numbers and we push him hard to get a number for this call here. But I still think we're in the good side of that band. And so, overall, we're in pretty good shape.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just lastly, Mike \u2013 sorry, Bob, we talked a lot about cold chain in Asia, commercial opportunity when we last saw each other. This China heat pump subsidy push-out slightly doesn't change any of the math you've got on kind of a one-year view, two-year view?","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","No, not at all. Like I said, cold chain this year, we're going to be in the high-teens, let's say, territory. We've done a lot of things to put that organization together for a full solutions play. The Cargo and Cooper-Atkins acquisitions, we are putting infrastructure in Asia and Europe to internationalize. So those are progressing well.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Steve, before you go, I'm going to ask Bob or Mike to comment. I mean, no one has really talked much \u2013 asked quite but Mike had a phenomenal quarter in China. And it's very broad-based, because we were just over there and we did a review. And we were up on sales 20-some-odd percent for the quarter? The quarter has been very strong. So we're seeing \u2013 Mike, do you comment, we're seeing very broad across all industries a lot of new players coming in and starting to build stuff both in China and moving outside. And that's been a very pleasant surprise for the last couple of quarters. You may want to comment?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","China has been strong for us. I think locally we've seen a lot of, the state owned is busy, a lot going on with the privately-owned enterprises. We're seeing these chemical companies rise up over the last five, six, seven years. They're getting very serious. They don't want to buy the mid-tier product anymore. They want the high-quality stuff and they're leaving the borders. We've got one that we're working on that's going to go to Louisiana staying at the gas prices. But China for us is broad-based. And, again, I think I referenced it in February, there's a refining wave that's going to come at us in China, a smaller one in India to go along with it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's a power wave.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","A lot of spend there. Power is still very solid for us. We saw the nuclear plants start-up here in the last few months. So we got some of those behind us now. So we can get on to the next ones that we've been ready to work on.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","But I would...","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd say.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I was impressed.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...China is really a delight.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I was impressed, Steve. I was there with Mike and his team just recently. Bob was there, too. Bob tried to do, tried to run me over in a car, you were with me too, so.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","I didn't try because I was next to you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, but I was impressed with the broad base of all the orders and the type of industries going on and the customer list. And one of the good things in this cycle here is a lot of the smaller players that we are competing against do not have financing. They don't have the money to get \u2013 access to money. And so the big multinational companies continue to make investments, which we continue to do, including upgrading our manufacturing capability in China with the V&C stuff. We are really, really actually separating ourself again in China.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. Good guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","And outside of China, we're talking a lot about China. Commercial, we were double-digit outside of China in Q3 and we were in Q2 also. So there's plenty of activity going on in Asia broadly.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we had same.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good job. Who is next?","Steven Winoker - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good day, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hey, Jeff. You notice how our orders and sales stayed pretty consistent and how they sort of track together?","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, that's amazing. I cover a bunch of companies that that doesn't happen.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Really. One of the differences we have, Sprague and a lot of people give me a hard time about releasing orders, all of these guys are going shit I can't believe you'd say that, but that's okay. The issue is one of the disciplines we have across this company is making sure the order pace and monitoring those and what we tell you guys are consistent, because if you don't get an order and eventually get sales, something is going on.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So I just had to tweak you a little bit my friend.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Well, I always give you credit for those orders but thanks for calling it out. I guess, even the kids in the audience probably now that if sales don't catch up with orders, then the orders aren't real, right?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'll explain that. That was the next question I've got. She asked about the dividend. She didn't quite get the connection between. I mean, I tell the guys, orders are great but without a sale I can't pay a dividend. These guys hear me say that all the time. Go ahead.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","I thought you are trying to suggest we were children by the way you put that on the slide, but...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's not a bad thought.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. So, hey, obviously, things look extremely robust and everything you said about projects sounds very encouraging. How do you put in context the fact, though, that you're looking at CapEx in your sort of markets actually now exceeding the 2014 peaks when oil prices are lower and there's other maybe countervailing forces? Would that reflect that maybe some of those projects just got truncated in 2014 and didn't happen? Or just what kind of big picture perspective would you add to that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Wow.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I think as we came off the 2014 and the peak, there were projects that were planned and did not move and they got parked and they kind of idled and they've gotten resurrected. And a little bit of pre speed (00:58:10) work has been done on them and now people are making those decisions to move forward. So we're certainly seeing some like that that have been hanging out there for a couple of years, Jeff.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd say, Jeff, the biggest issue we see in North America is North America has very strong and there's capital. If you look at the GFI in the U.S., you'll see the numbers are quite strong. Is that \u2013 the pressure on our customer base was so enormous relative to cut capital so quickly that they stopped stuff very quickly in North America. They did not stop as quickly internationally in North America and that's why we've seen the North America bounce back.","And so I'm sitting there in the Valves & Controls conference with Final Control and we're seeing North America numbers coming back to levels we saw in 2014 so quickly. And that tells me that things were cut off abruptly and they had to come right back on and they're ready to do it right and I think that's a very good observation because that's what we're seeing right now.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","One other insight there is the movement of energy to different parts of the world has gone up. The U.S. is exporting LNG, it was not doing that back in 2014. So we're seeing terminal and midstream spend build...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They're all good thing for us.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","We're seeing it in Mexico, we're sitting it in the Middle East, we're seeing it in Asia.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","So I think those are some of the things that are different.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","All right.","Unknown Speaker","Resources becomes a throttle too on those projects, right? I mean, yeah, that's happened before in the peak time.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Exactly. The other thing I would say that with the way I talked about V&C, I think V&C, the Valves & Controls, they did not have the capability of manufacturing the products here in the United States. And one of the things Mike's team has gone on rapidly is now, we have huge opportunities here in North America that we get addressed very quickly with our channels. And the markets turned our way. So we're now getting V&C products into customers that they never been in before. And now we're having to quickly accelerate manufacturing and spend money and that's given us another little bump here in North America that we were not anticipating.","My hat is off to Ram and his team and Mike for getting that done because that was not easy to do. We still have 18, 24 months of fairly good investments to make here. But things moved our way pretty quickly and the team executed very rapidly and the timing of the V&C acquisition has been on perfect, as I look at it.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd say all across the platform, everybody stepped up.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We need them.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","And everybody is going fast.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We needed them.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Very clear. Just one thing. There's obviously been a disconnect in Automation this year kind of observed incremental versus underlying as you digested V&C. Should those numbers be very similar now in 2019? You've got a little Aventics noise, but should be kind of what we see is what we get on the incrementals?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","V&C is on a good path to improve. They will continue to improve. They're not there yet. Aventics, sizable number going to come in lower. It's going to average us down. We will work that over time. Take a couple years.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think that the big issue is what we're having to go through right now is we're having to spend some different capacity and some investment both in some of the service centers around the world. I mean, I think we'll probably still have a one more year of a slight dilution there from an impact. But the profitability is going to be still very good, but I don't think it will be quite accelerating as you're thinking there, Jeff. Because I still see some dilution impact, and I still see some incremental investment that we're making faster than we originally planned.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","We have a lot of potential.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Solid. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. So just want to go back to the product funnel, the obviously very impressive buildup of projects. I just want to broaden out Jeff's question. What do you think this implies for the broader cycle? I mean, I'm talking here about some of your shorter cycle businesses. And the \u2013 sort of the question is that the view out there is that we are late cycle, but my read of this is that we're now probably in mid cycle, any views there Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I'll give you my two cents. First of all, this is my gut feeling as you well pointed, Nigel, I mean, I've been in business long time, almost since my 18th year. I've been around this stuff for a long time. So this is my best feel at this, okay? It's a different cycle. I think we're in early stage of the cycle. I don't think this \u2013 there's been such a significant underinvestment, there's a stronger growth globally, there's a shift in energy usage to the gas and alternative fuels, but oil still used quite strongly around the world as a commodity.","So what we see right now is a fairly large investment up right now early on to fine tune the facilities and to deal with the short-term capacity and then a long-term. So I think we're earlier cycle on this process. And so that's why, I mean, I feel very good about this point in time and from the standpoint of where we see the projects going, it's going to be \u2013 as Bob said, it's going to be a people capacity issue for not only our customers but also all of us too at the same time. But right now I think we've got it under control. It's going to take a little bit more investment and use of technology, but I feel pretty good about where we are in that cycle.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","I'd just add, four quarters ago we were still negative. I mean, we just looked at it a year ago and so this year obviously to comp against that we've been able to put up these nice growth rates. But I think the momentum is there. We're going to grow next year along the lines we've talked about earlier, and again I think some of these projects are three, four, five-year length playouts with the sales and everything coming with them. And unless something really wild happens in the world, this stuff is going to happen. They have not been exploring.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No, they haven't been.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","They've not been developing.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","They're still reducing reserves.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Some of these guys have actually gotten behind. They got to move. So I think it's going to be pretty robust here. So I would still call it early cycle.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Historically, Nigel, I mean, I've been talking about it two years, but if you go and look at three years, I mean, these bundles are three years and they're beginning to the peak and the next year down. You're typically talking on average around 26% to 28%, 29% three-year type of average numbers of growth. And so we're just starting into this cycle at this point in time. On an average, you could take the three years and average it out.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. So I want to come back to the two-year comments. You mentioned a two-year cycle. So what you're saying now is thee years. So if it's two years of 8%, 9% growth then third year would be in that sort of slightly lower rate, but still 6%, 7%?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, 6% to 8% type of stuff. It's historically what we've seen.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Okay. Great. And then the follow-up question, so with the dilution on Aventics and Textron hitting in 4Q, it sounds like you got nice tailwinds to M&A in 2019. Can you just maybe fill in some gaps on 2019? You gave us the tax rate, but how about corporate? I think this year was a double year on the benefit. So how does corporate look into next year and any other color on 2019 would be helpful as well.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So the \u2013 I mean for corporate cost expense standpoint?","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, I mean, I think we're in pretty good shape for the year because a couple things happened. We no longer have an overlap relative to our long-term performance share plan because we've now got that totally engaged, so we don't have that delta. The pension right now is still looking good. I think our pension costs are coming down. From an acquisition standpoint, I mean, my plan \u2013 we have done on average what, a $1.5 billion to $2 billion over the last two years. I think we're going to be less than $1 billion next year at this point in time.","So from a corporate standpoint, we're in pretty good shape. We should be positive. We're in pretty good shape there. I don't see anything extraordinary coming at us at this point in time. We're still trying to manage the capital. You guys think it's real easy to spend money, sometimes it takes time to spend money and we're managing at that, and trying to get production geared up from that standpoint. But overall, I think the cost containment is pretty good. We're just selectively making \u2013 having to make some investments to deal with a long-term project that Mike sees coming at them and we want to make sure we're ready. We don't want to lose them and we want to make sure we can serve our customers on a global basis.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Well, that's a good example of capital, right, because commercial construction ability to execute is limited by the industry.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Right.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. That's an issue.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, the corporate overlap, is that about $50 million of benefit next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't know, I haven't looked at it that tightly we'll talk to you in a week or so.","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","You figure it out and tell us.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nigel, we're not \u2013 we haven't looked at 2019 that tightly yet...","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Got it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Was it Andrew?","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","Nigel, Nigel.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nigel, we haven't looked at that closely yet. Gee, we're trying to get the fourth quarter done.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Right. Okay. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It will be a positive. I don't know, it will be a positive. I couldn't tell it that...","Michael Train - Emerson Electric Co.","...we can't size it like that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","God, I wish I was that good.","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you. You guys think we're that accurate.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Hey. How are you guys?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Not too bad. We're still trying to calculate the corporate cost. I mean, Frank barely got the tax planning done in the third quarter now he can't give me a total year corporate cost for next year. What's wrong with you, Frank?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Gosh, you know...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean, what do you think Andrew? What should we do with his budget, I mean his bonus this year?","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","I think you should raise it. I assume...","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I always liked you.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Exactly. I need as many allies as I can get.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's great color (01:07:38), Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Just a question on taxes. It's interesting that it took you guys until this quarter \u2013 until this quarter to figure out that you guys want to give the 401(k) contribution. There's still tax adjustments. When you talk to your customers, how far along do you think they are in figuring out their taxes and what kind of impact the new tax structure will have on their behavior? Because I would imagine you guys are more sophisticated than \u2013 among the more sophisticated guys. So it took you like nine months to figure this out. What do you think your customer base is in terms of figuring out, okay, what do I do with these taxes?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's a couple of things going on here. One, the Treasury when they passed the law back in December, hadn't really propagated the laws yet. I mean, so it took a long time for them to get all the rules and regulations out. So as you know this year everyone had provisionals. We took provisionals. And we took a provisional in our first quarter, correct, Frank?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And so everyone has done that. Now \u2013 because we're a 9\/30 company, the laws have been propagated and we have a clear vision of what's going on. So I would expect most companies are calendar year companies. So I would expect them to really get in this sort of figured out in November of \u2013 November, December, this timeframe. We just happen to get the rules came out a couple weeks ago, a month \u2013 about 30 days ago, about 45 days ago, we were able to get this thing hammered down pretty quickly.","And so we moved forward with all the ins and outs of this thing and got it cleaned. Most companies will take all the way to the end of the calendar year to clean this up because there's a lot of things going on around the rules and regulations on the tax laws and that's why I wanted to thank Frank and Alex and those guys because there's a lot of work here and you got to make sure once you make that call that you don't reverse it. And I don't want to reverse it, because we're paying taxes along those lines. So anything else you want to add there, Frank?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","No. No, I mean, I think our large customers obviously had a good sense of it, but many of them are calendar year, so they'll probably as Dave said wait till the end of the year. Smaller customers it's hard for me to generalize. I mean I think they figured out the CapEx portion of it pretty quick...","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","...in terms of getting the accelerated deduction. So I think it's pretty well done. Some of this clarification just came out in the last week. So I mean this is still moving around on us.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And relative to 401(k), we have been planning things and studying things and we looked at all the benefits and this is the last big thing we wanted to do and typically we look at things like this would be more in the fourth quarter for us when we do things for our employees, our fiscal fourth quarter. And so that's why we did it then. I mean could we have done it earlier? The answer is yes. But this was after we looked at everything we were trying to do and magnifying and look at everything and so we made the decision to do it. And so normally when we go out and communicate increases and everything, this is just one more way you could just thank the employees for what they have done for us.","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","All right. Sure. And in terms of follow-up on the funnel, my understanding is that a big debate in the industry is that large international oil companies are sort of committed publicly to returning money to shareholders and at least publicly they have not committed to CapEx in 2019 or 2020. So some of the funnel that you are seeing are you actually having discussions with people other than \u2013 it seems like Exxon is the only one who got shellacked over it. But are you having discussions with people who have not publicly committed to spending money that in fact they are thinking about it?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Absolutely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Absolutely.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I would say every customer is in that funnel with something, they've all got their priorities, they all got their programs. They don't like taxes going up a lot next year, I don't know but it's built in, they're working on it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. I think we talked about this early on, Andrew. The first phase of capital this year were short-term stuff for these guys.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","A lot of that....","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Quick payback, quick payback, quick payback. They may not be publicly talking to you guys but they know they've got to increase their reserves. They've got to increase the sales, of the top line. So the investment discussions are underway, and it's happening. And it's also from a competitive standpoint they're not going to tell people where they're going for their money because that's a competitive advantage. So I think that you may not be seeing it, but we see it because we have to work with not only the ExxonMobils or the BPs or the Shells of the world, but we're also working with the EPCs right now. So the EPCs are getting very busy. And so, all these different things are coming together. So going back to what Nigel said, I think this is fairly early on in the medium size to large size projects at this point in time. I like where we are at this point and I'm more worried about how I'm going to produce it now as I get into late 2019 or early 2020.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","And those LNG projects, these guys are partnering with each other, and then they are going to partner of EPCs...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","So there's some complexities around all of that. But once they kind of get lined up, I think as you said Dave, they've kind of got to go.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Total project in LNG right now as you see out there, what's the total magnitude of projects being discussed, the total number?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Over $1 billion out there for us.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, but on total projects, what's the total projects?","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Oh, my God. I mean, 5% to 10% of the...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So $1 billion for us.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","We're at 5%. So it will be...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","There's a lot going on out there, Andrew.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Absolutely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're talking. Okay. Next?","Andrew Burris Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thanks a lot, fantastic.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All the best to you my friend. Frank likes you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Gautam Khanna, of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's got to be our last questioner, Gautam. You're coming up, you're the caboose man.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","All right. Pressure is on.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No pressure. Just want to make sure that the caboose is bringing it forward, make sure, no one runs into us.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","I hear you. I had \u2013 a lot of questions have been asked and answered. But on incremental margins, just to get it calibrated, the two acquisitions Aventics and Tools & Test bring with it how much of intangibles amortization next year and on an ongoing basis, recognizing Q4 has done a lot of the one times?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Give us one second. We'll give you the numbers here, my friend.","Robert T. Sharp - Emerson Electric Co.","The full year amortization for Tools & Test, we gave as $25 million, and then Aventics should be in the same ballpark.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I think about $50 million on a run rate basis for the two of them.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Got it. And so net of that, we're still talking north of $30 million incrementals?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's where we want to drive.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","I like south.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","He likes south, but I'm like north. I'm talking for my shareholders.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","We have discussions once in a while.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes Gautam.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Okay. Just want to be clear. And then getting back to your earlier comment, Dave, about next year not being as rich in M&A opportunity set, is that a function there's opportunities out there or is there some internal constraint given the amount of activity you're doing just to integrate what you got let alone grow?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not internal constraint. It's a function of what we're trying to get our hands on right now Gautam. And if you look at the acquisitions of V&C, if you look at the Textron acquisition, you look at the Aventics acquisitions, all three of those major acquisitions in the paradigm, we have been working on for years. So it's just a function of what we see we're working on right now and trying to enticing and encouraging. We may have something new come out of the blue, we don't know about at this point in time, but I'm just looking at what we see working on and what we think we can shake loose as the cooperation where the acquisitions are coming from and it goes through cycles like that, and so we're working very, very hard and as we get into the 2019 and early 2020, they will try shake loose a couple of more good one, nice little bolt-on acquisitions. It just takes time that's how I see it.","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company, LLC","Thank you very much, gentlemen.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Thank you very much. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. And very much appreciate you joining the call, and again, Mike and Bob and Frank, your whole teams out there around the world, thank you very much for what you accomplished this quarter.

Welcome to Emerson's Investor Conference Call. During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode.","Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. This conference is being recorded today August 4, 2015. Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Craig Rossman, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Craig Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you, Tim. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's third quarter 2015 results. The conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website for the next 90 days. I will start with the third quarter summary as shown on page two of the slide presentation.","Net sales in the quarter decreased 13% to $5.5 billion with underlying sales down 5%. The continued pressure from lower oil prices has resulted in further capital spending reductions by global oil and gas customers, particularly those in upstream markets. Industrial spending remains sluggish on a global basis, but most significantly, in energy related and commodity markets.","The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind for our businesses. The third quarter order rates reflected the continuation of difficult economic conditions as the trailing three-month underlying order rates have been down in a range of 8% to 10% over the past four months.","Order rates were under pressure by the sustained headwinds from lower oil prices and gas prices, capital spending weakness, across many of our global manufacturers, weakness in data center and global telecommunications infrastructure investment and the effect of the U.S. residential air conditioning customer pre-build.","Turning to slide three, gross profit margin declined 120 basis points to 40.6% driven by volume deleverage as we adjust production and inventory levels, unfavorable business mix and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar on operations.","Overall, profit margins remain at a significantly positive level. Restructuring expense totaled $36 million in the quarter and $89 million on a year-to-date basis. A significant level of restructuring expense is expected in the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per share decreased 18% to $0.84. The current market conditions require focus on execution of the strategic programs including global cost reduction actions.","Turn to slide four for the third quarter P&L summary. As mentioned, net sales decreased 13% versus the prior year, with underlying sales down 5%. EBIT margin reflects the impact from accelerated restructuring costs. In the quarter, approximately 11 million shares were repurchased.","Turning to slide five, underlying sales growth in the quarter was down 5% excluding unfavorable currency translation of 5% and the impact of divestitures of 2%. Global demand was mostly down with the Middle East and Africa being the exception up 3%. Across the other regions, the U.S. and Asia were both down 7%, Europe was down 2% and Latin America was down 10%.","Turning to slide six, business segment margins declined 220 basis points to 15.5% primarily due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring expense. Operating cash flow in the quarter decreased due to lower operating results and taxes paid on the gain from the divestiture of the power transmission solutions business. Trade working capital performance was affected by the overall business slowdown. Over the next three months to six months, the global operations teams will be undertaking additional actions to align trade working capital with business conditions.","Turning to slide seven for the Process Management segment results. Process Management underlying sales declined by 4% with a 6% reduction from currency translation, resulting in a net sales decrease of 10% in the quarter. Oil and gas capital spending remained weak as a result of lower oil prices. Upstream markets remained under the most pressure, while downstream activity in chemical and power markets continues to provide growth opportunities.","Demand in the Middle East and Africa grew by 5% reflecting favorable activity levels across the region, particularly in midstream and downstream markets, while demand in Asia was down 7% with growth in emerging markets offset by slowing conditions in China and continued weakness in Australia. Europe was down 1% with strong growth in emerging markets offset by declines in mature Western European markets.","Margins were down 250 basis points due to volume deleverage, unfavorable mix, the impact of the stronger dollar on operations and increased restructuring. Demand is expected to remain weak through at least the first half of the fiscal 2016 and given the continued downward trend in commodity prices, a significant recovery will not be experienced until 2017.","Turning to slide eight for the Industrial Automation segment results. Industrial Automation net sales decreased 23%, as currency translation deducted 7% and divestitures deducted 11%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 5% versus the prior year. The third quarter sales reflected continued softness in European demand, upstream oil and gas and industrial spending, specifically in energy related and commodity markets. Demand was down in all regions with North America down 11%, Europe down 2% and Asia down 1%.","Margin decreased 80 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Market conditions will remain challenging with a gradual improvement in Europe and sustained headwinds from upstream oil and gas. Business capital spending plans are expected to remain weak given the softness in the global economies and global GDP is expected to be less in 2015 than it was in 2014.","Turn to slide nine for the Network Power segment results. Network Power's net sales decreased 17% as currency translation deducted 5% and divestitures deducted 1%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 11%. The third quarter reflected continued weakness in the global demand for data center infrastructure and telecommunication investments, with North America and Asia telecommunications spending down significantly.","The difficult conditions were felt across the regions, as demand in China was down 28%, North America down 10% and Europe down 4%. Margins decreased 510 basis points, reflecting volume deleverage, lower price, unfavorable mix and increased restructuring. We expect demand to remain mixed in the near-term with areas of opportunity in data center infrastructure and telecommunications power.","Turn to slide 10 for the Climate Technologies segment results. Climate Technologies net sales decreased 6% as currency translation deducted 3%, resulting in an underlying sales decline of 3%. Demand in North America was down 6%, driven by a double-digit decrease in U.S. residential air conditioning compressors, as customers continue to work through remaining pre-built inventory. Asia was up 3%, as growth in India and Southeast Asia air conditioning and refrigeration businesses more than offset slowing demand in China. Segment margin decreased 130 basis points primarily due to volume deleverage, higher warranty expense and unfavorable mix. When normalizing for the North American residential AC pre-build, the 12-month rolling sales growth is in line with the industry. We expect fourth quarter sales to be down modestly.","Turn to slide 11 for the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment results. Commercial & Residential Solutions underlying sales grew by 1% with a 2% reduction for currency translation and a 2% deduction for the transfer of a product line to another segment, resulting in a net sales decline of 3%. Sales growth in the quarter was driven by favorable trends in U.S. construction, growth in the food waste disposers and wet\/dry vacuums more than offset declines in professional tools and storage businesses.","U.S. consumer spending has been lackluster as recovery has been muted. Modest growth is expected in the fourth quarter, as favorable trends in U.S. construction markets are expected to continue.","Turn to slide 12 for the 2015 outlook. Little change is expected in market conditions for the remainder of our fiscal year. Underlying sales will continue to be affected by reduced levels of capital spending in oil and gas markets, most significantly in upstream project activity, a continued broad slowdown in industrial spending, particularly energy related and commodity markets, a general weakness in capital spending by global manufacturers and sluggish growth in certain emerging and mature markets.","As a result, underlying sales expectations will be lower, placing continued volume deleverage pressure on profitability. Restructuring expense is now expected to be in the range of $160 million to $180 million for the year.","Based on the continuation of the difficult current trends and their increasingly negative impact on results, we've revised our 2015 outlook as follows: Net sales will be down approximately 9%, with a 5% deduction from currency translation and a 2% deduction from divestitures, resulting in underlying sales that will be down approximately 2%. Reported earnings per share are expected to be $3.97 to $4.07, which includes a divestiture gain of $0.77 per share.","And with that, I will now turn it over to Mr. David Farr.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much, Craig. Clearly, extremely tough quarter and it got tougher as the quarter went on as we got into June. The big negative surprise for us in the month of June was the extreme weakness in China. We saw China drop over $100 million from prior year, down 14%-plus versus prior year. The bottom fell out in many of the core markets in China and we do not see that recovering anytime soon.","Our oil and gas investments continued to weaken, as the price of oil, the price of gas has continued to slide. We now expect pretty weak orders in this space for at least the next 12 months to 15 months. And we're a bit concerned about the pace of recovery. So what we're focused on right now is getting our restructuring done, getting the company right-sized to a slower pace of business and making sure that we can improve profitability even with the lack of underlying sales.","As Craig mentioned, year-to-date restructuring is around $90 million. Operations have geared up and are very active right now. I would expect the number, to be honest, somewhere between $70 million and $100 million in the fourth quarter, which will probably be in the $160 million, $180 million, maybe a little bit higher, if we get the work done. There's a lot underway around the world.","From my perspective, the restructuring from when we started it back in early February \u2013 from when we started this to when we finish this sometime early 2016, you're going to see SG&A, personnel head count down 8% to 10% from beginning to end, so a major undertaking around the world as we continue to reposition the company for a weak market.","Not much I can do about the market at this point in time. We faced the other issue of obviously strong competition coming out of the weaker currency markets, in particular out of Europe and Japan. Those things we have to deal with and that's why we've to get our cost structure in line.","As you've seen, the orders have continued to stay weak, in the negative 8% to 9% range. I would expect that to continue for the next quarter at least. We have not seen any indication to say that things are going to get much better. So we're focused on dealing with weak orders, weak sales and obviously, weaker production throughout our facilities.","So production's coming down, inventories will be adjusted, we will get the cash flow back, most likely a cash flow we top as we go into the fourth quarter, but we'll get that into that fourth calendar quarter, our first fiscal quarter. We'll start recovering that as we get that production back in line and we start liquidating the inventories that have been built up over the last 12 months to 18 months as the slowdowns happen.","The global teams are acting fast. The global teams, obviously, are clearly focused on the short term and the restructuring necessary to get our costs back in line, to get our production back in line and to make sure that we can improve our profitability even with an environment that we're seeing right now that we're going to see minimal if any type of growth for the foreseeable future.","At the same time, the teams are very focused on dealing with what we announced at the end of June from Network Power. Also, our Industrial Automation, LEROY-SOMER Control Techniques business and the continued divestiture of InterMetro business, as we continue to structure the company, the focus on segments that we want to invest and grow over the long term.","In the short term, we're very much focused on execution around costs, execution around getting our balance sheet back in shape, and then, we'll continue to move forward at the right time and the right pace, as we see the core markets recover, and as we see some other investment opportunities in the two business segments that we're focusing on going forward.","Net-net, obviously, not a pleasant quarter, one to deal with and one to report. Fourth quarter's going to be equally as challenging as we've had sessions with the operating leaders here in the last couple of weeks, and again, we're going to be meeting with them again on Thursday, Friday this week. It's all about getting the actions necessary to get the cost down, to get the production down, and deal with the marketplace that we're dealing with right now.","From our perspective, we're not losing this market, it's just a tough market for us, and there's no way to color it other than that. It's tough and we're dealing with that toughness at this point in time, and that's where we are.","And so, with that, I'll open the floor up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll take our first question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks and good afternoon, everyone.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I guess, Dave, look, it's \u2013 the fundamentals just continue to get worse, the market's not getting any better. I'm just wondering like, how do you feel comfort that you guys are doing enough from a restructuring standpoint, at this point?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You give your best shot, as we look at the forecast, as we look at where we see things going, and we bite off as much as we can do. And what's underway right now is a lot, and we're impacted with big chunk of this company with a lot of costs, and it's not really facilities we're dealing with. Our overhead structure, right now, trying to get it down, and at the same time, we're going to have to deal with our overhead structure, as we go into a smaller company, as we move out of 2016. So I firmly believe we've spent a lot of time on this. I feel that we have the right actions underway, and we're taking the right amount of costs out.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And I guess like the $225 million that you expect to spend by the first quarter of next year, I know you've talked about a payback of one-to-one. Can we see the \u2013 will we see all of the payback by fiscal year 2016 or is that some of that going to bleed into 2017?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're hoping to get close to $200 million in that fiscal 2016. Our game plan here is to get our costs down in a very difficult volume environment, so we can improve profitability, improve earnings in a tough marketplace. That's why we're taking this hard and quick action we're taking, and you're dealing with people here. And this is \u2013 we're not \u2013 there's not a lot of facilities we're rationalizing here, because our facilities are pretty well rationalized. What we're dealing with is an overhead structure of trying to get their costs out so we can drive that profitability to the bottom line. That's how you get that \u2013 the savings so fast.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Fair enough. Maybe one last question and I'll get back in queue. I know it's still early, but any thoughts yet on, you just announced that the strategic alternatives for a few of your businesses. Any progress yet, any interest on those businesses, just any color there would be helpful.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's pretty \u2013 it's early. I mean we've got \u2013 we've obviously had some interest, but it's too early to deal with that. We're working down the spin route right now. It's too early to talk about it. I think it's going to be worked here for the next three months, four months, five months, six months, and we'll spend that from that standpoint. InterMetro action, most likely will be done sometime before the end of this calendar year. We're targeting sometime in October.","Joseph A. Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah, so the first question is, I mean really kind of challenging numbers across the board globally. Do you think there's an issue of share loss here in addition, because we have seen very weak numbers globally, but not to the extent maybe in this variance for the quarter. So how do you speak to that or can you speak to the \u2013 are you leveraged to a particular end market or sub end market, particularly with respect to China? Just anything, any narrative around that would be helpful.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, I mean our China business has held up reasonably well for the last 18 months. In China, we don't firmly believe we're losing business at this point in time. I mean we don't see any indication of that. But we're \u2013 in China, we have very strong markets relative to the strategic owned enterprises, the state owned enterprises, which have really cut back on spending here in the last three months or four months as that government has ratcheted back some of the issues they're dealing with.","So if you look at our Process business, as you look at our Enterprise business in China and if you look at some of the other Climate businesses, we're seeing these where the state run enterprises have really curtailed, stopped spending and they did it very suddenly.","So I mean this is something new from our perspective to see that type of drop-off that quickly and until we see some kind of stabilization within the China market, the China government, I'm a little bit nervous about China and the recovery there. So we're expecting the next couple quarters to be pretty tough there, but that's what it is. It's around that China \u2013 it's just those spending at our key customer base.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And then I guess as a follow up, Dave, I know it's early and you get the restructuring, the restructuring benefits, but just conceptually thinking about 2016, do you have a visibility to say hey, we could be close to the bottom here in terms of EPS degradation or just too early to tell? I mean what's your view of 2015 versus 2016? Is it possible for you to grow in 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think the big issue for me right now is we had a very strong first fiscal quarter of 2015. We're up almost 5.5% underlying growth. We're up very strong earnings, double-digit earnings, and I think the visibility right now is very challenging, because I know I got that big hill I've to climb sitting right out in front of me and that \u2013 the fourth quarter was very strong for us last year and our first fiscal quarter is strong.","So it's a little bit early for us to see how we come out of that as we get through these next two quarters.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","This is \u2013 yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean that's the big issue right now. The next two quarters, we're looking at the huge walls we have to get through and see what from an order standpoint and backlog can we get up there to get some kind of growth in the second half of next year.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","And how do you think about M&A in this environment, when the prospects of a cyclical rollover and the bid\/ask maybe get widening between seller expectations and buyer expectations? Do you think this cools your potential appetite for M&A or your capability to get things done of size?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. And we'll \u2013 if the right thing comes along, we have the capability of doing it. Right now, we're looking at divestitures and spend. If the right opportunity came along from an acquisition standpoint, we'd jump on it pretty quickly. I don't think that has any issue for us. We understand that.","Robert Paul McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks for your time, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay, you're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just another question on the share with Emerson, just specifically with Network, that high single-digit underlying order decline, that does seem worse than some of the peers. I guess more peers exposed to power management not seeing severe declines. Can you maybe speak to, is it the data center and telco specifically or how your power management sub business is holding up?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I mean the core business is holding up. We had a very strong \u2013 we had some big project wins last year at this point in time. We also had \u2013 we have a very strong presence in China which is unique, in our telco space in China and North America telco have really cut back in spending. So that's why you see those numbers are a little bit more drastic than our competitors. Underlying business is pretty much in line with that, but the telco spend, both in China and North America, very difficult.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Right. Very helpful. And then just could you give us an update on the inventory on the Climate side and when that might be worked down?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We could relook through the cycle, because from the standpoint, we look at 12 months, it's pretty well trending. I would say right now, our estimate \u2013 not estimate we know 1.1 million units were pulled forward. I would say they're probably 80% through that right now. We should start seeing some North America refilling(23:33) \u2013 production is really \u2013 our inventories right now, production levels are low, so we expect to start seeing that flow through in the fourth quarter.","However, the issue for us, the comparison will be very difficult, because last year was when we were selling it both in the fourth and the first quarter, but we're seeing it come back in. If you look at the underlying, I would say pace is improving in North America. So I'd say they're getting through it pretty quickly.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Johnny Wright with Nomura.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just can you comment, Dave, around the competition out of Japan and Europe? Is that partly reflected in sort of the pricing environment, and is that on the Process side? What are you kind of seeing there from competitive pricing perspective?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I mean we have Japanese and European competitors across most of our businesses, both on the \u2013 Process side, Industrial side and Climate side. And clearly, with the weaker currencies, they have the opportunity to price, to drive that business their way. We're working extremely hard. And one of the reasons we're working so hard on the costs is because we do not want to lose any position in this situation where we are at a huge disadvantage with a stronger dollar against our European and Japanese competitors.","So the pricing is definitely tougher. And from our standpoint, we're dealing with it. The one advantage we do have is we get into the 2016 environment is with the weaker commodity environment, the weaker material environment, we will start getting benefit from that as we get into the first half of next year. And that's a big advantage for us and will help us offset this price cost.","Right now, I'd say we are still \u2013 as you understand, we look at this price and cost, we're staying probably pretty close to being neutral or slightly green, and the key issue for me is to stay ahead of this power curve. Yes, we have pricer (25:30) pressures, in particular from the weaker currencies out there, but the commodity supply side guys are working extremely hard right now to get the respective cost reductions to help keep us price costs green as we get into this tougher price environment in 2016. So that's where the war is right now and I feel good about the battle and I feel good about where we are.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then sticking with Process, from a vertical perspective, obviously upstream oil and gas staying pretty weak, but some of the downstream businesses like Chemical and Power actually seem to be holding up relatively well. Maybe you could talk about what you see there in terms of quoting activity and how you see those verticals holding up into 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The downstream, in particular the Power, has held up extremely well, and certain chemical segments held up extremely well. The order pace is at record levels. It creates a little mix shift for us a little bit, but the pressure is on profitability. But that activity is very, very good right now and we feel good about that, in particular, both in North America and in Europe. Asia is not that good. India is good for us right now.","But downstream in Power and downstream in the petrochemical area we see good pricing. We're a little bit nervous right now relative to \u2013 there's been a lot of actions by major global oil and gas companies here in the last two weeks and that will obviously start flowing back as they continue to get pressure on their capital spend. And that could possibly have an impact on what we would call their MRO, the repair business. If they get a lot of pressure on cutting their capital even more, they'll cut back in certain areas in the MRO area and we'll start feeling that. That's another concern I have right now with the continued weakness of the price of oil and gas, which \u2013 where's the price of oil today? Down $45 \u2013 where is it, $45? So that bothers me a little bit there.","Jonathan David Wright - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, Dave. If we go to 2016, just follow up one of your earlier comments, if in fact revenue did go negative next year and was say down 1% or so, could you still drive margin expansion in that environment with all the puts and takes that you're talking about?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's the goal. That's the goal.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","And...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's the aim.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah, go ahead. Sorry.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's the aim. That's what we're trying to do. Every operation guy's trying to figure out how to deliver improved profitability with no growth or slightly negative growth.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. And the kind of \u2013 I mean if we sort of think about what's possible in that goal given all the restructuring that you're doing, when you're calling out restructuring, it sounds like through at least the first quarter, but clearly in the environment that you're describing, it's kind of hard to imagine that you wouldn't be restructuring through much of the year. Is that a fair comment?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What we're trying to get done \u2013 we'll do some in the first half of next year, but we're trying to get it done so we can stabilize the business. And we've identified where we want to go with the restructuring, we've identified the costs, we have a map where we think things are going to head out, and that's where we're focused right now. I don't \u2013 my objective is get this \u2013 the major work done as we get into that second fiscal quarter next year.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Right. And I guess if I also compare everything that you're going through right now compared to what you went through in 2008-2009, one difference it seems, maybe \u2013 I don't know if I'd call it a bright spot, is that at least the order rates are not getting decelerating any faster it seems from the \u2013 but is that just a temporary thing? I mean based on what you're seeing in the front lag (29:21) and all these quoting activities that there could be another step down from here?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I'm glad you saw a bright spot in there, Steve. I'd give you \u2013 I'm going to give you...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm looking.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I owe you a glass of wine for that one. I don't know if there are any bright spots here, but...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I got my magnifying glass out, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're getting half a glass of wine on that one. Okay. At this point in time, we do not see it stepping down on the order pace. We look at the trend lines, we look at the various businesses; it looks like it's bouncing around this bottom. The question is, is there anything that's going to pull it back up?","We know what the comparisons are like for the next couple of quarters, but I mean I don't think \u2013 I don't see it as a step-down at this point in time. I mean it looks like it's trying to bottom here. And I mean I've called this before and I've got my ass kicked, to be honest, and that's not a swear word, Steve, you know. It's kickboxing here. I've been kicked around the ring a couple of times here this year. And it looks like it's forming; I don't see another step-down at this point in time (30:26).","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And it...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Unless you saw a sudden break in oil or \u2013 I mean you saw another sudden break in commodities down, say, into the $30s or below, then that would create another problem.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And then finally, non-res, just, you spoke about the res pressure, what are you seeing on the non-res side?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Non-res North America is \u2013 we've had a decent environment. It's continued to weaken. I mean the actual \u2013 what I would call the capital spending, the type of products that we sell have not been all that exciting. There's been some non-res construction, but the basic capital spending environment has not been very good in North America and \u2013 in the industries we serve.","We don't serve the automotive industry, and so it's been very anemic at best, and there's been very little recovery. And then you see a lot of drop-off as any \u2013 all the industries that support the broad oil and gas industry, both here in North America and in Latin America and around the world, so it's been pretty broad and it's been business-by-business. If you look at the segments that we look at, this is pretty broad across very many businesses here.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thanks, Steve. I owe you half a glass of wine for that...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Next week.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...slight positive you gave me there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","A couple of beers.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just a question on the gross margins. I guess they got up to about 42% second half of last year, they're now down to 40%. Maybe pause out between mix and volume deleveraging, which one was more important within that? And then when you're looking ahead, how do you think about the ability to hold the gross margin at around 40% considering price cost and (32:19)?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, it's about 50%-50% that degradation there. We still feel very good about, as we \u2013 recovery structure and stuff like that, we'll get this thing moving back up. I still believe there's two \u2013 from the 42%, I still believe there's about 200 basis points improvement in the GP margin for the company.","So we're clearly going through a lot of restructuring right now, there's a lot of mix going on and there's a lot of deleveraging, but the underlying fundamental GP margin of this business is still pretty good, and it'll move back up into that 44% range as we get there.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And then just within Industrial Automation, obviously, a very big drop in North America there in the quarter. Maybe just remind us how much of that business, globally or North America, you think is direct or indirect oil and gas?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","All \u2013 I mean in the North America, it's pretty heavy oil and gas.","Craig Rossman - Emerson Electric Co.","Total is 15.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, 15 is the total, but in North America, it's very heavy because it's Caterpillar.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","And so, the Caterpillar business is off significantly and that's primarily North America business, so that's what's driving that down, both from the standpoints if you look at what they \u2013 that we serve into their solar type of business and also their generational oil and gas platforms in the mining area. That's off significantly as they continue to take inventory out, they continue to take their production down.","So we expect that's going to keep running this way for the next couple of quarters, as they keep doing what they're doing, but that's what that is primarily. It's very heavy oil and gas.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. And then just lastly...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Energy is related \u2013 yeah. Go ahead.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","...got it. And then quickly on Process, you touched on MRO earlier. So I guess, have you seen MRO hold up until now and it's all been \u2013 CapEx has been coming off in the orders and sales?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. We've not seen the MRO come off yet, but I've gone through enough these cycles, as you guys well know, I'm a little bit older than you. And when I see the oil companies really under the pressure right now, they cut capital even more from their shareholder base. I know eventually what that means is they'll cut into the core MRO.","And so, I would expect the next six months for our Process business to start seeing some of the MRO business gets cut back, which won't help us. It will be another little headwind for us, but we have no indication. I just know what happens. I mean these guys are going to get pressure to cut capital. We know that's going to happen.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Understood. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You take care.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Hi, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Hello Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just going back to China, your comments about June sounds quite frankly quite disturbing. What do you think caused the drop off in June, Dave? Is it liquidity or is it the government telling you yes, we need to pull back in spending? What do you think caused that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","The major state owned enterprises, there has been a lot of continued crackdown on the ethical issues, the arresting and replacement of management team. A lot of people are afraid to make decisions. They're going to make bad decisions. So we've seen this on a broad base and a lot of our customer base across China where there's been a curtailment of spending as they figure out what's going to go on relative to the leadership. And this whole uncertainty around China and sort of the leadership of who's in charge, who's not in charge relative to the businesses and so there's been a big push in this area again and it's obviously reacted very strongly in some of our customer base which are a lot of state owned enterprises and customers in both the Process world and the Network Power world, in particular.","And they got hit real hard in China. And I expect that's going to continue until we see some clear direction of stability in the leadership of the various companies out there which a lot of those companies are having a lot of the management changes right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So you've seen a big divergence between the SOEs and the private companies?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then based on your comments around orders the next three quarters to four quarters, I think you said that they're going to remain quite weak. And then given that you're telling your managers to basically aim to restructure, to grow margins on going back down to (36:53) sales, would you suggest that we base our models on that basis, Dave?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes. I think it's \u2013 my firm belief is you got to wait till I get through these. I got two big mounds we've got to get through here, both the fourth quarter which was pretty strong for us last year and the first quarter. We got to see how we get through those mounds, how we see the underlying order pace, has it reached that bottom, and I think it's a little bit too early to bank on that.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then, just finally, Dave, on the Process margins recovered from 2Q into 3Q, up about three points Q-to-Q ex restructuring, with very little help from volumes, so I'm wondering what drove that. Was that cost saves from restructuring?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Was there a mixed benefit Q-to-Q?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We're getting the cost out.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Dave.","David N.

Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. Dave, just back to the MRO and OpEx versus CapEx discussion. We've heard from a lot of companies, it's actually a little bit the opposite, that the OpEx has been cut, because that's what their customers can easily cut and perhaps the CapEx comes later down the road. Does that intuitively makes sense? Is there something different in your business mix (38:22)?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What I said is that up till now they've been cutting the project spending \u2013 the capital spending, and now, my concern is with the most recent two weeks of all the announcements coming out of the major oil and gas customer base out there, they're cutting capital again, they're cutting project again, and my concern is they're going to start cutting into the MRO base which has held up until now. I'm just giving you my gut feel for this thing, that's what I was telling people, that is they continue to get pushed by their shareholder base to cut their capital spending and protect their free cash flow, they're going to start going into MRO here in the Process world. We've seen it in the past.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","How much do you think Emerson internal CapEx declines in 2016?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's where we finished this year; it will go down next year. I would say that we're going to be down to 2.8% of sales level.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just last one from me, Dave. Share repo, you do have a fair amount of liquidity. You expressed the willingness to do deals, but just wonder you feel like the organization can take on a large deal in the midst of all this change, and would you prefer repo over deals or is there any particular prioritization there?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","If the right strategic deal came along, we will slow down repo and do the deal. In the meantime, right now, we're banking on probably around $1 billion right now for next year in share repurchase. And so that's where we're going to focus, but if the right deal comes along, we'll do it.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Dave, the third quarter restructuring was well below plan. Now, you have a big target for the fourth quarter. So just wondering what were the timing factors some of the prioritization that caused that to move around?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's function around announcing in certain markets and giving out the proper notice, in particular, outside the United States. And so, it took us a little longer to get approvals, and now, we're moving forward, we have those. And so, we pretty well have this in sync right now as we move into this fourth quarter.","Sometimes you guess a little \u2013 not guess, you plan a little wrong and if it takes longer to do the discussions and negotiations, then you missed it by 30 days or so and that's basically what's going on there. But it's in the pipeline, it's coming. And the question is how much can be announced and discussed with the organizations around the world, and that's why I think it's a broad range here from the fourth quarter, it's a function of what can be formalized from the discussions and negotiations.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, makes sense. And then, in Network Power, could you go into a little more detail on the negative price there? I don't think that was mentioned last quarter.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","China. It's really \u2013 it was very \u2013 I mean the markets dropped off in the big enterprises; they were using this leverage to drive price down. The local producers are all looking for business right now. The markets weakened and their export ability has weakened because of their marketplaces, and so, therefore, they're looking at dropping prices to try to protect and that's \u2013 we're going to have that situation going on hard in the power area in particular across China.","Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","On Process, so at $45 to $50 oil relative to the restructuring you have in place, now, if this continues, do you envision having to do a lot more beyond that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I think we're pretty well sized in the $40 to $50 range right now and my next threshold is it possible that \u2013 that will create \u2013 that's going to create some very difficult challenges that we're going to look at how we reorganize and to take costs out to protect that profitability.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. But that's in this range you feel okay?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we feel okay here.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And then, going back to not this past Investor Day, the one before in 2014, so you had this big initiative around spending. I know that probably affected some of your businesses that are being separated, but what's the latest on that? And I assume that's been cut back in a meaningful fashion here (43:10).","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","That's been cut back in a very meaningful factor. I mean clearly, the opportunities for growth right now are not there, so we're curtailing that spending where it doesn't make sense and it's been cut back quite significantly.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Is there anything that you're doing spending on in this environment?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, we still have some \u2013 from a technology standpoint, from an innovation standpoint, we're still spending money, but we're being very selective and a lot of projects are being pushed out (43:39) slow down. So yes, including some of the Oracle investments, some \u2013 other things like that we've got to slow down that stuff.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a last one, quick modeling question. For next year, typically, you run on the three-year incentive comp where it gets \u2013 there's kind of a double up every three years. So as we think about next year, usually, at the pretty big ramp, when you get into a year like next year, so is that still the case? I mean I don't know Frank can comment on that.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah. There'll be the overlap next year. Right now, we're looking at 50 to 75 but it's early...","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Frank J. Dellaquila - Emerson Electric Co.","...yet to tell exactly what that's going to be, but you're right about the structure of it, there will be an overlap next year and that will be the biggest year for that.","Rich M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, I was hoping to get a little more like calibration on the restructuring in terms of you said head count and SG&A could come down between 8% and 12%.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","8% and 10%.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","8% and 10%. Okay. Is that \u2013 how does that compare to the previous restructuring actions that you've taken and how quickly do you think you can get that depth of cuts done?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","On a salary basis, head count, that's pretty normally what we've gone through before; you go back in the 2003-2004 time period, because most of this restructuring is coming from not manufacturing, it's coming from a salary base. We're not closing facilities down \u2013 we've a couple of minor ones, but they're very, very small as we move them around. So this is in line with other significant programs we had across this company and I would say based on how we started and where we are right now, our goal is to have this done as we get to the middle of 2016.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And this wasn't clear, or I may have missed it. Does this include restructuring actions in Network Power?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","This includes \u2013 yes, I mean Network Power will be \u2013 is going to be with us in 2016. Yes.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And you also mentioned that there are changes needed to the balance sheet. Is this related to the spend and divestitures or was there anything else you're referring to when you talked about balance sheet?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","What I referred to \u2013 the balance sheet was, I want to get the balance sheet strengthened and from the standpoint of \u2013 as this volume has dropped off, we have working capital captured on our balance sheet right now, both from a receivables and an inventory standpoint. And we want to get those levels down to an appropriate level. It usually takes us a couple of quarters once we stabilize and we expect that to be done, I would say, sometime early in the calendar year of 2016. On past looks at it and where the trend line is going right now, that's where I'd say it's going to be.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon. Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, Dave. Just on the idea of orders or trying to find a bottom here, at least geographically, it doesn't sound like that's going to be from China, right? That area (47:01) sounds like it's getting worse. Is there, either geographically or by business, do you think there's an offset? Is Europe feeling much better to you, or what would be the offset to China getting worse and that stabilization of orders?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","From our perspective, the stability will come in from Europe. I think there's not been a robust recovery in Europe. I think Europe has sort of muddled along at a low pace. But that's where I would see some improvement versus our \u2013 China. I would expect us to see some improvement in North America, as we come into this time period. And that's where I'm seeing it right now and that's where I'll see it. And we're not going to see it in China. You're right.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And then, specific to Network Power, obviously, the business there is under a ton of pressure and I mean China is a big part of that, but just broadly, pretty weak and yet you say demand is expected to remain mixed. Can you talk about opportunities in data center and telecom? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel there where you're actually seeing things you're bidding on and opportunities for order improvement in that piece?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't think you're going to see anything in China until the spring of 2016 relative to new opportunities of substance. I think you see day-to-day \u2013 our day-to-day business is okay in those marketplaces, but I think until you see some big opportunities, I think it's going to be into the spring of 2016.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Steve.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","On the Process side and the margins, so I guess \u2013 should we still think of this mix dynamic as MRO good, projects a little bit weaker? I mean is that something you're planning on kind of fighting through as this MRO drops off or is that \u2013 does that kind of \u2013 just when things go down like this, it's just more about taking the blunt actions on restructuring to offset that?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","A couple of things happen, Steve, on this type of business. When the large projects slow down, we have \u2013 typically what we'll see is a smaller type of project business and that business is usually better profitability wise. So if you think about the profitability, the hardest for us are the large, the smaller projects are good and the MRO is even better. And so, right now we're seeing \u2013 as those large projects are cut back, they're still doing some smaller stuff, medium-sized stuff and that's good project business for us. So I think the mix right now is still helping us a little bit in profitability, but it's not a big movement.","We still have the pressure of some of the big projects moving away through and some of that mix, but we're going to have to get the cost out to deal with the issue of a general slower-down pace of business, but I think it's going to be a little bit of both. It's not just MRO and large; there are some good medium-sized projects in there, which there is a good pace of that going on out there right now.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then on your mindset, I mean I asked a similar question to another one of the companies we cover last week about restructuring in this environment, but acknowledging the competitive threats that are out there. I mean, how do you weigh that, because you just talked about kind of trimming some of those investments? How do you keep your guys focused on the mindset of defending or even growing share while really battening down the hatches and delivering for guys like us on the cost side?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You have a lengthy (50:50) debate with each of the business leaders on this very specific issue, that no one wants to jeopardize the longer-term opportunity. So we're going to look at things that maybe aren't as critical and that's where you're going to cut and you're going to figure out we red circle, we circle, we ring fence areas that we must protect for those strategic reasons and then we'll go deeper on the other side. That's how we go about doing that.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. One last question. I think you issued some debt in the quarter. Net debt is up I think like $600 million or $700 million quarter-to-quarter. How will that trend? I know the filing said you'll use it for corporate purposes. How does that trend over the next couple of quarters? Will that begin to come down or is that now \u2013 you used it for some buyback, maybe some cash management dynamics because of your foreign cash that's overseas? Just what's going on with the debt levels over the next couple of quarters?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's not going to change much. It won't change much. If we're effective of getting out the cash by the end of the second fiscal quarter next year, then the debt levels will come down a little bit, but it's not going to change much.","C. Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, Gautam.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","You mentioned the desire to bring down inventory and the resulting kind of absorption that you're going to have to take. Is that going to be concentrated in Process or are you talking across the board?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Across the board. Across the board. I mean, obviously, Process and Network Power are the biggest dollars of inventory, but it's across the board and no one's really out of line. It's just that where we see the pace of business going which is going to be weak for several quarters now, we need to get that inventory back down. So we'll do it very systematically, one, not to shock the heck of our supply base, but also work it down over a six-month, seven-month time period. We've been working on it for the last couple months.","Clearly, the orders have been weaker here in the last several months, which creates a situation where we have to lower that water even further. So we do it very systematically. We don't try to shock it. That's dangerous.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just another follow-up. In your monthly orders that you give us, have you had any major de-bookings in Process or Industrial Automation or elsewhere and that has kind of amplified the negativity in the numbers? Or has that not really been the big part of the story yet?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No. It's not that big. It's not that big. We've not had anything to drive that big time. If we did, we would let you know.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","(53:48)","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just lastly, seasonality, normally fiscal Q4, we get a nice little plus up in margins in Process and elsewhere. I mean given what's going on real-time in the markets, what kind of bounce are you expecting sequentially if at all?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We are expecting profitability to bounce positively in the fourth quarter for various reasons. One, restructuring. We've now got $90 million done in the last 2.5 quarters. And we're starting to see a payback of that. And so, we're seeing that, and also, the typical type of mix of business where the business comes from. So we see sequentially we have a good improvement in our sales and we are going to see a bounce back in the fourth quarter.","Gautam J. Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot, guys, and good luck.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Afternoon, Dave.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon, John.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","What is your sense of Middle East being able to continue to be resilient in the face of oil prices? And it seems to be a lot of I guess politics and employment issues, right, that are sort of continuing to drive these projects, and it's obviously been a source of strength for you and other companies. But I think it's \u2013 does it continue to hold in, like is there \u2013 is that \u2013 should we just sort of think of it as a placeholder? What's your sense?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I wouldn't \u2013 I call nothing a placeholder, but...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Well, relative placeholder.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...yeah. Okay, John. I think you're exactly right. They have the issue they have to produce oil, they have to maintain that's what their income is. So they're going to have to produce more oil. They're going to need to invest to produce more oil, and they're investing for other jobs across a diverse group. So we've seen, not every business, but certain businesses have done reasonably well in the Middle East.","I mean on the data center business side and what I call non-res construction type of business side, it's been very poor, but on the Process side, it's been pretty good; in the Climate side, it's been pretty good. So right now, it's holding up, and the order pace is holding up. So right now, I'd say we're going to see moderate growth again in 2016 as of right now, based on what I've been seeing from an order pace...","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","...which is surprising to me.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Can I switch gears to Network Power here? I'm wondering do you think there's an issue perhaps that would be fleeting or temporary, but one perhaps nonetheless that maybe there is some distraction costs going on, post the announcement you're going to spin the business. And I'm wondering with this (56:22), I'm thinking in the olden days certainly, India, China, employees were just sort of habitual, but employees would bounce around company to company. A lot of companies had very high turnover. Just wondering post the announcement if perhaps there've been some worker, kind of extra worker losses unplanned at the managerial level or whatnot, that maybe...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...could be exacerbating temporarily the Network Power results in China or elsewhere?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","No John, it's been actually opposite. It's been very positive, people are very happy about it.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","So again, it's a positive note. They've had a tough couple of years here and it's got hit again really with the telecom spend both here in the U.S. and in China, and the enterprise spend in China. So they just got hit again, but within the organization, it's been well received. And maybe it's strong for us right now.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. I mean so there's not really much that you can do about the markets for that business. It sounds almost like that there is hypothetically further deterioration, you're just going to go ahead with the spin anyway. So in other words, analysts and investors, there's nothing that fundamentally is likely to detract you from the plan to strategically spin the business or...","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Nothing.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","...are there other things we should consider about?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","I don't see anything stopping us right now.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeremie Capron with CLSA.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Good afternoon.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Following up on restructuring, most of it seems to be happening right now and you just said that it would continue into the December quarter. Do you expect restructuring to continue at a similar pace in the first half of next year? How should we think about the total cost that you're taking out of the business between February of this year and the midpoint of next year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","You mean total, I'm still holding to around that $225 million to $240 million from the February at the beginning \u2013 when we started this process to its finish, it's going to be in that $225 million to $240 million range.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. So basically, we're looking at another $70 million into next year? Is that right?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","We'll see. We'll see what we have come down the pike here, what kind of the pace of the business is, but when all said and done, we did $90 million in the first three quarters. Let's say, we do another $90 million in the fourth quarter. That's $180 million. I'm looking somewhere between $40 million and $60 million probably next year.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Does that work for you?","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, yeah, absolutely.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Okay. Good. I didn't have a calculator. I used a piece of paper and a pen on that one.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Well, that works well too. I'm a little bit surprised to see negative mix across your five divisions. Is that anything to do with price more than mix? And then if you could comment on the overall price level, how much of a drop in price you've seen so far this year?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Yeah, from the standpoint we don't measure price that accurate, I would say the general price trend is slightly negative across the whole company. We didn't offset that from our cost reduction, not material inflation. I would expect we'll have negative price \u2013 slightly negative again next year.","What we've been seeing is mix within the businesses, some of our more profitable businesses are having a tough quarter, like Process. And so, we have this unfortunate situation where right now, we have a lot of businesses trending down quite hard which are the more profitable businesses. And sometimes that helps us and sometimes that hurts us, and right now, it's hurting us.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And when you look at your order intake, any shift in terms of pricing here happening over the last few months or just a similar slightly downward bias?","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","It's \u2013 from my perspective, right now, the pricing is obviously getting tougher every month. Particularly with the euro where it is at $1.10 and the yen where it is, but it's not noticeably much different. I think we're going to have the same issue as we go into 2016, too. That's why our costs, our work on the material containment stuff is very, very important to us. We're going to need that because we know the pricing environment is not going to be easy unless we see the dollar start weakening which I see no indication the dollar's going to start weakening.","Jeremie Capron - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Well, good luck with that.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","David N. Farr - Emerson Electric Co.","With that, I want to thank everybody. Again, it clearly was an extremely challenging quarter and not pleasing to see. We are facing another extremely challenging quarter again, probably for the next two quarters. The organization is very much focused on getting our costs and our production down in line relative to the pace of business we're seeing right now and we're making good headway. And we would expect to see improvement in profitability here in the fourth quarter which will give us \u2013 set us well as we move into that first quarter.","So thank you very much for your time today and I appreciate your support.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to Emerson\u2019s Investor Conference Call. During today\u2019s presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, the conference will be open for questions. (Operator Instructions) This conference is being recorded today, February 4, 2014.","Emerson\u2019s commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements including the company\u2019s outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson\u2019s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Patrick Fitzgerald - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Ron. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s call will summarize Emerson\u2019s first quarter 2014 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson\u2019s website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.","I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Sales increased 1% in the quarter to $5.6 billion, with underlying sales up 3% as the economic environment reflected slowly improving market conditions. Demand among industries and geographies was mixed, but favorable overall with a better business climate in Europe and emerging markets growth of 7%. Gross profit and business segment margin reflected solid improvement. One-time corporate items related to accelerated charitable contributions and acquisition costs increased expenses by about $50 million. Earnings per share of $0.65, increased 5% or up 8% to $0.67 excluding the acquisition costs. Cash generation was strong with operating cash flow up 8% supporting the repurchase of 4.6 million shares. It was a solid start for 2014 with execution from several strategic priorities.","Next slide, P&L summary. As I noted, reported sales increased 1% and underlying sales decreased 3%. Gross profit margin expanded 20 basis points excluding one-time acquisition costs related to the previously announced Virgo and Enardo transactions. Higher SG&A expense reflects a $30 million accelerated charitable contribution that was offset by related tax benefits, such that earnings per share was essentially neutral. Acquisition costs and charitable contributions impacted EBIT margin about 90 basis points. The tax rate was lower from the contribution benefit and final items from the embedded computing and power transaction. EPS of $0.65, up 5% reflects through repurchase of 4.6 million shares for about $300 million.","Next slide, sales by geography. The underlying sales increase of 3% was led by 10% growth in Asia, which includes a 14% increase in China. In other geographies, the U.S. was up 3%, Europe was flat, Latin America declined to 1%, Canada declined 5% and Middle East and Africa grew 9%. Emerging markets were strong across the business segments up 7%.","Moving to Slide 5, segment earnings and cash flow. Profitability remained strong across the business segments with 40 basis points of margin improvement. Corporate expense was elevated due to the previously mentioned accelerated charitable contributions of $30 million and acquisition costs of $21 million. Operating cash flow grew 8% reflecting earnings growth and lower working capital investment. Trade working capital as a percent of sales improved 90 basis points led by strong inventory performance.","Moving to Slide 6, process management. Process management underlying sales increased 5% with North America up 4%, Asia up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America down 10% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Acquisitions contributed 3% resulting in net sales up 8%. The sustained strength in the oil, gas, power and chemical industries continued to drive growth, which was led by a near double digit increase in the systems and the solutions business, which was particularly strong in China. North America accelerated with the U.S. up 6% while project timing caused the decline in Latin America sales where orders increased at a double digit rate. Process automation markets continue to support elevated investment levels with a robust project pipeline particularly in North America.","Next slide Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation underlying sales were flat with North America unchanged, Asia up 9%, Europe down 5%, Latin America up 3%, and Middle East and Africa up 18%. Industrial goods markets reflected mixed trends with strength in Asia, improvement in North America and softness in Europe. Emerging markets were up high single digits. Growth in the fluid automation motors and drives, electrical distribution and materials joining businesses was offset by weakness in mechanical power transmission markets. Sales in the power generating alternators business were flat with stable but sluggish markets. Market conditions are expected to slowly improve as demand recovery and favorable comparisons support a modest growth outlook.","Moving to Slide 8, Network Power, Network Power underlying sales increased 2% with North America up 1%, Asia up 2%, Europe up 1%, Latin America up 8%, and Middle East and Africa up 27%. The embedded computing and power divestiture and currency translation deducted 13% for reported sales down 11%. Strong demand for global telecommunications infrastructure and steady data center market conditions drove the growth. Emerging markets were up double digits led by Latin America and Middle East and Africa. Telecommunications end markets were supported by 4G network investments globally. Data center investment growth in Asia and Europe was offset by slower demand in the Americas. Profit margin declined primarily due to a $13 million one-time research and development credit in the prior year. Market conditions are expected to be favorable in the near-term supported by recovery in Europe and momentum in Asia.","Next slide, Climate Technologies, Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 5% with North America down 1%, Asia up 13%, Europe up 5%, Latin America up 9% and Middle East and Africa up 6%. Growth was supported by the global refrigeration market recovery and stable air conditioning markets. U.S. sales were mixed with double digit growth in temperature controls, weakness in service and flat demand in air conditioning after mid-teens growth in the prior year. Growth in China exceeded 20% with strength in air conditioning and refrigeration businesses. Europe improved as well. Orders accelerated to 8% growth in the quarter led by Asia and Europe. Growth momentum is expected to be led by global refrigeration markets along the continued strength in the air conditioning business.","Moving to Slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions, Commercial & Residential Solutions net and underlying sales increased 3% with North America up 2%, Asia up 11%, Europe up 6%, Latin America up 6% and Middle East and Africa up 4%. Residential investment in North America continues to increase steadily which drove growth in the professional tools, food waste disposers and storage business. The wet\/ dry vacuums business declined in large part due to high demand in the prior year from Hurricane Sandy. Market conditions are expected to remain solid in the near-term with support from continued North America residential momentum.","Next slide 2014 outlook, economic indicators remain mix, but trending slightly favorable as reflected in our underlying orders which have been trending in the 3% to 4% range for several months. We are expecting global macroeconomic tends to remain favorable supported by improved conditions in Europe. Based on current market conditions, our 2014 outlook is unchanged with underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%. Reported sales are expected to change minus 1% to 1% which reflects the embedded computing and power divestiture, completed acquisitions and currency translation. Margins are expected to expand approximately 0.5% with the benefits from portfolio changes and volume leverage partially offset by accelerated strategic investment. Earnings per share excluding goodwill and tax charges are expected to go 4% to 7%. Business segment and other financial metric forecasts will be provided at our annual investor conference next week in Boston.","And with that summary of results I\u2019ll turn it over to David Farr.","David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, Pat. First of all I want to thank everybody for joining us today and hopefully you guys won\u2019t get too much snow, I\u2019m looking out my conference room right now, we\u2019ve got plenty of snow fall in here in St. Louis, a nice cold winter, good for the oil and gas industry.","First quarter unfolded as we expected. From the standpoint of our financial forecast that we presented in November and will update in details in the investor conference next week in Boston, it happens just like we believe to what happen. We will talk about the incremental investments next week and where they\u2019re going and why this was important and what you\u2019ll see the deal why this was pretty strategic to us and why the timing is right now.","I also intend to have five business leaders with me next week, in addition to my talk so we will have the five (business leaders) give a brief update on the key issues they\u2019re seeing both from a business standpoint and the investment profile, give you a chance to give a broader perspective and what\u2019s going across this company. I want to thank all the operational leaders for delivering in the first quarter, a good first quarter with underlying sales actually a little bit over 3% and 3.4% range.","Order trends should continue to drive sequentially better sales, better earnings, better margins and growth in the next two quarters. From my perspective we have good start and things are lining up for a very solid year as we talked about back in November and we\u2019ll talk about it next week. New acquisitions are starting off well and will contribute EPS this year even with the normal balance sheet, accounting actions we had to take in the first quarter which is typical with this type of acquisition not unusual there. We\u2019ve done $1.2 billion; we\u2019re still targeting $1.5 billion for the year and with one small divestiture which we hope to get done in the preceding second half of our fiscal year.","Operating cash flow and free cash flow was very good in the first quarter on top of last year\u2019s extremely strong first quarter. As I look at it right now we\u2019re targeting somewhere around $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion in operating cash flow and we\u2019ll continue to payback money to our shareholders most likely in the 50% to 60% range this year a little bit under 60% given the fact that we\u2019re doing more acquisitions than we have over the last three years.","But overall very good cash flow performance, the balance sheet in very good shape and we had the flexibility and the need or the flexibility, the ability to do what we need to do from acquisitions or investments internally or getting money back to our shareholders. As usual I\u2019ll give you a lot more details on the economic expectations what we see both for the world in 2014 and over the next couple of years and what that means to our various businesses, I go in great detail on obliging. But just give you a little bit perspective right now to taken a long trip around the world with adding a couple of their OC members.","As we look at USA right now it is getting slightly better. We see the USA trends improving and we expect pretty good growth in USA this year versus last year. Canada getting a little bit better though, a very slow start, weather is not been very good and but we do expect Canada to have a reasonable growth this year of both as the oil and gas money has happened and if can sort of I get that pipeline going some point down would really help all of our investments up and down, Canada and the Midwest.","Europe, European trends continue to improve. Europe was flat in the quarter but all businesses were up except for one which is industrial automation and that\u2019s primarily driven because of the Caterpillar, but everybody else was up and we had a good quarter in Europe, I expect that will continue to gain momentum, I do not expect that to be super-fast growth but improvement growth which will help us in the United States and else will help China, we\u2019ll talk further about that next week.","Just coming back to the Middle East also see that Middle East doing well for us right now both in orders and sales and expect Middle East potentially be the strongest growth segment that we have are ordinary this year coming out of Middle East. China had a great start all across all businesses, the order pace was good. Yes, the news coming out of China things are slowing, that\u2019s nothing new. We do expect China to still have a good growth here this year as we see right now and we\u2019ll see how that goes in the next couple of months, but right now everything looks pretty good for us. In total, Asia-Pacific looks pretty good, driven by China and parts of Southeast Asia and hopefully India will hold in there right now as it did \u2013 as the orders show right now.","Latin America will be okay growth this year, won\u2019t be as good as last year in my opinion, but still be positive. It\u2019s probably high-single digit. Hopefully that will continue to strengthen. But overall as I unfold the year I like the pace, I like where things are right now. We are making investments. In my opinion all the operational performance was delivered in the first quarter. Basically we talked about \u2013 we laid out in our targets, in our financial plan, so I felt good about it. And I am looking forward to seeing everyone next week in Boston. To help Pat\u2019s job a lot easier, we decided not to give any charts out this year. So it will be really not to decide, which ones we are going to put in and not put in. And so we will have no charts. And so that will be a lot easier for everybody and Pat is dying right now because he is looking forward to that conversation. So I look forward to seeing everybody next week and hopefully you guys will have a reasonable weather for the next couple of days and not get snowed in.","So with that, let\u2019s open the floor for questions. And we will see what\u2019s on your guys mind. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Inch from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning Dave.","David Farr","Hi John.","Frank Dellaquila","Hi John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Dave, could you talk a little bit about your emerging market exposures, what you are seeing and maybe exclude China. And the question is sort of how the cadence of emerging market trends played out over the quarter and kind of how you are thinking about it this year?","David Farr","Sure. I went through a little bit there. From my perspective right now in the emerging markets, the Middle East looks still pretty good. I was just there, the order pace is good. I expect them to have a good year. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they are not as strongest, fastest in growth rate, high-single digit maybe even getting close to 10%. India is a market I am concerned about and I am factoring in the \u2013 let\u2019s say I think I am looking at Asia being somewhere in the 6% to 8%. I am factoring in basically a challenging year in India. We will see how that performs. I am a little bit concerned about India. Southeast Asia looks pretty good. Obviously the Thailand thing bothers me a little bit. From this perspective our business has not been disrupted yet, but there is a potential chance that it could be disrupted because it gets a little bit more wide spread.","Coming back into Latin America, the order pace looks pretty good, we have some delays relative to what\u2019s going on in Mexico because the law changes, which are going to be very good relative to \u2013 for the energy marketplace will be good for us. Debt flow was down relative to sales. Overall I am pretty confident that our Mexican and our Latin American business will be high single digits for the year. Africa is doing okay. Eastern Europe, right now it\u2019s starting to improve, I would say if Europe continues to trend upward then we will see Eastern Europe doing okay this year. So my biggest concern right now on emerging markets would be probably down into deep in the Latin America and the Brazil, Brazil region, Venezuela region and I am also concerned about India at this point in time. But that\u2019s my perspective. China it\u2019s I think the way our businesses will line up I think we\u2019ll do okay in China this year.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay, that makes a ton of sense. David, if we were to look at Network Power, how were margins ex-embedded computing and I am really sort of, is there a way to kind of parse out the margins year-over-year like how did the margins perform ex-embedded, I think you still have kind of this part of that?","David Farr","They were still slightly down based on some of the investments and restructuring things we are doing right now. But we are seeing \u2013 with their way where that we thought they would be for the start of this year. We have a lot going on relative to Network Power relative to new products and the changing things like that. So I mean from the margin performance standpoint I am pleased where Network Power is unfolding and holding and but they were still slightly down even we take out the embedded piece. They are in good shape. They had \u2013 orders were positive, sales were positive, Europe was positive, Asia was very positive. So right now I think Network Power is on track to have a much better year than they did last year, which is important for us.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","The fact that you don\u2019t have embedded in the business and you once did low teens margins, is there some dynamic given the fact that I agreed the business is getting better, but there is still a lot of sort of mix questions, right? Some reasons why you don\u2019t think this business over time, so obviously not \u201814 couldn\u2019t get back to kind of a low teens margin?","David Farr","I know \u2013 our plan is to get it back in that low teens margin, the 12%, 13%, 14% and 15%, yes, we are. We expect that that\u2019s where we will go. I mean the fundamental today, I mean right now we have significant investments as we are rebuilding in some technologies, we are rebuilding in some global sales positions and technology positions, so we expect that to put your backup in that range. That business fundamentally should be there.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Got it. Okay, thank you.","David Farr","See you next week, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Deane Dray from Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Hi, Dave. I was hoping you get expand on your comment on process in the robust pipeline, I know you choose your words carefully and that sounds pretty positive and you highlighted North America maybe just take us in, what are the end markets, what are the customers telling you and when do these turn into revenue?","David Farr","From our respective right now in North America, we are starting to see some of the downstream investment from all the strength into oil, the real oil and the gas coming out of the North America. We are starting to see the investments are happening across the southern part of this America and the product is being let go right now. We will start getting some sales late this year as you remember I have said all along our process would be more \u2013 the growth will be a little bit more rear-end loaded, because of some of these projects. So from my perspective right now, our project business both here and the Americas is looking pretty good. Also Asia is still looking very, very good. I think we are going to have another record setting year both on bookings and sales in Asia. And I am pleasantly surprised at the investment profile even coming out of the Middle East in the oil and gas area. So I would expect based on the pipeline we are seeing right now based on the level of activities from the bidding standpoint that we should have a very good process here again this year. Obviously, we are coming up with very high levels and I don\u2019t \u2013 right now, I do not anticipate getting double-digit top line sales, but I expect to have high single-digit type of gross sales out of these guys. But it\u2019s setting up very nicely and obviously we continue to make very good money in profitability and invest a lot in this business too.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Okay, that\u2019s real helpful. And just given all the headlines on some of the Latin America currencies, you all are one of the very few that engages in hedging practices. So this might be a good opportunity just to refresh everyone on the hedging and how perhaps any of the \u2013 any of the major currency swings affect it?","David Farr","Yes. I mean, the only hedging we do right now is at the operational level from the standpoint of buying and selling goods, but that\u2019s the sort of transactional that flows in and out. There is not much going on. We don\u2019t hedge a whole lot. I mean, obviously the currency right now the weakness and the real, the Brazilian real is not a good thing. But sometimes we have swings in the quarter, because what happens is a lot of our global contracts in the process in particular are done in dollars and they go back and forth. They true-up by year end, but we are not doing a whole lot of hedging right now, but clearly the weakening in southern currencies are also very disturbing from the standpoint of overall business and what\u2019s going to happen down there. So, that\u2019s why I am more cautious about Latin America than my internal people would be, just put that way. I think to your point there is going to be a concern there.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Understood. We will hear more about that in Boston.","David Farr","Take care, Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks.","David Farr","Hello, Julian. Are you guys seeing a lot of snow?","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Yesterday some, but it\u2019s pretty much gone now.","David Farr","Good, good.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","In terms of the \u2013 you talked about the accelerated investments back in November.","David Farr","Yes.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And I guess did you see kind of the normal run rate for the year in Q1, because I guess your clean gross margin was up 60 bps, your SG&A to sales extra charitable stuff was flattish. So, it didn\u2019t \u2013 from the outside it wasn\u2019t obvious you had stepped up investments. So, I just wondered if that was something that you had done and you just absorbed it in the operational leverage?","David Farr","I would say we did it and we absorbed it in operational leverage, but we also \u2013 it will grow bigger as the year goes on, but we still did pretty good job on actually absorbing some of the start of this investments. And clearly, we got very close to 3.5% underlying sales growth for the quarter. That\u2019s a good number for us. Once we get in that 3.5% range, we do leverage a little bit better, because as we move towards 4%, it\u2019s even better. So, clearly, we are \u2013 the investment dollars will ramp up as the year goes on, Julian and I am hoping that hopefully we will have pretty good leverage as the year goes on too. So maybe a little bit slightly better profitability, but we\u2019ve got to get the sales, that\u2019s key for us right now.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then within industrial automation, yes, you have done a lot of restructuring there the last four years or so. The margins were down slightly I guess even with revenues being up, was there anything \u2013 was that because of I don\u2019t know decremental margins within power transmission or was there anything kind of special going on there?","David Farr","Nothing special, just some tough mix for the quarter and some of the investments going forward, so I mean that\u2019s little bit of mixed noise, I mean, from quarter-to-quarter that more round, but overall, the profitability of that business should be pretty good again this year as it was last year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then just lastly within your U.S. process business, you reiterated the fact that sales should pickup later in the year from downstream projects. I guess was the 6% growth in the U.S. you saw in the December quarter, was that a surprise, just the base was very, very difficult, but you still grew 6%, I guess even without these projects coming through?","David Farr","I would say, it\u2019s probably \u2013 I was pleasantly surprised at how the U.S. did. The U.S. did little bit better than I thought they would. I actually thought we grow a little bit in the quarter in Europe, but we didn\u2019t, but as I look at the first quarter, I was pleasantly surprised in the U.S. I was hoping a little bit of growth out of Europe. I was disappointed in the Latin America, which did not grow on that. And so we saw better growth in the U.S. and not as much growth in Latin America \u2013 no growth in Latin America. So I think those are three surprises I saw in the quarter.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks a lot.","David Farr","You are welcome. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with MKM Partners. Please go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Hi, good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon Josh.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Dave, could you just walk us around the portfolio and give us a sense for how pricing is looking, where you guys are green and where maybe it\u2019s been a little bit tougher?","David Farr","The portfolio right now, where everyone would be green, except for I would say network power. Network power with some of the \u2013 we have been \u2013 we are going after some telecom business, the China Mobile build-out is happening right now and we are aggressively going after that business. We want to make sure we protect our installed base there and that is one of the biggest telecom investments you are going to see in China for the next couple of years and we want to make sure we have our adequate fair share of that. So I would say that\u2019s the place that we have had to sharpen our pencil the most around the world. And other than that, pricing is holding in there pretty well right now. We might see a little bit of squeeze if some of the commodity pressure keeps dropping down, but right now from a price cost standpoint, we are in pretty good shape. Would you say so, Frank?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, we were positive for the quarter. And I think we are pretty much on our plan for the year right now.","David Farr","Yes. We will give an update here at February as the guys come in for President\u2019s Council, but nothing surprising. I don\u2019t think you are going to see much overall movement positive or negative around. I mean, we might be look I said I think in November slightly positive or slightly negative. We are going to be pretty tight at this one. There is not a lot of movement right now.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. So the pressure or I guess design pressure on your end in embedded or not I am sorry not embedded, network power in China right now plan for the rest of the year as you see it today?","David Farr","I would say that we are going to close that a little bit. We will probably end up being a little bit of red there by the end of the year, but it will be less red than it is today.","Josh Pokrzywinski - MKM Partners","Got you. Alright, thank you.","David Farr","You are welcome. Thank you. I will see you next week hopefully.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Hey. So Dave, I mean you clearly sound more positive on Europe, I mean I know it was only flat in the quarter, but things seem to be getting better there, how positive does the turn kind of in capital investment plans feel there and how much you think Europe could actually grow?","David Farr","I am going to talk about that next week, but right now, my gut tells me that we are not looking for a big turn, I am looking probably for Europe in the 1% to 2% type of growth range for us. I look at the GFI by growing 2% to 3% type next year. I mean, as the trend lines continue to improve, clearly we need to get it towards that 2% range or the 3% range in GFI to help us little bit more, but I was pleasantly surprised where I am hearing in Europe from our customer base and also from our own guys internally. And that\u2019s going to be very important from my perspective, the way I would see the world is China, if Europe starts growing again and output and you are going to see China be helped and then you will see us be helped and so the U.S. helped. So I think that\u2019s a key thing and the world doing well next year if Europe stalls. And I think you will see the global economy stall again. And I think Europe is going to be the key driver of this thing.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay. And on process in terms of this pipeline, the pickup in the second half of \u201814 that you have been talking about, what\u2019s the tail like on that accelerated growth once it starts going? I mean, how long is this pipeline going to run when we started to think into \u201815 plus?","David Farr","If the pipeline actually gets built and they started actually flowing the oil down to the \u2013 into the Southern part of the United States then you could see for many years being like two, three, four years a pretty significant build out of what I would call downstream type of businesses across Louisiana and the Texas and Oklahoma region. People talk about there is only 50 new jobs because of the pipelines, but that isn\u2019t taking into consideration that if you build that pipeline and you have that steady stream of oil coming just like the gas pipelines that are being built right now the manufacturing and downstream production will happen in that region and we will have a lot of \u2013 lot more high paying jobs. First of all, to build those factories and secondly to operate those factories and those are skilled jobs when you are looking at be a refining or chemical or whatever type of process you are looking at those are pretty good jobs. And those ones that will come down the road that will be more in the 2015, 2016 time range. So it would be very positive.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Okay, great, thanks. See you next week.","David Farr","Alright thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon Steve, did you make the show in New York, the HVAC or was it more too cold so you couldn\u2019t call it HVAC (indiscernible)?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","I made it. I saw your guys there. Yes, some good technology, good technology.","David Farr","Was it a heating show or air conditioning show?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","When I walked across town about five blocks in the snow I was wishing it was a heating show but it was pretty cold so. But back to business on network power, so could you just give us the embedded, the actual embedded sales and profit you booked in the quarter I am just \u2013 I am having hard time understanding what you mean by the margin was still down a little bit ex-embedded did you \u2013 does that mean down a little bit ex-embedded stripping it out of the first quarter of \u201913 as well or down from the 7.2%, just wondering what the run rate is in the second quarter here?","David Farr","We going to give it to you right now, hold still.","Frank Dellaquila","When you \u2013 Steve this is Frank. Hand on one second here.","David Farr","This is because I am not going to give anybody any charts, so we are going to give you actual numbers. This is the trade off so (indiscernible) and because no one gets charts start, you get this information because you get this information no one gets chart so.","Frank Dellaquila","So it raises the margin for both \u201813 and \u201814 when you strip it out of both years, but the delta actually gets a little bit worse, maybe a little bit worse.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","What were sales last year in the...?","Frank Dellaquila","It was essentially breakeven sales last year. We booked about $350 million. This year closer to $150 million.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, so $150 million at breakeven?","Frank Dellaquila","Yes, basically yes.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay so it\u2019s like a lowest like mid-7%, low to mid-7% type margin. Am I doing math right","Frank Dellaquila","When you strip it out yes, no it\u2019s a little higher than that.","David Farr","It\u2019s like approximately what?","Frank Dellaquila","It\u2019s about 8%.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, 8%. Now the seasonality here, Dave as I move through the year I mean historically at least in the last several years it\u2019s been kind of like first and second quarter even and then you kind of see a little bit of a ramp in the second half. I mean is that how we think about the second quarter margin for these guys kind of in that similar range?","David Farr","Yes, I think across all of Emerson our seasonal pattern is pretty similar. We \u2013 the first quarter is our weakest. Then second gets a little bit better and then third and then fourth. Sometimes third is even better than fourth, but third and fourth clearly we are always the second \u2013 just the way our customer base is and the way \u2013 and the type of channel we have here that\u2019s the way it is. So it\u2019s going to be first, second, third, fourth I would say that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go \u2013 improvement.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. And then sequentially on the total sales for next quarter I guess last several years you have been kind of a high-single digit sales number obviously you have some headwind from embedded. So just for total Emerson kind of mid-single digit sequential sales increase first to second quarter, is that the right seasonality?","David Farr","No I think right now we are looking at more would be if we did about \u2013 we are going to be in the fours I would say. I think right now the order \u2013 and the pattern is pretty important to us. January was not a great month for anybody as you have been hearing everywhere I mean that we lost so many \u2013 we lost lot of days.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","How bad was January, was it down?","David Farr","I mean in January \u2013 we lost several days. I mean I don\u2019t know exact numbers right now. It\u2019s just anecdotal to me. But it is not I mean it was because we lost 2 or 3 days and so a lot of businesses. And so I would expect and our customers did too. So I expect if this weather stays up like this there as a lot of people losing today again too.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay what \u2013 sorry go ahead.","David Farr","Yes, so I would expect we are going to be \u2013 I mean the numbers I am looking at right now for the quarter I would be looking at 4%, 4.5% range for underlying sales growth.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","For underlying year-over-year sales growth for the total company?","David Farr","Correct.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then one last quick one just on China, I know you have got some dynamics around process and network power, but I guess in this kind of a general industrial you are seeing in China, there has been a bit of an uptick for a couple of peers I think Siemens and Rockwell talked about it. It doesn\u2019t appear that, that economy is getting like materially better. Is that a \u2013 is there \u2013 are there some stocking dynamics going on there do you think, is there \u2013 how do you think about just kind of like general industrial demand in China?","David Farr","Our general industrial business was very \u2013 it was very strong in the quarter both in \u2013 I mean we\u2019re strong across the board in China in sales and orders in the first quarter.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","","It\u2019s got.","David Farr","It was very weak \u2013 it\u2019s been very weak for about 18 months, the Climate guys started leading out if you remember correctly last year late. And so we\u2019re starting to see \u2013 it\u2019s not a channel building here because this is not a channel business, that much of business for us. We\u2019re seeing pretty much a lot of the people starting to invest, continue to invest in the productivity, they\u2019ve got the capacity right-sized. And so right now I just came back from meeting with all my agents that we saw a very good first quarter, we\u2019re still \u2013 we still feel very good about the second quarter. So we see orders and we see a good quarter in the second quarter in China then I might feel very good about the year there.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thanks.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Rich.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Two quick ones on process the margin was pretty good this quarter and last quarter Dave you talked about MRO potentially picking up in North America. Did that come through maybe earlier than expected?","David Farr","We saw some good \u2013 we did see some good MRO in the quarter, yes we did. And I mean I don\u2019t have the full analyzing, I don\u2019t have to do every quarter, but I would say that, that also tells me we could have a lot of big projects flown through there either at this point in time. So we had a lot of MRO. So it was just overall, it was a good mix, it was a right mix for us, sometimes you get lucky but I would say MRO came especially since we saw North America do well too.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Alright. So the way to think about it going forward is the mix probably gets a little less favorable?","David Farr","I would say so. As we go into the second half this year we\u2019re going to start seeing some more \u2013 I would see some more margin squeeze, we\u2019ll still do okay for the year I mean we\u2019ll still do very well for the margin to the year but I would say that we could see some squeeze. And the other thing going for us too is we\u2019re going to have \u2013 we\u2019re going to have some good growth in acquisitions we make through which are very good help us there too. So it\u2019s going to be an interesting dynamic, I expect pretty good things in our process this year.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. And then in network with UPS in North America has been pretty tough at for a while now based on your order commentary and the results. What are the dynamics there, what are you seeing out there competitively I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like anybody is knocking the cover off the ball, but how do you think this plays out over the course for the next 12 to 18 months in terms of growth?","David Farr","I think we and our competitors are going to start seeing a better market dynamic in the UPS here. We are \u2013 we\u2019re actually seeing the orders now and as the UPS is a little bit longer lead-time because of big systems. So I was in Italy, I saw that the pipeline there and not prudent with the pipeline here in North America. So I think you\u2019re going to see UPS which had been weak for the last \u2013 you are right the last 18 months for all of us, you\u2019re going to start seeing better investments. We\u2019re actually seeing better UPS business outside the United States right now because a lot of big \u2013 some projects being done outside the United States by some of the big datacenters so the cloud datacenters. Right now based on the pipeline and based on order pace I think you\u2019re going to start see in North America UPS do better.","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, great. See you next week.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome. See you next week. Look forward to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Steven.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Nice to hear you speaking positively about manufacturing in the U.S. resurgence whether it\u2019s a pipeline or anything else?","David Farr","You know I\u2019m a very proud America guy. I\u2019m from the Midwest. We\u2019re very positive people out here.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Excellent. So..","David Farr","And won the World Series.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Well it\u2019s always next year, right?","David Farr","Thank you very much. I appreciate that opportunity.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","So can you just talk a little bit about acquisitions and your strategy I mean you did Virgo, Enardo, those obviously give you quite a lot of additional capability. Should we be thinking about this on a more aggressive basis going forward?","David Farr","No, I mean as I said we\u2019re going to probably do another $300 million this year. We would like to do \u2013 we\u2019d like to stay focused on this $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of bolt-on type acquisitions over the next couple of years. As I talk about next week that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to talk about, we\u2019re going to be looking at level type acquisitions. These are ones that we\u2019re quoting, these are ones we\u2019re working, the timing is not always \u2013 we don\u2019t drive the timing, we work it hard, but that\u2019s a tough acquisition we\u2019re going to do, we\u2019re going to do, we did one in Network Power, a nice solutions service type business there. We did a couple of acquisitions and the process in the first quarter. So you\u2019re going to see us through those in process, some in Network Power, some in Industrial Automation, and some in Climate along those type of things, nothing real big, maybe ranging anywhere from $30 million up to the $500 million range, that\u2019s our focus plan right now.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great. I know you talked about January before a little bit on weather, but if you think about the PMIs that you\u2019re actually starring at coming out recently obviously for U.S. but elsewhere too. I mean are you as confident I mean is there anything that sort of impacted your confidence level in that, are you just saying what we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing in our portfolio so it\u2019s got to be weather and move on and we\u2019ll get better in a couple of months. So how are you thinking about that, Dave?","David Farr","Well the numbers that came out yes it didn\u2019t surprise me because we had all the business leaders last week and we all \u2013 we had heard \u2013 we run a four, four, five type of company or a four, four, five and a half that means we close up to four weeks in a month. We already knew that January is going to be like from the business there. So we lost days in North America, we lost days around the world sounds like because of the weather. So the numbers didn\u2019t surprise me and I mean our customers are still optimistic. What we\u2019re seeing is still very positive. So I think that they will come back. If the weather stays like this for the next couple of months you\u2019ll lose some more floppiness and obviously make February, March much harder, but so right now I feel pretty good. The China numbers didn\u2019t surprise me at all I mean given where the Chinese New Year fell and what\u2019s going on with \u2013 the government is trying to play around the shadow banking a little bit, trying to play it a little bit. But overall I mean my customer base in China is still pretty positive. So..","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","David Farr","Nothing surprising there.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And maybe just before I go, if you just address quickly than what you\u2019re seeing in terms of non-res momentum and you mentioned the Power Transmission side as well?","David Farr","The non-res, the inquiry \u2013 the things we\u2019re hearing in the United States relative to non-res construction are positive. We haven\u2019t seen a lot of order pace shed on it. We\u2019re seeing a lot of inquiries; we\u2019re seeing a lot of planning around it. And so even from our perspective today we went to our Board on two North America non-res construction that will unfold as the year unfolds and goes into next year. So I think that all that have kept our capacity real low, we\u2019ve worked it down in fact we\u2019ve taken it down after the \u201808 crash and now we\u2019re starting to work it back again. So I think it\u2019s going to unfold here. I think non-res will start ticking up, it\u2019s not going to be a exposure, but I think it\u2019s going to pickup as year goes on.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Alright. I see you next week. Thanks, Dave.","David Farr","See you next week. Take care. Steven, bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi, good afternoon guys.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Dave, is this the portfolio you have that you\u2019re going to ride for the year I mean is this \u2013 are you fairly committed to what you have I mean just reading your annual report it seems like this is \u2013 this is the \u2013 this is the game plan, is that accurate?","David Farr","That\u2019s accurate except for one small divesture this year, that\u2019s what we ride this year right now and I mean particular interest in getting North America in particular the U.S. to strengthen improvement and then I think we\u2019ll talk about next week that I have \u2013 we have plans that in the next couple of years that we would most likely see $1 billion to $1.5 billion type of divestitures. So you\u2019ll see that talk about that next week.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. Fair enough. And then on the strategic investments, are these long \u2013 I mean what\u2019s the mix of kind of long-term, short term projects I mean when I think about ERP systems and things like that they tend to last three or four years. But are a lot of the strategic investments you made things that we could be fairly confident to be over with in 2014?","David Farr","I think you\u2019re going to see us \u2013 so many of these things are going to last up two to three years that the type of investment period we\u2019re seeing here. We\u2019ll talk \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about it how you\u2019re going to see a little bit of tweaking up in a couple of areas and you\u2019ll see the numbers and we\u2019ll talk about those. But all of them will start paying back in my opinion as we leave this year and start getting into next year and particular ones in some of the service side that we\u2019re investing and some of the technology sides we\u2019re investing. Those will payback much faster than let\u2019s say the Oracle type investments or a custom interface and type stuff I mean so the majority of the investments we\u2019re talking about are going to be ones that will start paying back late this year and start \u2013 be in this next year a little bit too. So it will be self funding here as it goes on.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, great. And then just a quick follow-up and sorry if you already answered this question. But in the alternator business we\u2019ve had several quarters of inventory destock. Is that pretty much done at this point?","David Farr","We\u2019re going sideways right now, yes.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, okay, see you next week.","David Farr","See you next week. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Langenberg with Langenberg and Company. Please go ahead.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company","Thank you. Hey, Dave.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Brian.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company","Afternoon. Just want to ask the same question a slightly different way, it\u2019s an analyst thing with Europe?","David Farr","I think I can answer the same way. Go ahead.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company","No, you can\u2019t. You have to answer them differently. With Europe, obviously it\u2019s a big place, dive a little bit deep here, talk about the short cycle versus maybe capital spending driven? And then the second part of this is there is somebody doing something in Europe for Europe and there is in Europe for someplace else. So the best that you can maybe talk about what you have been seeing in Europe in that way and color the commentary that way, if you would?","David Farr","Okay. So, the first question is on short cycle, long cycle. The short cycle business is I mean, I would say, right now is what\u2019s really driving us at this point in time. The longer cycle business is just starting to unfold as I see it, it\u2019s early days. We are starting just the order pace we see it coming as the activity. People talking about it \u2013 coming at it, so right now, what\u2019s been driving this shorter cycle type of stuff, MRO business or some of the consumer or light industrial stuff and that\u2019s been driving us here a little bit. I expect the longer cycle stuff in order for our year to unfold and I am talking 3% to 5%, with 3.5% in the first quarter underlying growth and I am talking over 4% in the second quarter. We are expecting some of that longer cycle stuff to start kicking in for us.","And Europe right now, we have actually seen some of the Europe \u2013 outside Europe improving. Europe for Europe has not improved as much, but Europe for outside Europe is starting to improve and that\u2019s a good sign. And so from my perspective, if the economic numbers in underlying GDP or gross fixed investment continue to improve, you are going to see \u2013 then you will start seeing investments in Europe for Europe. Italy is still a concern for us. The southern part of the country, Europe is still concerned, France is we haven\u2019t seen much recovery in France yet, but there is enough going on in Europe right now that for the exporting kind of businesses that\u2019s a good sign. And if China continues to improve, then you will see that will help us too.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg and Company","Got it. Thank you.","David Farr","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Wood with Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys. This is Adam in for Mike. Just a quick one here. Are you seeing any impact\u2026","David Farr","You changed the name Mike on to Adam.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes me. Just a quick one, are you seeing any impact from credit issues for kind of the small or medium sized customers in China. I know it\u2019s something that has sort of come up before and seem to be resolved fairly quickly?","David Farr","We haven\u2019t seen it. Yes, I was talking to the guys about it. They are definitely, even though, we had a very good month and quarter on receivables, the receivable issue in China is still there. They are very slow paying, but they are getting access to money. It got a little tighter a couple of quarters ago, but it seems unfolding a little bit right now. And I think the government is trying very carefully to figure out how to rein this down slowly without totally crushing things, but right now, it\u2019s okay. But the receivable is definitely spread out a little bit and that\u2019s something we will be working pretty hard. We don\u2019t have much, in a company bad debt \u2013 the company the size of our bad debt in any year is about $7 million.","Frank Dellaquila","$10 million.","David Farr","$10 million. So we don\u2019t have much, but it\u2019s \u2013 at this time, I am going to watch very closely here.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks a lot guys.","David Farr","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeremy Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Capron - CLSA","Good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon Jeremy.","Jeremy Capron - CLSA","Question on pricing, could you talk about pricing across your businesses, I mean industrial automation and network power margins are down, I am wondering if there is anything related to pricing here and then more generally across the other business platforms as well?","David Farr","Yes. As I mentioned earlier, Jeremy, the pricing across our businesses right now in this quarter was pretty good. Everyone was slightly positive. We look at the price cost is green across the whole company. And then if you look at network power, it was \u2013 it\u2019s more of a mix issue. We have gone after, but strategically we want to make sure we play in the rollout of China Mobile with the 4G. And the other thing is that we have some new product coming out in North America on our precision cooling platform, a much broader platform that the newer product, which from a cost standpoint is a little bit high and we don\u2019t have our costs quite in line yet with what the selling price is. So, there is a little bit of squeeze there, but it\u2019s more of a mix thing in network power at this point in time. That\u2019s where it is. It\u2019s pretty good and I expect to be decent for the year for us.","Jeremy Capron - CLSA","Great. And then can we go back to the alternators business, you are talking about a stabilization here. I\u2019m wondering could you comment on the extent of the decline that you\u2019ve experienced here over the past year or so?","David Farr","We\u2019ve not given those numbers out, the magnitude, but that is quite significant of the numbers. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll I mean we\u2019ll pull something together if you\u2019re going to be there next week we\u2019ll probably talk about it a little bit. I don\u2019t want to give you a number off the top of my head right here, but it\u2019s not something but I won\u2019t go talk about either.","Jeremy Capron - CLSA","Okay. Thanks very much.","David Farr","We can give you a general feel. It\u2019s quite significant. Let\u2019s put this way, it\u2019s got two in front of it.","Jeremy Capron - CLSA","Great. Thank you.","David Farr","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Quealy with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","Hi, good afternoon.","David Farr","Good afternoon, John.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","So two quick questions. First, in Network Power, can you talk about how demand was in the sort of office LAN environment, I know you\u2019ve talked about datacenter pretty well, but can you talk about that LAN opportunity? And then, secondly within Climate Technologies in the U.S., if you could just talk about the dynamics of that field services business and when we should see that rebound? Thanks.","David Farr","Yes, on the LAN side I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t have that type of deal. What I would do is I\u2019ll talk to Scott Barbour be there this weekend. We will be webcasting, so why don\u2019t we find out little bit, give a little color on that \u2013 on the length because I can\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t want to make something up, John, some people accuse me of making things up that I don\u2019t want to do it. Now relative to Climate Technology in the service side I think the key issue there is we just \u2013 we\u2019ve seen our \u2013 unbelievably weak replacement type of marketplace right now. People are either putting whole new systems in and they work on the heating system because we\u2019ve just not seen much turnover year that we\u2019ve seen a very weak replacement. And so I would expect we would see an improvement when the spring comes that people \u2013 they\u2019re going to evaluate, do we put a whole new system in or do you repair. If your heating went out which we saw a lot of people here in St. Louis in early heat wave, a lot of heaters went out, they replaced a whole system, there wasn\u2019t repaired going no. So I\u2019m hoping that we\u2019ll see at this spring, we\u2019ll see a recovery in that repair cycle, a very nice part of our business which has been down for almost a year and a half and maybe two years now and so its proper side of our business there too. So that\u2019s our current feel, we don\u2019t have anything better than that at this point in time.","John Quealy - Canaccord Genuity","Great. Thank you.","David Farr","Take care, John.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jamie Sullivan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Good afternoon and thanks.","David Farr","Good afternoon, Jamie.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","So maybe just to follow-on to that question. Just more generally about Climate in the U.S. were some of those puts and takes. How you\u2019re kind of thinking about those dynamics for the year with you mentioned AC flat, field service was feeling some pressure. It sounds like you might improve in this spring, maybe just more broadly in the U.S. how you\u2019re thinking about Climate?","David Farr","Broadly in Climate U.S., I feel we have a good year. I mean on the AC side, just look at the AC side, the housing I think you\u2019re going \u2013 the housing continue to be okay, I think it\u2019s been several years now that we have not seen a strong HVAC marketplace in North America. I\u2019m feeling there is going to be a better one this year, inventories are extremely, extremely low right now. On the refrigeration side we\u2019ve seen the marine business pop back which is a good sign. If we actually are correct about non-res picking backup as year progresses you\u2019ll start seeing some of our non-res business improve too and the refrigeration side will improve. The only call on the replacement market will be is that people have the money to spend and they feel like they\u2019re spending the money. They will \u2013 the replacement market will soon come back up. I feel pretty good about Climate Technology in North America this year. I feel good about in Asia, good about in Europe. We\u2019ve had a couple of two flat years in Climate. They are due to have what I call is a solid breakout year because there is still \u2013 we\u2019ll talk a little bit about this through the cycle that is still I believe 5% to 7% underlying growth companies globally and they need to be at the high end of that cycle this year.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","David Farr","That\u2019s where it is.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","And then\u2026","David Farr","Take care, Jamie. See you \u2013 you will be there next week.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","I am. Could I squeeze in one last one before we go?","David Farr","Well if it\u2019s a decent question yes Jamie I would take it, if it\u2019s not a decent just \u2013 I\u2019m just going to hang up, okay.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Alright, fair enough.","David Farr","No pressure, no pressure.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","No pressure. So just on the Network Power margin I think you said for the forward year pro forma they\u2019re around 10.5 for 2013. Is that right, I think you said that last quarter? I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about this year relative to that, it sounds like some pressure relative to that?","David Farr","Yes. What we\u2019re trying to do is I would expect \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to get much margin improvement this year on Network Power. What I\u2019m trying to do right now is we are making some strategic investments. We are trying to get the business moving on a positive top line basis and I hope a slight improvement in margin, but that is not my focus in this business. We have gone through. We have torn this business apart. We have been making some significant investments. We want this business to have a positive top line. And then I expect if that happens, you will start seeing the margin improvement. And so we are looking at margin, slight margin improvement, that\u2019s the game plan this year, but the game for me is growth. I want some positive growth like we saw in the first quarter. That\u2019s important for me. And the new products are coming off. So that\u2019s why our focus is in that business this year.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much. We will see you next week then.","David Farr","See you next week, Jamie. You didn\u2019t get the X button, you are lucky. You didn\u2019t ask about Obamacare or something like that, man. Did you get your healthcare plan yet?","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","I got mine.","David Farr","That\u2019s good. Yes, everyone is covering that one too.","Jamie Sullivan - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks a lot.","David Farr - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you everybody. That\u2019s it. I want to thank everybody. I am looking forward to seeing everybody next. Again, the first quarter unfolded like we thought would. We still feel good about the year. We still feel good about the recovery. And I am looking obviously, feeling a little better about a stronger second quarter as a normal progression. Look forward to talking to people next week. And I am looking forward for Pat to talk about why we are not handing any charts out next week. I mean, that should be an interesting conversation. I mean, this will be good sendoff for Pat to figure out how to explain you guys you get no charts, I mean just give them a booklet of blank pages. That\u2019s what I think I would do. Pat, take care. Have a great one.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. Thanks for participating.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, Tuesday, February 7, 2012. Emerson's commentary and responses to your question may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that can cause actual results to differ very materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on the Form 10-K as filed with the SEC. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Please go ahead.","Patrick Fitzgerald","Thank you, Luke. I am joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's call will summarize Emerson's first quarter 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available in the Investor Relations section of Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call will be available on the website after the call for the next 3 months. I will start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call presentation. ","Fourth quarter sales were down 4% to $5.3 billion, caused by several near-term challenges. Our supply chain disruption caused by the Thailand flooding impacted results by approximately $300 million. U.S. telecommunications carriers deferred investments, awaiting the outcome of potential industry consolidation. HVAC OEMs in the U.S. and China pushed inventories very low on economic uncertainty, and there was broad European economic weakness. ","Operating profit margin declined 220 basis points from the prior year quarter to 13.2%, which is primarily driven by volume deleverage. Earnings per share of $0.50 was down 21% from the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow increased 4% versus the prior year quarter to $334 million. Our balance sheet strength continues to enable us to invest in growth opportunities. Despite the pressure on Q1 from numerous near-term headwinds, our outlook for 2012 remains favorable. ","Next slide, the P&L summary. Net and underlying sales were down 4%, with negligible impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures. Operating profit declined 18% as the magnitude of sales declined and resulting unfavorable mix drove substantial volume deleverage. Net earnings were down 23%. We repurchased 4.8 million shares for $226 million and EPS declined 21% in the quarter. ","Next slide, underlying sales by geography. Gross performance was affected by the previously mentioned challenges. Underlying sales in the U.S. decreased 4%; Europe was flat; Asia was down 8%, with China down 13%; Latin America increased 3%; Canada increased 6%; and the Middle East\/Africa was down 4%, resulting in underlying and net sales down 4%. ","Slide 5, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 38.7% declined 40 basis points. A favorable price and material inflation relationship partially offset the volume deleverage and unfavorable mix. Operating profit margin of 13.2% decreased 220 basis points. Currency transaction losses of $14 million and higher restructuring of $6 million were partially offset by amortization of $9 million. Pretax margin of 10.4% declined 250 basis points. ","Slide 6, cash flow and balance sheet. Operating cash flow increased 4% in the quarter as lower investment in working capital offset the earnings decline. Investment in technology and growth programs continued, as capital expenditures increased $130 million. Free cash flow was down 15%. Trade working capital as a percent to sales increased to 19.1% as inventory performance was affected by the Thailand flooding and sales timing and mix impacted receivables. ","Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin of 12.7% dropped 270 basis points as the volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and higher materials costs more than offset price increases and cost reduction actions. Corporate spend was down $23 million as favorable stock compensation expense and acquisition costs in the prior year offset a $19 million charge to eliminate our retiree medical liability. ","Moving to Slide 8, Process Management results. Process Management net and underlying sales declined 1% with the U.S. flat; Asia down 8%; Europe up 6%; Latin America down 3%; and Middle East\/Africa down 6%. The Thailand flooding supply chain disruption had a broad business and geographic impact. Strong orders growth in the quarter up 15% across all businesses and geographies as oil and gas investment remains robust. Segment margin of 12.4% declined 640 basis points as significant deleverage and unfavorable business mix from the Thailand flooding impact, including costs incurred to resolve the supply chain disruption, affected results.  The growth investments were maintained as the business outlook remains positive. $12 million of unfavorable currency transactions also affected earnings. The supply chain disruption has been substantially resolved, and the full year impact should be minimal. Strong backlog in order trends support a favorable outlook for the remainder of 2012. ","Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net and underlying sales increased 2% with the U.S. flat; Asia up 2%; Europe up 5%; Latin America up 17%; and Middle East\/Africa up 14%. Growth was led by the fluid automation, power generating alternators and electrical distribution businesses. U.S. results were affected by softness in the hermetic motors business. Weakness continues in the solar and wind energy business as governments have reduced renewable energy subsidies. We do not expect recovery in this business in the near-term. Segment margin decreased 50 basis points to 14.8% as a favorable price-cost relationship was more than offset by unfavorable mix and other cost increases. Demand for capital goods should remain stable across most end markets, but we expect increasing weakness in Europe. ","Slide 10, Network Power. Network Power net and underlying sales declined 10%, with the U.S. down 17%; Asia down 6%; Europe down 10%; Latin America down 5%; and Middle East\/Africa up 4%. Sales volume was affected by several factors, including deferred spending by U.S. telecommunications carriers, difficult prior comparisons and project timing in the global data center business, Thailand flooding impact on broader electronics components channels, and continued aggressive product line rationalization in the embedded computing and power business. Segment margin of 8.2% decreased 270 basis points, driven by volume deleverage, unfavorable mix and higher restructuring, which was partially offset by cost reduction benefits. There were one-time Chloride acquisition costs of $15 million in the prior year. Telecommunications carrier investment is expected to accelerate in 2012, and the order trends in Network Power show signs of improvement. ","Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net and underlying sales decreased 9%, with the U.S. down 5%; Asia down 21%; Europe down 11%; Latin America up 23%; and Middle East\/Africa down 29%. U.S. residential markets were down on weak economics and channel inventory reductions. There was a significant softening in the China air-conditioning OEM demand. Europe was weak as well. The global refrigeration business continued stable growth, led by strong improvement in transportation. Segment margin declined 260 basis points to 13.6%. Higher material costs were mostly offset by price increases and volume deleverage exceeded cost-containment actions. A modest U.S. recovery is expected in the second half of 2012. ","Slide 12, Tools and Storage. Tools and Storage net sales increased 2%, while underlying sales grew 5% and the divested heating products business deducted 3%. U.S. was up 6%; Asia up 1%; Europe up 1%; Latin America up 17%; and the Middle East\/Africa up 12%. Nonresidential construction in the U.S. drove demand across the segment, with strength in the professional tools and commercial storage businesses. Segment margin of 21.2% increased 40 basis points as price increases offset higher materials costs and cost reductions, volume leverage and mix from the divestiture benefited results. Tools and Storage had solid execution as commercial construction activity increased, and U.S. residential end market should improve as we move through 2012. ","Next slide, 2012 outlook. It was a challenging start to 2012, but full year expectations remain positive, with strong backlog and positive order trends in capital goods end markets, and expectations for Q1 headwinds to improve as 2012 progresses. However, the economy has weakened further with no sign of recovery. Based on current economic conditions, our revised 2012 outlook is as follows: underlying sales and orders up 4% to 6%; reported sales up 2% to 4%; operating profit margin of approximately 18% and pretax margin approximately 15.5%; restructuring expense, approximately $125 million; tax rate, approximately 31%; earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.60; operating cash flow, approximately $3.5 billion; and capital expenditures, approximately $700 million. ","We will provide a detailed review of 2012 expectations and strategic plans at our annual investor conference on February 14 in New York. And with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much, Pat, and welcome, everybody, this morning. I thank you for joining us. I truly really appreciate it. Yes, we had a very challenging quarter, and as we discussed in December, there's a lot of moving parts. And we still expect a record year in sales, profit margins, net earnings, cash flow, free cash flow and a 20-plus percent return on total capital. The management team, the organization, the people across this company clearly know we have created a huge hole that we have to dig out of in the rest of this year. But we feel confident that we can do it, and we reviewed the detailed plan with the board this morning, a lot of discussions on this issue. And we're focused on getting the job done. ","Today, I want to do something a little bit different. We have a very unusual situation with this abrupt start in the first quarter. So I want to go through them. I'm actually going to take you through slides, which you'll be able to see if you have your computer up. I will talk through the slides. They're not hard copies out there, but you'll be able to see it. ","We finished the year very strongly in 2011. Fourth quarter was up to $6.5 billion in sales. It was up 12% quarter-over-quarter. The whole year, the underlying sales were 11% and the fourth quarter was 9%. But clearly, as we moved into this first quarter, we had some sudden challenges, extremely unusual external environment that hit us very quickly. I'm not here about complaining. I just want to give you some insights to what was really going on, just a little more transparency so you have a better understanding what's going on when we talk next week in New York at our investors' conference. ","As you can see on the chart, our sales dropped in the first quarter to $5.3 billion from $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter and below $5.5 billion last year. And historically, we always have a seasonal pattern this way. Our first quarter is the weakest, then we build up and then drop. This year, it was an extraordinary, extraordinary drop. And so let's talk a little bit about that. ","As we discussed and mentioned at both in August and in November and then again December, we see the European environment extremely challenging. In fact, I would call Europe in a recession for most our businesses. And it hit all the key businesses from Process, Network Power, Industrial and Climate Technologies. The Thai flood hit us pretty hard within Process Management and Network Power, and I'll talk a little bit further about that. ","The telecom, the attempted merger of AT&T and T-Mobile clearly created a slowdown in spending for many months across our telecom and IT space, which are overlapping in a couple of places. And then we had an extraordinary, I would say, inventory slowdown correction in Climate Technologies both from Europe, North America and then also China. So we had a lot of going on. Normally, we have a couple of things, but there's extraordinary amount of times. And I have to say that we saw some of it coming, but it was far deeper more impact to our business than we had anticipated clearly. And hence, we have the phone call in December to give you some insights into it. ","We had clearly 3 of our businesses down year-over-year with Process Management. We had Network Power down. We had Industrial Automation not down but still impacted by it, Climate Technologies down and our Tools and Storage business go down. And we had an impact of $300 million from the Thailand flood, the European recession, unexpected HVAC inventory correction. So we went into the quarter feeling pretty good about it, and we got hit pretty hard. ","One of the things I'm going to show you and I'll show you again next week is the leading indicators of G7 have gone quite negative, driven primarily by Europe and also by Japan. The U.S. has held up, and therefore, what we've seen right now is we're seeing fairly large segments of our marketplace actually go into a recession type of mode. And I would say that Europe is all -- for intents and purposes in Europe, historically, when this number goes below 1.4 negative, it shows that we're going to have a recession in multiple markets, not all markets, but many of the markets. If you take a look at Europe, the European number has gone extremely negative, down 4.8%. And this has been going on now for several months and this is clearly leading -- from our conclusion, what we see in our own business, recession in Europe are very -- are basically no growth, but a very difficult environment for Europe. I certainly feel better about Europe today than I did a couple of months ago because of the actions being taken by their governments and the actions being taken by the banks, the financial community, to try to bring stability and funding to the marketplace. So even though we see this today and we see a recession, we are still going to say that we have underlying growth in Europe in 2012. It may only be 1% or 3%, but we're still expecting some underlying growth as we go forward into 2012. ","But taking a look at a little bit more detail in Process in Thailand floods. People ask how could this be such a big impact? The issue is you lose $100 circuit board and it goes into our systems business, it goes into our coils, it goes into Rosemont transmitters, and you can see that we missed sales of $300,000 or $7,000 or $1,500, businesses, as you know, we're very profitable with. We made the decision to continue to build, run our plants. You can see the inventory built in the quarter. Our actual orders were up around 19% for the quarter, and 15%, 19% for the quarter, around that range. And we had spent a lot of money to make sure we mitigate this and fixed the supply chain. ","We had a mistake clearly allowing one of our key suppliers to be in a floodplain and that won't happen again. And we've moved a lot of supply, it's up and running. And over the next, I would say, 6 to 9 months, we will recover these sales because the orders are out there, and we'll recover the sales and we'll recover profitability. But clearly, the deleveraged impact of this is we're looking at their more profitable businesses. We actually spent a lot of money to support our customer base. We are the global leader in process management, and we made the decision to spend money and invest to protect our customers, even though we were shocking them relative to their overall supply base issue.  So we made that commitment and we spent, we worked with our customers and we did whatever possible to help them in the short-term to get some of the products out the door. Even with his disruption, our product -- our basically sales in Process Management were basically flat for the quarter, even with a very difficult supply chain network. ","In Network Power, the same thing happened. We have many of our customers, less of our supply base, but many of our customers making components and products. We had people in the IT industry also impacted, and it created -- if you're selling a whole package, it created a whole disruption relative to the Thailand flood impact to our end markets, to our customers, to our short-term customers and also in the end customers down the channel. So this business, I believe, will slowly come back. It's clearly -- is it all going to come back? I think that's the question I have on the table right now. And I don't think the answer is yes, it all will come back. Given the slowdown that you're seeing around the world both in Europe, also a little bit in Asia, in China and Japan, I think a part of this unwinding of inventory and obviously some of our customers took back inventory and that took inventory down, it's a function of the slowing global economy. The U.S., I believe, will continue to go forward and see investments in what we saw in some of the delays in what I'd call Network Power Systems business, the data centers, both in the IT world and also in the telecom world, we believe that will continue to go forward. So we think that, that will slowly recover. ","On the telecom side, we saw a dramatic dropoff in the second half of this year in the key telecom areas, the AT&Ts, the Verizon, Nokia and Samsung. They cut back their capital. The issue here is clearly with the merger and the disruption of potential AT&T and T-Mobile, there's the capacity that was coming in, and the industry was trying to change and react to that. That created a basic gridlock stoppage of customer spending, which backed up quickly onto us. That will also come back as AT&T puts that capacity back online. And they're going to put new capacity online. I believe that will also take at least about 6 to 9, maybe in 12 months, for us to unwind. And I'm not looking for a huge surge in telecom spending in 2012, maybe a slight positive, maybe basically flat telecom spending. So the market will recover, but it's going to take its time. I think the process market will recover faster because the actual order is within the industry. ","The other impact we saw in the telecom or the IT industry is we saw PC shipments were down. And for the first time in 2011, I expect from quarter 4, 2011 to quarter 1, 2012, they were down double-digit, 12%. We're looking at IT spending still being positive but slowing down. So I think there's been a negative impact out there. And overall, it's definitely a clear slowing, but the growth will return and we're already starting to see that in the current orders that we have currently on the books in January. ","If you look at Climate Technology, they got hit -- Ed Purvis' business got hit around the world. The residential business in China, the markets were down 30-plus percent, as the Chinese government tried to contract investments and tried to slow down the economy, also redeploying the excesses and maybe some of the real estate and the light commercial. And I do not expect that business to come back much in 2012. I believe the China government will continue to control what's going on in the housing market. I believe that you'll see stimulus going on in China in certain markets. I'm not expecting us to see a major rebound, though some improvement in China second half, but not anywhere close to recovery that would impact us over the last 6 months in that marketplace. ","Same thing in Europe, the early stages, our business in Climate goes down sooner than anybody else. It started going down in the middle of last year, and it's now stabilized at a lower level. But the recession in Europe will keep that business, I believe, reasonably weak and with a mild recovery, if anything at all, in 2012. ","In the U.S., we had a situation with obviously the refrigerant issues from R-22 the year before. That's had some changing going on, so the build-up last year is not the same as this year. We're seeing the inventories being taken down both at the end marketplace and into our customer base at all-time lows, and we've had a very warm summer -- winter, I'm sorry, feels like summer. But winter, relative to the heating season, so that's also impacted that market. ","So overall, Climate Technologies has had a very difficult 4-month period. January orders in Climate Technologies have continued to deteriorate. One of the things we're seeing in a chart that I was showing here right now is that we're seeing the marketplace that has really continued to go up from 2006 to 2009 to 2010, is that basically, our customers, the OEMs, are now waiting and waiting and waiting for the very last second to order. And so this month, January orders were down 22% again in Climate Technologies. So a very specific number, but they have not improved yet. ","You can see that historically, around 20% of our sales are in the first quarter. 5 years ago, it was more like 28%, 29%. Now it's now under 20%. It bounces way up and comes way back down. So basically with the refrigerant issues coming on, with the energy credits ending in 12\/31\/11 and then also the OEMs really focusing harder in inventory and waiting until the last second, we have a situation here right now that we're going to have to manage a lot tighter and make sure we react to it, but it's going to definitely be a more seasonal business than we historically had. We can adjust, the only big issue is, we will have our plant shut down here for a while. And the OEMs, if they wait too long, will have consequences relative to what they can get because they're going to wait until the very last second, and you just don't bring compressor plants up, which are reasonably sophisticated, high capital-intensive plants up very quickly and make sure you maintain the quality, which is very important to us. ","So as you go and look at where we are today, our backlog built significantly in the first quarter. We are sitting at record backlogs right now at $6.7 billion. We had a positive order month in January. Our early indication, we got a quick snap of this, it's plus 7%, approximately 7% on a fixed rate basis. Our underlying orders for December on a fixed rate basis were down or around 4%. So we've seen a turnaround already in the month of January, everywhere except for the Climate Technologies. Network Power systems and embedded power positive, our Process guys still holding well, the Tools and Storage business doing well, even a little bit in IA improvement. So we have seen a little bit of bounce-back. Hopefully, that will continue as we move forward. ","As we report later this month on the underlying orders for the month, the 3-month roll, it's possible that it could be actually negative on a GAAP basis because of the dollar impact, and also because we're dropping off a very positive, I believe, October and we had a negative December. But I'm very pleased to see that we've actually seen our underlying improvement relative to our orders and our backlog sitting at the highest levels that we've ever seen, and we've added $800 million of backlog. So we have the business. ","So if you look at next week, and I'm talking about 2012, we now look at an underlying growth around 4% to 6%. We see the emerging markets will continue to slow down a little bit, still grow but slower. We see -- we remain positive about the U.S., especially in the nonres and improvement coming on the residential. I'd expect very little growth in the economic environment in Europe. I do expect us to see a little bit of growth because of our export through Germany and to Eastern Europe, also in Asia and also into Middle East. And our typical European business in Germany looks pretty good right now. But overall, I do not see a lot of strength coming out of Europe. If you look at the underlying growth right now of 4% to 6%, the currency impact is around negative 2%. So hence, that's where the 2% to 4% comes from on a reported sales basis. ","So I wanted to give you a little bit more insight. We'll clearly get into where our strategy is relative to 2012 coming up next week. We have our challenges here in the first quarter. We have things in focus. We've got -- we're working very hard relative to recovering the backlog and replacing the supply change issue that we faced because of Thailand. We have seen order pick back up in key markets, the climate will come when it comes, and I think it will see improvement in the early stages or the second half of 2012 here in North America. We are -- obviously with the businesses that are struggling, we are taking the cost actions necessary to contain our costs. We're going to keep costs extremely tight until I really see this recovery happen because we feel even with a tough start, we're going to go forward and have record levels of sales, profit margins, profit earnings, EPS, cash flow and a 20-plus percent return on total capital. ","The management team, the executives and all the people around the world, the 130-some-odd thousand people are working very hard to get this recovery back on track after a very difficult first quarter. We are clearly disappointed at our execution in the first quarter. We're not looking for excuses. We're not looking for any tears here. We are who we are, and we're going to move forward and deliver on what I believe is a record performance in 2012. ","Next week, I'm looking forward to seeing everybody at the conference. It's going to be very crowded. And I think we have at least 165 people. Hopefully, everyone will show up. Hopefully, people didn't order things and have a lot of no-shows and we only have 2 people there, but so be it. I'll talk to those 2 people personally. My feeling is it's an important communication. We have an interesting strategy. I want to update the 2010 to 2015 time period. We are seeing some different approaches to the strategy, our insights, what we see changing and what we're going to do differently. And it's not the same old, same old strategy. It's the view of what we see today, given the global dynamics that we'll be facing and a slower mature market growth, a slower emerging market growth and how is Emerson going to drive its underlying growth, which I believe we can do. ","So I look forward to that. It's always a lot of fun to debate and to field the questions. And I look forward to seeing everybody. And again, I want to thank everyone around the world of Emerson. It was not a pretty quarter, it was a challenging quarter. We made money. Our operating cash flow increased. We are continuing to invest in technology and to drive our growth. And I believe that we'll bounce back and deliver a very good year in 2012. ","With that, with a few minutes we have left, I'll be glad to answer some questions. But I wanted to spend time on a little different approach here today by having some charts and explaining those, so you have a little bit more detail as we go into next week, and as you think about what's going on in the dynamic world where we live in today. So thank you very much. And Pat, let's open the floor.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So just a question first on Process, the idea of kind of deleveraging and everything, I understand you spent some additional money running around, right? But your sales in the Process are actually flat. And so maybe a little more color on how you had such a large profit decline on flat sales. And is the profit in backlog now somehow hindered by what you had to do to kind of get through this?","David N. Farr","I think, Jeff, that's a good question. It's not easy to understand. The businesses that we couldn't ship on are businesses that are very profitable for us, they have very high GPs. So we ran the facilities, we kept people online, even though we couldn't book sales. So clearly, I'm not worried about the profitability in the backlog. I personally believe that we will talk about this next week. But we will have record levels of profitability across Process, even with a difficult first quarter. The key issue there is when you continue to maintain the build, you're not shipping some of your most profitable businesses or products and you're continuing to invest in that technology and stuff, you actually have a significant deleverage. And the numbers make sense from our standpoint, and so I don't see anything unusual there. I do expect them to leverage nicely and come back and deliver record levels of profitability for the remaining parts of 2012.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And could you also just spend an additional minute or so on what's going on in the embedded businesses competitively and from a price standpoint, where you are on kind of your restructure of those businesses?","David N. Farr","Yes. I'm going to give you -- the Network Power segment, this next Tuesday, we'll have -- it will be the biggest segment in talk. As I look at the process strategies, some of those strategies are pretty tight. And we know we're going to be able to give you a quick update. But the Network Power business, I'm going to break it down into the 3 pieces that we look at in this business. The systems business is doing pretty well. We had some disruption in relative to delivery because of the end customers couldn't get everything, so they pushed off some slowdown. The telco business was greatly disrupted with what was going on with the AT&T potential acquisition of T-Mobile. And in embedded, we saw a dramatic impact relative to the customers not able to build approximately, just stop ordering the product, and we saw a dramatic dropoff in profitability and deleverage. And we're going through a very, very aggressive repositioning right now within that business to recover that profitability because I personally do not believe that business is going to come back much. I don't see the underlying growth expectation of those customers as all that robust. So I'm planning a year right now that I think we're going to see -- we'll recover some of the growth, but overall, that I think we've potentially got down sales growth in that segment, and we have to get this profitability back to where it should go. So we're going through a very aggressive restructuring at this point in time. And you'll see our restructuring numbers start picking back up a little bit faster here in the second quarter. We will spend somewhere between $125 million and $135 million of restructuring, primarily driven around Europe and also the work we're doing in embedded and embedded power business. We'll talk a little bit more about this and the whole evaluation we're going through right now, Jeff, the next Tuesday. But there's a lot of action going on in that business right now to recover what we really fell behind in those 3 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Wood of Macquarie Capital.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Can you provide an update on Chloride and where you are in the restructuring, cost synergies and how that's tracking to plan after seeing the softness in telecom, data center and just Europe in general?","David N. Farr","The overall Chloride integration is going, I would say, very well. We have a lot of restructuring underway this year. We did what I would call the general sales and the overhead last year. And now we're actually getting into the infrastructure part. I will show you next week that from a performance standpoint, we are ahead, slightly ahead of our savings and performance. I'm very pleased with the Chloride integration at this point in time. Yes, we had a little bit of slowdown in the marketplace. That happens at any time, but overall, the integration and the effort underway, I'm very pleased with. And I would say both on Chloride and Avocent we are ahead. The one issue we did get hit real hard on in this quarter, in the first quarter, was Avocent. Avocent's into the server marketplace, which really got hit hard in the fourth calendar quarter, our first quarter. And Avocent sales really got -- came down extremely hard in the fourth quarter, and they deleveraged quite significantly. They have actually started seeing improvement already in orders and shipments in the month of January as people got back online to start buying again. So overall, we're very happy with Chloride and Avocent. The pace is good, and they're getting the job done.","Mike Wood - Macquarie Research","Okay. And on the residential side, we've been seeing some early signs of a potential recovery in the U.S. residential construction market. Where would that impact your business? Where might that positively surprise you versus your expectations?","David N. Farr","I think that we're going to have in what we call the Tools and Storage business, you're going to see they had a pretty good first quarter. The order pace is pretty good right now. They've had good order pace. I think that will be the continued positive, which we see that is in the -- primarily, the repair. We've seen a good recovery in the repair, upgrade marketplace in North America. On the Copeland side, our Climate Technologies side, we'll start seeing that later this year as the construction and then also the people move into the cooling season. So I would expect that to be more in the second half. Right now, we are banking on some recovery, but not much a recovery. And with the level of inventories where they are right now, that could be the one upside we see in the second half. I think we'll continue to see momentum and positive performance in the Tools and Storage business because of residential. I agree the recovery in residential is underway. And I think you're going to see probably 5% to 7% underlying residential GFI growth in the United States this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Those slides were very helpful. So just Industrial Automation, the margin side, I know you called it out. We've got revenue up and margins down. And you talked about cost containment in relative to pricing and additional investment for growth. Can you maybe provide a little more color here so that I can sort of think about what the leverage was here, and was it not enough profitable [ph] mix or...","David N. Farr","Yes, there's 2 things. One of the big issues on material is, when our price increases come through -- and it's been a fairly high net material inflation area -- time period. We've got the prices to cover the material costs, but it dilutes our margin. And so this in initial phase right here, upfront what happens is, the price is going through and we get that margin dilution relative to -- because we don't cover margin, we just cover net material costs, that hurts us quite a bit. So from the standpoint overall as a company, we had positive green price costs for the whole company, and we are almost -- we're approximately $20 million, about $18 million positive. So this is the first quarter after 4 quarters of being negative, we've got the price cost coverage, but we don't make margin on the high inflationary time periods. It's not something we build into our contracts. That hurt us from that standpoint. The other area in Industrial Automation is, with a dropoff, in particular, continued dropoff in solar and wind, we've seen a significant deleverage. We had a lot of restructuring going on in that way because we do not see that market coming back. Industrial Automation had a record level of profitability last year. I believe they will set another record level of profitability this year because the cost actions are underway. We will absorb this price cost as we go forward here, and we get our productivity going. So I feel very good about Industrial Automation. Some of the markets will be good, some of the markets will not be good. And again, we'll give you a little bit more insight to that next week, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And just back to that first question on Process. When you're filling out the backlog now, your capacity utilization and the plans as you go forward, how are you thinking about that backlog fitting in? Are you just scaling that thing up all across-the-board and running full out 80%...","David N. Farr","If you had noticed that one chart, we actually built a lot of inventory in the first quarter. So right now, from automations -- process automation standpoint, we're going to spend around $700 million of capital this year, and we're going to have -- a big chunk of that is going to be going to Process. We are going to have to invest in capacity. I mean, we're driving towards an $8 billion Process Management business this year. And our orders are very strong and we need to increase our global capacity. And so you're going to see us having to continue to spend money in Process and capital. Right now, we are okay because we made the decision, even though with the disruption, to go ahead and build inventory. So we have control valves out there without the electronics in. We have pressure transmitters, we have flow devices. And so we have actually built the product that's sitting in warehouses, and now we're going to come back later and put the assembly in there. If we hadn't done that, we would never be able to get this caught up this year. So we made a decision to go ahead and spend the money, costs extra money, inventory -- because we know that with the orders sitting where they are and the backlog sitting where it is, we have the capability of shipping that stuff, assuming we get the electronic boards in.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And Dave, again how much inventory did you build for that?","David N. Farr","We built -- in the Process, where I had the chart there, I'm going to give you the exact number. I had it broken out...","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","You flipped it too fast for me, I couldn't write it down.","David N. Farr","I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, Steve. We built $130 million, so we had inventory at year end around -- I'll give you $575 million and we're now over -- we're over $700 million. That's a lot of inventory.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So just on the electronics pieces, I guess, do you now have the components you need? I mean, when do you think you can resume shipping instruments with electronics out of Process? I mean, is this all going to come back in a hurry? Is it going to kind of spread out through the year? How do you see it happening?","David N. Farr","We are already starting to see the shipments. I mean, in the month of January, I know the sales in January. We saw the shipments in some of the instrumentation actually come on, so we're seeing that in the simpler product, the instrumentation product, the flow devices, the pressure, the temperature devices. The larger devices were -- I would say, the control valves were more complicated. That's going to take 6, 8 months. So we are starting to get a flow of electronic boards. We are allocating where the boards are going. They're not all the same boards. We are allocating based on our customer pressure points, and we're dealing with that issue right now. So you're going to see a continuing improvement. You'll see our second quarter sales in Process go up unless we have another shock somewhere. I really don't need another shock. And then you're going to start seeing the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter sequentially getting better, and as we move out, so it's not -- they're not all going to show up at one time. We're staging them out because that's the only we can deal with it. But they're starting to flow already. I saw the benefit already in January in some of the more easier products to get into.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the restructuring of embedded power, I mean, some of this is tire-related stuff, too, but it sounds like you're -- do you see more of a permanent change? I mean, could you talk about some of the nature of the restructuring you're going after and what the payback period is like?","David N. Farr","The restructuring, we're going to start getting payback this year, and it's going to be within a 12-month period starting right now. This is a very near-term, short-term thing we're doing. I'm just making a call on there. I listen to a lot of our customers on their conference calls. Some of them said that the recovery, everything was going to come flying back, some of them said not. I am of the opinion right now, given the slowdown in Europe, the slowdown in Japan, the slowdown in Asia and in the marketplace, the dynamics going across the marketplace with some this customer base, I think the market will be a lot slower for some of this, what I'd call core electronic market space in 2012. And I think a little bit of inventory had been built with the Japanese issue we just had 6 months earlier. And so I think a lot of that got washed out, so I don't see all of it coming back. So if I look at -- we lost about $100 million, in what I would say $100 million to $150 million in certain parts of these businesses, I would say we'd probably get half of that back and that's it. That is just my call right now, knowing the space that I know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Investment Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I was hoping you could take us through Europe and a little bit more color regarding the individual businesses. Because you were flat for the quarter, you're speaking as though you still could get positive growth. Process and Industrial Automation both had better quarters in Europe. So just take us through what the tone is of the customers and your visibility that still gives you a sense that you will outperform the market.","David N. Farr","I mean, the Process business did have a decent quarter. I think they have a high level of backlog. That business will continue to start shipping when they get the components, so I think Process will do pretty well. I am concerned about the underlying industrial business of Industrial Automation. I think Industrial Automation Europe is going to struggle this year. I think that business will weaken as the year goes on. Within the last 2 months, we have actually started seeing the stability in the Climate Technologies business in Europe. They're the early indicator. They went down last year, so they had a couple of tough quarters last year. The first quarter was tough. I'm seeing some stability in that order pace. And based on the fact that Germany is still doing reasonably well, we're still seeing that improvement, and I think Climate Technologies will have a better, better year as it progresses. The other area is our Tools and Storage. And we're continuing to see some investments going on within the European business, and that space is not big. But I think Process will be good. I think Climate Technologies will start to recover. I think the Tools and Storage business, we do well. I think the industrial part of Industrial Automation is not going to do well. I think some parts of Industrial Automation, their export out of Europe will do okay. But overall, I mean, you've got to remember, Europe last year for us was 11% underlying growth. This year, I think we're probably somewhere around that 0%, 1%, 2% type of growth. So it's not going to be pure negative, but it's definitely -- we've got the backlog to show we'll have some growth there. That's they way I look at it and feel it right now.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And then just -- I might have missed this. But on the impact of Thailand, originally, it was a $300 million to $400 million hit. And it looks like it came in towards the lower end of that. Was that just being conservative? Or how did that actually play out?","David N. Farr","I've made a commitment -- and Frank's here with me, we made a commitment to the audit committee that we would not just throw everything in the big catch-all, and say, \"Hey, s***, it's Thailand.\" And I'm not supposed to swear, but I did anyway. But what we made is we looked very carefully what type of products we're not able to ship in that. And our best estimate right now and the best that we're going to do is $300 million. The other parts, we believe, from the climate standpoint and the recession slowdown -- so we went through and we categorized it for the audit committees because they wanted to make sure that we weren't playing games. Let's be honest. They wanted to make sure that we know what we're doing here and not just use this as a big cop out. So we did the best we could relative to the products, the customers. And we clearly mapped out between the Network Power, the Process business basically what we could see coming out of from our standpoint on Thailand. And it worked. And so that's where we are right now, it's around $300 million, plus or minus $10 million, $15 million, and the rest came out of just the other activities. That's why I mapped out that one matrix, where we saw the various piece of the impact around the world. That's how it is.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, my first question was, obviously, you've had a lot of sort of strange issues as you say in your fiscal Q1. And if we look at the gross margin, though, that's been down year-on-year for kind of 3 or 4 quarters in a row. And I guess, if I look at your guidance for the year of an 18% margin, we assume that SG&A grows about 3% for the year as it did in Q1. That implies for the balance of the year, your gross margin has to go up maybe 70, 80 basis points. And so I guess, given that it fell when revenues were up 6, 9 months ago, and given that it fell when revenues were down in the December quarter, what is it you think that's really swinging on the gross margin that gets it growing again year-on-year from this point?","David N. Farr","The biggest issue is price cost. Last year, we had a very negative price cost that really hurt our GP margin in a big way. Even though the first quarter was tough, our GP was not that bad relative to what we lost overall. So I would say the big issue for us is price cost. We were green in the first quarter, that makes a big difference for us. We expect to be green next year, which will help us relative to our recovery of GP. And so that's the #1 issue, Julian, that we are tracking internally. If we can deliver that, then our GP margin will go towards that 40% GP, and we'll have that recovery. Last year, we got hit very, very hard at that level and that really hurt us. So that's the #1 issue, being green right now. And we got obviously 3 more quarters, that's the key issue for us. #1, 2, 3 and 4, that's the issues.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on your cost base generally. I mean, looking at your CapEx guidance and what you spent in Q1, that's about flat year-on-year for the next 3 quarters. What's going on with -- your restructuring's going up a little bit, I think, $30 million versus the previous guidance. And your OpEx, the SG&A, as I say, that was up in Q1 even with down revenues. So what's happening on the SG&A line? I mean, is that going to stay at this sort of $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion? Or are you going to try and take some of that out?","David N. Farr","We, I mean, the SG&A, from the standpoint of spending, we start curtailing spending and we will continue to curtail spending. I expect our SG&A to be on a percent of sales slightly down when the year finishes as we get the growth coming back. On the capital standpoint -- but there's not going to be -- we are being very careful, we are taking some cutbacks, I would say, overall in spending right now because of our concern of the slowdown, particularly in Europe and some slowdown spending in Asia. But overall, nothing dramatic because our cost structure is in pretty good shape. It's just that we're going to be very careful of where we increase it. And for the businesses that are struggling right now, there will be very significant cutbacks, the Climate Technologies, the embedded power computing, those businesses will have significant cuts relative to their overall spending because their business is not right -- is not there right now. Relative to capital, we're going to spend around $700 million. We actually cut it back a little bit. In some of the businesses that are struggling, I don't see the growth rate, then we've cut back their underlying growth rate. So we're going to be taking some capacity out that we had planned in originally except for Process, which is going to need it. So there's a little shifting going around relative to capacity. So I would expect us to spend less capital than I thought we're going to spend 3 months ago. But we're going to be spending around $700 million, which is still under 3% of our total sales. So overall, the cost structure of the company is in pretty good shape, though we're going to trim, and the capital plans are going to be cut back a little bit. But overall, I think we're in pretty good shape.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave, so you mentioned early on that you still think that this will be a record year for Process Management profitability. Does that still mean that you think even though you've got a tough 1Q that you can still do 20-plus margins this year?","David N. Farr","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Awesome, great. And any way of scaling what the impact of the Thai floods was? Because if you just look at the sales and the deleverage on the sales, you get to about $0.15. But it sounds like there are other costs as well. I mean, do you have that number to mind?","David N. Farr","No. I have not gone and spent a lot of time on having the guys track what we had to spend to meet with customers, to redirect stuff, airship stuff. I mean, right now, that business is in a crisis mode. So we have a global leader, and I told the guys, \"Spend what it takes to get this business back on track, back up in line.\" That's far more important to us. With bookings, orders coming in on 15%, 18% and we're expecting to drive towards an $8 billion number this year, we need to figure out how to get the shipments going again. So they did a lot of extra spending, and I'm not -- I have a lot of confidence that management team that they don't waste and they got the job done because it's important for us to take care of that customer base.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. And then we spent a lot of time talking about Climates and Network Power, but we haven't spent so much time talking about Industrial Automation. And we did see a big dropoff from 4Q to 1Q. And you talked about solar, wind, and I think, hermetics as the big drive to downside. But can you maybe just talk a bit more about that, Dave? How much of this is inventory? How much is CapEx?","David N. Farr","I mean, from our standpoint, the hermetics business is obviously tied to our compressor business being dropped off that hard. The big issue for us that we're seeing in Industrial Automation is the slowdown we're seeing in Europe right now in the underlying -- what they call the pure industrial, the industrial motors and drive touch [ph] that we're seeing some slowdown in that area in the core business. We're also seeing a slowdown, we actually saw a slowdown in China in the first quarter. As China really -- it started dialing back on spending money, we saw the industrial marketplace really slow down a little bit. I do expect that to pick back up because that's going to be an area, I think, the Chinese government will focus their money relative to the stimulus they're going to put in place. I'm a little bit positive -- less positive about the housing and residential and the light commercial. But I think in industrial, as companies continue to spend to go after that growth as that stimulus comes in, I think you're going to see that money spending there. But the overall industrial marketplace both in Europe and in Asia, we saw weaken in that first quarter, but we're seeing some signs of picking back up. So I feel okay. There are segments in there that are struggling, but those segments will do very well. So it's going to be a mixed bag this year, very lower growth. But I believe as we'll talk about next week, they'll be setting record levels of profitability.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But quickly, finally, on the shale gas. Your exposure there is quite low, right?","David N. Farr","Pretty low. We sell into the shale gas market. We sell a lot of equipment to the shale -- when it comes to -- anything to do with natural gas around the world, we are a player relative to equipment and measurement and custody transfer. So we have a lot of money being spent in that area.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to come back to the Process Management margin discussion with regards to the implications for the longer-term from what you're saying. And I think the implications are that you're going to be kind of 50% incrementals for the balance of the year. And there was this earlier discussion, \"Hey, as you get deeper into the cycle, you'll shift more to solutions that dampens the incrementals.\" We've got a lot of investment to do to make sure we're in position for the long-term there. As we think about the 2013, '14 picture for Process margins, what are the implications of the kind of profile that's really implied by this last 3 quarter guidance on Process? Is it that you're just seeing the underlying as stronger, you're doing a better job on productivity than you thought, pricing's a little stronger and that can carry forward? Or how would you like us to think about that?","David N. Farr","I think there's one thing that's going, the price cost is turning so that's helping us right now. So that's a slight positive, even for Process. I wouldn't say we can say we're executing better because we just had a really challenging quarter here, so I wouldn't say we are executing better from that standpoint from our productivities. We have not seen a shift yet into the big projects, which will eventually kick in probably '13, '14 relative to some of the dilution on the overall P&L structure, as some of these big projects start shipping. We have seen a continuing, I would say, upgrading of spending, what we call brownfield-type expansions. And brownfields are less competitive market space than greenfields, which are extremely competitive. So right now, the mix is still going our way, and I think that's what's going to help us in the second half of this year. And we'll see how that order book goes in the second half of this year and that will tell me, Terry, how that's going to look as we go into '13. But this right now, I see no fundamental reason why we can't maintain fairly high levels of profitability and continue to make the investments we need. But I don't see any reason why we can't do that yet, but that mix could change in the second half of this year relative to orders. We've got to wait for those orders to come in.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, the next question is trying to get a feel for the key levers in your mind between the new high end and low end of EPS guidance range for the year. And from the standpoint of organic growth around that question, it sounds like with the January up 7% orders and some of your commentary to earlier questions, that the organic pattern, if you will, over the next 3 quarters you're seeing is relatively the same. 6%, 7%, 8%, I guess, is what you need to get the high end of the 4% to 6%. Have we got that about right?","David N. Farr","Yes, you do. I mean, the key issue, you're going to see -- the key issue for us is, unfortunately, we ran loaded this year. And that is not something I like from a growth standpoint. The key lever for us right now, Terry, is underlying growth. If I -- from a cost structure, we are driving to get the cost structure in line. We're taking the actions we need to. And from my standpoint, as we can get that 5-plus percent underlying growth, then we'll be at the high end. If we start going -- if underlying growth starts slipping down, we will be fighting down towards that low end in EPS. It's going to be underlying growth. This company knows how to deliver profitability and getting the costs in line. It's going to be that underlying growth. After the first quarter, the price cost was in good shape. If I can deliver another positive price cost in the second quarter, I'll take that one off the table. So right now, I would say, can we continue the positive green price cost and then underlying growth. Those are the 2 levers that I'm watching and tracking extremely closely right now to relative to this company.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, maybe give Frank some airtime here and save Pat a bunch of time later on. Frank, can you give us any thoughts on the segment corporate line for the year, how you're thinking about that? And anything on interest expense as it relates to use of free cash and so forth through the year that you can talk about as well?","Frank J. Dellaquila","Segment corporate line?","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Relative to the $80 million you did in the first quarter. Typically, it comes off as you move into the last 3 quarters. But any other commentary would be helpful.","Frank J. Dellaquila","Yes, the first quarter is actually a bit favorable so that $80 million is not a good run rate. You need to bump that a little bit for the balance of the year. And interest expense...","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How much -- relative to last year, what kind of line is it going to be, plus or minus? Where are you going to be?","Frank J. Dellaquila","No, we're going to be up a little bit. A little bit versus last year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But that's relative to $220 million?","Frank J. Dellaquila","We're up a little bit versus last year. And I'm talking about the noninterest expense, the other corporate, which is mainly incentive comp. And in interest expense, we should be a little bit better than last year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But just to be clear, the corporate number you just referenced, you're talking about the $129 million? Or are you talking about the $80 million from the first quarter?","Frank J. Dellaquila","I'm talking about the $80 million from the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A follow-up from the December call regarding Europe. In December, I think you talked about market share gains in Network Power in Europe. You didn't mention that in one of the earlier questions. I just wanted to get your thoughts there.","David N. Farr","I don't remember saying that. But very unusual when we talk about market share on a quarterly phone call. But I have to be honest, Rich, I don't know if I said that or not, so I have to check in. You can talk to Pat on that. I don't know. Coming off the top of my head, I don't remember that conversation.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, I'll follow with Pat, but I thought you said there will be some gains in the business in Europe in 2012. But I'll follow up.","David N. Farr","We'll go back and look at what I said and try to make sure. If I messed up, he'll go back and clarify it. But we'll go back and look at the transcript and see what I said, and then I want you to follow up with Pat on that one because I don't want you to leave that out there.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just on M&A, what are your thoughts here? You had another -- we're 45 days past our last update with you. What are your thoughts there between share repurchases and then bolt-on M&A?","David N. Farr","We'll be talking about that in detail next Tuesday. Let's leave it until then. But I'm going to give my thoughts on the capital structure, where we're going to spend our money and how we're going to shift it, and I have some different thoughts on that. So I'd rather talk in the session next week.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I know you don't give quarterly guidance. But obviously, the last 3 months, quarterly guidance has kind of been a key sticking point here. And I think maybe just move beyond the focus on that, is there any way you can kind of give us a little bit of color on how we should think about the second quarter, given all of these -- the multitude of moving parts? I think that normal seasonality, I guess, if you adjust the first quarter would get you something in the $0.80 range. I mean, can you give us any kind of an over-under on that? Or just any color on the second quarter would be, I think, helpful for people.","David N. Farr","Steve, I think the key issue for us is the recovery in sales. As I think I said to Terry, I think the key issue for us is the recovery of what our underlying growth is and starting to get after some of that backlog. We are expecting our sales to be up for the quarter. And right now, I think from the standpoint of -- the question is how fast that recovery happens, and that's going to be the key issue. And just for that, it's hard for me to say what our earnings per share is. And again, unfortunately, we're going to be ran loaded this year because of the recovery of the sales and the backlog. And that's going to be a very difficult thing. And I'm going to have to keep my board updated on a month-by-month basis from that standpoint. But all I can tell you right now is all are going to be coming off of our sales pace. And if we get a good sales pace, then we should start seeing a recovery in our OP margin, and then we're going to see an increase in restructuring. But you should start seeing a recovery in our earnings, and I expect a positive, obviously positive growth in earnings to positive growth in sales. But it's not going to get back to the pace that we need to get that second half done. And so I'm hoping we can do a better job here, but that's the best I can give you right now.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess, that just kind of leads me to my next question, which is just the visibility you have. I mean, you went through a bunch of fundamental, I guess, macro issues, whatever you want to call them in the quarter. But despite kind of the January order comment, whether it's telecom, whether it's Climate -- Process, I think is its own animal, which you guys are -- that's kind of understandable. Whether it's Industrial Automation, it still has pretty tough comps in the second half of the year. It's just unclear to me how you guys envision this kind of ramp in second half sales. A lot of the telco guys are talking about things not coming back until later in 2012. So I'm just wondering how do we kind of get to that -- what are you watching for? Europe, you said, was going to remain tough. I mean, is it China that we're really banking on here? What is the -- is the U.S. economy? It's just unclear to me what really comes back in the second half of the year.","David N. Farr","Well, I'm not banking on much of a telco recovery. I'm not banking on much of the Climate Technologies recovery, although I am banking of some recovery in Climate Technologies. We're expecting recovery plus some growth from the Process guys. I am banking on some recovery in the Industrial Automation, in particular, in Asia Pacific and some of the other markets stabilizing and improving. So I do have a little bit of recovery coming on there in Industrial Automation. I'm expecting an improved performance out of our Tools and Storage business better than we have been running there, so I expect that to be positive. But definitely, I don't see much telco. I also expect some recovery in the embedded power and computing and we're seeing that, but we're not going to recover back everything we lost. So that's how we see it right now. There's clearly a lot of moving parts in this thing, and that's why, as I said to somebody earlier, how we deal with that range. If our underlying growth rate starts slipping down, then I will be at a lower range of that EPS clearly. But I think that if the order pace keeps coming by the segments as we saw in January and we see that again in February and March, then we're going to see that visibility we need. But right now, the ball is around execution, getting that backlog down and getting some recovery pace in, I would say, North America residential and a continuing strong pace in nonres in North America.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one last quick question, just on the Process side. I think Jeff asked a good question around the margin being down despite the flat sales. You talked about mix a little bit. But CapEx in that business was running at about 2% of sales, basically for the entire cycle last cycle. It bumped up to 2.8% of sales last year, and now you're saying it's going to be -- it's a pretty significant part of the healthy increase you're seeing in the first quarter and maybe throughout the year. Does this kind of get to the point that -- 20%-plus margin is great this year. I agree, I think you have to do that to update your guidance. But does this get to the point where like you have to kind of begin to throw more investment and money at this business, given the competitive landscape is just a lot different than it was last cycle? Or why are we throwing so much more money at the business early this cycle than we were last cycle?","David N. Farr","Because the last cycle, I took capacity offline -- I took it offline and I did not redeploy it. I took it offline because I wanted to move it into where the growth is going to be. And so now that growth is starting to happen and I'm starting to redeploy that capacity and where that growth's going to come from, Middle East, India, Asia, China, and parts of Latin America, that's the issue. We took capacity offline and we did not redeploy it. I used the capacity I had to mount that, and now I'm putting capacity in. I don't see that we have to have some extraordinary amount of higher levels of capital spending. I mean, I think the Process guys are probably going to be around that 3% level. It could run down to 2%, but it's not going to be an extraordinary number here.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Inch of Bank of America.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, just based on your relatively upbeat comments towards nonresi or towards resi construction and then sort of some of what the Tools business is seeing on the nonresi side, isn't this sort of a -- aren't there sort of decent lead indicators for Climate that, all else equal, you could perhaps argue that actually had a cycle bottom? The business almost seems to be locked and loaded. I'm just curious on your thoughts.","David N. Farr","If you look at the leading indicators, you look at all the numbers, your statement is 110% correct. Now we've got to see it happen. And the other issues, there's a lot of capacity and there's a lot of product that's been taken offline right now, and we are taking our capacity down at this point in time. We're taking plants down because the orders are not there. And so in order to protect our deleverage the best we can, we are actually taking out cost at this point in time, and we're putting and turning lights out. And so our customer base expect us to be able to turn on a dime and hire 500,000 people or whatever it takes. They better be thinking about that. That's all I can tell them, because I'm furloughing my plants right now. So they've been warned.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So does that -- I was wondering about that actually as it pertains to the rest of the channel. I mean, does that, to a degree, give you leverage, whether it be on pricing or otherwise when the cycle actually turns? I mean, there's a bit of a compounding effect that you don't necessarily need big turns to these end markets to actually get a big profit contributions for this business.","David N. Farr","Well, if we actually get the orders and the shipments, the answer is yes because there's not going to be a pricing standpoint because we lock up agreements with them for a 12-, 18-month time period. So it's just a function of they're playing us so tight right now that they're expecting a large compressor plant that's fairly sophisticated to turn on and get going. And so my warning to all the customers out there in this area is they've got to be very careful because I am furloughing my plants right now because their demand has dropped off so dramatically that I have no reason to keep my workers in the plant working, period. They have been warned.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I'm also just wondering sort of big picture with respect to lessons learned perhaps from Thailand. Are there implications as you look out -- as the CEO of Emerson and your global operations, you're clearly a very well-entrenched company in all these different emerging markets. Are there implications for perhaps other, call it, geographic supply chain concentrations that you're going to be trying to work through? Or is really Thailand just an isolated event that you're going to...","David N. Farr","I don't think it's isolated. I think that we looked at a couple of things happen. One, we shouldn't allow a major supplier in a floodplain, which had -- that was one thing, that was one flag. We don't allow our plants to be built in floodplains. And so why allow one of our major suppliers have a plant on a floodplain is beyond me, it's my fault. I would say, John, that we are taking a look at across all the major suppliers and seeing -- going through with a backup plan. Are the plants in a risky spot? We don't locate plans in an earthquake zone. We're going through right now, this is a wake-up call for us. We've had 2 whacks here. We've got one whack upside the head in Japan, then we got a whack up with Thailand. So now okay, I'm not going to go for the third one because the third strike and I should be out type of situation. So I'm looking at right now from a supply chain, are we setting ourselves up in a situation where we're asking for more problems? Or we're looking at that from a standpoint of just safety from an environmental standpoint, a concentration and backup. So we're stressing a lot of places around here because I'm trying to learn from both of these events. And I never can foresee everything, but I want to mitigate this because this was a very damaging thing. And it's not just us, the whole electronics industry that got hit by it pretty hard. And so we, as an industry, need to think about that. ","Thank you, everybody. Again, I want to thank everybody today. It was a different approach. I wanted to give you a little more insight to what's happened in the last 3 or 4 months. I hope that helps you. I want that off the table, so we got into next week. I'm looking forward to talk about strategy, looking forward to talk about what I see out there right now from the standpoint of our end markets and how we're going to attack differently. We are going to have to make some different moves from a strategy standpoint, and we'll talk about those. And then we'll give you some quick insights relative to the various business, some of the businesses are just a matter of executing some of our stuff. Some are a little bit more obviously insights that we're going to have to spend some time on. So we're looking forward to it, looking forward to seeing everybody both from an investor standpoint and the sell side standpoint. I appreciate with all the patience. And again, I want to thank all the employees around the world working their way through this very challenging time for the company because we intend to recover and have a record year in 2012. Thank you very much. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded today, November 6, 2012.","Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson. Go ahead, sir","Patrick Fitzgerald","Thank you, Jill. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Today's call will summarize Emerson's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012 results. A conference call slide presentation will accompany my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next 3 months.","I will start with highlights of the quarter as shown on Page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Fourth quarter sales increased 2% to $6.7 billion, with underlying sales growing 5%. Robust growth in Process Management was driven by energy investments and recovery of sales deferred from the Thailand flooding, in which we have now fully recovered. Record gross profit margin of 41% in the quarter expanded 140 basis points from the prior year and operating profit margin of 20.4% increased 130 basis points.","Earnings per share of $0.39 reflects the impact of a $0.72 goodwill impairment charge related to businesses impacted by telecommunications and information technology industry weakness. Excluding the impairment charge, earnings per share of $1.11 increased 7% from prior year.","Yesterday, Emerson's Board of Directors increased the first quarter 2013 dividend by 3%. After down sales and margin in the first half of 2012, our business has executed well to deliver a strong second half amid a weakening global economy.","Next slide, P&L summary. Again, net sales grew 2% and underlying sales increased 5%. Recovery of sales deferred by Thailand flooding helped drive strong volume leverage and 130 basis points of operating profit margin expansion. Net earnings of $282 million includes the $528 million after-tax goodwill impairment charge, which was $592 million before tax. We repurchased 5.6 million shares in the quarter for $269 million. Reported EPS declined 61% and excluding the impairment, increased 7%.","Next slide, underlying sales by geography. In the fourth quarter, underlying sales in the U.S. grew 2%; Europe was flat; Asia increased 8%, with China flat; Latin America grew 18%; Canada grew 10%; and the Middle East\/Africa grew 19%. Total underlying sales increased 5%. Currency translation deducted 3% for net sales growth of 2%. Full year 2012 underlying sales grew 3%. Currency translation deducted 2% for net sales growth of 1%.","Moving to Slide 5, profitability detail. Gross profit margin of 41% expanded 140 basis points, driven by volume leverage, mix and cost containment benefits. As already mentioned, the operating profit margin of 20.4% improved 130 basis points. The goodwill impairment of $592 million and $31 million in currency transaction losses with the primary items bridging to pretax earnings of $593 million. Reported tax rate of 49% reflects the low deductibility of the impairment charge. Excluding this, the rate was approximately 30%.","Next slide, cash flow. Fourth quarter operating cash flow increased 4% and capital expenditures declined slightly resulting in free cash flow growth of 6%, with strong conversion from earnings. Working capital as a percent of sales increased from the prior year at higher receivables related to higher end-of-year sales offset solid inventory performance.","Moving to Slide 7, business segment detail. Business segment margin improved 140 basis points, reflecting strong volume leverage and cost containment benefits. Changes in corporate expense were primarily driven by the impairment and higher stock compensation compared to prior year. Reported pretax earnings margin declined from the impairment. Excluding this, pretax margin expanded 100 basis points.","Next slide, Process Management. Process Management net sales grew 18% and underlying sales grew 21%. By region, the U.S. was up 16%, Asia up 21%, Europe up 11%, Latin America up 46% and Middle East\/Africa up 42%. Strong conversion of backlog from the Thailand flooding supply chain disruption helped sales, along with robust investment in the oil and gas, chemical and power industries. Segment margin of 24.3% expanded 200 basis points, primarily driven by volume leverage and cost reduction benefits. Full year 2012 underlying sales were up 15% for Process Management with margin at record levels. Continued end market strength is expected to support solid momentum into 2013.","Next slide, Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation net sales declined 6% with underlying sales down 2%. By geography, the U.S. and Asia were flat; Europe was down 5%; Latin America, up 3%; and Middle East\/Africa down 20%. End markets were mixed across the segment, with the power generating alternators and industrial motors business, weakest. Underlying sales grew modestly in the fluid automation, electrical distribution and mechanical power transmission businesses.","Segment margin of 17.5% expanded 280 basis points, benefiting primarily from cost containment programs and lower restructuring expense. Profitability was strong resulting from a well-positioned cost structure and favorable mix. In the near term, the European fiscal crisis will remain challenged for industrial automation.","Next slide, Network Power. Net sales declined 4% and underlying sales decreased 3%, with the U.S. down 7%, Asia up 5%, Europe down 9%, Latin America down 4% and Middle East\/Africa down 14%. Global telecom and information technology weakness persisted, resulting in a double-digit sales decline in the embedded computing and power business. Data center end markets were mixed among geographies, but challenging overall, especially in Europe. Segment margin of 11.6% declined 190 basis points due to volume de-leverage and other cost increases, but improved sequentially 130 basis points.","As mentioned in this morning's press release, the embedded computing and power business continues to face unique market and technology challenges. We have decided to pursue strategic alternatives, including a potential sale of this business.","Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies net sales decreased 4% and underlying sales declined 3%. By region, the U.S. was down 4%; Asia, down 7%; Europe, down 1%; Latin America, up 6%; and Middle East\/Africa, up 17%. U.S. residential\/commercial and refrigeration markets were weak, especially in the transportation refrigeration market. Asia reflected mixed trends across markets and businesses with China down 7% and Europe remains soft.","Segment margin of 18.5% expanded 150 basis points despite the sales decrease on a well-positioned cost structure and favorable mix. Global end markets remained stable, but soft, a trend expected to continue into the first half of 2013.","Moving to Slide 12, commercial and residential solutions. Commercial and residential solutions net sales were unchanged, with underlying sales up 5% as the Knaack business divestiture deducted 4% and currency translation deducted 1%. By region, the U.S. was up 2%; Asia, up 17%; Europe, flat; Latin America, up 11%; and Middle East\/Africa up 35%.","The commercial storage and food waste disposal business has reported strong growth as U.S. construction and renovation demand remained steady. Segment margin of 21.9% increased 130 basis points, benefiting primarily from cost containment programs. We expect North America residential end markets to continue to improve into 2013, resulting in good sales growth at solid profitability for the commercial and residential solutions segment.","Next slide, fiscal 2012 highlights. As previously mentioned, full year net sales grew 1% and underlying sales increased 3%, with emerging markets increasing to 36% of total sales. Record gross profit and operating profit margin reflects continued innovation, portfolio management and cost repositioning efforts. Reported EPS of $2.67 reflects the $0.72 goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, EPS of $3.39 grew 3%. We also completed the 56th consecutive year of dividend increases, with 16% growth in 2012. After a challenging first half of 2012, we finished the year with strong execution and solid operational momentum moving into 2013.","Moving to Slide 14, the 2013 outlook. Global economic growth continues to trend downward, but still moderately positive. The pace of growth is unusually weak for this stage of recovery cycle and uncertainty in the U.S., China and Europe is resulting in cautious business investment. At present, there is no obvious catalyst for economic growth acceleration.","Based on current global economic conditions, the 2013 outlook is as follows: Reported and underlying sales growth of 0% to 5%; EBIT margin, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement; earnings per share growth, mid- to high-single digits from a base of $3.39 in 2012; we expect the majority of sales and earnings growth to occur in the first half of the year.","And with that, I will now turn it over to David Farr.","David N. Farr","Thank you very much. Thank you there, Pat. First, I want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we appreciate your interest and your support of Emerson. Secondly, I also want to congratulate Frank Dellaquila. The board today promoted Frank to EVP and CFO, expanded his title, given an EVP title, and so he's now going up a notch, and his compensation will be adjusted downward accordingly. So...","Frank J. Dellaquila","Thank you, Dave.","David N. Farr","You're always welcome for that. And then most importantly -- by far, most importantly, I want to thank the entire global organization for delivering extremely strong second half of our fiscal year after the unique and enormous shock that we took in our supply chain for many of our businesses coming from the Thailand floods.","As you all know, the first half of this year was down in sales, earnings, margins. And we rallied the folks around the world. The organization fought back and recovered nicely with a very strong second half, and I want to toast and thank all of the individuals on this company who made that happen, especially led by Frank and Ed Monser and the business leaders because without their effort, we would not have made that second half happen, and I appreciate that. And it gets us into great position relative to the year where we face right now in 2013 with, again, a lot of uncertainty, and I'll talk little bit about that.","Unfortunately, this year in 2012, the underlying volumes of the company, due to the weakening economies as the year progressed, were significantly lower than we thought originally. We ended up the year a little bit over 2.5% underlying sales growth, stronger second half because of the floods impact, but overall, it's basically down 4 points from what we thought we were going to see and we presented in February of 2012. So a much weaker economy impacted us, and then we had the floods, and it really had a challenging situation for the whole company.","As I look at the fourth calendar quarter, there's a lot of uncertainty out there between the whole fiscal cliff here in the United States; the European situation and the continued impact of that recession and slowdown and, I would say, stagnation in Europe; the Japanese situation, which is clearly uncertain and also weakening; and then a little bit uncertainty relative to China and what their next-generation leaders are going to do relative to their global investments and also investments to stimulate their economy.","As we look at our current order pace, it's a little weaker. Our backlog is still very positive. We are clearly looking at an uncertain and challenging business times for the next 6 months, and we are going to plan accordingly. As we look at our current make-up of the year, given the very weak first half last year because of the Thailand flood, we expect, again, this year to be a first half, second half, with 70% to 80% of our earnings per share, I'll say it again, 70% to 80% of our earnings per share in the first half of this year and obviously the remaining part in the second half.","It will be very difficult at this point in time to say what's going to happen in the fourth quarter given the fact that people are being very cautious, and I'm also a bit concerned that people will shut down early in the month of December on -- based on inventories or weak demand. And so I'm very nervous about the fourth calendar quarter.","We still see continued growth in 2013, pretty much in line to what we see this year -- we saw this year. We do not see a global recession at this point in time. We're looking as we talked about 1% to 5% underlying sales growth with a good mid-point about exactly what we did this year. Around that 2.5%, 2.6% level is a good midpoint. We are seeing a current forecast level and pace of gross fixed investment weaker in 2013 on a fiscal year basis than we saw in 2012. We clearly have the uncertainty with the fiscal cliff and that one bothers us right now relative to what's going on.","Even if they do resolve the fiscal cliff, and I have no idea how they're going to do that, I personally believe the spending in the U.S. will be negatively impacted, both at the government level and then also the consumer level if they go about raising taxes. So our plan right now is a slight margin improvement, EPS in the mid to single high -- single digits with strong leverage, and particularly coming from process business and the recovery in residential and commercial solutions business.","We will give more detailed segment information at our February meeting, not today. I gave you more than I normally would give you in a fiscal year guidance, but that's where we sit at this point in time.","On the positive headwinds and tailwinds we see right now, the big headwind for us right now is pension. With the discount rate at 4%, unbelievably low for U.S. discount for pension, we will have a negative P&L impact of $65 million on our pension. We are in good shape with the pension. But clearly, with the low discount rates, we have to fund additional monies and we have to expense that and also put the cash in. But the cash funding will be about the same level we did last year, around $150 million, just the pension expense will be higher.","Restructuring, we're in good shape. We have gone through 2 very, very big years. In 2013, we're looking at restructuring in the $70 million to $80 million level, down from the current 2012 and then also down from the 2011 expenditures. We do have the new, what we call the performance share, or the 4-year program, which we have -- every so often, we have an overlap year and this -- and 2013 will be an overlap year.","The Compensation Committee and the board awarded the performance share awards, which are a 4-year program. They awarded those and there will be about $120 million impact on the year as we have an overlap -- the overlap year. It's clearly depending upon the stock price. And if the stock price goes up, that number obviously goes up. But that's good for everybody, as long as the stock price goes up.","But net-net, we are looking at a year pretty much like we just faced without the catastrophes, where underlying sales growth, low-single digits, some good leverage, good cash flow, strategic investments and running in an environment where right now, that everyone is concerned about where the economic growth is going to come from.","Fundamentally, I believe the United States has to lead the world out of this recession, this global downturn, and we do have the capabilities in North America and Mexico, U.S. and in the United States to lead this economy out for the world. But until that happens, we will stay, and I would say, in a very sluggish economic environment at this point in time.","So with that, I would like to turn the floor over to questions and open the line to ask questions of either Pat, Frank or myself. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Winoker from Sanford Bernstein.","David N. Farr","Steve, before you ask the question, I do -- Frank Dellaquila just pointed out something, so I do need to clarify it very quickly, 70% to 80% of our EPS increase, not of the total EPS, but 70% to 80% of our EPS increase for next year will be happening in the first half. Thank you, Frank, not the -- increased.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes, I know. It's the growth.","David N. Farr","Yes. I just want to -- if Frank pointed that out, and I misspoke, and thank God, I'm not on the live TV somewhere around the world, or something like that.","Frank J. Dellaquila","Right.","David N. Farr","Okay, Steve, what's your question?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So the first one, just again on the guidance, the pension and the stock-based comp, if I put them together, feel like 4% to 5% impact on growth, EPS growth for next year. And if that's true, then at the high end of your guidance, just talk about mid-single digits, 5% top line, high single-digit, 9% bottom line, plus I'd add back the pension stock base, and now I'm talking about low to mid-teens EPS growth off of that 5%, if I x out the pension and stock base. How should I -- how are you getting that much leverage, or how are you thinking about that much leverage in the business?","David N. Farr","Well, first of all, let's clarify what I consider high to mid. I would consider 7% a high, mid-single digit EPS growth. And if I grow -- if we grow underlying sales at 5%, we will get more than 2\/10 leverage. It's pretty simple. So I know you guys have a tendency to run, you're sort of like people in my family, say you, \"Go ahead and spend,\" and you just run right up to the top number to the credit card, so you just ran right up to 9%. And so what I classify high-single digit may be a little bit different than your definition. So your credit line is stopping, let's say, at maybe 7.5%, okay?","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, Dave. I promise not to spend it before you deliver it, how's that?","David N. Farr","You got it. Thank you very much. I just want to make sure you understand that credit card balance there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Second, maybe a higher-level question on the portfolio. I mean, given your comments on embedded and so seeing that exit and given the M&A environment, right, how do you see the portfolio changing and transforming over, say, the next 12 months as opposed to longer-term or 12 to 18? What is...","David N. Farr","At this point in time, our focus will, obviously, clearly find the right partnership and proper way to exit the embedded power computing, we'll do this as you know we have -- we'll do this in an orderly process. We want to protect that business and also to maximize the value for our shareholders. It will take us throughout most of this year to do that. And then relative to the acquisition front right now, we're looking primarily at small, again, small bolt-on type acquisitions, nothing significant. We're planning, as we review with the board today, basically around that $500 million level again. So there's not going to be anything structurally changing at this point in time. The folks in Network Power Systems are very much focused on integrating and getting that business back on track. The process guys have their hands full with underlying growth. Our Climate Technologies folks really have their hands full right now relative to sorting through how that market's going to recover in some time in 2013. So very much focused on status quo, nothing significant from the acquisition front at this point in time.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And could I just follow that up on the data center, with the board review, when you talk about the difference between embedded computing power versus data centers, even though we're in a weak data center time frame right now, what were some of the major -- you talked about strategic and market differences when you talk about those very different segments.","David N. Farr","We'll talk about that in February. That's a little bit more than what I'd discussed in a phone call like that. I mean, there's a lot going on in the data world right -- data center world right now with the, obviously, with the new hyper-scales and the -- hyper-scaled data centers and also with the -- basically what's going on in the telecommunication data center infrastructure and stuff like that, that's something we'll get into in February where we can throw some information out there and give you that. But I think in the short term, the data center marketplace will be still quite -- I think it will be challenged because there's not a lot of growth going on out there and there's a lot of fundamental change happening in the marketplace. So we're looking at, I think, over the next 6 months probably a challenging data center environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eli Lustgarten with Longbow Securities.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","What do you -- what was the underlying growth of process in the fourth quarter if you x out the catch-up from the Thailand? I mean, where -- what kind of comparison are we looking at this point?","David N. Farr","I mean, what was the total underlying sales growth?","Frank J. Dellaquila","It was up 21%.","David N. Farr","21%. I think it's going to be high-double digit. And you\u2019re probably talking -- I mean, we're trying to track that, Eli, to be honest. It's sort of like catching sand that's falling in the air. But it's clear, and I would say, you're probably taking about $100 million or $100 million out, $120 million off that, so you're talking about high-double digits. So we had extremely strong underlying sales growth even x that business and all that.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So we're looking at a double-digit capability for 2013 on the basis of that?","David N. Farr","I think that -- I talked about this before. Right now the backlog of the order pace says that we should be able to do that. We -- I'm always concerned about projects being slow. We have not seen that yet. Our order pace, our backlog demand, everything are still very strong even through this month here. However, I think there's a point of some uncertainty in, let's say, that something does happen to the U.S. economy and does take a dramatic dropoff, then you could see some of that slowdown, which we don't see right now. But I think that the pace of business, the backlog would say, \"Yes, you could do north of 10% again.\" I am, right now, are -- probably would say more cautiously that in my base forecast, which would be that mid -- that 2.5% underlying growth rate, we could probably do more like 7%, 7%, 8%.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And with the strategic alternative for Network Power, the focus has to be how are you going to replace -- anything you sell these days, unfortunately, is dilutive.","David N. Farr","Right.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","So do you intend to be buying back shares throughout the year to offset the dilution of that, or wait until it happen, or do you hope you can make enough acquisitions to offset it? How do you plan to offset the dilution of that...","David N. Farr","We intend, at this point in time, our current plan with the cash flow generation, is to buy -- we're planning around $800 million of shares, share buyback. We will start within a couple of days here after we file our reports and we have -- clearly, this marketplace will go back out. We stopped about -- at the end of the fiscal year because there's impairment charge. We did not to want go out during the time period that we knew that we had an impairment charge. So we will go back out here in the coming days to start buying. But our target is to buy around 800 million shares this year which will clearly offset any dilution we have from this business. And depending on if we have more cash and the market says that, we'll actually buy more. But right now, that's what we're looking at, Eli.","Eli S. Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC","And we'll get the details of how much creep we have from these incentive program overlap or so how much you'll be reissuing in tax rate change and any of that will change at all?","David N. Farr","Yes, I mean the tax rate number, I'll give you exact -- I mean, right now we plan last year a 32%. We did a little bit better than that as the year closes out. Right now I would assume we're around that 32% again. From the share count, there's very few new shares going out. The share from the new performance share program, we have to earn it to get them. So right now, our share count will drop based on buying 800 million shares back. So our share count drop this year. Frank, how many shares have dropped?","Frank J. Dellaquila","At about 20 million.","David N. Farr","About 20 million? So our shares will dropped this year on average, and I will expect our shares to drop again next year on average depending on obviously what the stock price is. But our share count has been dropping year by year as we buy the stock back. We are not a big issuer of stock. We obviously have employee stock programs, but we're not a big issuer of stock.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Dave, have you seen any evidence of any kind of backlash in China from the Huawei comments, the Congress made about not wanting to buy Chinese telecom equipment. I mean, is there anything that puts your business at risk over there and just general backlash?","David N. Farr","No, we have not seen any backlash. We have extremely good relationships in China. The Congress comments on Huawei, obviously, were quite strong and, obviously, from an All-American corporate perspective. But we have not seen any big issue there. They know that, that was not us talking, that's the Congress talking. It's a little bit different situation. So our relationship in China is very good. I think that the key issue for us right now is there's new leaderships coming on board as we've talked about where are the investment dollars going to come, and I think there's a degree of freedom they have of investing that money is less than they had historically. So we are looking for, in our case this year, we're probably looking to 5% to 10% type of growth this year in our China businesses after a weak 2012. And it's not uncommon for us to come back, and we see some of those marketplaces already starting to come back, some stability there already.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second, just on Industrial Automation. You had a nice improvement in the margins. It wasn't really clear in the prepared remarks how much you can really attribute to favorable mix versus cost. And if it's cost, how much of it is structural cost? I mean, I guess another way of asking the question is, is this business taking a step-up in kind of structural margins because of some cost actions you've taken or is this more temporary?","David N. Farr","We've taken, as you know, up to the very end, we've had a lot of restructuring in our high-cost structure, both here in the U.S. and also in Western Europe in the Industrial Automation business. So here, the majority of the margin improvement is a structural change, and that we should see a good margin next year. We've had a huge step-up here this year, we also had the Byrd Amendment monies that helped us a little bit. So they have to overcome that, which I think was around 40-some-odd million  dollars, $43 million. But I would expect them to have a slight margin improvement again next year. And they're not going to see much growth from that business in the next 2 or 3 quarters. But they have structurally improved the operating performance of that company to back where it has been historically. So I think you're going to see pretty good margin from them, though, the marketplace, because they're very strong in Europe and, obviously, some of the other markets have weakened a little bit, so I expect these guys is going to be fighting for volume all year long. But they have their costs in great shape right now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Dave, I just want to make sure you did vote today?","David N. Farr","Yes, I actually voted, yes. I guarantee I voted. I voted a couple of weeks ago. It was actually a couple of times. Well, yes, I can't do that, but I did vote, I voted a couple of weeks ago. My son was home for his fall break and I took them down there. I voted absentee and he voted because he's out of school. I know I can be at the board meeting, there's no way I can get down there this late so I did already.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right, good to hear. Now I was hoping you could expand the comment on climate, pretty mixed results across all the end markets or more likely, more negative across all the markets. But then the outlook on the commercial and resi side as you're expecting resi to improve, so how do you get resi improving without a better look at resi HVAC?","David N. Farr","That is the issue. We firmly believe that there will be an improvement in residential spending in North America in 2013, ignoring any economic shock or a huge dropoff in the U.S. economy. The issue for us right now is gaining stability within the China market which we're starting to see from that business, which is important, which we haven't seen. I do not see any recovery in Europe at this point in time in our Climate Technology. On the transport side, which has been the most recent deterioration in the business space from a global transportation, both in trucking and then in also container, that marketplace is in downward cycle and that probably will go for another 6 to 12 months. So at this point in time, we would expect the industry to stay very tight, be very lean, and then come the typical recovery period which will be more March, April time period, I'm anticipating that the housing market continues to solidify and we'll start seeing some recovery in our Climate Technology business in the second half of the year. In the first 6 months, it will still be a challenge for these guys and they've got their cost in line and there's not going to be any growth. It's just a very tough marketplace all around the world. That's how we look at it right now.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And is there any comments regarding the impact of the storm, both negative and part of the rebuild?","David N. Farr","From our own underlying business, there's obviously very, very minor impacts. Obviously, we have businesses up there day-to-day. We obviously have our service organization in there right now working with the key customers. Would there be any -- you're not going to see any significant impact both in sales and profitability, both positives or negatives. I would say net-net, in the next 3, 4 months, it will be positive. And then long term, obviously, as we rebuild, that will be helpful. But we have short-term things that will be positive for us. But it's an ordinary course of the business. So it's a net positive for us at this point in time.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But you can't quantify that from there?","David N. Farr","No, I can't because it's hard to say. It's not something you can quantify. It's sort of like quantified back in the 2008 stimulus number. I mean, that was a waste of effort by \teverybody.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Hey, Dave, so the 41% gross margin, obviously a big number. I mean, you have some favorability in process going on in the quarter. I mean, how do you view the sustainability of that type of gross margin?","David N. Farr","I mean, what I would say right now is that based on the current mix of businesses, based on where our cost structure's sitting right now and the current price cost structure we see, we're probably anticipating another 50 basis points improvement in GP margin in 2013, based on everything I see right now, how we finished. I mean, the 41% is based on a very high volume and a catch up and a good leverage point. But I see right now the run rate, my gut tells me, as I finish that year out and we wrap up '13, we're going to be looking around a 40.5% GP margin next year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then on restructuring, I mean, you did $119 million this year in an elevated year, you're already seeing some good payback from prior restructuring. What do you think your year-over-year benefits going to be in '13 from the actions you've taken this year?","David N. Farr","I mean, I don't quantify that, but from the standpoint of if you look at the businesses, both in the Industrial Automation and then also Network Power systems, you're going to continue to see -- have better margin from that restructuring. So we'll be getting a good payback this year. I mean, my gut tells me that we will spend $70 million or $80 million and we'll get a little bit more back than that in savings based on what we spent last year. We won't -- you spend a $70 million to $80 million this year, you get a little bit back, but we're going to get a good carryover from what we spent last year. So we should be well north of that $70 million to $80 million in benefits and that's obviously part of where I'm getting my GP margin improvement. That's why I made that statement to you. I see at least 50 basis points of GP margin improvement going into this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague.","[Technical Difficulties]","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So just thinking about the comment about there's no obvious catalysts and we need leadership in the U.S. I mean, not to kind of get on a soapbox here or anything, but you're kind of in a defensive crouch, a lot of companies are kind of in a defensive crouch. I mean, how dramatically do you think actually things could change if there's a favorable outcome in the election and how quickly could it change? And is it right to characterize you and corporate America kind of in a defensive crouch?","David N. Farr","Yes, we're definitely in a defensive crouch. We have -- as you know, I refer to it not a defensive crouch, I'm talking about the reins. You hear me talking about pulling the reins. So we've got the reins way back. What we're going to need, not only do we need -- well, obviously, within the next 24 hours and hopefully sooner than later, get clarity on the election and who's going to be the next President of the United States, this great country. What we then need is, okay, we need the leaders of this country to get together and sort out how are we going to fix the long-term fiscal structure of our government. We can't afford what we're doing right now and we have to fix that. The leaders need to see that. And I think -- so there will be either a great -- depending on what party you're involved with, a great amount of excitement and then there will be -- or there will be a great \"ugh.\" However, the big issue for all of us is what are we going to do in Washington relative to not only the issue relative to this nightmare fiscal cliff that's been set up by the inability of the Congress and the President to deal with this issue. But we also have to lay out what is the next 20-year or 15-, 20-year program to recover this country from a fiscal standpoint, get the spending back on track, get the income back on track and to encourage long-term investments. So you're going to see business CEOs will say, okay, we now know who the President is, okay now, what are you going to do in Washington? And then based on that, I think, if you had -- if we see a very positive pro-growth, pro-U.S investment environment, you would see sometime in the second half of 2013, starting to see things flow. People will not get carried away and start to say, hey, I'm going to go out and spend, up my spending by 20% because of this. You will see some impact in the second half of 2013 which would tee up, I think, a much stronger 2014, 2015. And that's -- Jeff, that's how I feel right now and I don't see any -- okay, Dave, spend 20% more next year because of election results tonight or 20% less. I don't see any impact. However, what I want to see is resolution to getting this country back on a sound fiscal spending income track, period. And that's what CEOs want.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got it, that's helpful. Just back to Network Power, so you actually exited at a pretty good margin rate. I mean, should we -- so is the restructuring going on there, there's some seasonality. And do you think about building on this Q4 rate or do we step down and build our way up going forward? How do we think about that?","David N. Farr","Well, we -- from the standpoint of Network Power, historically, the first quarter margins are -- I mean, we've obviously got some margins going the right way. But first quarter margin, we will go back a little bit. We are not going to go back to a level that we saw last year in that first quarter. So I'm looking, Frank showed me the numbers right now. So we should see a continued improvement in the first quarter, depending on the rate of restructuring, but we should see continued improvement in the profitability of this business as we go -- the whole Network Power segment into this first quarter, second quarter. We saw sequential improvement in the third, we saw a sequential improvement in the fourth. Yes, it was down versus prior year, but they have their cost structure in place. And we've seen a reasonable stability relative to the order pace. So I feel that we're going to see continued improvements throughout the year and then we'll end up the year at a better profit margin for this business than obviously we finished this year. Again, moving back up towards -- well, I'm trying to get the whole Network Power. I mean, we want to go back up into that above 10% range. So hopefully, we'll get it up to that 11%, 12% top of the range. That is what we see right now.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And the write-off was solely on amortizing goodwill, there's no amortizing intangibles that went away as part of the write-off?","David N. Farr","No. I mean, I always wish they only wrote off the intangibles, but unfortunately, when they go through and revalue the business, they do everything both intangibles and also the goodwill. So there won't be any change in that intangibles delta. Frank, was there any change?","Frank J. Dellaquila","It's a goodwill write-off, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Only goodwill?","David N. Farr","Yes. It's one of those things.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And just finally, we can do the math, but I should take quite literally the notion that an $8 million share repurchase can offset the dilution...","David N. Farr","No, $800 million, $800 million.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","I'm sorry, that's what I meant, $800 million can set off the dilution from offsetting out embedded power?","David N. Farr","Easily.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg with Langenberg & Company.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","Just a couple of things. First, Network Power, can you talk a little bit about whether mix helped you or hurt you? Understanding it dealt a lot to do with restructuring. Second of all, can you talk about the benefit or what have you, of price cost in climate in the quarter? Then the third question, I noticed that quarter-over-quarter, receivables were up almost $400 million, sales were up a little bit over $200 million, just walk us through the puts and takes in the working capital, please?","David N. Farr","Okay. The first one is the mix did not help us and Network Power in this quarter. The climate -- what I call the Precision Cooling business, really didn't -- I don't -- did not have a good quarter so therefore, that's a good margin business. That did hurt us. The mix overall, when I look at the Network Power, would not be a good sign. So we overcame bad mix and through the restructuring and the efforts there, we did get an improvement in profitability. So that was a negative for us. Relative to price costs and climate, at this point in time, the price costs was slightly green for us in our fourth fiscal quarter or the third calendar quarter. It will continue to be slightly green in this quarter coming up and then we're going through negotiations and most likely, that will go back into a neutral type of mode at that point in time. But right now, with the material decline and that material inflation and the price increases we have in place, we were slightly green. And so it helped us a little bit but it wasn't huge, let's put it that way, slightly green. And the third question, you asked, oh yes, receivables. Okay, that is an issue. We had -- a couple of things happened to us as we had a very strong last basically 40 days of shipments as we made this quarter, as we geared up to make this quarter. So we had a lot of sales shipped out in the last couple of weeks in particular that we're collecting those receivables now and the quarter end of this year, on Sunday, that are cut off for collections for us or the banks, it was basically Friday. So we had a lot of shipments going out as we drove to make -- drive that backlog down and make the quarter and the sales. I mean, obviously, everything aboveboard, nothing illegal just from the standpoint of that's how the quarter unfolded. And that caused us -- our receivables to explode and you'll see it, we will have a good first quarter cash flow and that receivable numbers to start winding back down. There's nothing extraordinary, we did not -- from a bad debt standpoint or any income, we're in good shape. We've analyzed the heck out of it. We have nominal bad debt to this company. I mean, we're talking nominal. And so we're in pretty good shape, but we did have a huge surge in receivables as you pointed out. Inventory receivables were in good shape.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Richard Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Mix for process, how are you thinking about that for '13? You had a pretty good year in '12. I know there was some disruption but how are you thinking about MRO versus solutions, et cetera?","David N. Farr","Right now, with a record backlog and starting the year with very strong North American investments in oil and gas, and we have still pretty good mix. So I would expect we're sitting at record levels of profitability. I would expect that we would still be able to get a slight improvement based on the current pace of business and based on the current mix. So I feel -- as I said, I think it was Eli asking the question about it. If you just look at the raw numbers, you could say we should be able to do 10-plus percent in process growth next year. So I have -- in my base plan of that, basically midpoint of that 2.5% to 2.6%, I'm talking about underlying sales growth. I think that process could have a slowdown in some pushouts, so I'm looking more in that 7% to 8%. But right now, the mix is really good for us, and obviously, the technology mix and MROs, I mean, that helps our margins, as you could tell, both from the GP and OP levels.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. Okay. And then a question for Frank on the stock comp. So when you look back to fiscal '10, you had a big increase in corporate and other and then that was the last year we had the incentive comp. If the stock price stays where it is today, what's kind of the bogey in terms of the year-over-year increase on the incentive comp?","David N. Farr","$120 million.","Frank J. Dellaquila","I think about $110 million, $120 million.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","$110 million, $120 million, okay.","David N. Farr","It depends if the stock play stays right here, but we're hoping stock gets up to $75 and then that number will be a lot larger.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So just trying to reconcile all the moving parts here. This year, you guys did, I guess, 3% to 5% EPS growth on about 3% underlying. You said this is going to be somewhat of a similar year. You've got the stock comp, you've got the pension, I guess, offset by a little bit lower restructuring. So I guess, what kind of -- despite those headwinds, what kind of gets you back to a similar year this year even to the high end is a combination of volume and then I guess restructuring saves in the business? I'm just curious as to if you did 3% EPS this year on 3% underlying, why at 3% underlying are you going to do better than 3% EPS this year?","David N. Farr","A couple of things. One, we would not have -- there was a lot of cost and disruption in that business this year, as we try to recover it and try to recover from that standpoint of the Thailand floods. Secondly, as I look at it right now, the mix that we'll see, we see our growth coming next year again from process, but also from our residential, commercial-residential business which is also a pretty good profitability market. And I also look at just from the mix standpoint, I see a reasonable level of margin improvement this year. And I thought, as we get higher volumes, I think we'll go towards that high single-digit. And the middle, I think, we'll do little bit better from a leverage standpoint, so I feel at that 2.5%, we'll do a little bit better than we did this year and that's where it comes from, Steve.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So when you say mid to high single-digits, you're talking something like 4% to 7% is that how we should think about it?","David N. Farr","Yes.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. On the...","David N. Farr","Maybe 7.4%. I'm going to get that credit card, I can't remember who asked that, I might take that credit card out to $7,400, but it's definitely not going to be $10,000 credit line there.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then on the EPS growth, just to make sure we're calibrated here, there's a lot of moving parts in the first quarter, but you said 70% to 80% of the EPS growth, which I guess implies about 10% growth in the first half and I would assume the first quarter is obviously the strongest given the comp you have, but I guess is that kind of a linear step down 1Q to 2Q? Or is 1Q like 20%?","David N. Farr","We're saying 78% of the -- obviously, the delta increase next year. And so it will be in the first half. Now the issue really boils down to -- as I said in my commentary, I'm very nervous about the fourth calendar quarter. I still believe -- I believe the 70%, 80%, I'm very nervous and that's why I've not given any guidance like on a quarterly basis because I'm a little bit nervous that we have a significant customer base that could really slow down in the month of December on us. And because the uncertainty out there, and especially if we get into the discussion, post election, about this whole -- the fiscal cliff and the restructuring and of what's going to happen in the U.S. government and this thing gets into a logjam and also when you start seeing that they're going to let this thing happen, you're going to -- I think that will create a lot of even more uncertainty from the company standpoint and the customer standpoint, and it could really slow down that month of December. So I'm a little bit nervous about giving what I would call EPS estimates for the quarter because of that. I would agree with you, the first quarter, if you look at it just from a pure economic standpoint, I would say that would be -- my biggest increase would be that first quarter because it was the shock last year, but I'm also very nervous about the uncertainty around this fourth calendar quarter. So I feel good that we will have 70% to 80%. It's hard for me to say that I'm going to have more in the first and less in the second, that I tell you. So I mean, I know I'm not helping you much, but I'm just telling you, I'd be very careful there.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more question on the order rates. They bounced around, it sounds like you had a lot of book and ship in the September quarter because the order rates were -- I mean, reasonably negative on a 3-year trailing basis. How was kind of October playing out so far?","David N. Farr","I've not seen October, but what you did see in September -- September, we reduced our backlog. You're going to see our backlog drop significantly in the month of September, in the fourth quarter. So we had built a backlog, as you know, all year long, and the whole issue was to get that backlog down. I still believe, as the total company, we ended up the year with a little bit higher backlog but we significantly reduced it. Frank, how much we reduced the backlog roughly?","Frank J. Dellaquila","A couple of hundred million, think about $200 million.","David N. Farr","A couple of hundred million. Let's say, right now, Steve, I don't have it exactly but let's say $200 million of place orders, that's how much we reduced that backlog.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Over the year?","David N. Farr","No, on the fourth quarter.","Frank J. Dellaquila","From Q3 to Q4.","David N. Farr","So I just assume around $200 million that we reduced in the quarter of the backlog. So a lot of that improvement came from not from the current orders, but the backlog.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, the first question was really on the margin progression. I mean, you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of operating margin growth in fiscal '13. You grew about 20 bps in fiscal '12 with a similar revenue growth rate. It sounds like the gross margin should be up 50 bps. It sounds like mix should be good in '13 from process and some of the construction-facing businesses. So what is it that sort of dampens that drop-through on the EBIT margin line aside from just the pension and stock comp issues or is it really just those 2 things?","David N. Farr","Those are the 2 issues right there. Those are the 2 big issues at this point in time, Julian. And this -- as we get above that 2.5% to 3%, we will have pretty good leverage. And obviously, I think, the net margin would be a little bit -- that margin delta will be a bit higher there, I mean, as to moving parts going on at this point in time but right now, I think we're looking at a little bit better progression relative to growth from the standpoint we're not looking at the disruption and that we're looking going into the year with our cost structure in very good shape right now. We have a reasonable backlog. And so I think operating right now is pretty good. I'm more concerned about the external shock going on the global economy more than anything else at this point in time and how that will impact us for a month or 2 as things get sorted out. That's why I'm being a little cautious there.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the restructuring side of things, I mean, you said that '13 will be a bit lower run rate than '11 and '12. But if you're very worried about the top line, why wouldn't you keep going at an aggressive restructuring?","David N. Farr","Because I think, as I laid out the restructuring, we needed to get accomplished and what we think we can get accomplished with next year, $70 million, $75 million is the right number for us and I would say that, that -- right now, the look at -- what we see going forward in the next couple of years, that probably is going to be the range we're at right now as we manage. I don't have anything that forces me to accelerate that even higher. We've had 2 very big years of restructuring. Actually 2.5 very big years of restructuring. And so now, I'm in the mode of trying to stabilize this and say, okay, let's get a payback for my shareholders in that restructuring.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So then just a very quick follow-up, Network Power, the sort of the decremental margin was pretty big in Q4, and you called out some cost increases as a reason for that, I just wanted to check what those were?","David N. Farr","I don't have that off the top of my head.","Frank J. Dellaquila","I mean, it's nothing in particular, it's just kind of typical business inflation that occurs, nothing out of the ordinary.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Mike Wood with Macquarie.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","This is Adam in for Mike. You talked about looking for 5% to 10% growth in China businesses in next year. Can you talk about what that growth was in fiscal '12 and sort of which businesses will be driving that growth?","David N. Farr","Negative. It was negative, minus 4%. We gave that number out today, it was minus 4%.","Adam Baumgarten - Macquarie Research","And could you talk about which businesses you expect to be strongest next year?","David N. Farr","I would expect the process business to be stronger next year based on the record level of bookings that we had in China in the second half of fiscal '12. I expect to see a recovery in our Climate Technology business which was hit pretty hard last year. I expect to see whether some of the investment areas I'm seeing right now will impact our Network Power China business, so I expect to see a reasonable recovery there. And I don't expect to see much recovery in Industrial Automation at this point in time, so that's where I see it at this point.","Operator","And we have John back with Deutsche Bank.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dave, you made a comment about you haven't seen projects slowing in process. I wanted to ask you because x process, you have seen project deferrals, I think, bigger projects amongst oil and gas types of activities. So if you're not really seeing those, it suggests you're taking share or maybe there's something about the process industry that's perhaps different than flow and other aspects of that. Could you talk to that a bit, like the sustainability of your oil and gas piece in process? What are you thinking right now?","David N. Farr","Right now, based on the current order pace and the current backlog we see and the execution, right now, our oil and gas business should see another very good year. As you know, I don't look at it from a 12-month period or 1 quarter share gain, but I think as you look back at the last 2 years where we've had 15-plus percent growth in sales and a good marketplace, but I think that you're going to see that we did pretty well. We held our own and maybe did a little bit better than average. So I feel good about the position right now. I feel extremely good about the technology. I feel good about our record levels and investments we're making there. So we are obviously -- everyone's getting in the zone and we're in the zone on right now. And sometimes, you fall out of the zone, but we're in the zone, let's put it that way.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That makes sense. Dave, if you haven't seen October in a lot of detail, I'm just curious, given kind of what's transpired in the economy, there was some slowing significantly amongst other companies in September, why do you still think that there is no U.S. recession coming or pending in 2013? What's your gut tell you?","David N. Farr","My gut tells me that they will come up with some level of, what I'd say, compromise on the immediate fiscal cliff that will cause the U.S. economy to be slower or stays at a slow pace in 2013, but not go into recession. I mean, we're real close to a stall speed right now where as you well know, we're growing somewhere between 1% and 2%. That in U.S. economy is basically a stall speed. Yes, it's stepped down and I think that if I look at my order pace in North America, probably in total, yes, I would say that we probably had another weak month in October, but I don't have those numbers yet. I just don't -- I won't get them for another 4 or 5 days here. But my gut tells me right now that they will take some action to mitigate the dramatic dropoff going into fiscal cliff. However, if they don't, then you're going to have a dramatic pullback in the reins even more relative to spending and that will create a deeper hole. So I don't think we're in a recession right now. I just think we're in a very, what I would say, low growth, 1% to 2% type of growth period at this point in time.","John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And the things do deteriorate, what's sort of your thought process with respect to what buttons or levers you might like to pull? For example, would you want to be more aggressive in M&A or share repurchase? And I'm sure there's -- I'm thinking of the context of prior recessions and your own experience as CEO of the company and so forth.","David N. Farr","I think from the standpoint of -- I don't know if -- in the short term, would you be more aggressive if we went into a recession? I mean, obviously, that would have a knock-on effect to the companies, maybe you would have a better chance of making some of those acquisitions happen. That would be more of a second half '13, early '14 type of impact. If we went into a downturn and obviously the marketplace got hit pretty hard and we generate strong cash, clearly, we could obviously ramp up that share repurchase. We would then fundamentally cut back what I would call it even more of our discretionary spending, which we right now, based on say, 2% to 3% top underlying growth rate, you're starting to build in to drive that, so you can always go after that. But that's why we're going to keep things extremely tight here in the near term because of the uncertainty relative to what's going to happen here as Congress gets back working after the election. That's where we are.","I need to wrap it up here. I need to go to another meeting. And so again, I want to thank everybody for listening today. Thanks for your support and thanks for really sticking with us as the year went on. I know it was not a normal year with the first half, second half, but the operations guys did execute very well and we finished the year at record levels of profitability and record levels of earning. Unfortunately, we had a little impairment issue relative to the business, the one business. But as we talked about, we will deal with that issue as we go forward here in 2013. And again, I want to thank all the executives out there running Emerson for making this year happen. Bye."]}}
