My name is Kim and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call.  At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode.  Later, we will conduct a question and answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Alicia Charity.  Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you and welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s Second Quarter Earnings call.  With me on the call today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer.  Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the underlying performance of the Company\u2019s operations.  Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials available on our website.","Some statements that we make in this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and operating plans and performance.  These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, our 2011 annual report to shareholders, or our 2011 10-K report.  We undertake no obligation to update publicly or to revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","James Cracchiolo","Good morning.  Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings discussion.  I\u2019ll begin with my overview of our business performance for the quarter and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail.  Afterwards, we\u2019ll take your questions.","As we reported yesterday, our headline operating results were impacted by a few items, the largest of which relates to taxes in prior periods.  Walter will explain these in more detail.  If you exclude these items, EPS and return on equity would have been up nicely.","Overall, results in the quarter were solid despite the challenging market conditions and low interest rates that continue to pressure revenue levels which you are seeing across financial firms; and as you would expect, we are adjusting our expense levels to reflect this decline.  We\u2019re making good progress executing our strategy in helping our clients navigate a difficult market environment.  Our business fundamentals are sound with solid traction in our advisory business, good client acquisition, and strong retail net flows.","In asset management, we\u2019ve completed our integration of Columbia Management and together with Threadneedle have a global platform with strong performance and expanded distribution.  In protection annuities, we maintained good books of business with strong risk management and underwriting.  We continue to manage expenses prudently and our balance sheet and capital management underpin our firm.  Meanwhile, we have the flexibility to invest for business growth and return significant capital to shareholders while maintaining the flexibility afforded by our free cash flow and large excess position.","During the quarter, we devoted $428 million to share repurchases and dividends.  With the increased dividend we announced last quarter, our dividend yield is about 2.9%, which is at the higher end of our peer group.  In fact, over the past six quarters we\u2019ve returned more than 130% of our operating earnings to shareholders, putting us in the top quintile of financial companies in the S&P 500.","Now let\u2019s review our business segment performance.  First, advice and wealth management \u2013 we generated nice improvements in profitability in the quarter considering the market headwinds.  Total retail client assets increased 4% year-over-year to $331 billion aided by strong client net inflows in the quarter.  We\u2019re continuing to invest in capabilities that will help our advisors reach more clients and serve existing clients more fully.  ","One of our largest investments is our new brokerage platform.  It\u2019s a multi-year project and its rollout has been successful.  All our employee advisors and more than half of our franchisee advisors are working on the new platform with the remaining advisors making the switch later this quarter.  While training will continue, the larger investments for this project will wrap up later this year.","We also continue to invest in our brand and have enhanced our web presence and online capabilities.  Heardable Score, which measures online brand performance, ranked Ameriprise third in full-service investment brands online, topping many other large firms.  Overall, we feel good about our brand positioning and consumer awareness.","With an established brand and strong value proposition, experienced advisor recruiting is going well.  During the quarter, 91 experienced advisors with good books of business joined Ameriprise.  Approximately 400 advisors have moved their business to Ameriprise over the past year, and we have seen a steady increase in the productivity levels of recruited advisors.  I feel very good about the quality of the advisors who are joining Ameriprise and our efforts to bring them onboard.  They have strong practices and share our values.  In addition to our recruiting success, our long-tenured advisors remain highly satisfied, resulting in very strong retention rates.  ","In terms of productivity, operating net revenue per advisor was down slightly for the quarter, driven by the unease in the markets.  We are increasingly working with clients and fee-based relationships, and our fee-based production increased by nearly double digits; however, as volatility spiked during the quarter, client transaction volumes declined.  ","As we invest in tools to help advisors grow their practices and improve their productivity, we still maintain a strong expense discipline.  We ended the quarter with a pre-tax operating margin of 11.6%, up from 11.3% a year ago and 9.9% sequentially.  Short-term interest rates continue to have a significant impact on our results and the industry. For example, for just the year-over-year period, low interest rates impacted profitability in the segment by 100 basis points.  ","As we move forward, we continue to focus on pulling the right levers to drive profitability improvements in a lower revenue growth environment.  Earlier this month, you likely saw that we are transitioning our federal savings bank to a non-depository national trust bank.  While we have grown the bank since launching it in 2006, it is a small part of our overall business.  Unfortunately, Dodd-Frank does not distinguish between large consumer banks and companies with limited banking operations like Ameriprise.  Once complete, we will no longer be considered a savings and loan holding company.","Importantly, our deposit and lending client value proposition won\u2019t change.  What will change is that it will be delivered through third parties.  These are quality firms, and in many cases they had existing relationships with the bank.  While our decision will impact the advice and wealth management segment due to the loss of revenue and good margin business, we anticipate using the additional capital flexibility to neutralize the EPS impact at the Ameriprise level by repurchasing our shares.","Now I\u2019ll move on to asset management.  In the quarter, asset management achieved consistent profitability in a tough market environment.  Total assets under management for this segment were $446 billion, down 5% from a year ago, from net outflows and average weighted market depreciation.  As I\u2019ve mentioned, the second quarter marked the official completion of our integration of Columbia Management, a significant undertaking for the firm.","In terms of flows during the quarter, we experienced 6.6 billion of net outflows which were largely driven by the expected former parent company and large outflows from the sources we discussed last quarter.  Walter will give you a detailed break-out in a few minutes.","As we look ahead, the large former parent company outflows at Columbia are largely behind us.  The underlying business is sound.  I feel very good about the progress we\u2019re making.  We\u2019re headed in the right direction.  At Columbia, we\u2019re seeing steady progress in flows in our focused sales areas, despite significant market headwinds in the quarter.  In institutional, our pipeline remains strong.  Asset retention is excellent and we continue to deliver good win rates.  ","Earlier this week, the State of South Carolina announced that we will continue managing its 529 plan.  At Threadneedle, the challenges facing the euro zone dampened investor sentiment and led to lower institutional funding rates.  Even with the economic and market challenges in Europe, net flows from European retail investors were essentially flat for the quarter.","With the completion of the Columbia integration, we now have a strong global asset management platform.  We have strong performance across product lines with 116 Morningstar four- and five-star rated funds.  We have broad product lines and we\u2019re launching new products where we see opportunity, including the Columbia Risk Allocation Fund we introduced last month, and we have extensive distribution in the United States and Europe and are working collaboratively to reach more clients and capture opportunities in Asia, the Middle East and other international markets.","As we move forward, we are focused on navigating the challenging environment and managing the business for profitable growth.  Clearly, market conditions will continue to shape investor sentiment, assets and flows.  While we expect flows to improve materially from what we experienced this quarter, we, like the industry, continue to face market challenges.  That said, we have the right people, capabilities and strategy to achieve our long-term growth potential.","Now I\u2019ll move on to annuities and protection.  In annuities, we continue to balance the goals of offering clients products that help meet their income and protection needs while ensuring an appropriate risk profile and return for our shareholders.  Ultimately, both the fixed and variable businesses are affected by a low interest rate environment, and we\u2019re taking steps to further address the related risks.  For example, we introduced a new variable annuity rider in May that incorporates a managed volatility fund.  We stopped sales of certain guaranteed riders and we restricted add-on premiums for the VA in-force block.  As you would expect, these decisions impacted variable annuity sales and net flows in the quarter.  Net inflows in the Ameriprise channel were $94 million, which was down from a year ago and account balances remain flat at $65 billion.  We\u2019re training advisors on the new product features and expect lower sales through the balance of the year as we continue the training process.","On the fixed side, the asset and flow story has remained consistent as has the pressure of low rates.  While we feel good about the characteristics of our fixed block, we are not adding to it, given the rate environment.  Overall, the underlying annuity business is performing within our expectations.  ","In protection, we have good books of business that generate solid earnings and provide steady contributions to our diversified business.  We\u2019re continuing to help our legacy and new advisors work with clients to address their insurance needs.  Total life insurance in force was $191 billion, which has been largely unchanged over the past several quarters given the industry-wide pressures.  We\u2019re seeing continued good lift in our universal life insurance which is more than offsetting slower sales in variable products.  In total, VUL and UL sales were up 25% from a year ago.  ","In the auto and home business, similar to what you\u2019ve seen in the industry, weather-related claims were reflected in second quarter earnings.  That said, the business is doing well.  We generated solid growth and profits in the quarter, and our policy count was up a steady 7%.  To summarize, I feel very good about the risk characteristics and the long-term returns in our insurance and annuity businesses.  ","Overall, Ameriprise remains in a strong position.  We\u2019re making good progress and executing our strategy and helping people gain confidence in their financial future despite a very difficult environment.  The economy in the U.S. is uncertain and clients are cautious.  As Americans return from summer vacations, the election season will be in full swing and our economic issues will be fully debated.  I expect individual and institutional uncertainty and caution will remain elevated for the foreseeable future, and there\u2019s little relief from low interest rates.","At Ameriprise, we will continue to manage through this period consistent with how we managed the firm since we became a public company.  Our business fundamentals are strong and our financial foundation is rock-solid.  We have embedded an expense discipline and are realizing the benefits of our reengineering program to fund our growth investments and help contribute to the bottom line.","We are evolving our business mix to generate more of our earnings from less capital-demanding businesses with strong free cash flow that adds to our existing excess capital position and enhances the flexibility to redeploy capital opportunistically and drive shareholder return.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Walter.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim.  Our second quarter operating earnings per share of $1.13 included several significant discreet items which totaled $0.26 per share.  This included a negative $0.18 from a tax item associated with securities lending activity where we received incomplete data from a third party.  This resulted in the miscalculation of tax deductions in prior periods.  Our tax department became aware of the discrepancy in the second quarter and we took action.  We curtailed the activity associated with this securities lending and quantified the impact of the miscalculation.  Going forward, we are confident this is behind us.","Turning to operating results in the quarter, our segment business fundamentals and performance were good despite the challenges we face from volatile equity markets and declining interest rates, which I will discuss in detail later.  We had three notable milestones in the quarter:  the Columbia Management integration was completed within expectations, we announced our plans to transition our bank to a non-depository national trust bank, which I will discuss later, and we completed a major phase of transitioning advisors to the new brokerage platform.  In addition, we returned 428 million of capital to shareholders and maintained a strong balance sheet position.","As you can see on Page 4, both revenues and earnings per share were affected by the current low rates and the volatile market situation.  Net revenues were also lower on a year-over-year basis by 27 million, reflecting the gain we had last year when we unwound an interest rate hedge.  Earnings per share were also lower on a year-over-year basis from the interest rate hedge and $0.26 per share of unusual items in the quarter.  Specifically, $0.18 per share was related to the tax items I just mentioned.  The remaining $0.08 per share was from the market impact on DAC and DSIC, catastrophe losses above expected levels, and the guaranty fund assessments primarily related to Executive Life of New York.  Excluding these one-time items, earnings per share grew nicely, primarily reflecting the high level of share repurchase over the last 12 months.","Turning to return on equity on Slide 5, this was also impacted by the aforementioned unusual items in the period.  The tax item in the quarter reduced ROE by approximately 50 basis points and the other discreet items reduced it by approximately 20 basis points.  Even in the difficult environment, if adjusted for unusual items in the quarter, our ROE would have been 15.9% which is consistent with last quarter.  ","The low interest rate environment continues to put pressure on our results.  As you are aware, rates have continued to decline in 2012.  As a result, we updated our estimate of the earnings impact over the next couple of years.  Overall, we believe it is manageable.  Our current estimate for 2012 is that after-tax earnings will be about $55 million lower than last year, which is about $20 million higher than our original estimate in the third quarter of 2011 and higher than what I indicated last quarter.  Given how rates moved last year, about two-thirds of the estimated impact has already been realized in the first half of the year.  In 2013, low rates will reduce after-tax earnings by an additional $40 million.  In 2014, our rough estimate indicates that the incremental impact will be less than $10 million after-tax.  We will be re-pricing a large block of fixed annuities that are currently at a 1.5% guaranteed minimum interest rate, which will allow us to improve our spreads on this block of business.","In advice and wealth management, we demonstrate strong underlying fundamentals, as Jim indicated, so our focus is on margins in the quarter, which increased to 11.6% despite the headwinds we faced from the markets and the $10 million impact from lower year-over-year interest rates.  We are realizing the benefits of our strong expense discipline while still making important investments for the longer term business growth.","Based on the low interest rates and market volatility, we now expect margins to be in the 11 to 11.5% range for the full year; however, the expense management initiatives we previously outlined are on track and will accelerate in the fourth quarter as the brokerage platform project is completed.  The bank exit in the fourth quarter will have a minimal impact to margins.","On Slide 8, I will provide some additional information on our bank exit.  Earlier this month, we announced our plans to change our banking subsidiary by year-end, subject to regulatory approval.  As Jim said, this structure is more appropriate for our business mix and will give us more capital flexibility.  There will be approximately $20 million of non-operating expenses in 2012 and early 2013.  In addition, the transition frees up about 375 million in capital on a net balance basis.  Other balance sheet impacts are nominal.","We estimate that this will reduce AWM earnings by 45 to $50 million in 2013 and decreased margins by 80 to 100 basis points on an annualized basis.  At the enterprise level, we anticipate that the impact to earnings per share will be immaterial as we redeploy the excess capital to shareholders through share repurchase throughout 2013.","Turning to asset management, we are feeling the impact from outflows we experienced last year, the industry shift from equity to fixed income, as well as the lower equity markets.  We are making good progress on managing expenses to partially offset revenue pressures.  On a sequential basis, earnings were stable despite market volatility and reflect good expense controls.  We completed the Columbia integration and are well positioned to grow this global business as we go forward.  As Jim said, the fundamentals around distribution and performance remain strong.","In the near term, market conditions will keep margins at our current level for the full year or 33 to 34% on an adjusted basis, and 18 to 19% on an operating basis.  This is a change from what we provided last quarter primarily because of weak equity market performance in the quarter.","Now let\u2019s look more closely at asset management flows on Slide 10.  I wanted to provide an update on the large anticipated outflows primarily at Columbia that we discussed last quarter.  Last quarter, we expected to see 4.7 billion of outflows from former parent 401K, Balboa Insurance, and the loss of the New York 529 plan.  Our actual results were in line with these expectations, with some acceleration in outflows from Balboa Insurance assets.  $1.5 billion of AWM remains from Balboa and we expect these outflows over the next few quarters.  Aside from these assets, we expect these large former parent company outflows are behind us.  ","We continue to see about 900 million of outflows in our value and restructuring fund due to the retirement of the portfolio manager earlier this year.  It appears that this trend is now slowing.  We also saw continued outflows from a third party sub-advisor in the quarter.  Outflows in the closed block of insurance assets at Threadneedle represented the majority of Threadneedle\u2019s outflows in the period.  As we look ahead to flows in the second half of the year, we are mindful that this is a challenging environment, as Jim described.\\","Turning to annuities, earnings were also pressured by the operating environment.  DAC adjustments and several other items, including payments of the guaranty funds associated with Executive Life in New York.  Together, these reduced segment pre-tax operating earnings.  Variable annuity operating earnings were 83 million in the quarter, down from 88 million a year ago.  Results included unfavorable impacts from low interest rates and the market impact on DAC, partially offset by the fee increase on living benefit riders and lower distribution expenses.  For fixed annuities, operating earnings declined to 33 million, reflecting the 17 million from lower spreads and a $14 million unfavorable item from valuation model changes.  ","Turning to protection, pre-tax operating earnings improved year-over-year by 17 million to 109 million.  Results were strong in life and health.  We have favorable life and disability claims experience in the quarter which were somewhat offset by unfavorable long-term care results.  We also released a $9 million life insurance IBNR reserve in the quarter.","Our auto and home business remains strong with policy growth at 7%.  Catastrophe losses were 17 million in the quarter, which was 8 million above our expected levels of claims.  In the period last year, our catastrophe losses were $15 million, which was $11 million above our expected level of claims.  ","Now let\u2019s turn to our balance sheet, which remains very strong.  Our high-quality investment portfolio continues to perform well with only $8 million of impairments in the quarter.  We had minimal European exposure with no holdings of sovereign debt or financial institutions in financially troubled European countries.  Our hedge program remains over 95% effective and greatly reduces the risk associated with our variable annuity business.  We have 2 billion-plus of excess capital and 1.1 billion of free cash across the company.  The life company had an estimated RBC ratio of approximately 525%.","Taking a closer look at capital returned to shareholders, in the quarter we continued to return significant capital to shareholders and have paid out 134% year-to-date.  As of the market close yesterday, our dividend yield was a strong 2.9%.  We repurchased $350 million of common stock and paid $78 million in dividends this quarter.  Going forward, we plan to return the majority of our earnings to shareholders, gradually increasing the mix between dividends and repurchases.","In closing, Ameriprise continues to perform well despite a very challenging revenue environment.  This speaks to the resilience of our business model and our expense management discipline.  Our business mix continues to generate significant free cash flow, which we are returning to shareholders, and our excess capital position gives us enhanced flexibility.","With that, I will open it up to your questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you.  We will now begin the question and answer session.  [Operator instructions]","And at this time, we have a question from Sumeet Kamath from UBS.  Please go ahead.","Sumeet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Thank you and good morning.  I wanted to start with the revised guidance for advice and wealth of 11 to 11.5.  If I go back to last quarter\u2019s conference call, Walter, I think\u2014you know, I was just reading it just now, and the phrase that you were using was definitely achievable.  I think you said it\u2019s not a walk in the park, but certainly the definitely achievable suggested some level of confidence.  Obviously this quarter the margin snapped up pretty nicely, so I guess I\u2019m trying to figure out what exactly has changed in your thinking today versus what you saw in the first quarter, so I\u2019ll start there.","Walter Berman","I think the main thing, if you take at look at why I said it was achievable was because of the expense and the trajectory on the revenue at that time.  Since that time, we\u2019ve seen the market come off and certainly there has been continued impact on the transactional activities.  We still believe it\u2019s achievable \u2013 within the 11 and 11.5 \u2013 and we\u2019re just going to move on through it.  The plans are working, and I think coming off the 12 is not really that big a deal when you\u2019re talking about a situation that\u2019s changed as much as it was when last discussed.  ","Sumeet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay.  I mean, I guess if you just kind of do the math, you\u2019re running at 10.7, I think, first half; so that would put you\u2014to get to sort of 11, 11.5, I think that\u2019d kind of put your second half at around 12.  So it kind of feels like maybe you just can\u2019t overcome the tough first quarter where you were at 9.9.  Is that a reasonable read?","Walter Berman","Yeah, I think your read is right.  I don\u2019t know if I would go as high on second half, but certainly the second half will have an improvement factor.","Sumeet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay.  And just to be clear, this 11 to 11.5 excludes the impact of exiting the bank since you\u2019re going to have the bank for most of this year, so as we think about 2013, sort of the starting point is something like 10.1 to 10.6, and if that\u2019s correct, I\u2019m just wondering what the game plan is to try to get that margin higher, and where do you think it could go as we think about 2013?","Walter Berman","All right, so there is a very marginal impact in \u201912, okay, as it relates to the bank.  It was just taking place in the fourth quarter.  And always incorporated in the \u201912 was the bank, and really it\u2019s a phenomenon of it\u2019s revenue to PTI relationships, which is quite high because of the net revenue calculation of interest less this deposit base expense that you have on the credit.  I think certainly we have, as Jim has said and we have said, we have momentum and we certainly look at the numbers and give guidance as it relates to the positioning; but the business is in good shape.  It is generating good margin, and we certainly have the fundamentals, we feel, in control.  So I\u2019m not prepared to come up with a number right now, but certainly that would have to be factored because that was actually part of it when we actually came up with the 12.","James Cracchiolo","Sumeet, this is Jim.  I think overall if we look at the underlying aspects of the AWM business, nothing actually has changed from even a year ago.  In fact, I would probably say that we\u2019ve been able to manage through even a more difficult market with better margins overall, and I think to the end of the year, we continue to see the improvement on the expense side, as we said.  I think the only real change is that the markets are a bit more volatile.  People are a little more concerned as we go out of the year.  Unemployment is a little higher, so as you would imagine, people are holding a bit more cash.  Transactions are a bit down from what we were running at when things started to show the improvement.","Interest rates, short-term rates from last year have come down.  I mean, it was 10 million just in the first quarter.  There is a bit more in the first quarter, second quarter was 10 million.  That alone is 100 basis points just in the quarter, and year-to-date it\u2019s probably over 100 basis points.  So those are things that, again, we didn\u2019t fully understand some of the impact of that when we chatted in November, and the change from April really is just due to the transaction revenue.  You\u2019re right that we still think that the second half of the year will be closer to the 12 or a bit over, depending on the quarter, depending on activities.  But as we look out, the bank itself has added margin, and when we take that out, it will adjust the overall margin rate.  ","But one of the things that\u2019s very important to understand in that decision was it does free up a lot of capital, and a capital requirement that would have gone up a lot.  And I think as other institutions that have banking business and spread business in their AWM business, it\u2019s going to be a change from where it was where that margin was not as driven by capital-intensive activities, and that will change.  So we think it was the right decision, and so on a margin-adjusted basis, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to have any concerns to continue to make the progress.  Having said that, it does take a certain amount out of the margin base because the earnings in the bank did contribute to that margin.","So I hope that helps clarify, and I think Walter can lay that out in a little more detail as we go forward.","Sumeet Kamath \u2013 UBS","No, that\u2019s helpful.  And again, I agree that the trade-off between a point of margin and sort of capital flexibility in terms of buyback is a trade-off that I would support as well.","Just a quick follow-up on flows \u2013 the past couple quarters, we\u2019ve been hearing about the institutional pipeline at Columbia being very strong and building, and I get some of the moving pieces this quarter in terms of former parent stuff.  But even I back that out of the flows, it kind of looks sort of flattish.  I guess I\u2019m just wondering when are we going to see that institutional pipeline start coming through in terms of turning those outflows into inflows.  Thanks.","James Cracchiolo","Well, as we looked at the pipeline from last year, the pipeline has grown nicely.  Now, I think what has occurred in the pipeline is it\u2019s sort of leveled off based on, again, the market situation over the last quarter or so.  Having said that, it hasn\u2019t fallen, and as we look at the win rates and the percentages, it\u2019s still doing quite well.  Having said that, we do have those redemptions that come in.","Now part of the flow situation on the redemptions are things like the VNR fund and things like that, that are in there, part of the Bank America pension fund activity.  So we had the outflows.  Part of that goes institutional, part retail.  ","I would just say that I think we\u2019re holding our own in this market.  I think we\u2019re getting more of our product out there with a broader, what I would call a line-up of institutions.  But things do take time, in a sense, to get some of the newer categories that we once did not sell into the institutional pipeline.  Having said that, we don\u2019t see any negative, and as I speak to our institutional sales group, they actually feel pretty good about it.  So I think part of it is timing.  Funding rates as well \u2013 I mean, just as in Europe, we were having some good wins institutional, and then some of the funding rates just sort of dry up a little bit or are put on hold.  And so I do believe this environment does affect some of that activity, but I have not received any change from my people as far as what they\u2019re seeing right now.  But the environment does have its effect.","Sumeet Kamath \u2013 UBS","Okay, thank you.","","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question come from Jay Gelb from Barclays.  Please go ahead.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Thanks and good morning.  For the buyback related to the capital release from the bank transition, should we consider that 375 over and above what you would typically do in 2013, i.e. 100% of earnings?","Walter Berman","Actually, okay \u2013 it\u2019s Walter.  Based on current plans, we would intend, as we indicated in the release, that we would offset the impact and that would presume that, again, depending on the circumstances that we would deploy that.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Right, but it would be over and above your typical buyback, correct?  I just wanted to clarify that.","Walter Berman","Yes.  (Talkover), so therefore yes, we would be over and above typical.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay.  And Walter, what gives you confidence in the ability to hit the target margins, particularly in asset and wealth as well as asset management?  What\u2019s the risk of not achieving those?","Walter Berman","Well as Jim said, the key foundation element is we are managing the expenses.  We\u2019ve done that.  We\u2019re going through the conversion, and the conversion expense will start tailing off in the fourth quarter.  And the other reengineering, we\u2019re getting the improvement in the run rate, so we have a solid positioning on that.","The flexibility items or the non-controllable items are the interest rates, as Jim mentioned, which again were at the low point.  If you look back, certainly as we get into the beginning of the year, we thought it would certainly be much higher; and then it\u2019s the transaction, the environment, and the other situation.  So that is\u2014clearly on the controllables, we feel comfortable and we are getting good productivity, and the question is where the markets are and the environment.","Again, in asset management, good control of the expenses.  I think performance is excellent, and we are getting traction on the distribution side.  So for the things we control, we\u2019re managing it and I think we\u2019re getting good positioning.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","Okay.  And then on a separate issue, can you give us a sense of what the standalone return on equity is on the auto and home business?","Walter Berman","Standalone return in the auto\/home business is\u2014","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","So not for the overall protection unit, but\u2014","Walter Berman","It\u2019s around\u2014figure between around 12 and 15%.  And again, remember it\u2019s coming through now and it\u2019s actually\u2014it went through the situation, it improved, and actually on its current trajectory that, I would say, is the low base of it, and it\u2019s on good positioning to the higher middle teens.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from Blostein from Goldman Sachs.  Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, good morning.  Wanted to follow up, Walter, on your comments around the bank and I guess the timing.  So when you think about the freed up capital - $375 million \u2013 and you guys redeploying that into the buyback, I just want to clarify \u2013 that is on top of your kind of normal buyback that you keep doing, and also what do you think is the timing of that?  So, you know, if you guys\u2014is this this year\u2019s event or is it next year\u2019s event?  Are you guys going to kind of spread it around over the next couple of quarters?  How should we think about that.","Walter Berman","Okay, so let me be clear \u2013 it\u2019s our intention beyond the circumstance, it will be over and above.  Again, if you look at\u2014we talked about neutralizing or trying to certainly offset through the purchase\u2014utilization of the capital, the earnings that were lost from the bank, so that would\u2014you should assume\u2014you know, again, we look at the opportunities with the stock and other things of that nature, so we don\u2019t get to any set time frame but certainly we\u2019re trying to be guided by trying to neutralize the impact of the lost profitability associated with the bank.  So on that basis, we gave you the numbers of somewhere between 45 and $50 million pre-tax, and that, you should assume, is spread reasonably equally over the year.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.  And just I guess from the technical perspective, if that does, say, make you use up your buyback authorization sooner, what\u2019s your flexibility on going back to the Board and asking for a bigger buyback?  Is that a quarterly event?  ","Walter Berman","As we start approaching it, we certainly go back and demonstrate to the Board our ability to do that, so we have degrees of flexibility to present to the Board to get additional authorization.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Excellent.  And then shifting gears a little bit to AWM, it sounds like the pipeline of employee advisors is still pretty strong, and we\u2019re seeing that, frankly, across the industry where the wire houses continue to lose some share.  Can you quantify the productivity of advisors that are coming in or the ones that you currently see in the pipeline versus your current book of business?","James Cracchiolo","The average production of the people we\u2019re recruiting over the last few quarters has actually been higher than the recruits that we did even previously, and we are finding that they are coming in with larger books of business.  Now, against our entire system, including the averages of the franchisee system, they\u2019re probably in that realm of productivity.  If we look at the employee system, they\u2019re on average a bit higher because, as you know, we still have some of the legacy novices further developing there.  But we believe that the level that we\u2019re recruiting at now actually will give us a nice productivity lift as we continue to move forward raising the average of the employee system and in line with our franchisee system.","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.  And just a last one from me \u2013 Jim, in the past you talked about the level of frustration with the valuation in the stock.  Is there any strategic options that you guys could potentially consider that would unlock some of the shareholder value?","James Cracchiolo","You know, as I look at the company today, the thing that I would just say right now is I know we\u2019re in a little difficult market, but when I compare the valuation against other companies and I look at the earnings, I look at even the continued growth of those businesses over the last number of years and the profitability, I actually think we are undervalued to a large extent, even if I look at the annuity insurance business, based on the quality of that book and that it\u2019s a proprietary book and system, and the returns that we achieve on that.  ","So listen \u2013 I think over time it\u2019s going to be recognized.  I do believe we are making the right amount of changes, so there is something that you can say as well \u2013 can you take something out of it and sell it, et cetera, and would that change you?  Yes, I think it could, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019d get the right value in this marketplace today, and in some cases it depends on who you sell to, whether you feel as comfortable with what you have in the end because even on the insurance book, you have your obligations out there.","So I actually feel what we\u2019re doing will get us to a much more, what I would call less capital intensive mix over time, and the growth that we are seeing in some of our businesses and the capabilities we\u2019ve put in.  You know, if I look at asset management just as an example, I know we look at some of the flows quarter to quarter; but if you go back two years and look at what we had and what we have today as an asset management business, it\u2019s materially different and the value we achieve there through that acquisition and integration, we have a great platform today \u2013 a wide mix of product, good performance, wider distribution, international and domestic.  And our AWM business, I would match up against anyone in the growth there over the last number of years, and even the margins and profitability.  ","So our annuity business has held up really well.  Our hedging is good.  We don\u2019t have exposure based on how we actually managed that book and hedged it all through its growth, and our protection book is all proprietary and excellent in that regard.  So yeah, we could make some changes, probably not in this environment; but having said that, I think the strategy we have will unlock that value and migrate us to, I think, a bit more of a higher PE business over time.  And as anything else, I think we\u2019re all frustrated a little bit with the market, and so that frustration compounds the activity.  But I feel really good about it, and even though I don\u2019t like this environment, I think it does affect us and I would like the business to show greater levels of growth.  I feel like we\u2019re making, to Walter\u2019s point, what we can do as the controllable to continue to improve the underlying value of the company, and in time maybe it will be recognized.  ","Alex Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it.  Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.  Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks.  First question for Walter \u2013 you had mentioned your Dodd-Frank interpretation in terms of the change in bank capital rules.  When you mention that your assessment of required capital would have gone up a lot from the 375 million, what order of magnitude were you talking about there?  I would assume it would have to be substantial for you to have made this decision.  You know, were you looking at doubling or tripling of required capital, just to give us range, order of magnitude?","And then related to that, can you talk about any potential risks to actually exiting the current structure, or do you expect that you\u2019re going to be able to get this done without any angst?","Walter Berman","","Okay, let me start with the second part.  It\u2019s a big undertaking, but I think we\u2019ve done our planning and I think we had the necessary valuations done and operational capabilities put in place.  We are targeting to do that through\u2014once we get regulatory approval in the fourth quarter, and I think we see everything working as of now and we feel confident that it will take place subject, again, to regulatory approval.","As relates to capital, it\u2019s a fairly fluid situation, so therefore you\u2019re evaluating it but certainly different signaling from it, if you headed to the various Basel conventions and how it would be applied, it would be a substantial capital impact because you were a depository-taking institution on the entire institution.  That was certainly where it seemed like it was leaning, and so therefore we looked at this and started evaluating to put in place and ensure that we can provide the capabilities to our customers and do this in the most effective way, and that\u2019s what has taken place.  But we felt it would be a fairly substantial impact on the other businesses that, in some respects, could make us non-competitive.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it.  And I guess as I think about your advice and wealth management post-this transaction going forward, is it fair to say that right now, you\u2019ve got a little bit of a mix between fee and spread \u2013 mainly fee, but then there\u2019s a spread component.  Are we going to have any spread-based component of earnings left in advice and wealth management post-this transaction?","Walter Berman","Sure we will.  We have the sweep account where there\u2019s $14 billion.  That obviously creates a substantial opportunity for us as the short rates change.  We also have the certificate company which has about $3 billion, $3.5 billion in it.  It\u2019s been with us, actually, more than I can remember \u2013 it got here before I did.  And those are excellent opportunities, and it\u2019s certainly an important product for our customer base.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it.  And Jim, can you comment on just the balance that you\u2019re thinking about right now in terms of capital deployment between the M&A environment, buybacks and dividends?","James Cracchiolo","Yeah, I would say as we left last year, based on what we thought may be some good properties out there, I was probably a bit more enthusiastic on the M&A front.  Based on looking at some of those various properties, et cetera, I\u2019m probably not as enthusiastic, as you can see \u2013 we haven\u2019t really done anything.  And from that perspective, we\u2019ve been picking up the buyback a bit more and raising the dividend; and as Walter said, we\u2019re going to continue to look at the dividend and the buyback mix.  We have over the last six quarters gone from even the idea of what we said about returning roughly all of our earnings, 130% of our earnings, and we\u2019ve sort of picked that up again. ","So at this point in time, I would probably say we\u2019re leaning more in the return to shareholders rather than the acquisition.  I\u2019m not saying that something might not come along that might be good, appropriate for us strategically or of value; but we do have the capital on hand to do that and still maintain a good level of buyback and dividend increases.  So that\u2019s the way I would probably look at it, and again, it\u2019s always a situation that changes a little bit.  But one of the things that we\u2014you know, in this market situation with our stock where it is, it\u2019s a good price.","Tom Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it, thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.  Please go ahead.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thanks very much.  Good morning.  My first question relates to the decision to change the legal format of your financial institution.  I purposely say change the legal format because (audio interference) institution business, you\u2019re changing, as I understand it, the legal entity or the legal nature of it.  So my question is what are the specific businesses that you will be leaving that you would otherwise have been in that will result in this loss of 45 to $50 million pre-tax in earnings?  What won\u2019t you\u2014go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","James Cracchiolo","The only business that we\u2019re leaving is the banking business as a depository institution.  So in the bank, we developed the bank, it was a national chartered bank.  It takes deposits as well as makes loans.  Some of those loans, we kept on balance sheet; some we sold off balance sheet, like mortgages, et cetera.  In that regard, if we maintain that legal entity status, we are a savings and loan holding company under the new regulations, and that causes us to be subject as a legal entity to certain capital requirements that go sometimes beyond what that legal entity itself.  So not only do the capital requirements for the legal entity go up, but it may affect the rest of the institution as well.  And again, the signal coming out in the various capital requirements that you\u2019re starting to see be made public, as we evaluated that fully, we didn\u2019t think it would be appropriate for us to subject the entire entity for the businesses we\u2019re in.  We\u2019d rather have the ability to grow those businesses as they are currently set up.","So the only thing we\u2019re changing is that we\u2019re moving the bank charter to a national trust charter so we can still do trust services.  It won\u2019t have the extra capital requirements per se; it\u2019s just for that business, appropriate.  And it gives us the ability to continue to build the businesses as we have in the past.  And so that\u2019s it \u2013 nothing else has changed.  We\u2019re not leaving any other businesses outside of the banking business.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay. My second question relates to\u2014go ahead, Walter.","Walter Berman","Yeah, I just wanted to say we are still going to be offering the services, it will just be through third parties so the capabilities to our customer base is still there.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Right, I understand.  Thank you.  My second question relates to your outlook for margins in your asset management business.  You\u2019re saying that\u2014I think you said in your prepared remarks and your slides that you anticipate margins for the full year to be consistent with those in the first half of the year.  But of course, and a question \u2013 isn\u2019t that entirely dependent on what happens in the market in the second half of this year?  I mean, it\u2019s still quite early \u2013 we haven\u2019t finished the first month of the third quarter.  I\u2019m trying to understand if you\u2019re telling me that there\u2019s been a modest degradation in the margins from your original expectations that sort of is unlikely to be reversed, irrespective of what happens in the market, or will margins for the full year very much be a function of what the market does in the second half of the year?","Walter Berman","I think, Eric, what we are saying is this \u2013 when we, and to be very fair for you, is when we actually gave you the idea of the margins, we were in a certain market situation with the idea that markets would appreciate, okay?  And so to be very honest, as the first quarter \u2013 and you\u2019ve even asked the questions that said, well, why are you coming off?  What\u2019s changed in your margin outlook?  And so what has changed is the environment a bit more.  Equity markets have come down a lot.  Volatility has affected flows and client activity, and the same thing in the asset management business.  I mean, we run a lot of equity assets, and so with the market depreciating a bit, it does impact that margin.  It goes right to the margin and the bottom line.","So yes, we have adjusted that based on those market conditions.  Also, the effect that those market conditions have on equity flows, I don\u2019t think\u2014again, as we looked at the beginning of the year, I think the whole industry, including us, would say, hey, it looks like equity asset flows are starting to pick up again \u2013 that\u2019s good.  I think you have seen just again in the second quarter that flows have really been in fixed income.  And so that exactly is the reason \u2013 fixed income products don\u2019t have as high margins as equity, even if you do get the flows, and the mix does cause a depreciation if the markets are down against the entire\u2014you know, if we look at the large base of equity assets.","In the AWM business, it really is the client activity coming out and the lower interest rates, and so those are the only two changes.  So even as I look at third quarter, I think we\u2019ll be in similar type of margin ranges, but the fourth quarter we see\u2014if things just continue to hold, the pickup\u2014because as we said, some of the expenses will go away in the systems that will start to boost the margin in again.","So it is very hard to put that as a finite to your point, which is very accurate, that we don\u2019t know the market conditions for the next quarters.  The only thing we can say is based on what we\u2019re seeing today, we hope they will get better; but if they don\u2019t, we are just trying to give you a little better of what that would mean.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","And I guess just one final point that just came into my head that I wanted to ask you \u2013 would it be right to say that margins in the asset management business in the third quarter are really not independent of margin activity in the second quarter, that the quarters are linked in the sense that if you start from a lower\u2014if you start the third quarter from a lower base than you had anticipated because the second quarter was poor, that\u2019s going to influence third quarter margins.  Am I thinking about the economics and the relationship between the quarters correctly?","James Cracchiolo","Absolutely, because your asset base starts at a lower level and therefore your fees start to be booked consistently from that.  It just doesn\u2019t get booked at the end of the quarter wherever the market ends.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Once again, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please press star then one on your touchtone phone.  And at this time, we have a question from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.  Please go ahead.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Hi, good morning.  I want to follow up a little bit on the asset management margin, and I\u2019m going to use the GAAP margin that I guess in the first half of the year is slightly over 18%.  I\u2019m just thinking about that margin versus, for instance, the margin on a core basis ex-some of the one-timers in 2011, which I think was about 18.8%.  You know, the market\u2019s up on average about 6% in the first half of this year \u2013 the equity market \u2013 versus the full year last year, and your average assets are up about 2% in the first half of this year versus the full year last year, yet your margin is down about 70 basis points and it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s going to get much higher from there.  So I guess I\u2019m sort of struggling with the same thing Eric is in that I\u2019m just trying to understand where the scale benefits are here and the integration saves.  I don\u2019t\u2014I\u2019m struggling with that.","Walter Berman","Okay.  It\u2019s Walter.  Let me start with certainly if you use the S&P, you would say that the market is up 3% on average for the half a year, but unfortunately our asset base isn\u2019t really geared to the S&P exclusively, so we use a weighted equity index and that is actually down.  That\u2019s down 1%, so I think that is part of your delta situation that you have from that standpoint, and that is putting pressure on the margins because you have also had to shift, as Jim said, from equities to fixed, which is there.  And as we also mentioned, this is the first quarter we have the impact of the 529 plan from New York.","So we do believe we\u2019re tracking, and expense reengineering and revenue reengineering will be coming through, so we think we are on track.  Certainly the market has been problematic, the mix has been problematic from that standpoint, so we think it\u2019s understandable and we are able to calibrate, and we feel we\u2019re tracking within our expectations.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  And then just\u2014I\u2019m not sure if you addressed this earlier, and maybe the answer is none, but just a quick question on\u2014so it sounds like all of the previously highlighted one-time type large outflows have now taken place, with maybe some remaining from Balboa.  I\u2019m just wondering\u2014is that correct?","Walter Berman","That is correct.  There\u2019s about 1.5 billion left on Balboa.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay, and just the question is, is there any new sizeable or one-time type mandates that you\u2019ve either won or lost?  I know you mentioned South Carolina\u2019s 529 plan, but anything else to think about as we look forward?","Walter Berman","Again, there has been\u2014certainly some of the mandates being funded are less, and nothing that I would say is sizeable at this stage.  But because the market has certainly impacted the level that we had, certainly Middle East mandates come in at a lesser level, and there have been some\u2014there are certainly outflows.  But the issue is at this stage, we\u2019re just tracking it.  ","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Okay.  All right, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  This concludes the time that we have for our question and answer session.  I will now turn the call back to Jim Cracchiolo for closing remarks.","James Cracchiolo","Thank you.  First of all, we appreciate you listening in this morning as well as for your questions.  If there are any other follow-up questions or information that you need, please contact Alicia and Chad and they\u2019ll walk you through or give you some additional information that will help you.","As I said\u2014listen, we\u2019re in a fluid situation with the markets, et cetera.  Having said that, I think we\u2019re in a good situation in the underlying business.  I can\u2019t with accuracy predict quarter to quarter, and that\u2019s not my job.  What is my job is to continue to, with my team, keep navigating the environment in a good, strong way, which I think we have been over the last number of years, and we feel good about our ability to do that.  We do see\u2014even though it\u2019s not as apparent, we do see good progress being made in each of the businesses.  We would like to see the flows in the asset management business improve, but I do believe part of it is getting over the hump with the integration, which we have now.  We will still experience some challenges \u2013 ins and outs with the flows.  We run a very large business with a number of different venues, but having said that, I think we\u2019re gaining some underlying traction.  I think it\u2019s feeling positive in that sense and we\u2019ve got a solid core now from which we can build.","And in regard to our other businesses, I do believe in this environment there\u2019s always concern, particularly around some of the protection-type businesses, but I would say to you that we feel very confident and comfortable with the businesses we have, with the books that we put on, with the client behavior that we have; and we feel particularly based on our capital position and hedging and strategy that we\u2019re in good shape.","So thank you and we\u2019ll continue to keep our focus, and if there\u2019s anything else that you may need to know, please contact us.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials that are available on our website.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2014 annual report to shareholders and our 2014 10-K report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I will turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Third Quarter Earnings Call. This morning, I will provide my perspective on the quarter and Walter will follow to discuss our financials.","Ameriprise delivered solid results in what was, as you know, a tougher operating environment. Volatility spiked across global markets. Equity markets dropped in the quarter and currency translation was a headwind as well as the ongoing pressure of low interest rates. Across the firm, we focused on executing our consistent strategy and managing expenses as we invest in the business and navigate these conditions.","Because of our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow, we are able to return to shareholders at a significant level while maintaining an excellent capital position. For the quarter, operating earnings per share increased 12% and that includes some moving pieces that Walter will address.","In terms of return on equity, we continue to deliver at a differentiated level. Operating ROE increased to 24%, which is one of the best in the industry. This is up nearly 200 basis points from last year and marks another record high for us. Assets under management and administration were down to $766 billion, as good Ameriprise retail client flows were muted by the market impacts I've discussed in outflows and asset management.","Let's move to the businesses. In Advice & Wealth Management, even with markets depreciating, our financial results and metrics remain strong. Clearly, the market dynamic was difficult in the quarter and asset levels were essentially flat at $433 billion. That said, in a volatile market environment, our Advice value proposition shines. Our advisors are using this opportunity to get in front of clients and reinforce the value of financial planning and advice across market cycles. It's in this type of environment that people really need their financial advisor to help them remain calm and focused on longer-term goals.","Overall, we have strong client inflows, and of those inflows just under $3 billion went into Wrap products, which is quite good in this environment. Our investment advisory platform is one of the largest in the industry and a consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. While this was down a bit from the second quarter, we did see a pickup in clients' cash positions given the volatility. I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. I've spent a lot of time recently with our TAP advisors, and they're pleased with the support from the company and the ability they have at Ameriprise to build even more productive practices.","During the quarter, we increased our advisor count. In fact, this was one of our best quarters for recruiting. We had 95 new experienced advisors moving their practices to Ameriprise, with strong average productivity per recruit across employee and franchise channels. Looking forward, our pipeline remains strong, as more advisors recognize the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition.","We're also pleased to welcome more than 50 JHS advisors to Ameriprise, as we completed that acquisition in the quarter. In terms of our focus on growth, as we shared previously, we continue to seek to serve more of the mass affluent and affluent clients and see opportunity in two areas: Consumers who are accumulating assets and those who are transitioning to retirement.","I believe our firm and advisors are well positioned to help clients and prospects in every stage of their lives. During the quarter, we launched an extension of our successful Confident Retirement approach for those who are still building their wealth. Wealth builders, as we call them, represent more than half of our target market. Consumers with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets. They value our financial planning relationship, so this is a real opportunity for us going forward as we introduce it to our entire field force over the coming months.","In a recent external study showed that 89% of generation X, 92% of baby boomers and 87% of millennials surveyed want to work with an advisor who will meet them personally. This research reinforces the growth opportunity we have as people continue to value working with a financial advisor. And the importance of that human perspective for saving, investing and retirement planning.","Helping advisors serve client needs, deliver strong service and operate efficiently has always been a priority. And we continue to get good uptake from the advisor capabilities we're investing in. At the end of the quarter, we launched a new mobile capability that integrates functionality from our highest-use advisor capabilities into one simplified experience that's accessible on any type of device. We're seeing good initial results. It's freeing up advisors' time to focus on serving their existing clients more comprehensively.","In September, we unveiled the next evolution of our story to the U.S. marketplace with our new Be Brilliant brand and advertising platform. It illustrates the benefits of working with Ameriprise advisors and how comprehensive financial planning and the right advisor can help people achieve their personal goals today and in retirement. The campaign tests very well with our target market, and our advisors are taking great pride in the ads, as they bring to life what they do every day on behalf of their clients. We're working closely with the field to take advantage of the campaign in their local markets.","As a result of our efforts, our advisors continue to grow productivity, which increased 6% year-over-year to a new record of $514,000 over a 12-month basis. This resulted in solid revenue and profitability growth in the quarter. Therefore, on a relative basis, considering the significant market pullback and volatility in the quarter, the business performed strongly.","Let me now turn to Annuities and Protection. I'll focus more on the underlying business, and Walter will cover the financials, including the impact of unlocking.","In terms of Annuities, we continue to see nice sales from the introduction of new living benefit riders earlier in the year as well as products without living benefits. New sales within our channel look good, which has helped offset some of the pressure from lower-equity markets on account balances. And there's no real change in the fixed annuity trajectory given where we are with rates.","In Protection, Life & Health, insurance sales remain muted overall, and while Life claims were higher, we do expect it to normalize. We have a good book built to serve Ameriprise clients and planning relationships. Around the business, we are focusing on supporting our advisors to serve clients' protection needs. We continue to see more of an interest in our IUL products than VUL, and I expect that will continue in the near term, given the market volatility we're experiencing.","We recognize that the volatile market environment creates challenges for these longer-term products, but at the same time this environment reinforces the importance of guaranteed retirement income and protecting what matters most to clients.","In Auto & Home, we experienced higher collisions, in part due to the increase in the number of miles driven, as others in the industry have noted. We continue to invest in our capabilities as we adjust pricing, tighten underwriting as well as improve claims management. This work has begun to take hold, but it takes time for these enhancements to work through the book. As we said last quarter, we do expect to see some benefits next year and beyond.","The enhancements we're making are to restore the business to its historic performance. In terms of our client experience, we continue to maintain strong client satisfaction and retention. Auto & Home has a good client base and good distribution.","Now let's move to Asset Management. This was clearly a tougher quarter in terms of assets under management. The market environment I've discussed was particularly difficult, with foreign exchange driving a large piece of the assets under management decline. In addition, we had outflows from two large clients in strong performing funds where asset allocation or geopolitical and liquidity concerns drove their decision to sell. As we finish the year, we're likely to see some additional pressure here.","Outflows in low-fee former parent affiliated assets this quarter were elevated. In terms of fourth quarter, we expect these will continue with additional outflows in low-fee collective trust funds, given U.S. Trust's decision to manage some of these fixed income products in-house.","In terms of Acorn, outflows have persisted, and while investment performance has improved year-to-date from the enhancements we put in place, in the near-term we expect that outflows may continue.","In terms of underlying flows, the market dropped in August and September and related volatility dampened retail activity globally. With regard to U.S. retail, our gross sales were up compared to last year. We have some improvements in sales share over the last few quarters and our wholesaling productivity has improved reflecting the steps we've taken to better align our sales strategy.","In Europe, retail also slowed, but we feel good about our positioning, and flows could turn as conditions improve and clients become more comfortable. Overall, our investment teams are generating strong performance across equities and fixed income and in solutions. The volatility is helping to demonstrate the benefits of active management.","We have added new talent to our sales leadership in both the U.S. retail market and U.K. institutional, complementing the teams in place. We also continue to strengthen our retail product line, including the recent launch of the Colombia global unconstrained bond fund.","In Institutional, we were impacted by the client moves we discussed. That said, we are building on the business. We have good strategies with competitive track records in both the traditional and solutions space, and aligned sales in a service organization. Our pipeline remains strong as we look to the end of the year.","In terms of financials, we continue to deliver solid earnings given our ongoing commitment to effective expense management as we focus on executing our strategy and delivering for our clients.","From the perspective of the overall company, we're consistently generating an excellent return. Our balance sheet and capital position are strong, and our investment portfolio remains high quality. That allows us to return more to shareholders, and on a year-to-date basis we've increased our buyback significantly. And combined with our dividend, we have returned $1.6 billion this year alone.","Our capital position also provides flexibility as we look to drive organic growth and consider inorganic opportunities in both Wealth Management and Asset Management. To that end, earlier this month, we officially marked our 10-year anniversary as an independent publicly-traded company. As I reflect on the last decade, we successfully executed one of the largest spinoffs in U.S. history. We navigated the financial crisis better than most, and that was without government support.","Ameriprise emerged stronger because we had our own financial plan in place, made good decisions, and managed risk well. We stood by our clients, delivered appropriate products and solutions to satisfy their long-term goals. At the same time, we invested in our business and the right capabilities and set the stage for our future.","Ten years in, Ameriprise is one of the strongest financial services firms in the business. When we look at our brand and reputation, it is one of the best in financial services. I believe, over that time, we've earned an excellent track record of growth and return and for making thoughtful decisions in the interest of our clients, advisors, employees and shareholders. Though markets have recently become more challenging, we remain focused on navigating the environment while we look to continue to generate good returns over time.","With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter to review the numbers.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial results in a volatile market environment. The S&P 500 had substantial volatility in the quarter, ranging from 1,868 to 2,128 and VIX ranged from a low of 12 to a high of 41. In the quarter, we generated operating net revenue of $2.9 billion, down 1% from last year and down 4% sequentially. This was obviously driven by the impact of market movement in the quarter on asset levels and the associated fee generation.","Assets under management administration was $766 billion, a 4% decline year-over-year with a more pronounced 7% decline in asset management, where geopolitical concerns, equity markets and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced asset level and fee-based revenue.","Our top-line growth was impacted by the environment. We continue to manage expenses tightly and use lower valuation levels to repurchase additional shares in the quarter. And we benefited from effective tax planning. These actions drove strong 12% growth in EPS, and resulted in achieving a new record return on equity in the quarter of 24%, up almost 200 basis points year-over-year.","Let's look more closely at capital on page four. Our ability to return capital to shareholders at this level reflects our strong balance sheet fundamentals. Our investment portfolio is well diversified and low risk. Our hedge program is effective. Our risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be over 625%, and we have approximately $2.5 billion of excess capital.","Given the share price in the quarter and our current valuation, we accelerated the level of share repurchase. We returned $571 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, which is our highest quarterly level. This equates to 133% of operating earnings. We are confident in our continued ability to generate free cash flow, return capital to shareholders and bring down our excess capital prudently over time.","Turning to segment performance, starting with AWM on slide five. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well across all dimensions to deliver solid financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.2 billion in the quarter, up 3% from last year and down 2% sequentially. Our revenue growth slowed due to the impact of market movement on asset levels and its associated fee generation, but still compares favorably to others in the industry. Wrap net flows were good at $3 billion, despite the deterioration in the markets.","While total expenses increased 2% year-over-year, it was driven by higher distribution expense. G&A expenses improved 1% year-over-year while still investing in key business growth initiatives, including more productive experience advisor recruits, advisory platform product expansion, and investments to improve the ease of doing business for advisors and clients.","This resulted in earnings of $219 million, up 7% and a record high-margin of 17.6%. Results were achieved without the benefits of increasing short interest rates. We have $21 billion of brokerage cash balances that earned 23 basis points in the quarter. This is a substantial upside opportunity when rates rise.","Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings as you will see on slide six. As I previously discussed, both equity marks and foreign exchange translation impacted asset levels in the quarter. Combined with elevated net outflows due to geopolitical concerns and the timing and performance fees, it resulted in a 7% decline and operating net revenue to $782 million.","We remain committed to managing expenses tightly, with G&A down 3%. Pre-tax operating earnings were $180 million down 13% from last year. Again, this represents the low markets and timing of performance fees.","Let's turn to slide seven. Before I focus on the underlying business results and Annuities and Protection, I want to review the annual unlocking completed this quarter. Overall, unlocking provided a $42 million favorable impact. Variable annuities had a $64 million of favorable unlocking this year. While continued low interest rates negatively impacted our unlocking, it was more than offset by favorable net persistency, withdrawal utilization and model updates. Fixed annuity unlocking was only a $2 million favorable impact. The benefit of clients' lapsing was largely offset by the impact of continued low rates. For insurance, the primary driver of $24 million unfavorable unlocking was low interest rates.","In long-term care, we conducted the gross premium valuation and did not have loss recognition despite low interest rates. While low interest rates impacted the assessment negatively, we have received approval of more premium increases than we had anticipated, and the benefit of these future rate increases more than offset the impact from low interest rates.","Turning to Annuities on slide eight. I will focus on underlying results that exclude the impact from unlocking and mean reversion. Underlying variable annuity pre-tax earnings declined $3 million from a year ago to $116 million. This decline was driven by lower account values from markets and from the runoff of the closed-block distributed through third parties. Underlying fixed annuity pre-tax earnings declined $23 million due to elevated lapses of the blocks running off as it comes out of the surrender charge period. Given the current interest environment, there are limited new sales and as a result, this book is expected to gradually run-off and earnings will trend down.","Turning to Protection on the next slide. I will focus on underlying earnings. Protection pre-tax operating earnings were $49 million in the quarter, excluding the unusual items noted for the quarter. This is down $38 million from last year with the impact essentially split between our Life and Health business and our Auto & Home business.","Let's focus on Life and Health first. Underlying pre-tax operating earnings were impacted by higher claims activity and the lower-interest rate environment. Life claims were elevated in the quarter as we had four large, later duration VUL claims that had a much higher retention level than our more recent policy years. Year-over-year, gross claims increased $19 million compared to a very favorable quarter a year ago. As you can see, we did not see a corresponding increase in the benefit from reinsurance.","The Auto & Home business generated a pre-tax operating loss in the quarter. First, we experienced deterioration in collision results from an increase in miles driven and lower salvage values which is consistent with many in the industry. Second, we had a loss associated with Travel Accident program, a small program we piloted, but did not meet our profitability targets. Therefore, we are in the process of exiting this business. Third, we had some prior year CAT development associated with hailstorms from last year. Finally, we had higher expenses this year as we continue to enhance our operation and staffing levels.","The operational improvements we have made this year are beginning to show across our product lines of event collision. Unfortunately, that has been masked by some of the unusual items in the quarter. Our activities are on-track and we anticipate marked improvement next year.","To wrap, Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial results despite some revenue pressure related to market volatility. We will continue to actively manage the levers within our control like expenses, balance sheet strength, and capital return to drive consistent, solid financial performance.","With that, I will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question is from Suneet Kamath with UBS Financial.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with asset management. Jim, in your color around the flow picture, it seems to me to suggest that there's probably not going to be a turn in 4Q from some of the trends that affected you in 3Q. So my question is, do you think that 4Q flows could actually be worse than what we saw in third quarter?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, I think as we look at the fourth quarter, I don't think from sort of the core businesses that that will be the case. On the other side, we know that there's a level of volatility in August and September, and we know that that may continue depending on markets. So we wanted to be clear, particularly in the institutional space, that's a little lumpy. The only area, as I highlighted in my opening remarks, was around one of the ex-parent activities and some of the low-fee as they take a bit of that portfolio back in-house. But we were planning on that and it is very low revenue to us. But that's the only thing that probably would be higher in the area that we highlighted in the ex-parent activities. But from the retail and institutional, I don't see that at this point in time but, again, I don't know how the rest of the year will go in volatility.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then Walter \u2013 sorry, go ahead.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. That was it.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Sorry. So then, Walter, you had mentioned that performance fees were lower in the quarter. I think you said it was $10 million in the year ago and less than a million this quarter but that some of it was related to timing. Any sense, based on what you know today, of what that could look like next quarter?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we'll see \u2013 normally at fourth quarter is higher \u2013 but I think we will see that it will shift into the fourth quarter and basically on the year where it's within our targeted ranges.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","And what are those targeted ranges?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me say it's tough to \u2013 but now fourth quarter is basically the $10 million that we talked about should be able to flow through. And so it will not be a variance factor except for that $10 million. And we anticipate that the normal performance fees that we have last year and this year will be in the ranges that won't be of course a variance of that like it did in this quarter.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just lastly, on the capital, I fully acknowledge the move from $425 million buyback to $450 million, but given where the stock is, which I think is lower today than where you bought back stock in the third quarter, and the excess capital position remains at roughly $2.5 billion, why can't that quarterly run rate of buyback be in excess of $500 million on a quarterly basis?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it could, but as we demonstrated, as we feel the stock is undervalued, looking at our \u2013 that we have purchased 133% of our basically earnings. So we are evaluating that and looking at it, but certainly we are \u2013 we talk about our range as 90% to 100%, but we've demonstrated as we see the circumstances \u2013 the opportunity that we will buy up. I don't know if we'll go to $500 million, but certainly we have the capacity to do that and we will evaluate it. But I would imagine you should expect it would be higher than 90% if the current situation continues.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. I think \u2013 I think you should take the buyback up over $500 million, sell Auto & Home and your stock price will be higher than $111. Thanks.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Okay. So thanks. I wrote that down.","Operator","The next question is from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. I wanted to start with a question on the advisor hires. It seems like the last two quarters you may be turned a corner there and we're certainly seeing some momentum. Can you maybe talk about what \u2013 has there been any shift in terms of your recruiting strategy, or the efforts or what's leading to the higher advisor recruiting levels?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, first of all, we are bringing in what we think is a good core of new advisors to the firm, has very good productivity. And I think will fit in nicely based on the value proposition that we have and what their interests are to grow their productivity. And I think it's really over the course of the last year that we've been able to better get out there in the market and tell our story. That \u2013 it always takes time to sort of build that sort of pipeline in relationships. And I think people are more interested as they learn more about Ameriprise. And so, I think it's been a more consistent sort of ramp-up that we've had and the pipeline still looks very good. So we feel good about that. We're seeing good people. And it's all about what makes sense for them. And if it fits with what we're looking to accomplish, then it becomes a win-win.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then one follow-up, asset management clearly is coming under pressure, but that also means that valuations for such franchises have compressed as well. I'm just curious as you talk about capital deployment and your thoughts about the future, clearly you've been quite disciplined in terms of deals in the past. Do you see a pipeline today? Is it more robust? Do you see more opportunities or more serious opportunities from your perspective as you potentially look for deals in asset management?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I do believe that there is a bit more of a reconciliation of people evaluating what the alternatives are. I think there's also an understanding of what would be more of appropriate pricing as we go forward, and I do believe there'll be more opportunities that come about over the next number of quarters. So, if something interesting does fit the bill, and it strategically makes sense for us and it would be a good complementary, as I said, and Walter said, that we do have the cash on hand and the capital ability to do that and we would be very open to exploring those opportunities. But as you also said, we're also very disciplined and it has to be appropriate and make sense to get us a little further down the road than where we are.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And could you remind us in that space what would be a good strategic fit from your perspective?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, we're continuing to look at building out some of our product set around alternatives and solutions and there may be some core product that would be complementary on the global platforms that we have. We're also looking to further expand some of our distribution capabilities \u2013 as we continue to build out our global activities. So again, I think it would \u2013 there are a number of things that would fit the bill or can increase our ability to grow even more formally in some of the channels that we're in. So I don't think it's just one thing that we're looking for per se, but there may be other \u2013 a broader set of opportunities that would work for us.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Can you update us on your strategy to accelerate the growth in Colombia's retail channel? I mean, obviously it's a tough environment, but are you seeing progress in terms of getting on distribution platforms or establishing performance track records for new funds or maybe some other initiatives that give you confidence that flows can turn. And if and when we see a pickup in retail demand?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So I did mention that we are seeing some good traction. I think it's hard to see overall because you get some \u2013 we've had some additional redemptions in things like the Acorn Fund, et cetera, but overall our sales activity as we look at external benchmarks like Market Metrics, et cetera, shows that our market share and some of the major channels that we're doing business in some of the major intermediaries has actually improved. And so that does mean that we're able to expand a bit more.","Now that takes time and it does take that you get more fully onto those platforms and the relationships form, but I think we now are making some good progress. We have plans. We just brought in some additional strong leadership in both the platform business over the last year. We brought in a strong leader overall for the intermediary channel. We just added a new leader to run our wholesaling activities. We have adjusted how we go to market, working between the product and the marketing groups and be able to tell our story a lot better. We're also putting out new advertising in the marketplace that we'll be launching shortly. We've been a little quiet there as we've worked on a new brand, the Colombia Threadneedle.","And so, we feel pretty good that we can continue to gain traction. But again, it doesn't come overnight and it does get impacted and influenced based on what's happening in the volatility of the markets, but we have some really good products, like a strategic income fund that really suits what the client and the advisor are looking for right now. So we do believe that we can actually take more space and we have a good group of leadership and people focused on doing that. So that's really what I can say at this point.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And just quickly on PNC, do the emerging trends you're seeing in auto claims change your view at all as to how much rate is needed and should we anticipate that it will take longer than initially expected to get back to target margin levels?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","This is Walter. Obviously, the collision and the impact on the \u2013 which was driven by certainly the drop in salvage voucher which was quite substantial and the frequency of people driving has and we will reflect that, but the other actions that we are taking are, I think are in place but we're going to have to supplement that.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Berg with RBC. Please go ahead.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks very much. First, in the asset management area, Jim, I'm hoping you can build on your comments, your prepared comments that there's been a change in strategy or outlook at U.S. Trust. This is \u2013 I believe this is your \u2013 the specifics behind your reference to the former parent company relationships. What has been the nature of the change and sort of how long will it last \u2013 how long will the effect last beyond the December quarter?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So what we were saying, first of all, we have a very good strong relationship with U.S. Trust, multiple dimensions, particularly strong in our fund family, et cetera. And that really hasn't changed. I think what I did mention is, you know, they go through their portfolio allocations, et cetera, they're dealing themselves and where their flow should go. They're a bit more into how they're looking at their overall lineup. But this is a really -- regarding some of their collected trust areas for some of their clients and fixed income. And they feel that some of those things they can manage in-house and they're looking to do some of that. Now again, it's a low-fee business. It's something that they think its suited for, at this stage, for them. And so you know, we probably will see a continued outflow from that area but nothing fundamental around the larger relationship has changed.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Next, with respect to the international institutional business where you've had clients outside the United States withdrawing funds for what you call geopolitical reasons. Can you build on what you mean by geopolitical reasons? Are we talking about the collapse in the price of oil and the effect that that has had on certain sovereign wealth funds or something else?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there are two things just in broad terms, okay? So as you've seen, there's a move away from some of the emerging market and Asians that we have some good portfolios in that some clients reallocate right now from. The second area is definitely around the price of commodities and other things that have occurred that may affect some of the investments from clients. You've read about that sort of more globally. But it's nothing particularly to Ameriprise. It's nothing against the performance. And in fact, people just need to raise some once in a while, some liquidity.","So we think over time that will settle and actually things will come back into some of those areas because it wasn't a performance issue for where they're pulling some money right now. So \u2013 and we're probably affected less than some others out there.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Last question. I understand that there is no new fiduciary rule so you can't react to it. I'm not going to ask you to do that. But I would think that you would be doing preparation for the possibility, possibility, not the certainty, that the IRA rollover business could become a lot more difficult to get done in the future than it has in the past. Would that be a right conclusion to reach, or just what sort of preparation are you doing for possible changes? Thanks.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think, Eric, as you do understand us here at Ameriprise, you know that we always do our planning and we always look at what may happen. And so, I do have my teams geared up. We look at everything that has come out from the department. We look at what \u2013 based on all the comments and what the department has already said that they need to look at, or possibly change. And we're already gearing up to see what that looks like and what it takes to make those adjustments and already have things underway.","I would be very clear as I've actually even outlined in my opening remarks, whether they're millennials that people sometimes think they just want to work with a Robo or they just want to be self-administered. We clearly know that they want advice. We clearly know that the populations that we're talking to want to work with an advisor. And we have the best, one of the best advisor forces out there. Our satisfaction is very strong. They like what we have to offer.","So, again, I know the department will come up with something. We know that we want to work in the best interest. There's no argument for us on that. We'll see as they make adjustments to their rule that it's more rational. You can work with people on a reasonable basis with reasonable compensation and try to satisfy their needs consistent with what FINRA and the SEC already look at and regulate.","So \u2013 but yeah, we are planning for it and we are already looking at things of what may come about from whether it's disclosure or how you operate or a compensation. But again, I think Ameriprise and what we offer is really the key. And I think if people weren't satisfied today, you wouldn't have those strong personal relationships that we have. But they really want personal advisors and they really want the biggest thing they want help on is their retirement.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Your next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, guys. Good morning. Back to the M&A discussion for a second. Jim, any sense, and I guess, when you're talking about opportunities to deploy capital and inorganic growth, any sense on which way you guys are leaning towards more in the broker side of things. So similar type of deals we saw you guys do earlier this quarter or last quarter or more on the asset management. Just kind of try to see given your kind of alluded comments on improvement pipeline and deal flow, which way does that pipeline skew?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think, Alex, it doesn't have to be an either\/or for us. We have the means and the ability to do both. We have the experience to do both and the operating infrastructure to do both. So, as an example, if there are things that fit in for us in the broker dealer side that would complement the good recruiting we're doing, we're open to entertain that. We have the ability to do that. We do look at things that come along. And the same thing on the asset management side.","It hasn't been that we haven't kicked the tires on a number of things, but whether it's because of a combination of factors, operating factors, people factors, or just the value that people are attributing to some things, we would have passed them that might have passed on some of the things and that really explore them to that depth. But I think if those things come along again in that light, we have the ability to do both.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. And then on AWM operating leverage and margins, clearly super strong results with continued margins here, hanging in at record levels. As you guys look out and think about a more challenging equity market drop, let's say in a flattish equity tape, how much more operating leverage can we still see from just organic initiatives without the help from the market? Just trying to get at the sensitivity in the model.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think \u2013 as I think about that, it's \u2013 what I would say is that if markets just flatten, it depends on how they flatten in the level of volatility and how that affects client activity. So it's hard to say it's just like driven based on the market, but as you saw in the third quarter, markets actually depreciated. So we still had good client inflows in. We had cash balances built, but we still put money to work for our clients and in our wrap businesses.","So it's hard to predict exactly what the circumstances are. What I would just say is we're operating at pretty good margins. We continue to see productivity lifts from what we've invested in. But having said that, with flat markets or lower client activity, it depends on what that looks like of whether the margins would accrete from there or stay more consistent. I think I would probably put it in that sort of vantage point that says stay more consistent at this point in time.","We are, again, at one point the Fed will raise interest rates if the economy continues to improve or even maintain at this growth rate. I mean it's hard to see why you're at a 0 interest rate with even a 2% growth rate in the economy. So I think at one point that may kick in that will offset what happens with the equity market pressure.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. I hear you there. And, Walter, just real quick on seasonality in AWM, should we still expect a similar type of kind of a pickup in G&A in the fourth quarter like we've seen in prior years?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I'm sorry. Say that again? I didn't pick up the first part of it.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry. The seasonality in expenses in AWM, should we expect to see similar pick up in the fourth quarter in G&A like we've seen it in prior years? I think there's some things around market and things like that.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you'll see a normal pattern. But certainly, the expense will remain controlled as we've demonstrated in the first three quarters.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Awesome. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. First question on what drove the big increase in RBC this quarter from the 560% last quarter to 625%? Was that favorable annuity hedging or what was driving that?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. That is mostly variable annuity hedging and the value of it going up. Yes. That was exactly correct.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then just given the level of increase there, Walter, why wouldn't your excess capital have grown to north of $2.5 billion? Is it holding more RBC for VA?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, it's actually \u2013 it is the continued buyback that we did in exceeding the level of our earnings. So there is an element within that, and so the net net effect is it has been in the range that we've reported last quarter.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So bigger drawdown of HoldCo cash offset by an increase in RBC. Is that the right way to think about it?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it's in it \u2013 yes \u2013 because RBC comes into our calculation. We look at the overall excess. Certain things we discount a little bit as we talk about but it is basically \u2013 we're feeling very good about the requirement. And we have used more cash, too, for buyback.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Just shifting gears to M&A. Jim, your earlier response, you mentioned, I believe, products on the asset management side as being some \u2013 I think that was the first thing you responded to when asked about M&A, which suggests to me more asset management is of interest. Can you talk about, would you be interested in doing another pretty sizeable deal or would it just \u2013 would it be something smaller to expand product instead of a large AUM-type deal?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So what I would probably say is that we would look for deals that would be incremental to what we've established would be our primary. It doesn't rule out something else that may be out there or come along if it made strategic sense, or if it really was complementary that was on a larger scale. But as we think about just the climate and things that come up in the normal course of the year, we think that you can easily, more easily execute more of the smaller, strategic, complementary type things in product and distribution and that would be always the first thing. But if something came along that made sense larger, and it truly fit with us, there's something we could evaluate but that's not sort of our starting point.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful. Then next question on your response to the AWM margins trajectory, I presume that doesn't include any increased costs that you would expect if the most likely deal while fiduciary standards proposal goes through; or even if you consider a range of outcomes from that proposal. Is that the right way to think about it? My point being that if we're in a flattish type market without significant revenue growth, I assume there's going to be incremental costs coming from this new standard.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think \u2013 it's Walter \u2013 I think it's a reasonable assumption. Again, we've demonstrated in the past just looking at these sorts of investments that we could have the flexibility to mitigate some of that within the re-engineering base that we look at the business. But certainly, it's a reasonable assumption that it's not included. We're certainly scenario-ing it, but that's it.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then just one other quick one. The higher frequency in Auto that you mentioned this quarter, did that get worse versus 2Q, 1Q, or is that an elevated frequency level you've been seeing throughout the year?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the Auto, I think it's something that is been building and we've been observing it and looking at it and again, trying to \u2013 watching certainly in the industry coming back on the Auto. But it's been more of a building element that we've been evaluating than reflecting.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And if I could just sneak in one last one on long-term care. I know you had the favorable actuarial review, but on a core basis, you still lost money in the business this quarter. If you continue to lose money, is there still risk of a balance sheet charge here if you fast forward to next year? Or do you feel you've got enough flexibility and cushion where we can start to take that off the table as a serious risk?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Based on what we're seeing with the price increase is the overall element and certainly the way we \u2013 you do know we've exacerbated a little because we've been pretty prudent on our investment strategy and other things at that standpoint but I think you can take it off the table.","Thomas George Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from John Nadel with Piper Jaffray.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, everybody. I've got a couple. If I can just ask maybe a quick housekeeping one first. I think in the past, Walter, I don't know if it's been every quarter, but you have broken out the margin from the franchisee versus the employee channel for us, and I was wondering if you could do the same for third quarter?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, basically, the streamline has continued as we talked about it. Certainly, from that standpoint we've seen improvement within it. We're also seeing from that standpoint, we are comfortable with the development that's both taking place in the employee channel and with the franchise channel. I don't know if we've official broken it out but we just \u2013 I don't have the number in front of me but it certainly trend line wise, it's \u2013 we're feeling comfortable with it.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. So would it be fair to say that the gap between the two is still closing?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, if you take quarterly the answer is certainly directionally it is closing.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then I have a question on variable annuities and their relationship to Advice & Wealth Management revenues. I mean, so really nice, nice growth in sales on a year-over-year basis. I think it was 11%. And I'm sure that had to help the revenues in Advice & Wealth Management channel. I guess the question is do you think you're seeing any advisors hold back on VA sales into qualified accounts given any anticipation of some changes there? Or would you say it remains business as usual until a finalized rule is enacted?","And then also related to that, I know I'm getting a little long-winded here, but perhaps you could give us a sense for approximately what percentage of Advice & Wealth Management revenues are being driven by VA sales into qualified accounts? I've estimated it's about 5% of revenues but I'm wondering whether you think that's in the ballpark.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","First thing I would say is I do not believe that there is any hold back. It's an important solution set within it. And certainly we offer the product. And I think from our standpoint, it's been more of a business as usual. Again, as the percentage, I don't really have that in front of me. It is certainly an important part of the element, but I think you consider it relatively small, so whether it's 5 or where your range is, it's a relatively small.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","It's relatively small. Okay. And then just one other housekeeping one, if my math is reasonable, I think your current remaining buyback authorization or at least as of September 30, your remaining authorization is down to around $500 million, give or take. I guess the question is, can we expect \u2013 the board will re-up the authorization sometime relatively soon. Is there any reason to expect that the capital deployment strategy you guys have enacted so far would change at all as we look out the next year or more?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the answer to your math is correct. And certainly we intend to discuss with the board re-upping.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't foresee an issue there. It's just the timing issue.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then final one is just quick on asset management. So you've given us some color on what to think about as we look at fourth quarter and a couple of these items that could, in terms of flows, that could continue to impact the numbers in the fourth quarter, but as we turn and look out the 2016 or even a little bit further out than that, Jim, do you feel like you have enough visibility into what's happening underlying some of this noise to say you feel like you're reaching an inflection point on flows, or is it still little bit too soon?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think, listen, we've worked very closely and had the teams really diagnose and also put their plans in place. We have very clear objectives and initiatives underway against the strategy we have and where we think there are opportunities and how to grow against those opportunities. And again, it's you run into sort of environmental market, you run into geopolitical of what's happening in China and Asia versus, et cetera, whether you've got a slowing in Europe versus the U.S.","So all those things, if we look and just say, hey, the world will continue to be a bit more adjusting over time, and that's part of the landscape, I do see underlying some really good core improvements, some really good people and focus that we have that we have brought on board or got channeled into the areas that we're focusing on. And we do have some very good product and people and performance in those product. And so, no, I don't think there is an issue of that we can compete and we can get the flows in the right situation, but I think we're part of seeing what the industry pressures are that you see across.","We've had our own one-offs because of whether it's some ex-parent or a portfolio here or there that might have underperformed or just getting re-established as we've integrated Columbia with RiverSource, with Threadneedle. But I think those things are actually moving forward very nicely, and we're seeing some good positive both energy and synergies. So, no, I actually think there is growth but I'm not going to sit here with a quarter right now, because that hasn't actually happened based on the environmental and complements some of the internal. But no, I do see a path forward and I feel positive, really positive about the group we have in place.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Excellent. And sort of following up on your ten-year anniversary from the spin-off, I'll leave you with this thought. Your stock, despite some pressure this year is up threefold or more since your spinoff while your former parent is up only about 40%. So I wonder who misses whom. Take care.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had a couple of follow-ups. On the U.S. Trust change in the relationship in the fourth quarter, can you just quantify the amount of assets that could be impacted by that?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't have a full thing, but we're probably talking a couple of billion, something in that neighborhood.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just going back to the AWM margin, I know you were asked about and you commented that you'd expect flattish margins if the equity market remains fairly flat. But if we get more normal equity market lift and \u2013 but interest rates remain where they are, do you still expect further margin expansion from here over the next few years?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yes, I do. And again, there's a number of moving parts in there. As we said, we see productivity improvements from our advisors, but we're also adding a good number of new advisors, that we have incremental cost initially as they ramp-up. But then all the vintages ramp-up nicely in the productivity. So it's hard for me to sit here without doing the exact calculations, but if equity markets continue to improve, yeah, we would see a continuing incremental margin over time.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then just last one. Can you just remind us what percentage of Columbia retail sales are distributed through Ameriprise advisors?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're talking in the teens from a sales perspective. So we're a good provider in our channel. But we have other good providers, but it is not sort of an overly dominant position, but we have, for good, we have a good sales platform here. But it's one of a good number of another \u2013 we have a large number of providers. So we have good providers in the system as well.","Ryan J. Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. That's it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"2287":["Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

My name is Sylvia and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll will happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2 you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2017 annual report to shareholders and our 2017 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On slide 3, you'll see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that, you will see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Hello, and thanks for joining us for today's earnings call. I'm pleased to share that Ameriprise had a strong second quarter. Across our diversified firm, we're executing our strategy for growth and long-term value creation. This morning, I'll discuss the strength of the company and the progress we're making, both from a business and a financial perspective. And then Walter will delve into the financials.","As we reflect on the quarter, we're building on the growth and the momentum from the first part of the year, and that we've consistently delivered for many years. On an adjusted operating basis, revenue increased nicely, up 6%. We delivered significant growth in earnings, up 22%, with earnings per share also growing strongly, up 29%. And our return on equity was 31.1%, which is among the highest in the industry. In addition, our assets under management and administration were also up 7% to $891 billion.","In terms of our overall business, there are some important themes to take away. First, as part of our diversified firm, Advice & Wealth Management remains the growth driver of Ameriprise. As a segment, AWM generated 50% of our second quarter pre-tax adjusted operating earnings excluding corporate.","From a business perspective, we're serving clients' needs comprehensively with our advice value proposition and quality solutions. Our clients recognize the meaningful value that comes from working with Ameriprise, and importantly, we're attracting more clients and more assets.","Second, Ameriprise has a strong track record of generating profitable growth and shareholder value, while responding well to a changing operating environment.","And third, complementing our distribution, our Asset Management and insurance and annuity businesses provide strong solutions to serve our clients' needs. In addition, their ability to consistently generate free cash flow is excellent, which gives us further ability to invest for the future, as well as returning capital at a high level.","Like others, Ameriprise is also benefiting from a better operating environment. Equity markets globally are positive. We've seen a meaningful pickup in short-term interest rates, though long-term rates are still relatively low. The U.S. economy and employment levels are also improving nicely. However, global trade and geopolitical issues remain, and we're seeing that reflected in the higher equity market volatility. And in the UK, we're closely navigating Brexit and executing our strategy to adapt accordingly.","In Advice & Wealth Management, we delivered record business and financial metrics in the quarter. We continue to bring in strong client flows and are generating double digit revenue, earnings and productivity growth. We have a consistent growth plan in place. And with our focused execution and efficient use of resources, we're garnering strong results.","As we shared with you, key to our strategy is to grow our retail client base and serve more mass affluent and affluent investors with advice and to deepen relationships with our clients. I'm pleased to report that we're making good progress. Advisors are focused on client acquisition. We're serving more clients in financial planning relationships. We also continue to bring in clients with over $1 million of investable assets. This is a significant opportunity for us in an area where we're expanding our services. Ameriprise client assets grew a robust 10% to $566 billion.","We've built one of the largest investment advisory platforms in the industry. We continue to grow it and attract client assets. Net inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts were up nicely at $5.3 billion, an increase of 18% from last year and the fifth consecutive quarter above $4 billion.","Client assets in these fee-based accounts, as well as in other solutions, are allocated across equities, fixed income and other asset classes. And because of our broad solutions and deep client relationships, assets can shift and stay at Ameriprise according to a changing market conditions and client preferences. And cash balances are over $24 billion. And with short-term interest rates up, we're generating additional net spread revenue, up 56% versus last year.","Our advisors are benefiting. Productivity growth is strong. With excellent client flows, as well as growth in assets and higher activity, advisor productivity was up 12% to $599,000 on a trailing 12 month basis. When you adjust for our 12b-1 fee change, Ameriprise advisors consistently grow productivity faster than many of our key competitors. And we continue to bring in experienced productive advisors. Another 76 joined us in the quarter. Ameriprise has a competitive attractive offering and the recruiting pipeline for the second half of the year looks good.","As we continue to focus our resources for future growth, the U.S. wealth management opportunity today is larger, both in terms of households, as well as asset levels. We also know that our target market, investors with $500,000 to $5 million, want and need advice. In that regard, they're looking for a firm that will help them feel confident about their financial future. Confidence was and still is the outcome of advice in working with Ameriprise advisor. And as the long-standing leader in advice, Ameriprise is differentiated in the marketplace. Consumers need to plan and accumulate wealth for retirement and we're well positioned to serve this need and to continue to drive strong growth.","We've been conducting our other client satisfaction survey. I'm pleased to report that our results are best-in-class, with client satisfaction of an impressive 4.8 out of 5. Our clients are highly satisfied because the important work our advisors do every day, as well as the total experience Ameriprise provides. This complements our external recognition where consumers rated Ameriprise at the top of the investment industry for likelihood to recommend the firm to friends and colleagues.","The Ameriprise culture and the way we work with clients continues to be an important differentiator. We know that trust is the most important factor for clients, as well as our target market prospects, when they select a financial firm to work with.","During the quarter, in the Temkin 2018 ratings, Ameriprise was rated number one in trust across investment firms. And consumers were also asked how likely they would be to forgive companies if those firms made a mistake. Ameriprise was also rated number one for consumer forgiveness for the second consecutive year.","We're not stopping there and we continue to help our advisors satisfy client goals and grow their practices. We're further investing in our client experience, complementing it with the introduction of new digital advice tools; our new and enhanced customer relationship management capability, as well as enhanced goal tracking. We're beginning to introduce these capabilities in the coming months, and we'll be delivering focused training to support our advisor uptake through 2019 that will help us continue our journey and focus on growth.","We are also continuing our investment in the Ameriprise brand and getting our great story out to the marketplace. Brand awareness has reached a record 70%. We believe that this combination of strong client focus, recognition and results, as well as the investments we're continuing to make, positions us well for further growth.","As part of our asset accumulation approach, insurance and annuities are a part of our solution set and benefit both our clients, as well as generate appropriate returns for the company. They complement the other I&A manufacturers in our network and the broader range of solutions we offer clients; our I&A books are of high quality. We have good retention of assets and only sell in our network. And therefore, we generate good returns and cash flow for the company. Our results are in line with our plans. We aren't searching for growth and therefore, don't need to go out on the risk curve to compete.","Given that, we're seeing a good pickup in VA sales, up 16%. With 30% of our activity in products without living benefits, a continuation of growth we experienced in the first quarter. With regard to fixed annuities, since spreads are tight, we are not replenishing our activity. And in Life and Health, account balances are up 4% and sales are steady.","In Auto and Home, we continue to see improvement in our underlying results through increased rates and plan rating sophistication, product changes, underwriting advances and disciplined claims management. At the same time, we consistently earn high consumer satisfaction ratings, once again being recognized as a leader in California auto insurance, our largest state.","As you saw in our preannouncement, we, along with many other insurers, were impacted by wind and hailstorms in Colorado and Texas in the quarter. We are taking steps to further reduce our catastrophic risk profile including curtailing a homeowner's partnership with Progressive and putting more emphasis on the auto line.","As part of Ameriprise, our Asset Management business complements our Wealth Management strength. There are three key themes I want you to take away. First, we have a nice diversified base of assets that we manage with a good mix of equity, fixed income and alternative categories for both retail and institutional clients, distributed both domestically and internationally. And we're generating competitive profitability. Second, we're managing a strategic mix shift to more third-party assets. Third, we have a good diversified product line and distribution, and we're making the necessary changes to enhance the business further to improve longer-term flow results.","Let me take you through each of these themes in more detail. In the quarter, our assets increased slightly to $482 billion. Our teams are generating consistent competitive performance for our clients. At the end of the quarter, about 70% of our funds, equities, fixed income and asset allocation were above Lipper medians or benchmarks over multiple time frames. This has resulted in 110 four and five star funds offered globally. With the shift of assets, we maintained our fee levels, while we continue to manage expenses tightly, while making appropriate investments and managing regulatory changes. Our margins are strong at 38% and profitability was up a bit compared to last year.","And while near-term growth has been challenging, the percentage of lower fee former parent assets under management in largely closed blocks has gradually declined as a percentage of the total, as we have increased higher fee third-party assets under management.","Our strategic relationships with former parent companies provide an important base of our assets. Consistent with our plans, former parent assets under management levels have declined by about a half since 2010, while our total assets under management has grown to $482 billion.","In the quarter, while we remain in net outflows, we did experience improvement in total net outflows at $7.1 billion for the quarter, compared to $8.7 billion of outflows a year ago. Former parent outflows were $2.2 billion, compared to elevated outflows of $7.1 billion last year. Global retail, excluding former parent, was a net inflows of $2 billion in the quarter.","In the U.S., we are making progress with the top-eight wealth managers. For example, our funds, where we concentrated our wholesaling efforts, had inflows of nearly $1 billion for the quarter. And in EMEA, wholesale flows have moved from outflows last quarter to slightly positive in the quarter. Activity has improved, but isn't fully back, given Brexit and the political uncertainty in Europe that has increased volatility, particularly in June.","In institutional, we had $1.5 billion in outflows excluding former parent, which was mainly driven by CLOs. And with markets a bit more volatile, we experienced a slowdown in mandate fundings that we believe reflects current environment market.","And the third thing, we're making the changes necessary to evolve the business. With strong product lines, we're focused on further strengthening our third-party distribution both in terms of reach and productivity. That includes a stronger focus on driving sales of our key products, with the larger broker dealers. It also includes significantly expanding our CCAP product line in our Luxembourg fund range and launching new products such as our European Dynamic Real Return strategy that we introduced in Europe to complement the UK product line. We're also expanding our distribution reach in key European markets and expanding our marketing and sales activities there.","In addition, we're executing the Brexit transition, an important initiative that we're managing along with our growth initiatives. Importantly, we continue to invest to enhance our brand awareness in our key markets, as well as our website and in digital capabilities. In addition, we're enhancing our data analytics capability as part of our Ameriprise-wide initiative. It includes optimizing data to help identify and target sales opportunities and leveraging data within our investment research.","From an infrastructure perspective, we completed key deliverables to enhance our front, middle, and back office systems and operations, and we're realizing savings. These savings are helping to offset research costs we had to absorb due to MiFID, as well as cost to implement changes required for Brexit and new European regulatory requirements. This focus will continue.","So overall, in closing, we have a clear focus on client needs and a strong consumer value proposition. We continue to deliver excellent financial results and returns. We have a strong financial foundation, and we continue to invest significantly for growth, return capital and navigate the environment. In fact, as we invested in the business, we returned more than $400 million a quarter to shareholders for 25 consecutive quarters.","From our perspective, based on our consistently strong financial and financial results, and our ability to manage risk well and the quality of our business, Ameriprise is significantly undervalued today, especially compared to our competitors.","Now, Walter will cover the numbers, and I'll be back to take your questions.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered strong results in the quarter. We continue to make significant progress in delivering our long-term shareholder objectives with strong 6% growth in revenue, 29% growth in EPS and a 31% return on equity.","Let me take you through the details, beginning on slide 6. Overall, Ameriprise delivered strong revenue growth, up 6% in the quarter, largely driven by Advice & Wealth Management. Asset Management, Annuities and Protection had stable revenue that was in line with expectations. Expenses continued to be well managed across the firm, with G&A up only 2%. I'll go into details on expenses in each segment on the subsequent pages.","We returned $532 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends. Given the lower share price in the quarter, we opportunistically increased the amount of share repurchase to the highest level over the past six quarters. In total, adjusted operating EPS was $3.60, fueled by Advice & Wealth Management, which now makes up half of our pre-tax adjusted operating earnings.","Let's turn to slide 7. As I just indicated, Advice & Wealth Management represents half of pre-tax adjusted operating earnings, demonstrating a significant trend, up from 44% last year. Advice & Wealth Management continues to drive growth at Ameriprise. And our Asset Management and insurance capabilities compliment and benefit from its strength. Combined with Asset Management, the fee-based businesses made up three quarters of our earnings for the quarter. This mix shift continues to generate significant free cash flow.","Turning to slide 8, Ameriprise's cash flow generation, balance sheet quality and capital return capability remained very strong. Ameriprise's excess capital is $1.4 billion, and our estimated RBC ratio is 532%. In the quarter, we returned $532 million of capital to shareholders, which was nearly 100% of our adjusted operating earnings. This demonstrated our ongoing commitment to capital return, as well as confidence in our risk analytics and future cash flow capacity.","Let's turn to AWM on slide 9. Advice & Wealth Management is delivering consistent strong financial performance that is underpinned by business fundamentals that support sustained organic growth. Revenues grew 12%, driven by wrap net inflows and higher transactional activity levels, as well as equity markets, and the benefit of higher short rates on cash suite balances. Expenses increased in line with revenues, and reflect higher distribution-related expenses.","G&A increased 8%, about half of which was related to investments for future business growth, including new digital capabilities and the addition of IPI advisors. Additionally, G&A was up due to higher volume-related expenses.","Given the revenue environment, and our future growth objectives, we expect G&A expenses to be up 4% to 6% for the full year. While we are investing substantially for future growth, we remain diligent in ensuring we are making the right investments that we will see the best payback, and that expenses are managed in line with revenues. Overall, AWM had substantial 20% earnings growth and margins reached a new record of 22.7%.","Let's turn to the elements that will drive sustained profitable growth on slide 10. Advice & Wealth Management has a strong track record of improving business fundamentals, which support good financial performance across market cycles. Total client assets increased 10% to $566 billion, driven by growth in wrap assets of 16%, reflecting client demand for fee-based products. In the quarter, wrap net inflows were $5.3 billion, which is our fourth consecutive quarter with wrap flows of over $5 billion. Brokerage cash balances remain substantial at $24.5 billion, down slightly as clients are putting money to work.","We are benefiting from short rates getting back to more normal historic levels, and we saw the spread rise to 1.57% in the quarter. While, we have retained a high percentage of the rise in short rates to date, we would expect to gradually pass along more of that to clients in the second half of the year and will closely monitor crediting rates offered by competitors. Advisor productivity also continues to steadily improve, reaching nearly $600,000 on a trailing 12 months basis.","Let's turn to Asset Management on page 11. Asset Management financial performance remained very good, as we transition the business during a period of industry change. Revenues were up 1% from strong market appreciation and the acquisition of Lionstone, which was partially offset by net outflows and lower CLO performance fees than the year-ago period. In addition, the fee rate was consistent with our expectations in the 52 basis point to 53 basis point range. Expenses continue to be prudently managed. Excluding the acquisition of Lionstone, G&A was flat, even with continuing investments in the business and elevated research and regulatory cost in the UK and Europe.","The investments we've made to enhance operational efficiencies are bearing fruit and helping to offset this additional expense. We delivered a 38% margin in the quarter. We continue to expect the margin to be in the 35% to 39% range in the near term.","Let's turn to Annuities on slide 12. Variable annuities earnings are $117 million, down from last year, and in line with expectation in this environment. Equity market appreciation increased account values year-over-year, but earnings were down due to lower mean reversion than a year ago and net outflows. Variable annuities continue to be in outflows, though at a slower pace than last year in both internally distributed block and the closed block that was distributed by third parties. We've also seen a 16% increase in our sales of our variable annuity product. Fixed annuity pre-tax adjusted operating earnings declined to $12 million, as lapses and interest rates continue to impact results as expected.","Turning to Protection on slide 13. Life and Health pre-tax adjusted operating earnings declined 7% from the pressure of continued low interest rates consistent with the industry. Total claims are in line with expectations, though there was less reinsurance coverage in the period. In the Auto and Home business, pre-tax adjusted operating results in the quarter were impacted by elevated net cat losses of $40 million concentrated in Colorado and Texas.","We continue to reduce home exposures and severe convective storm states from the termination of one of our affinity partnerships along with other actions. This has resulted in homeowners' policies in force declining 12% year-over-year and 7% in the quarter. We expect this to improve our risk profile going forward as will other actions being taken. We had substantially lower gross cat losses in the first half of 2018 compared to the first half of 2017. However, we realized little benefit from reinsurance, as year-to-date cats have not yet exceeded the retention of our aggregate cat treaty. Should we experience similar cat activity during the rest of the year, we will see the benefit of our reinsurance arrangement as we did last year.","Underlying Auto and Home results are benefiting from the improvements we've made over the past couple of years in product management, pricing, underwriting and claims. However, we have not yet reflected the favorable development from these changes and our reserve estimates to date.","Next, I would like to spend a few minutes on our Long Term Care business beginning on slide 14. In the quarter, Long Term Care had a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $5 million, partially driven by lower investment portfolio yields. Claims were in line with expected ranges. As I spoke with you about last quarter, we believe we have a season Long Term Care book that is appropriately reserved, and we remain very comfortable with our exposure. We began writing the business in 1989 and sold our last policy in 2002, which gives us a substantial amount of experience to inform our reserve estimates.","I think about our Long Term Care business in two distinct blocks. First; our older generation policies that were written between 1989 and 1999, which is about half of our policies and 56% of our GAAP reserves. This block has been shrinking over the last few years, given the average attained age is now 80 and the average attend age of policyholders on claim is 87. We benefit from having substantial credible experience, so our actual results have deviated very little from reserves in recent years.","Next, we have our second generation policies that were written from 1997 until 2002. This block has a more conservative risk profile, specifically a smaller portion of the block has lifetime benefits and there are higher premiums per policy. This block has significant credible experience, and we follow the same reserving practices. The average attained age is 75 overall, with the average age of those on claim is 84 for this block.","Let's turn to slide 15. As I mentioned before, we utilized three primary levers to manage the Long Term Care business. First, we have taken an active approach to steadily increasing rates since 2005 with cumulative rate increases of 138% on our first-generation block and 63% on our second-generation block.","Second, we have a rigorous reserving process that reflects the policy features and risk characteristics of our blocks. I'd like to note that our statutory reserves are approximately $400 million higher than our GAAP reserves, and includes margins for key assumptions like morbidity and mortality, as well as $165 million in asset adequacy reserves that we voluntarily put up to build in additional conservatism.","Lastly, we have prudently managed our investment portfolio by maintaining a liquid investment-grade portfolio that is currently in a net unrealized gain position.","In the third quarter, we will add another year of experience and incorporate any deviation from our assumptions into the reserve calculation. To date, reserve adjustments have been small and manageable. I continue to believe that our Long Term Care business is adequately reserved and well managed. As such, I do not believe that Long Term Care will impact our ability to return capital to shareholders consistently.","In conclusion, Ameriprise delivered another quarter of excellent financial performance and demonstrated the sustainability of our business fundamentals and growth. The outlook for AWM is outstanding. We're managing a period of transition for Asset Management and our enterprise risk management program is very effective. And we feel confident that we will continue to execute on our strategy and deliver strong results and free cash flow generation going forward. The investment thesis for Ameriprise remains intact, and is particularly attractive at the current valuation.","With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks. A couple questions on Advice & Wealth Management. Franchise advisor productivity has been very strong in the last two years, up 10% this year, and really 20% over the next two years. Could you give us some sense, what's driving it? Is it more advisors having higher assets? Is it net new wins? And\/or is it clients putting more money to work?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","This is Jim. It's a combination of all of the above. So, our advisors have been focused in bringing in more clients and moving a bit more upmarket. So, the average clients they're bringing in have more assets. They're also deepening the relationship through the advice value proposition, which in fact serves the clients in a more deeper way against more of their goals and activities. And we're also supporting them so that they can become more efficient, so that their practices actually can drive more levels of activity, serving the clients well.","And so, it's all of the above. And we are continuing to focus on bringing that advice value proposition to life because even our best advisors don't necessarily give the full advice equation to all of their clients. And we want to help them do that because \u2013 in a more efficient way, so that they can serve them even more fully. And so, that's why we're bringing even more tools and capabilities to bear in an integrated fashion, so that they can engage all of their clients in the same deep value proposition that they provide.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then as far as the number of advisors, you've had good growth. It's up almost 3%, one of the better growth rates in a number of years. Now that's driven in part by bringing in new advisors, but also deals. As we think about the next couple years, is it possible to keep that growth rate in that low single digit range?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. What we're more focused really on is bringing in highly-productive people, and really tenuring our group. And so, helping our practices even grow more fully by adding support staff, so that they can drive more activities within their own grouping of advisor activity \u2013 teams. So, it's not just the number. I mean, we could go and bring in independents and merge other firms like others are doing. What we're really looking for is strong, quality advisors that will run a really good practice, deliver a strong value proposition, build our brand in that regard, and serve their clients well.","So, we look for quality. We look for them to have a good level of productivity in serving the clients more fully, so that we get really strong satisfaction. We're a firm believer in that if we can offer a really strong value proposition, if our clients believe in us and trust us, and we can give them the confidence they need to make the right decisions, we're going have a strong franchise. So, it's less about number for us and it's more about what we can deliver that will grow the asset base and the productivity of the advisor.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then as far as still on Advice & Wealth Management, expenses were up in the first half, 10%. If I understand your guidance, you're talking about expense growth more in the 4%, 5% for the year. That would suggest expense growth really contracts in the second half. Is that correct?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","The answer is that the expenses will be going down \u2013 or will be lower. But the issue is we'll still be investing in the basic product, and we will be getting some efficiencies as we go through. But it is \u2013 that is \u2013 our targeted range is in that 6% range.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","And it's geared towards your revenue growth, and we feel comfortable that that is the range within reasonable deviation.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our following question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of strategic questions for you. So, I guess first, there's been increasing chatter from private equity firms to look at lifting out the combination of variable annuity, fixed annuity blocks, and then there's also some chatter around long-term care. So, any appetite from you guys pursuing something like that? And if so, what are some of the key considerations we need to be contemplating in assessing whether or not you'd be willing to do that?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","It's Walter, Alex. Obviously, we've gotten more inquiries coming in. And certainly as interest rates or other situations improve, people are looking for earnings. But we have \u2013 again, the block is an excellent block, it generates excellent returns on the variable annuities side. So, it would have to be an offer that would create shareholder value.","On the Long Term Care, again, as we always said, we are preparing for and certainly would entertain offers that would basically give us a reasonable share of return, considering the counterparty risk that you'd be taking, and the fact of where we're leaving the interest rate capabilities. Because again, as they go up, and you know that we've been investing conservatively on that point. So, yes, we're certainly prepared, but it has to meet certain hurdles that provide shareholder return and the right protections from a contingency standpoint.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. Alex, as we look at it, I mean, we have a very strong VA and as well as an insurance book. And it's an ongoing business that has really good clients and advisor activity against it and a very good channel in a sense of that we have a financial planning channel where the products are really sold as solutions.","So, strategically, if there's an opportunity there, but it's more thought about not as a closed-book where we're looking to unload it in any fashion, as we said, it generates very good cash flow, it has very good risk management, and it's an ongoing business concern in a sense of replenishment of assets. We don't grow this externally. Someone can take our capabilities and use it if they want it in that regard. So, it's along those lines that we would consider, but not in a sense of just selling it as sort of closed wind down book. It's not that book. It's not that type of book.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Yeah, got it. Sticking with the strategic portion. So, thinking about the bank, you guys started talking about it about a year ago. On the last call, it still sounds like it's work in progress, but maybe an update there. Where you stand on launching a bank, and when and how you do it I guess also depends on where the interest rates are going be. But as you think about developing that \u2013 I think you talked about coming up with some consumer lending products on the back of it as well, what are the stages we need to be thinking about? So, would it be bank, like a cash sweep program at first and then branching on into lending products, and maybe as a follow-up to that, how do you feel about potentially getting into consumer lending product at this point of the cycle?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So, we're clearly evaluating that. We still have a bank charter. It's a trust bank charter that we would look to expand our activities. So, we're well on our work in evaluating what that would be for the latter part of this year, but it would be more of a bank serving our client needs. So, it'll be around wealth management-type of products, such as pledge activity. It would be on secured lending activities. It would be what we used to do in some home equity lines and some mortgages, and various products like that on certain loans activity. But it would be all to our client base, not looking to externally sell.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So, is there like a go\/no go by the end of the year? Or is it just kind of ongoing?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We have already and installed base of credit cards that we'll be transferring over. And certainly as you indicated, sweep accounts will certainly come in and then we will be able to leverage on and play with the balance sheet then to provide the appropriate risk return.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our following question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody. So, I really appreciate all the incremental data and disclosure you've provided, not only this morning, but over the last couple of months on the Long Term Care block, and I was hoping I could ask a couple of questions and get a little bit more specific here.","First, I think your disclosure from a couple of months ago had indicated that about 90% of claims have been closed within five years and about one-third of claims are closed within one year. I'm curious. If we think about the assumptions embedded in your reserves, are those assumptions very similar to the experience you've actually had with respect to claims that have already taken place?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Okay. Alex (sic) [John] (41:15). It's Walter. So, thank you for recognizing \u2013 excuse me, John. It's Walter. The answer to your question is, yes. And you're exactly on \u2013 in the one year it is about a one-third and in five years it's about 88%, closer to 90%, and those are the ones that we use. And, obviously, we're going through our unlocking now and updating our credible experience factors, but certainly the assumptions are based on our experience.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, second, you've also \u2013 you've shown us that statutory capital supporting the retained portion of your block is about $280 million. I'm curious. Can you speak to the level of statutory capital that resides within the trust that represents the portion of the block that is ceded to Genworth? And the reason I'm asking is in the unlikely event that you either decided to or at some point even had to recapture that block, I'm trying to understand what impact it might have from a capital perspective on you.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Okay. It's a fair question, John. The answer is, obviously, we don't call it a trust, but certainly we feel comfortable, and that's your term. So, I just have to make that point. But we certainly have the collateral Protection that we feel is appropriate, and the answer is that the Protection is in line with what we believe the liabilities are. And certainly, we work with Genworth and we certainly understand.","Again, it goes to our close relationship both on them doing claims, doing administration, other aspects that we work with that we feel that theirs is similar to ours. And so, it would not have to be a substantial denigration of capital if in the \u2013 like you said, we're not talking about recapture. But if it \u2013 and that event ever occur, there should be no capital. But we have no plans to recapture. I just want to make sure everybody understands that.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Oh! Very helpful. And then, finally, if I can just ask in general, if you looked across the block and you thought about the biggest sensitivities, where they exist with respect to \u2013 if actual experience did come in different from your current assumptions, which of those assumptions might have the biggest potential sensitivity? And how much risk do you believe still exist given how credible the experience is at this point, particularly with the first-generation portion of the block?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Okay. Good question. With the first generation, as we've indicated, we certainly believe that that has reached a stage where the impacts will be minimal. And certainly over the last several years they have certainly stayed within very manageable ranges and quite minimal.","I believe, it's probably going to be in the area of morbidity. But again, we do build in morbidity. And we've been tracking morbidity, building at about 1% a year. So, we feel comfortable with our credible experience analysis as we look at it, and especially as we go over to the second generation, we are certainly matching and feel comfortable with that.","But morbidity \u2013 and again, the problem with morbidity, you just can't look at it as a single event or a single variable. You have to start getting into mortality or other (44:28) implications of that. But I would say probably, morbidity is and we \u2013 as a reference point of sensitivity, a 5% increase in the course of claims would equate to about $130 million. Just to give you guys some sizing. Okay? But that relates to our GAAP reserve, which is our best estimate. Okay?","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. That's all very helpful. Thank you, Walter.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","You're quite welcome, John.","Operator","Following question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. On the cash sweep, I think you mentioned that you'll likely pass along more to customers going forward. Can you help frame that at all? I know you've been keeping the vast majority of it so far. So, going forward, I guess, would you still expect to keep over 50% of the upside?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","The answer is yes. Obviously, we track this very closely versus peers and competitiveness, but the answer is yes to your question.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then just a follow up on the bank. How should we think about potential capital requirements as you roll out the bank? Is that something that will have a material impact at all? Or should we not be thinking about that as really impacting your capital much?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. I guess the short answer is no, you should not. It's in our basically risk appetite and tolerance analysis that we do, and we certainly make recommendations as it relates to the deployment of capital. And with its earnings characteristics, and so even with as we run risk elements, the capital \u2013 I think we've actually disclosed this, that, five years out, you're talking in the range of $400 million. And certainly, we're generating very strong returns on that. So, it is actually certainly manageable and certainly providing the right return characteristics with the right risk characteristics. So, no impact to our ability to continue to do and invest in our business and have other options as it relates to inorganic or return of capital to shareholders.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citigroup.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","Thanks. Good morning. So, wanted to go back to Long Term Care. I think you've said couple of times your block is different in that, it's older. But as we think about over the next several years, particularly as mortality kicks in, how should we think about the pace of reserves over time? In other words, should we get to a point where we start to see the reserves declining just because the underlying policyholders are starting to die off?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Obviously, the answer is yes. Listen, we are tracking and we do build in and certainly based on our credible experience that we have what we feel is demonstrating the claims cost increases. So \u2013 and then, of course, we still have the ability on price increases, which we certainly build in, that we feel we're quite prudent on that. So, the answer is we do see that, obviously, claims are going up, but certainly within what we expect, what we've seen, and building elements.","The other aspect of this, and we've gotten questions, Suneet, and I think just to be clear, we currently have built in to our reserves about $120 million worth of future price increases, of which 30% of that is already approved by the state. So, we're feeling quite comfortable with that element. Our reserves, as we look forward, we're comfortable with that. But, again, we're going through our third quarter, we have no reason to think it's going to change. But we feel quite good about where we stand with that, and certainly expect that it will be within ranges that we've seen or we will adjust as we've always said, but again, quite manageable.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","And then on the credible experience, for the two blocks, can you give us a sense of what percentage of sort of covered lives are actually on claim at this point?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We have about, total policies on claims, around 7%.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","For the two blocks?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, it's about 8% for the first generation. It's about 5% for the second.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","Okay. And then is that reinsurance cover that you have, is that sort of 50% on the two blocks or does it differ by the two blocks?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. It's \u2013 again, we've reinsured to Genworth \u2013 we're dealing \u2013 I'm talking about our block now and, obviously, they're setting up the reserves, and I just answered a question on that. But this is, again, they will be impacted by obviously the full amount, but the issue is with their share. But this is for us. We're talking about us.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","He is just saying did they have a share of the total.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","They have a share of the total. Remember, the total of reserves on this are $5 billion. We're talking about $2.5 billion. There's about 113,000 clients, they have half the clients or half the risk of it.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","Got it. And then just lastly, on the morbidity sensitivity that you gave us, a 5% increase. I guess, one of the things we're struggling with is just to try to understand what's the base assumption for morbidity, and maybe how it compares to the industry overall. You had mentioned in your slide deck that you have this external validation. Do you have any sense of how your morbidity assumptions compare to industry standard?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Actually \u2013 we certainly, as part of a review look at, but it's very difficult to get something that gives you the comparability. We rely on our credible experience because candidly that is something that is tracked, and we certainly feel very comfortable with that. So, on industry, certainly we don't ignore it, but it is now building and it's not difficult to do \u2013 it is difficult to do a very precise compare considering when they stop their features, the way they manage it. But certainly, it's a data point. And that will be evaluated as we go forward, but we do rely heavily on our credible experience. And certainly, are not \u2013 we understand what goes on with the street, but the issue is drawing our conclusions about what reserves and what generates on reserves is really based upon our credible experience because we have not seen anything that would deviate us from that.","Suneet Kamath - Citi","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our following question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey. Good morning. On the tax rate coming in at 16.5%, and then guidance for 17% rest of the year, I believe guidance was 17% to 19%. And I know you've had \u2013 you've got benefits like the DRD and tax preferences on low income housing. But maybe you could touch on what's kind of keeping it a bit lower? And where you see it going beyond 2018?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, that's a good question, Andrew, by way. Good to speak to you again.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, likewise.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Right now we put that 17% to 19% out because there were still a lot of areas that were floating around that could impact that number. Those have subsequently been settled down. We also have the share purchase accounting, which comes in, and we're trying to manage that from that standpoint which has a big impact. As you saw in the first quarter, we took in under \u2013 14 point some-odd percent. We think we have a good understanding of DRD. Our other elements are still in place. So, on that particular case, 17% looks good us. It's obviously dependent on, of course, your marginal tax rate. Because again, tremendous amount of generation and new profitability will give you a higher marginal rate of 21%. But I would say, you should be looking forward that that rate is a good rate and, obviously will increase in time, as we build the business and we get the marginal rate of 21% coming in. But it's a good problem to have, isn't it?","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Absolutely. And then just lastly, Walter and Jim, on the property casualty business, I was kind of looking through the model and going back to 2011 and the combined ratio hasn't gotten below 100% since 2011. And I'm wondering, is that a business \u2013 and your rationale for staying in the variable annuity area and other areas of Protection make a lot of sense, but is this really a business that fits Ameriprise, and where you want to be?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so as we said previously, the first thing we wanted to do is we did have \u2013 developed a very good business here, a good business model. It's a direct affinity business. So, it \u2013 it generates unbelievable client satisfaction. It's a low-cost operated in the way the business is run as a direct affinity type of model. And we have very good client activity and retention, so more of a mass affluent base. I think over the last few years, as we've grown through certain partnerships, like Progressive, et cetera, we picked up some undue loss activity there based upon the concentration.","So, now we're getting out of that type of arrangement, which would bring down a level of the cat activity that we experienced, that really got heightened over the last few years based on the number and type of storms that have been through the country, but you can see that across a lot of insurers.","In this certain part of the equation, we had to enhance a lot of our modeling capability as the industry continued to make adjustments. And there are different things occurring in the Auto section, and so we've been able to do that now. And I think over the next year or so, you're going see improvements that are going to work its way through in what we're putting in place on the underwriting, the modeling, the pricing, the claims management activities, the policy adjustments that we're making and the partnership arrangements that we're adjusting.","So, I do believe we'll get back to a good state. But to your point, strategically, it is not as integrated into our proposition in a sense of it's all our core client activity. But we have very good relationships. We have very good client base. We have a consistent retention of clients based on how satisfied they are with Ameriprise. So, strategically, we'll be able to evaluate that with our partners and figure out if there are things that we should consider. And I will do that. But we want to really continue to bring this back to the state that we think it can be in, and it's well on its way.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our following question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the Continental Europe growth plans for Columbia Threadneedle. Maybe you could expand upon some of the key opportunities there within products or distribution, and given the challenges stemming from regulatory changes in that region. Thanks.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. So, what we're doing is we're going to replicate a lot of our OIC (56:08) line and build on our CCAP line across the continent. It's a combination of \u2013 we're doing it both for a combination of Brexit activities, but also we do want to expand more fully in the key markets across Europe. And we've already started to put our extra resources, build the brand, introduce some of these product lines more comprehensively in the fourth quarter of this year.","And so, we'll be building out in places like Germany and Italy and Spain and places like that where we see a good opportunity, where we already have a good initial level of client activity, and that they're looking for our product. And we feel there is an opportunity for us to further expand and go deeper like we are in the UK. So, we feel good about that. We think it's a good opportunity and one that we can have some good success with \u2013 with the product line that we have.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. And just one follow-up. In terms of what you said in the prepared remarks, began to slowdown in mandate fundings within Asset Management. Want to know if you could expand upon that? Maybe comment upon what you're seeing in terms of institutional client demands? And maybe also stepping back, just from a longer-term view, how do you think about the potential to grow that institutional side? I know that the Asset Management business is skewed more towards the retail side right now. Thanks.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. So we have been able to put together both a good product line, more fully and comprehensive than we've ever had before in the institutional basis. We have longer term track records in a number of areas. In some of the areas that we've been a bit stronger in, things like high yield, et cetera, as you would imagine the markets has tightened a little bit. People aren't putting as much money into it. And also, just based on market evaluations, people have slowed down a little bit on the equity side as well.","So, we don't see this as a permanent thing, but we do see \u2013 and I think you'll see it across the industry where the institutional activities have slowed a bit in a number of the areas, particularly in the areas that we have a bit more strength in. So, that's really what we're seeing. But we have been expanding our relationships. We are growing them globally. And we do feel there's more opportunity for us to continue to get some of our product line in, including some of our solution activity.","And so, we're building that out as well. We want to get a little more customized than what we can deliver for institutions. We're also building out our infrastructure business out of the UK and Europe. And we're trying to also with Lionstone start to build that activity even further there. So, we have some things in the hopper. But as I would tell you, I think if you look across the institutional activity in the first half of the year, it slowed a bit.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our final question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Just in AWM, can you remind us like what portion your G&A costs are fixed versus variable? Like just how to think about the potential margin expansion there as the experienced advisors continue to ramp up going forward?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So in our G&A, we both have, first of all, support across the entire network for what we do from our branding to our capabilities that we offer and the services we provide. It also is volume-related in various activities. From trading activities and the platform clearing and, et cetera, et cetera. So, all of that is part of our G&A expenses that go up with volume and down with volume, as well as some what we would call our staff and support and servicing.","From an advisor perspective, we bear the cost of our employee advisors for their G&A-fixed costs like offices, et cetera. And our franchisee channel, they bear the cost of their real estate and their services and their support staff, as part of their activities and they have a higher payout to do that. So, it's a combination of where we have the asset, both fixed and variable, that we serve. And then our advisors, if \u2013 they're a franchisee pick up some of their overhead from managing their own in-office operations.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","I guess assuming we're just looking at the second quarter, if you bifurcate the G&A cost in AWM, like what portion of that would be fixed versus variable?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","The variable expense in that \u2013 again, it's looking at what we've said as it relates to vendors and other elements as it relates to the activity level is about $4 million or $5 million on that increase.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then regarding to your recruitment of advisors, can you talk about the pipeline in the second half? My understanding is the changes in the protocol disrupted the recruiting in the first half, but things have picked up since June. Do you think you can get to a similar level as the second half of last year in terms of the recruiting for this year?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, the recruiting did slow a little bit at starting the year activities. There's a combination of factors including market volatility. But I think some change in the protocol for some of the firms. But I think our pipeline looks good. We're seeing a bit more activity come back again. As you saw, we picked up the 76 or roughly similar in the first quarter. But we do feel good about the pipeline, the people we're bringing in, and people are interested. And so we feel good about that.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We have no further questions. This concludes today's conference.

Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear various references to non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations.","Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials available on our website.

We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I will turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. I'm going to provide my perspective on the business. Walter will follow my remarks with a review of our results, and then we'll take your questions.","Yesterday afternoon, we reported good first quarter earnings. Overall, Ameriprise is performing well. Assets are up across the firm and we're generating very strong results in our Wealth Management business. We're executing on our strategy, investing in our growth areas and strengthening our position in our core businesses.","In terms of the economic environment, I feel better than I did a year ago. Equity markets are stronger in the United States, and the economy is on a more stable ground and growing slowly.","Across Europe, the markets are a bit weaker, consistent with the economic environment there. However, we're managing the headwinds caused by very low interest rates, although this pressure has been offset by gains in the equity markets.","Walter will take you through the numbers in detail, but our financial results reflect a good start to the year.","On an operating basis, net revenues grew to $2.6 billion, due to strong growth in our fee-based businesses, offsetting the negative impact from rates in the loss of the bank-related revenues.","Our earnings were $338 million, with earnings per share of $1.59. And return on equity increased to 16.4%, which is an all-time high for us. We expect to see ROE continue to improve over the next few quarters.","In addition, our assets under management and administration grew to a record high of $708 billion.","We're maintaining our strong capital position, generating good free cash flow and increasing our capital return to shareholders.","During the quarter, we returned $454 million to shareholders, including repurchasing $360 million of our common stock.","As we've said, we intend to return the majority of our earnings to our shareholders annually, including the capital freed up from the bank. And we plan to do so in a balanced way, based on the environment and the share price.","As you saw in the earnings release, we announced that we're increasing our dividend another 15%. With regard to capital, we're focused on our core businesses and returning capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. We often look at acquisition opportunities and how they can complement our business. But at this point, we don't see any large properties in the marketplace that meet our acquisition criteria.","With that, let me turn to the business. Our highlights for the first quarter reflect our progress, opportunities for further growth and our continued focus on areas of improvement.","Advice & Wealth Management is producing excellent results as we continue our growth from 2012 into the first quarter.","Operating net revenues increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by record retail client net inflows and market appreciation.","Operating net revenues increased 10%, excluding former banking operations, and operating PTI increased 39%, and adjusted for the bank, it would have been 66%.","Operating margin increased to 12.9% due to the increase in productivity, our effective expense management and savings we targeted from our reduced technology spend. In fact, the 12.9% number included both the impact of lower interest rates on cash balances from a year ago, as well as the loss of the bank.","Ameriprise advisor client assets grew by 11% to $372 billion, driven by strong net inflows and equity market appreciation. Client activity continue to pick up with exceptionally strong wrap net inflows, growing to $4.1 billion, which is 41% higher than a year ago. Productivity is also up nicely, with operating net revenue per advisor, excluding former bank operations, growing 9%.","Importantly, our advisor force remains strong, retention and satisfaction rates are high. We continue to recruit good, productive and experienced advisors. Because of better markets in the year-end tax season, recruiting has slowed in the first quarter, which is consistent with others in the industry.","We do, however, see a good opportunity to continue to bring in more quality advisors this year. We're investing in our growth areas, building our brand through advertising, and increasing efficiency through the tools and technologies we provide advisors.","The Ameriprise name was highly visible in the first quarter. We launched the next phase of our national advertising campaign, with spots airing during high-profile sports and entertainment programming and online video ads.","In fact, our ad awareness has doubled with our campaign, so we're seeing terrific results there. We also released our latest retirement survey, a continuation of our Retirement Check-In series to provide research and support to our advisors and demonstrate our position as a retirement thought leader in the industry.","With regard to our technology platform, which includes our new brokerage platform, as well as all of our online capabilities, we're now focused on helping advisors leverage the benefits of the full suite. This is a priority for us over the next 18 to 24 months.","We invested in this system because we believe it can help our advisors grow productivity, and when utilized fully, it will lower costs and enhance our overall client and advisor experience. One of our largest opportunities for growth is in the retirement space, where we're already a leader. We're focused on serving the consumers' overall retirement goals. In fact, we brought out a more consumer-friendly approach to enhance our go-to-market positioning. We call it our Confident Retirement approach. It has tested very well with our advisors and consumers, and we've just begun to roll it out across our system. Advisors who are using it are finding it to be a very effective way of deepening current relationships and developing new ones. We're putting a concerted effort towards implementing this more broadly over the next 2 years.","Overall, it was a very good quarter for Advice & Wealth Management, and we're pleased with the progress we're making in the business. With good flows in productivity, as well as our continued expense management efforts and even with the headwinds from low interest rates, margin is expanding nicely.","In Asset Management, we're building on our 2 strong footholds in the United States and Europe, and establishing a strong global Asset Management business. We're delivering good financial performance while managing a period of outflows, which I'll discuss further in a moment.","Our assets under management were up 2% sequentially to $466 billion, driven by market appreciation. However, that included the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was sizable in the quarter.","Operating PTI increased 10%, reflecting market appreciation and the benefits we're realizing from our revenue and expense reengineering efforts. And the adjusted net pretax operating margin grew to 34.6%, from 33.3% a year ago.","We have a good product platform in Asset Management, which we're continuing to invest in and grow, in particular within global equities and asset allocation products.","Meanwhile, we're maintaining consistent competitive investment performance, which remains a priority for us.","Regarding flows, Walt will cover the numbers for the quarter. But I wanted to take a moment to explain how we think about Asset Management, the overall strategy we're executing and what you can expect from a business perspective.","Both of our major acquisitions, Threadneedle and Columbia, gave us asset managers with meaningful portions of assets under management, which included mandates from their former parents. That created unique flow characteristics that we continue to manage today.","Threadneedle is part of Zurich and it manages a significant level of insurance-affiliated assets. Our objective was to leverage Threadneedle's investment platform and asset base to build strong, third-party related distribution in both retail and institutional capabilities to grow higher fee business while managing legacy assets. We've been successful in doing this.","Today, legacy insurance mandates represent a much smaller percentage of Threadneedle's assets under management. This relationship is important but we do expect to experience approximately $3 billion to $4 billion in outflows of these assets annually, given the nature of the book.","That said, as we look at the business overall and invest to grow, Threadneedle inflows are higher fee and we're seeing that dynamic come through in the P&L.","Like Threadneedle, Columbia had a level of assets directly associated with its former parent, as well as assets that were influenced by relationships with the bank or its affiliates.","We approached the transaction in a similar manner to Threadneedle, to build on the existing asset and client base, leverage strong investment performance and product offerings and expand third-party and institutional distribution relationships.","While outflows of assets directly associated with the bank's pension and institutional area are largely behind us, we continue to experience several billion of ongoing outflows annually from our relationship with the bank and bank-affiliated distribution. In addition, we expect some level of outflows from a key subadvisor.","The core of the Columbia business is strong. We're beginning to make good progress on growing in third-party and institutional. We have good traction in our focus funds and we are working to expand this more broadly across our intermediary platforms.","As well as we're building a broader institutional pipeline and beginning to win more institutional mandates.","Looking ahead, we expect flows to improve gradually this year. Here's what you can expect from an overall business perspective.","Both Threadneedle and Columbia will experience outflows from assets that were directly or indirectly affiliated with the former parent companies, the majority being lower-fee business. We'll leverage our platforms to build flows through third-party distribution in both the retail and the institutional channels. We're organizing the efforts of Columbia and Threadneedle to use the strengths of the investment teams to better compete in the global marketplace with high demand products such as emerging markets, asset allocation and global. We're always focused on generating consistently strong investment performance, building on the product portfolio of 118 4- and 5-star funds. In fact, Columbia won 5 new Lipper Awards in the quarter. Reengineering remains a priority to maintain good profitability and margins as our flows evolve.","And finally, we will make decisions to drive profitable net inflows. For example, we are executing our plan to align share classes with certain distribution channels. In the case of our RIA changes, it may impact flows in the near term in exchange for improved earnings.","Overall, I'm optimistic about this business and what we can do with this business. We have talented people, good investment processes, solid performance and expanding distribution. We're focused on gaining flows and building from the strong foundation we have in place over the medium term.","Let's move to Annuities and insurance. In Annuities, our business is strong and performing well. We're generating good returns on a business that has a good risk profile with strong hedging.","Our flows are improving in our new volatility control product. In addition, we're building out the product line by launching 3 new managed volatility funds to help serve an even broader range of client and advisor needs.","As we move forward, we'll also emphasize variable annuities without a living benefit rider to add to our already strong book. We're launching 21 new investment options, including more advice embedded solutions, new asset classes like alternatives and commodities, and more funds and asset classes where tax deferral is valuable.","This is a good business for us and we're looking to grow this book again.","With regard to fixed annuities, they continue to be in net outflows due to the effects of the interest rate climate and the reduced client appetite for these products.","As we look to 2014, we'll be able to reprice a portion of the book that will take some of the pressure from this product line off our margins.","In Protection, our insurance business is also performing well with good profitability in the quarter. We have a diversified portfolio that is mostly comprised of variable universal life, cash value-focused universal life, disability insurance and term products that are not significantly impacted by the interest rate environment. We're beginning to see a nice pickup in sales of life products, with cash sales growing 12% year-over-year. We're also pleased to see sales grow in our variable universal life product, as well as continued steady growth in our indexed universal life.","In Ameriprise Auto and Home, we had solid policy growth of 9% from our affinity partners and within the Ameriprise channel, resulting in premiums growing nicely, up 7%.","Expenses were well managed; however, momentum was affected by increased reserves for an auto liability loss development. Client satisfaction retention for Auto and Home remains strong.","To summarize, we had a good quarter. We continue to execute the strategy we laid out for you in November and we're making good progress. We're investing to maintain good capabilities, while maintaining tight control of expenses.","Now I'd like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered strong financial results, particularly in our key areas of growth: Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. These 2 segments represent 60% of our total revenues and grew 8% on a combined basis when you normalize for exiting the bank.","In Protection and Annuities, revenues grew in line with our expectations, particularly in light of continued low interest rates.","Let's turn to earnings on Slide 4. Pretax earnings from Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management together increased over 30%, excluding bank earnings in the 2012 quarter. Similar to the revenue picture, we are seeing the same trend for operating pretax earnings in these segments.","Let's turn to EPS on Slide 5. Excluding the bank, we had a solid 13% growth in operating EPS to $1.59 per share. As we said, we plan to return 100% plus of earnings to shareholders this year, plus the $375 million freed up from exiting the bank.","The return of capital associated with the bank will effectively offset the lost bank earnings from an EPS perspective by year end. However, because of timing, earnings per share was impacted $0.04 on a year-over-year basis.","Return on equity hit an all-time high in the quarter at 16.4%. And we see an opportunity for further ROE expansion in 2013 and over the longer term.","Moving to the segment discussions. In Advice & Wealth Management, the strong year-over-year PTI growth trends were driven by underlying fundamentals of the business. Client assets grew 11% to $372 billion, and we had record wrap net inflows of $4.1 billion.","Advisor metrics were strong. We continue to recruit high-quality experienced advisors with continued high retention rates. Advisor productivity reached a record high of 104,000.","In the quarter, low interest rate had a negative impact of $10 million on our earnings year-over-year. The impact of low rates will be approximately $10 million per quarter for the balance of the year.","As Jim said, we remain focused on managing expenses. Excluding the bank, G&A expenses were down 3%, primarily from the wind-down of the brokerage platform conversion expense.","Year-over-year, new brokerage platform related expenses declined $8 million, though a nominal amount of training expense will remain for the next quarter or 2. We'll continue to invest in business growth initiatives, but we do not see any projects of this magnitude in the near term.","One of the most compelling results in the quarter is the AWM margin, which on a reported basis, was 12.9%, up 300 basis points. Good results in their own right. If we exclude the bank from the prior quarter, margins would've expanded 430 basis points over the prior year.","Turning to Asset Management. We had solid earnings of $144 million, up 10% over last year. We're able to deliver earnings growth, despite being in outflows, by reengineering our revenue and expense bases. In the quarter, we had 1 less fee day, which impacted revenue growth and profitability.","Overall operating expenses were up 4%, primarily from the impact of market appreciation on distribution fees, and G&A expenses remain well-controlled.","As always, we will continue to focus on both revenue and expense reengineering opportunities to maintain solid profitability and margins, make the necessary choices particularly around fee levels to ensure our flows are profitable, and execute the strategies necessary to achieve positive flows.","Let's turn to flows in more detail on the next slide. In the quarter, we had a total of $5.7 billion of outflows. This was higher than anticipated, but consistent with prior patterns of outflows in a few specific areas.","For retail, overall flows were flat, with a strong $1.7 billion of inflows at Threadneedle. This was driven by strong consumer confidence and good sales in a few key products, particularly in Europe.","We recognize that U.S. retail flows remained a challenge. First, a large distribution partner continued to rebalance asset concentrations. Second, we had continued outflows from a third-party subadvisor. As we mentioned last quarter, we're also taking actions to improve the profitability of flows by changing the share class that we are offering in the RIA channel. This resulted in outflows this quarter and we expect to see more over the next few quarters.","For institutional, outflows were high at $5.5 billion, though primarily from low fee assets. At Threadneedle, $2.2 billion of the outflows were largely from normal outflows from legacy insurance assets, and also included $1 billion from a mandate in Japan that we've previously disclosed.","For institutional at Columbia, there were approximately $1 billion of outflows from low basis point assets, including Balboa.","In addition, several clients took money off the table in both investment-grade and high-yield credit mandates, given strong performance in these asset classes.","Turning to Annuities. Operating pretax earnings was $156 million, which was in line with our expectation. Variable annuity operating pretax earnings were $109 million, down 18% from the prior year period. First quarter results were impacted by a $7 million higher DAC amortization and benefits expense related to our third quarter 2012 unlocking, which we had discussed last quarter.","And additionally, there was $10 million less favorable mean reversion compared to a year ago. And the prior year period included a $20 million favorable actuarial model adjustment.","In fixed annuities, operating pretax earnings declined $9 million. The pressure from low interest rates continued to impact the fixed annuity block.","In the first quarter, the impact from low interest rates was $17 million on a gross basis. Partially offsetting this was a benefit to investment income from the accretion associated with assets transferred from the bank in the fourth quarter.","We expect the pretax earnings impact of low interest rates to be $15 million to $20 million per quarter for fixed annuities. By year end, we will begin lowering our interest rate exposure by resetting rates on a large 5-year guarantee block of fixed annuities.","As previously mentioned, we adopted a new methodology for allocating equity to our product lines in the quarter. The new methodology reflects the higher requirements of rating agencies or regulators, and also allocates contingent capital for stress scenarios, mainly to support our variable annuity book. This quarter, the Annuity segment's return on equity was a strong 16.2%.","Moving to Protection on Slide 10. Operating pretax earnings were in line with our expectations at $110 million. The continued strong results in our Life & Health businesses were offset by lower earnings for Auto and Home. Life & Health earnings were strong in the quarter from favorable disability and long-term care claims experience. It was a good quarter for sales. Both variable universal life and indexed universal life sales were up after refreshing our product last year.","Auto and Home has continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships with Costco and Progressive. However, earnings were a bit lower as we built reserves related to prior year loss development.","The Protection segment generated a strong 16.7% operating return on allocated equity in the period.","Let's turn to capital on the next slide. We returned $454 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in the first quarter. We have been able to consistently return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders due to our business mix shift, risk management capabilities and strong balance sheet fundamentals.","For the rest of 2013, we anticipate that our capital actions will drive continued ROE expansion and will neutralize the EPS impact of exiting the bank by the year end.","As Jim said, we announced that our board of directors has approved an increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share after our regular annual dividend review.","This dividend brings us to a 2.9% dividend yield, and is in line with our strategy to move towards a greater portion of our capital returned in the form of shareholder dividends.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the environment for recruiting new advisors, and whether you view the slowdown in hiring this quarter as a blip or is it becoming more difficult to attract the advisors you're targeting? And I guess related to that, do you expect any impact if new disclosure rules for compensation packages offered to advisors or advisor recruits go into effect?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, what we've seen is we've started to experience a little slowdown at the end of the year and the first part of this year. And we think that's consistent -- and you probably heard this from some others, because the market did pick up, there were a lot of changes at the end of the year because of fiscal policy and tax policy, and there's a number of things that I think, because of dividends and reinvestments, that people were much more focused on how they're going to manage their portfolios. So we saw that a bit more this year than we did in previous years. I think that's across the industry. Having said that, we still have a good pipeline that's starting to rebuild as people come out of this period. And we think that we will be able to ramp it up a bit as we go through the following quarters. We've also been focused a bit more on higher productive people, and so that area is always a bit more competitive. But we've been really attracting some quality people into our franchise. Regarding the new disclosure rules, depending on what they ultimately decide, it will initially have some effects, I would think, as people start to think about how they would disclose information in regard to their clients and what that would mean to them. Having said that, I think it could actually work as a benefit over time, in a sense that there's a lot of -- people move between wirehouses, and there's a question of why do they do that? Are they doing it just for compensation or for a change in environment? In our case, as we attract people over, we're attracting people who are actually coming over to work in a little different model, with a bit more advice proposition. And we think we can probably help them explain to their clients what we would provide them that would actually help them work with their clients even more fully. So it would be a change. I think any change always has an effect. Having said that, I think there are some good things that we could highlight that would explain why those people are making the change to move. So we'll see where it goes as far as what the regulator ultimately decides. But we are preparing ourselves to deal with that effectively.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, if I could just ask one quick one on the Asset Management side. You talk about a lot of the outflows being in the low-margin assets. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of the margin difference between, kind of, what you're seeing on the institutional outflows; and then, on the retail assets where you are seeing inflows? So just kind of a rough margin differential between the 2.","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, I think we could break it down to just 1 or 2 components in institutional that Walter mentioned. So -- and I'll separate the Threadneedle from Columbia, just for a moment. Clearly, we still have the $2.2 billion of outflows from Zurich-related assets. One was a mandate that we recognized, a little incremental from our normal flow picture. But on an ongoing basis, these are closed books, et cetera. And there is always a drawdown of assets. We have explained in the past that the fee basis, even though it's a good level for us to generate profitability, is much lower than new institutional mandates that we do win in the international marketplace. And therefore, the flow picture always looks, whether even if it's a breakeven at a point, it's a real positive for us if we're bringing that in through the new mandates through the third-party institutions. Columbia is a little similar in that regard. There were bank-related like Balboa that they sold off that insurance book, there were bank-related affiliate distribution related to their institutional activities that also have very low basis points. And those, compared to new institutional mandates, are significantly different. Now the one thing we did get affected in the first quarter that was of higher fee to us were some mandates that we had in the credit area, not because we didn't have good performance, we have excellent performance, but because there was a rotation out of some of that area at the very beginning of the year, when everyone thought rates would start to back up, et cetera. And so we experienced that rebalancing. Now the good news is, from what was freed up, including some capacity in these areas, we do have wins that will be funded in the second quarter, it just didn't time correctly. And you can never count on the timing of those things. So we do see some improvement in that regard from what I would call the third-party institutional. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to get affected by what I would call the ex-parent stuff, including here with Columbia. And that's an effect. And the retail distribution, as you know, retail always has different fee structures than the institutional. However, some of those fee structures for outflows are again, through bank relationships, as well as through subadvisor. And so their fee adjustments will be slightly different than it would be if we're winning a new third-party that doesn't have some of those fee structures attached to it. And the last point was -- Walter made on the RIA. RIA, we were selling the wrong share class when we actually took this over. And even though we will experience outflows as we did in the first quarter, over time, this will actually be a better business for us. But we felt appropriate to make those changes. So there's a confluence of events that really hit in the first quarter. Having said that, we're continuing to be very focused on building flows in what we would call more profitable businesses, as well as expanding the distribution through the third-party retail and institutional. But we will still experience outflows from the ex-parent. Now having said that, we've got a good base, we continue to reengineer to offset some of those losses. And at the end of the day, I think we can get back into a growing business, but yes, right now it's going to take a little time, particularly if you look at the overall flow picture.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, with the improvement in advisor productivity. Can you discuss whether that -- whether you expect that to be sustained or -- with some of the client activity, perhaps a little abnormal, given the fiscal cliff and then the rush to push -- to put cash back to work in the past couple of quarters?","James M. Cracchiolo","What we saw, again, is -- let me start with a little longer-term, and then, what we saw in the quarter. What we saw longer-term is that we've been getting very good strong inflows into the company from a client perspective over the last year. And we've also seen some strong inflows consistently into our wrap business. I think the first quarter this year was exceptionally strong. Now 2 things, a little to even out sort of that trend a little bit. We did see a pickup in cash, holding cash at the end of the year as dividends were more significant, as well as people maintaining some of their cash to see what happens at the end of the year. But if you looked at our balances, our cash balances are very high, still, and they only went down about a $1 billion that rotated back in through the wrap business. So I would say, overall, we still see a good trend of new business coming in, they're going into the wrap fee-based area. And our cash balances are still at an -- abnormally high, even though they've come down a little from the end of the year. So as long as markets don't ratchet tremendously, we don't see a fundamental change in that at this point in time. In regard to some of the current period activity, it's picked up a little on a transaction, but there, it's not at a high level yet. And so again, I think as people feel more confident and start thinking about longer term, we may see a further pickup there. But again, that all depends on environment, as well as market conditions. But I would say, what we're experienced in productivity from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, I don't see a fundamental change. I can't predict. Summer months always slow down a little bit. But that's as we look further out.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Second, just going back to the issue with regards to flows. As you mentioned in your comments, most of the outflows continue to rate to BofA, Balboa, Moscow [ph] and Zurich. So out of your $430 billion-or-so of assets under management, is it possible to get details as to how much of the AUM relates to those buckets? If not in isolation, at least, in aggregate?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. I think we could probably -- we'll actually see if we can -- what we can put together. I think we disclosed now we're separating out and giving you a line item to talk about Zurich. I think we don't like to break out sensitivity on client per se. But I think what we could do is probably give you at least a perspective on some of these affiliated type areas. But let me check with the group and see what we can do to provide some information. What we did try to say to you, clearly in this quarter, is what Zurich will continue to mean to us. So don't get me wrong, there's replenishment in a sense of what that basis of assets and as it appreciate, et cetera. But there will be an ongoing -- it's consistent from the day we bought Zurich -- Threadneedle from Zurich. So I don't see that fundamentally changing as long as we have that mandate, which is a good relationship. In Columbia, I think it's going to be similar. You have some of these low fee type of institutional businesses that were part of bank relationships. And I think that has come down a lot, but there are still billions left there. But they're at very low fee basis points like Balboa. And then, there are the ongoing relationships, including things like the U.S. Trust that will be a good relationship that we want to continue to focus on and invest in. But just based on the starting point of that being a primary asset manager for the business, we will have experienced normal outflows as that business continues to diversify a bit. So we'll see what we can provide you moving forward. But I wanted to be clear upfront here, that on an ongoing basis, for both of those, it will be a few billion each. But we believe that we could manage that, and we believe that as we continue to redeploy our focus and resources for building, that we'll offset that, particularly on a fee basis moving forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jim, thanks for the update on your appetite for deals, I think it's helpful. But I guess, broadly, it may be helpful to kind of revisit how you guys think about excess capital with respect to deals as you kind of continue to look for, maybe, other opportunities. So, I mean, Walter, I think you highlighted $2 billion of excess capital. I think you guys removed the ploy [ph], but I don't know if it's intentionally or not. But can we think about the $2 billion again, if it's available for deals, you guys will look at everything, but over time, if there are no deals, you'll continue to return kind of 100% of earnings, plus over time we'll be dipping into the $2 billion cushion?","James M. Cracchiolo","I think you said that very well. So, yes, that is exactly how we're thinking about it. It doesn't mean that we won't look. But as I said, unless there's something that we feel is really appropriate for us that will further strategically add value and that we can get a good return for shareholders, our primary will be continuing to return to shareholders through buyback and dividend, as we've been doing. So no change in that direction. Walter?","Walter S. Berman","Yes. The only thing I would add, Alex -- excuse me, it's Walter -- is that even as we go to add -- return more to, we have the ability to accumulate a lot. So if something does come up, we have the ability also to engage there.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, helpful. And I just want to go back for a second to AWM, on margins. I remember, a couple of years ago, you guys were hoping to get to 12%. And now, you're clearly at 13% with still a decent amount of headwinds in the business. Can you give us a sense where the employee margins are versus the franchisee margins? And can't we think about the target margin in that whole segment closer to mid-teens versus, I guess, what you guys used to target?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I would say -- listen, we've been able to overcome significant headwinds. As Walter outlined, just year-over-year, where we're already at low rates, as various Bernanke made the latest adjustment back in August. That's another $10 million in the quarter lower than it was just last year, and we know how low that was. And we've been able to offset that from improvements through productivity and expense management. And then we took the bank out, which also really compressed margins by, well, just add 130 basis points on top of that. So if you put those 2 back in, you're close to 15% today based on what we said to you previously that we wanted to get to 12%. And the 12% included interest rates coming back at the time. So we've more than offset the interest rate headwinds and it's actually gone far beyond that. In regard to your next question regarding the 2 channels, the employee channel is not at the margins we want them to be at, as we continue to build the capacity and get the productivity where we want that to be, as we have invested in that area. So we're probably around the breakeven point right now. And so, as we continue to add productivity there, advisors, et cetera, we can definitely get that into the type of margins that we're talking across the business, which gets you, again, that boost that you've mentioned.","Operator","And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple questions on the flows. First, Jim, you had mentioned the RIA share class change and that it had an impact on the flows, that you would expect that impact to continue going forward. Can you just give us a sense of order of magnitude, how much of an impact on the flows that had in the quarter?","James M. Cracchiolo","In the first quarter, that was roughly about $600 million. And that was what normally would have been an inflow that we would have experienced to turn that into about a $600 million outflow, so that the change was probably a bit more significant than $600 million. Now again, that was a repricing which closed out an old share class. So there are some effects to that, that people make a decision on. We think we still have a good business there. We think that a good number of people are staying in as the share class shifts. Having said that, it was an effect in the retail flows in the first quarter, probably closer to the 6-plus hundred million that would've been slightly positive, let's say, or a little positive to a negative.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And about -- is that about the rate that we should expect kind of going forward?","James M. Cracchiolo","I think in the second quarter, it might be a bit higher, only because it was fully enacted by the end of March, February and March. So again, we don't know exactly. But I would just say, second quarter would be a sort of a -- the bigger quarter possibly for it. And again, I think even after that's over, economically, we'll be better off.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, understood. Turning to Institutional at Columbia. In the past, you guys have talked about a building pipeline. It was probably the biggest pipeline it's been, I think is the way you characterized it at some point in recent quarters. And my understanding is that pipeline, in terms of mandates filling or funding, has been delayed a little bit. So I was wondering if, a, you could talk about that? And then b, can you give us a sense of order of magnitude of what that pipeline is? In other words, if everything just magically funded today, is it $1 billion? Is it $5 billion? I mean, just some sense of what we could expect if those mandates eventually fund?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. So if we just look back over the number of periods, remember, we had to rebuild this. We were on hold with consultants, et cetera. We got off hold beginning part of the last year. And so since those points, our pipeline is the highest it's ever been and it continues to grow. We have -- I don't want to give actual numbers here, but it's significantly up from where it was 2 years ago, and even nice strongly up from where it was a year ago. And we're in a lot of pending finals. And we usually have very good win rates, ultimately. So once we can get in the door. Now having said that, it's taken a little time to get a broader, what I would call, a broader set of funds to be considered. And I think we're finally getting there. We -- as an example, I'll give you this out. We have wins to be funded of $1.4 billion. Now again, you can't exactly time that. We thought some of that would come in, in the first quarter, it didn't. But we know, based on a year ago, that a lot of what does win does get funded, but it does sometimes take a bit more than a quarter to do that. So I would just say that the pipeline is building. I'll ask the team what we feel comfortable with as we go forward. But there are billions in the pipeline and billions in the finals. And so, what we already won is another billion-plus. So I think, unfortunately, what we got hit in the first quarter is winnings didn't fund as quickly and people rotated out of some very good mandates because of what they thought were going to happen in the fixed income market. And it was unfortunate that the -- it compounded what that looked like. Having said that, our team feels good about what they got in the pipeline. It doesn't mean we won't lose some low-basis-point stuff from the bank-affiliated type things that are very low margin that goes into those numbers. But we'll try to clearly identify that for you moving forward. Listen, we're not declaring success here. We're declaring that we're hard at work. We've got to build and we've got to keep on getting out to the market and expanding. But we do believe we're gaining traction. It's just for you, and I can fully understand, it's hard to see when you see these substantial outflows from -- of these categories.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just a final -- my last question is on Columbia. So I think we're about 3 years after the close. And I think pretty much every year, we've been in outflows. And I understand that there's been some cyclical headwinds and the former parent stuff, and I get all that stuff. But I guess my question is, as we think back to over the past couple of years, what, if anything, have you learned from the experience with Columbia that you would take to, say, another acquisition that you might decide to pursue down the road? Were there any lessons learned that you could share with us?","James M. Cracchiolo","There's always a lot of lessons to be learned. So I would say things always take a bit longer than you always think. For instance, you think some of the stuff -- let's say, we're talking about flows. Some of that stuff would either wash out quickly or adjustments would be made or you can be clear on what that is, and it's not always easy to do that. I would say, even when you integrate and merge, you may have a very clear plan and roadmap. Having said that, the execution of it takes a lot of parties, whether they be internal, external, providers, boards, et cetera, that always take a bit longer. You also, even in a deal, you've learned some things as you dig under the covers more and whether you peel the onion in regard to what's really from a parent perspective or an economic or a distribution. Having said all of that, and if I had to retrace steps, I think we did an excellent deal. I think we're providing a tremendous transformation for what we had. I think we bought a good business. I think we worked with a good partner in Bank of America and to orchestrate this and do this. And I think if you go back to where we were and where we are today and you look at our total Asset Management business combined, where we're generating over $0.5 billion of PTI, even with these outflows, could they -- would you have liked that to be done so the optics are different, absolutely. But for just like I did Threadneedle, I've got optics of outflows, but I've created a wonderful business in Threadneedle with a diversified, strong asset management company, #4 in the U.K. market and expanding. So I would just say, the flows are an optic thing right now, but look at the profitability, look at the makeup, look at the positioning we have as one of the larger providers that we can build upon. And we've learned a lot. So if I had to do another deal, I'll know a lot more about what I would do and say and how do I orchestrate it. But I also would say, if you look beyond the quarter or you look at beyond the one indicator and look at the total, and you can go back quarter to quarter and go back to the past, we've created a very large, successful -- we think will be very successful over time but it's going to take more work -- asset manager that's generating very strong profitability, I would compare it against anything in the industry, has a good product lineup, has good investment performance and expanding distribution. So I know it's hard, Suneet, as you look at the period and say, \"Well, why aren't the flows turning around?\" But even if I suffer continued outflows from ex-parent perspective but I'm building a stronger business with stronger profitability, I think that's fine. If I did another deal, let's say, and you buy it from somebody else, you're going to experience outflows in a consistent, particularly if it was a parent-owned entity. But if you can derive good value from it, then I think we have to explain that a bit better than we've been able to.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have one on Asset Management. Jim or Walter, if I look at the management fees as a percentage of average AUM, in other words, the fee rate, it jumped up this quarter very nicely. And I assume that's reflective of some of the things you've been talking about, a higher proportion of assets coming from retail, some of the lower-fee business outflowing. I guess my question is, can we expect that, that fee rate can continue to move higher from here? And if so, is there any help you can provide us in terms of thinking about at what pace?","Walter S. Berman","I think the observations you have are correct. And I think again, there's a market factor in there and other elements. So I think we can't be that predictive. But it's certainly -- and the 2 fee days left -- less. But [indiscernible] I think we should see that, again, you can't control the market, but certainly the trend line is reasonable.","James M. Cracchiolo","And I'd also say that we have more work to do regarding various pricing and things that we have with fee waivers and caps and various things to get that orchestrated even more appropriately over time. We did a lot of mergers. We did a lot of movement of funds. And I think that, that has caused some issues for us that we're -- we've started to make some changes with a year ago, that's being factored in there, that we need to continue to focus time and attention on.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So even the revenue enhancement side of that is not yet fully baked in yet?","James M. Cracchiolo","No. I think we've got to do more work, including with our fund boards to really go over that, to understand what has changed in the dynamics and why. We do have a good philosophy of giving and having good reasonable fees. Having said that, I think when we did a lot of these merges and caps between 2 fund families, that actually put a bit more of a pressure and burden that I don't think is necessarily appropriate at this point.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then Jim, sort of right upfront in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're not seeing, at least currently, acquisition opportunities that meet your internal criteria. I was just hoping you could put maybe a finer point on that and help us understand, maybe more specifically, what those hurdles are?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, I think what I would say, and Walter can complement this, we have a few hurdles. So one would be, we start off with the idea that, does this add value overall to our franchise longer term? Because any deal that you do, you have, just like Suneet asked, what are the learnings, you have a lot to do with integration, you have a lot to do with change in flows and people and talent, et cetera. And so, you always have to look at that to say, \"Does 2 and 2 equal something more than 4?\" Hopefully, it doesn't give you 3. So the first thing is, does it add or complement the product line? Does it give you enough additional capacity? Can you consolidate, in the right way, to free up resources? And so we go through that, that gives us a financial analysis as well. And economically, does it give us as good a return as if we return to shareholders in a  different way. And so there are always opportunities. The question is, can you get them to work for you and do they detract you from the things that you think will build even a stronger business and prevent -- present an opportunity cost","or not? And so it's not that we don't look at things. We look at things, and each of those properties have some benefits and some of them that could be detractors or have some issues with them. And I think, as you also asked, we have continued to get smarter based on the learnings of doing Threadneedle, Seligman and Columbia now, so I think we're not naive anymore as we go in. But I think we've done a good job in each of these. And I think we factor in those learnings and our experience as we look at any other opportunity that approaches. So is the world continuing to consolidate at one level? The answer is yes. You'll continue to see transactions out in the marketplace. Will we be able to play in them? I think we do based on our experience and our capacity and free cash that we can utilize. But will we just do it because there's a deal out there? The answer is no. And so those are the things we take into account. Beyond that, I mean, we have a very detailed thing that we go through to analyze whether something adds value or not, so I don't want to disclose that strategically here on a phone call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, my question. I just have one that really bridges the Asset Management and the Wealth Management area, the Advice & Wealth management area, and it is this. It's striking to me that you've achieved continuing significant success with your RAP program, and yet the success, I think this would be probably to put it -- would be to put it generously, has been on-again, off-again in retail mutual funds. Contrast the 2 businesses. Why do you think you have been able to be as successful, continuously bringing in net flows in the RAP area, but not in retail funds?","James M. Cracchiolo","So I think, Eric, I think we are successful because in our RAP area are the funds underneath it that I think, as an example, we continue to do well as Columbia, including in our channel. Having said that, we have an open architecture channel and therefore, we're never going to win the -- all the old business. Now if you think about what we're experiencing for Bank of America and Zurich, again, these were proprietary businesses at one point that they captured a substantial amount of sales within each of those channels, just like we did at Ameriprise many years ago. And it took us years to sort of go through that leveling out as an impact. So part of that is what you may see in the overall fund types. The second part is, to be very clear, now we are going to grow, how, through third-party. And so even though we are maintaining good sale share, let's say, at Ameriprise, and even, let's say, at some of the Bank of America activities as they further diversify, we now have to gain further traction. And when we were RiverSource, remember, we started a third-party business. We were just starting to develop it. At Columbia, they developed the third-party business, and part of what they did at Columbia in establishing that is some of their hotter products that they sold were, unfortunately, in just a few areas. And so as those areas have changed now, some subadvisor and some types of funds where people have moved on and retired, they've been impacted a bit more by outflows. But if we look at our gross sales, our gross sales are still good and strong, and we do a significant amount of tonnage. However, we've been even having a part of a redemption, and what we have to do is grow beyond those proprietary channels even more strongly now into third-party. And so that's really the changeover. And so I would say that we need to work at this a bit longer. We need to -- we took a major organization and merged it together over the last 3 years. And it's only at the end of, let you think, mid-year 212 (sic)","that we're over the merger activities. And unfortunately, I think we would've all liked to come out of this a bit stronger, it's requiring a bit more time and effort. But I think we got a lot of the good pieces in place to do that. And we do see signs of success. But having said that, we got a very big fund family today and a very big asset base. We have $450 billion of assets under management. So we've got to get more cylinders firing to offset some of the ex-parents stuff to get into a growth mode when we look at overall flows. I think we may find it a bit easier to do that on a fee basis, rather than in an absolute flow basis. And that's exactly what we experienced when we did Threadneedle with Zurich. Our flows weren't oversized in a positive, but our fees were, over time.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I could ask just one more question. And you've touched on this, but I'm hoping you can build on your answer. It's clear that you think, at least to me it seems apparent that you believe this acquisition has been a success despite the negative optics of negative flows, which I think have been almost every quarter. If we can get a sharper point on what measures, not the measures that you see, but the measures that we in the public can see, what are the measures that we in the public can see that you would point to, that you would think best speak to the success of this acquisition?","James M. Cracchiolo","I'll talk a few, and I'll let Walter talk to the economics. First of all, I would say, we have a fund family that we're #8 in the U.S. We, today, have 50-plus 4- and 5-star funds in most categories. We have a more diversified and larger distribution platform than we've ever had before. We have good, talented people that have good performance in a larger areas than we ever had in capability. We are a fund complex to be reckoned with out there. I think you can compare the economics over and the size of scope and the performance and the number of funds against any other fund family out there. And you can see that we are one of the larger, more significant players. That's a few. Walter, why don't you give them the law [ph] on the economics?","Walter S. Berman","Sure. Eric, clearly, it's been transformational from our PE, from our IRR objectives, as we talked about it, it was 30%. It's been north of that. And currently, from every aspect financially, the program of both the capabilities that we now have and really, the potential has really been a major, major shareholder value to the firm. So -- on any measure we have looked at, this has been excellent.","James M. Cracchiolo","So I think you're asking on excellent question, Eric. I think, as I said, I think I would look at the more absolute dimensions and where we're situated. I mean, the other thing I would just say is this. We're only at the first or second inning of now taking Columbia because we had to focus on integrating Columbia, and putting Threadneedle with Columbia. And now we're really working on some global product, emerging markets, asset allocation. We've just brought in some senior talent there. And we see some good opportunity. We're expanding in Asia. We set up offices out there, and we're winning mandates already. So listen, I think we got more work to do. It's a competitive world. There's a lot of good players in the industry. But we are a player today. Where in the past, we weren't able to compete on a full-scale basis. Now it doesn't mean it's going to be easy, particularly to establish ourselves even more globally, but I think we have a lot of the capabilities and foundation to do so. But we're going to work hard. We've got to get those flows turned. We've got to win more business. We've got to develop some of the more global capabilities that I think we already got some good things that are coming to -- will come to fruition towards the latter part of this year. So listen, we are not satisfied. This is an area that we got to get a bit stronger in and better. But on the other side, we're generating good strong profitability. I think if you put us against a lot of -- outside of the very largest players out there, I think you'll find that we're right in the mix there. And you can look at all the dimensions I've mentioned to you. And I think we compare quite favorably. More to do. There are some areas we can get better. But I think we're in good shape.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Schuman from KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I was hoping we could talk a little bit about the fixed annuity block. Can you give us some sense of what the crediting rate or spread opportunity is when that book matures?","Walter S. Berman","You're talking about -- it's Walter. You're talking about the 5-year book?","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Walter S. Berman","Yes. What is going to happen here, if you take a look at this, it has 2 major components. Primarily, there's an outside distribution channel, which has a guaranteed minimum interest rate that's going to be in the 3.5% range, which obviously on that basis, we will on then adjust to it, but that will give you a compression. The balance of it, however, both on the ID channel and some of the OD channel, is in the 1.5% range. And obviously, that would then bring down and prove, as we go into 2014 and start repricing this spread compression that we've had as we rebalance that. Obviously, we have to look at being -- certainly what's available out there from that standpoint and our alternatives to our clients. And -- but it clearly will be -- as we indicated this year, we are -- the bulk of the $115 billion -- $115 million that we're taking an interest rate, that would start in -- basically be mitigated in the area of the annuity as we go into '14 and certainly, in '15. Again, it depends on the environment because I can't say what we're going to price that yet, depends on what the rate is going to be out there. But that -- it certainly gives us that leg in to really readjust that and then be balanced with our shareholders and clients. Okay? Is that okay?","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] So the outside distributed stuff, the 3.5%, that is still some kind of a floor that would remain in effect. Is that what you're saying?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, absolutely.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So not so much opportunity there...","Walter S. Berman","For that one.  And that's about -- if you talk about the $4 billion, that's about 30% of it there. $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of it.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And are there other similar blocks of this type of annuity that will come out of the guarantee period in subsequent years? Or is this pretty much the one kind of big block of this nature?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, this is a big block. The other is the 1 year that's been -- a lot of it's been out of surrender. And obviously, they have high guaranteed minimum interest rates.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then one other thing, we talked a lot about the share class and the flows on the RIA business, but what is kind of the base of AUM for RIA business?","Walter S. Berman","Right now, I don't have that. For RIA business base it's -- I don't want to guess. So why don't we get back to you on the RIA base because I don't want to give something that's -- it's not at the tip of my hands right now.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Just -- we've talked in great detail about the different flow dynamics, but I want to make sure I understood what I thought I heard Jim say in his opening comments. I thought I heard Jim say that, all in, the expectation was that flows might improve over the course of the year. Is that -- did I understand sort of the bottom line correctly that when we factor in all these kind of bottom-up inputs that you still would hope to improve from this level?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I think again, we can't dictate when some of the lumpiness, some of the mandates change. But what I am saying to you, and again, let me try to be clear, as clear as I can be right now. We will, even after this year, okay? So let's say, we will experience Balboa and some other things happening this year. Even after this year, for some of these lumpy institutional, low-fee type of things, we will still, always -- and so in Threadneedle, the way I would look at it if I was you is this, are we gaining good flows in Threadneedle from retail and institutional through third-party x Zurich? Because Zurich will be in an outflow on an ongoing basis from $3 billion to $4 billion a year. And if the answer is yes, even if flows are at breakeven or negative, but they will offset the negative in flows because of higher-fee business, that's going to be a positive. And so I'm not saying we won't be in inflows in Thread. You can see in periods like including last year, we were in strong inflows in certain periods, but it's always every quarter, there's a $1 billion, $1.5 billion of outflows from Zurich. And you say, \"Well, it's not that strong.\" It's at -- that's a very strong good business of the net of those 2, even if they come to breakeven or positive after offsetting those outflows, or even negative to some extent. We're going to still have some of that for Columbia as well. We believe we can get into positive net inflows in Columbia. Again, similar to what we're doing with Threadneedle. But we're always going to experience some level of outflow from the bank, bank-affiliated distribution, that are good agreements, good relationships, good base of assets. But I will tell you that when you look at the gross gross, you're going to say, \"Well, why isn't it possibly stronger?\" I would say on the gross side, it will be strong and growing. On the net side, we will have some of those consistent outflows. But that doesn't mean it's a bad thing for us. It means that it was part of the arrangement we made when we purchased this, moving from a proprietary type of relationship to a third-party relationship. But our flows this year, we are targeting them to improve from what we've seen in the first quarter. And we're targeting that we will gain more third-party activities, both in the Institutional and improving in the retail. And so that's what we would say. But we don't have a perfect crystal ball. That's what we and the team are working on.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I think we all do understand some of these basic dynamics you're talking about. But I would just simply echo Nigel's point, which is, to the extent that you'd give us better transparency, as you did a little bit this quarter with the Zurich outflows -- I mean, if you give us more transparency, it's much easier for us to wrap our hands around it and understand it.","James M. Cracchiolo","I agree with you. I actually agree full. So we'll see what we can do appropriate, and that's why we tried to have this conversation. Your questions are right on target. And I can understand, sitting where you are, and sometimes even sitting where I am. It's always easier as you break them down into different buckets. We'll see if we can even get better as we go forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just to completely beat a dead horse here, just one other question on the flows. The news or the guidance you're giving us on Threadneedle and Zurich assets, pretty consistent with what you've said in the past, so that doesn't sound new. The guidance on Columbia is new though, just in terms of the expectation that you're going to continue to see outflows. And I heard everything you've gone through, but I just want to know from your standpoint because I think, leading up to this quarter, the expectation that you had had was that, we would have more of a near-term end to the legacy flows. So I just want to get a sense for what is it that you've seen behind the scenes? Is it simply just the continued leakage? Is it some new development on the U.S. trust side? I just want to get a little more color for what the change in tone from you is, your management team? Just in terms of what you are seeing now, is there -- has there been a change? Or is it just more -- you've just gotten to the point where you're not willing to draw the line in the sand that this is going to abate? So anyway, that's my one question on the flows.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I think -- again, a good question, Nigel. I think what it is, is I think what we concentrated initially on was some of the larger buckets that we knew would adjust in the periods right after the acquisition. We knew things like Balboa. We knew that there were low fees, prepaid type accounts and institutional accounts. And a lot of that has occurred as we thought, maybe a little longer it took than we thought. When someone says we sold the insurance block, we figured that would go sooner than later, and it's been a drip, drip, drip. There are some of those institutional relationships that are still there. Again, we're not going to try to move on them. I mean, they're there and they're good to the extent that they're there. But we know, at one point, they will move out. We probably just assumed that some of that would move quicker than it had. A thing that I think is different is, as we sort through all the lumpiness of it, what we also recognize now is there is a -- also a continued large installed base of assets that we have a good relationship with Bank of America or their affiliates. We want to maintain that relationship even beyond whatever the initial contractual period on an ongoing. We think it's good for them. They think it's good for them. We think it's good for us. And so we're working hard to keep that relationship. Having said that, there was a level of concentration in there. There was a level of asset base as they looked to make some changes or they're dealing with how they want to look at their business that we know that we will be affected. Similar to, in a certain sense, not that these are closed-book assets or anything, but similar to the sense of what we dealt with Zurich or even in Ameriprise's proprietary system at one point. And so, now that we have greater optics to that, we understand a little more of what are the dynamics there, we're probably saying, this is what we're beginning to see more as we go further after the first level of the consolidation is over and the lumpiness is out. And so I don't know if we would have known all this initially. We didn't. Having said that, we don't think that it will, in some way, cause us not to be in a good, strong business that we can grow, but it will be an ongoing effect. And we're trying to make it clear to you, so that we -- as your colleagues -- as your peers just asked, we're trying to give you some color for what we're trying to do. And in that regard, we believe that we can do that well. Having said that, we do know the optics of flows is where everyone concentrates on. We're probably saying, you've got to look beyond what the -- just the one flow number is to look at the dynamics of the flow number. And then, what are we doing, as a total picture, to make the changes necessary so that we can be a good competitor. And that's probably what we're trying to bring to light. I don't think we knew all of this previously. So as we knew it and understand it and we continue to lay out our strategy moving forward, I am trying to be clearer to you. When we first did Zurich, we never came out initially, again, not knowing, to say Zurich will be an outflow of $3 billion to $4 billion. It was more of can you maintain that relationship and that agreement and all that stuff. And over time, we learned a bit more as we peeled the onion and we reestablished that relationship in appropriate way. And so, we want that relationship. It's a good relationship. But what we learned and what we continue to tell you every -- now, more formally, every year, is what that will look like so that you can do your math and you can understand the dynamics. And that's all we're trying to do here. I don't think we know everything going into any arrangement, particularly of the size and scope that we were talking about here.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No. That's helpful, Jim. So if I can paraphrase at least the way I'm understanding this is, there's a larger pool of assets now, under which you thought when you initially did the deal, there was a distribution opportunity. Now, as you assess those pool of assets and the distribution opportunity, the distribution opportunity probably isn't there for a larger pool of assets, which means it's more -- there's a larger amount of assets in a closed block that we should be thinking about in more of a closed-block context.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, I wouldn't call it a closed. But what I would say is, it would get into a more normalized overall rate from a sale and a redemption perspective. So over time, I think that will start to mediate, et cetera. But what we're saying to you is, good, strong relationship in a certain area that we're going to maintain and do our best to continue to replenish and build. But just based upon the level that was there already, there's a natural outflow from that because we were pretty significant and, let's say, fixed in municipals. So as there's a diversification, including with more diversified equity and passives and stuff going on to various platforms, we're not going to always garner what that total flow was when it was part of Bank of America entity, or even if it was, let's say, Bank of America would be making changes today, even if that was -- Columbia was still a part of them. So that's all I'm saying is, there's that natural evolution that's occurring there that we're going to be affected by because we were a very large provider in that channel. And that's what we're saying. Now having said that, the world changes. Just like with Ameriprise, we changed and we had to grow other areas of distribution to offset that. That's exactly what's occurring here for Columbia. Is that helpful?","Operator","And our last question comes from John Hall from Wells Fargo Securities.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. I'll try to be real tight here. Jim, on the global initiatives, I was just wondering if you could give us a quick progress report and maybe a time frame as to when we might see those take hold?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. So what we're actually seeing right now and doing is, we've actually had some pretty good product in emerging market equity and debt, et cetera. And what we are doing is, we had some good people in Threadneedle, as well as Columbia. We're putting those resources together even more formally. We've already established some reasonably good track records in these areas, and we're going to be able to go to market even more substantially by having a stronger, larger depth of team resources and more track records. And I think we're going to be in market for our first few activities in the second half of this year that we're going to try to actually put in our toolbox to even be more focused on in selling in the institutional channels. We also have made some good headway in sharing things and building the depth of our research for global fixed income, as well as global equities, putting together some of the sub-portfolios that Threadneedle has some excellent results in, in let's say European, and we have here in the U.S. that we manage in certain areas. And so those things are coming together. We also now have put together a more formalized global team in asset allocation. We brought in Jeff Knight, and Jeff is leading our efforts there. We have some good portfolios today in asset allocation. He's building that into a more comprehensive global platform and taking resources that we have that are managing those type of things, both in the U.S. as well as at Threadneedle. So again, we're not standing still there, but these things take a little time. But we will start to put some of those things in the market more formally in the second half and build upon that over the next 18 to 24 months.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I'll now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","On slide 2 of the earnings presentation material that are available on our website, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectation about future events and overall operating plans and performance.","These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risk factors and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2017 earnings release, our 2016 Annual Report to shareholders, and our 2016 10-K Report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","Turning to slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that you see our operating results, which management believes, enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The comments that management makes on our call today will focus on operating financial results.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for joining today's earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business, Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail and then we'll take your questions. Let's get started. Ameriprise reported strong second quarter results led by our Wealth Management business. In a period of change in opportunity for the industry, we're delivering excellent growth in earnings and earnings per share and we had very good momentum in a number of important metrics including nice growth in Ameriprise client assets, client net inflows, as well as advisor productivity.","With favorable equity markets and low volatility, clients are putting more money to work. It's also good to see that short-term interest rates are slowly coming off of record lows. Consistent with our strategy, we're serving client needs and growing our fee-based businesses which continue to become even larger contributors to total earnings. Our business creates significant free cash flow that supports our growth, our investments and our return to shareholders. In terms of the regulatory environment, we're managing well through an ongoing period of change. Regarding the Department of Labor Fiduciary Rule, Ameriprise and our advisors were well prepared for the June 9th implementation.","As part of our comprehensive advisor support plan, including the series of webcasts and more than 100 training sessions over the last few months, we continue to provide clear direction and extensive training for our advisors so that they are well supported and able to continue serving clients and building their practices through this time. We eliminated 12b-1 fees in advisory accounts earlier this year as we highlighted and we've also streamlined our fund range like others. We're currently working to be ready for any further requirements that may be necessary on January 1 and continue to have appropriate resources devoted to this work.","Let's move right into Advice & Wealth Management where we had an excellent quarter. As I mentioned at the opening, we achieved strong growth in client assets. In fact, Ameriprise client assets increased 11% to $512 billion, a new high. Net inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts were $4.5 billion, another all-time high. This marks our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in wrap flows and bodes well for the rest of the year. As we discussed with you, serving more investors in the $500,000 to $5 million range is a key priority and client acquisitions increased nicely, especially in this target market. And we're serving more $1 million-plus clients than ever before.","We continue to invest in our brand, in marketing and our social media presence. Ameriprise brand awareness is again at our record high of 66%. Our Be Brilliant TV, digital and social media advertising continues to resonate with consumers and advisors and we're finalizing the third phase of this advertising that will come out in the fall. Advisor recruiting is another positive for us with 81 experienced advisors joining Ameriprise in the quarter. Importantly, advisors joining us from wirehouses, regionals and independents are, on average, more than a third more productive than advisors recruited this time a year ago.","Across our network, advisor productivity continues to grow nicely. Ameriprise advisors have consistently increased productivity at a higher rate than many of our competitors, and for the quarter, productivity was up another 9%. Normalized for the net impact of transitioning advisory accounts to share classes without 12b-1 fees, productivity would have increased 14% on a quarterly basis. As the leader in advice, Ameriprise is differentiated in the marketplace. Consumers need to plan and accumulate wealth for retirement and we're well positioned to serve this need. Our Confident Retirement approach creates real value for our clients. Our research consistently shows that it contributes to a very high satisfaction with Ameriprise and their advisor, and their clients are committed to implementing the recommendations and feel more confident.","This approach also works well across all life stages. So, we're very focused on cross-generational opportunity in our Wealth Management business to acquire and serve more clients, people who'll prefer to work with a seasoned professional to guide their future in a digitally enabled relationship. The Ameriprise culture and the way we work with clients continue to be important differentiators. I want to let you know that I'm very proud of how Ameriprise is being recognized in the marketplace in many important ways. From the 2017 Temkin Group ratings, we were number one for customer service across the investment industry. Importantly, we're also second in trust across the investment firms. As well, number one for forgiveness, the likelihood of consumers to forgive a company, if it made a mistake.","And in the Hearts and Wallets' Wants and Pricing survey, Ameriprise was rated a top performer in customer ratings based on being unbiased and putting clients' interests first, which is what the DOL fiduciary rule is all about. Ameriprise also stands out for our very engaged culture. We've earned leading employee and advisor engagement for many years. And earlier this month, career website Indeed.com named Ameriprise as one of the Top 50 Best Places to Work. I believe this important recognition further underscores that the Ameriprise advice value proposition and the way we do business positively influence client satisfaction, loyalty as well as our strong culture; all vital to our long-term growth.","Meanwhile, we continue to invest significantly to enhance our client experience. This includes further digitally enabling the advice experience our advisors provide and making our financial planning process even more collaborative. We're also investing in making goal and performance tracking easier and providing advisors with dedicated local leadership and training to support this work. And as you know, robust information security is more critical than ever. We invest tens of millions of dollars annually in people, processes and tools to protect our clients' information and the firm through a multi-layered approach to security.","Finally, in July, we officially closed the acquisition of Investment Professionals, Inc., an independent broker-dealer based in San Antonio, specializing in on-site delivery of investment programs for financial institutions, including banks and credit unions. This is a new channel for us and one, we believe, will be a great complement to Ameriprise.","As we move forward, Advice & Wealth Management is situated well. We focused on serving clients and growing the business as more consumers realize they need guidance on accumulating for retirement and other important goals as well as managing their wealth through retirement. Our insurance and annuity businesses provide important solutions to our clients, help protect their wealth and generate retirement income. Consistent with what we discussed with you, we continue to maintain very strong books of business and manage our growth. In addition to offering clients important income protection benefits, these businesses deliver strategic benefits for Ameriprise, including contributing to high client satisfaction and asset persistency.","The businesses are performing as we expected given low rates and industry trends. In annuities, variable account balances increased to $77 billion on market appreciation, which more than offset redemptions and slower sales, both are industry trends. We consistently had annual sales in the $4 billion to $5 billion range. This quarter was at the low end of our range given the shift of sales. In insurance, we've seen a nice pickup in cash sales from a year ago. UL and VUL sales are up 18% with good growth in installment sales and lump sum deposits. We continue to focus on asset accumulation primarily in variable universal life and universal life products.","In Auto and Home, our financial results continue to improve in line with our actions we've taken across all parts of the company, especially in product pricing, underwriting and claims. Leading indicators in these areas point to continued improvement in the underlying business, but like many personal line insurers, we experience elevated levels of cat losses in the quarter which were significant, particularly from a historic Colorado hailstorm and significant hail events in Minnesota and Texas. We recently implemented several new reinsurance programs that helped reduce some of the effect of these cats on our results. We continue to improve the book, take rate in several areas, underlying loss ratios continue to trend lower and we feel good about how we're tracking with our plans.","In Asset Management, we're growing assets under management and generating good financial results. We're executing our plans as we adapt to industry changes and invest in areas where we see near and long-term growth opportunities. Total assets under management grew to $473 billion. Markets have been favorable which helped to more than offset net outflows. I'll start by providing more color on flows in the quarter. We've been impacted like the industry and working hard to make the changes we need, but there is more to do.","The majority of our outflows, $7 billion of the $8.7 billion, were lower fee former parent assets, most of which related to particular events or actions. As we discussed with you, we have large important relationships with Zurich and U.S. Trust from our prior acquisitions. These relationships provide a nice base of assets as we continue to focus on growing higher fee third-party assets. Given the nature of these books, we typically average a couple billion of outflows per quarter. It was higher in the second quarter, as Zurich redeemed a large pool of low fee pension assets of $3.6 billion and outflows at U.S. Trust were higher because of mutually agreed upon actions that should improve our economics over time.","In third-party retail, like other active managers, we're experiencing pressure from industry flows into passive, especially here in the United States. U.S. intermediary experienced outflows of about $1 billion after dividends reinvested. While the environment remains challenging, we're focused on building our offering in categories where assets are flowing. While we've made some progress, our flows are not where we want and we continue to focus on improvement.","In the U.K. and Europe, we are in net inflows of $500 million as the political environment has settled somewhat and investment sentiment has improved. And in the third party institutional, we're seeing mandates fund as expected. However, this was offset by $500 million outflow from a large client seeking liquidity and about $800 million in outflows from CDO liquidations.","Let's move to investment performance. It remains strong and will continue to be a benefit as we look to garner flows for the future. We had a good first half of 2017 and we're delivering compelling 3, 5, and 10-year investment track records. Our U.S. and U.K. equity franchises are strong and we're benefiting from our quality growth bias in equities this year. Regarding fixed income, our long-term track records are strong and our taxable performance has improved nicely over the last year.","The 114 Morningstar four- and five-star funds we offer reflect good performance we're delivering. As we look to continue to improve our flows, there are a number of things we're focused on. First, we're enhancing and aligning our distribution by executing a more informed and targeted channel strategy and putting the right resources where we're looking to grow. That includes within DCIO, where we've added a new head of the business to complement the team.","Second, with broad capabilities and equities, fixed income and multi-asset, we're serving client needs and ensuring our products address the important investment themes, generating income, managing taxes, managing changing rates and growing assets to deliver the outcomes they're looking for.","Third, we're enhancing our product lines in a number of areas such as in solutions. We continue to build out our multi-asset business. We're seeing good interest in our adaptive risk allocation capability in both retail and institutional channels in the U.S. We have a nice base of assets of just over $4 billion that we've grown and have garnered strong three year numbers for us to build on.","We're also building out our solutions internationally with the Dynamic Real Return fund in the United Kingdom and seeing good results, and we'll be launching a complementary solution in the European market. In the responsible investment space, we have over $30 billion in assets under management and we're adding to our product line and launched the Threadneedle European Social Bond Fund to complement our U.K. and U.S. funds. And in Strategic Beta, we've integrated the EGA acquisition, and have a strong team in place. Our sustainable ETFs have established one-year track records and we intend to expand our product lineup beyond equities to fixed income later this year.","Fourth, we're strengthening awareness of Columbia Threadneedle. Our global advertising campaign centered around consistency is resonating in the marketplace. Fifth, as we discussed, we have an important project underway to move from separate regional operations capabilities and controls to a global front, middle and back office capability that will help us increase efficiency and flexibility, especially in the solutions space.","And finally, we continue to manage the evolving regulatory environment both the United States and internationally, including Brexit and multiple regulatory initiatives in the U.K. Overall, the actions we're taking to drive long-term growth are the right ones, but there is more work to do. We're managing the business with a strong focus on our clients and profitability, while we invest to compete in our key regions.","Before I turn things over to Walter, I feel very good about Ameriprise, the value of the advice and solutions we offer our clients, as well as the progress we made at the midpoint in the year. We're executing on our strategy and are focused on delivering a strong client experience. Very few financial services companies are generating this level of ROE and returning to shareholders like Ameriprise is, while continuing to deliver good earnings. As we look forward with our client focus, business strength, capital profile and return as well as our risk management, Ameriprise is positioned well.","Now Walter will cover the financials and I'll be back to take your questions.","Walter Stanley Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise continues to execute on the strategy Jim outlined to deliver very strong financial results across shareholder driver components in the quarter. Advice & Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth driver, now representing almost half of our total revenue. Our other businesses have performed well and within our expectations. Our balance sheet remains strong. We are generating strong free cash flow, which we are using to consistently return capital to shareholders, driving excellent EPS and return on equity growth. In the quarter, we returned $481 million of capital to shareholders which is almost 110% of operating earnings. This included the repurchase of 2.8 million shares, which was similar to the first quarter.","Turning to slide 6, Ameriprise delivered excellent financial performance across the top and bottom lines. Ameriprise operating net revenue was up 5%, normalizing for the net impact of 12b-1 fee changes we discussed with you with Advice & Wealth Management revenue up 13%. Top-line growth was driven by 7% growth in total assets fueled by $4.5 billion in wrap net inflows and strong equity market appreciation. In addition, we demonstrated strong expense discipline across the firm. The overall expense base was down 1% with G&A down 3%. This resulted in a very strong margin in the quarter of 19.8%, up from 16.7% a year ago. We returned a substantial amount to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Combined with strong earnings, our capital return supported EPS growth of 26% to $2.80, and return on equity of over 25%. Overall, we delivered excellent financial results across the firm.","Let's turn to slide 7. The Advice & Wealth Management businesses continued to perform very well, delivering strong business metrics and financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.3 billion, up 13% in the quarter from solid growth in wrap assets from client inflows and market appreciation, as well as higher earnings on brokerage cash. We successfully completed the previously announced move to share classes that do not have 12b-1 fees for advisory accounts and other associated changes, which reduced revenue by a net $54 million in the quarter. The PTI and margin impact of these 12b-1 fee changes was very small and within expectations.","Expenses were up 3% reflecting higher distribution expenses, including investments in recruiting experienced advisors. We are tightly managing G&A expenses, which was flat to last year. Revenue growth and expense discipline drove operating earnings up 32% to $291 million, and we delivered an all-time high margin of 21.6%.","Turning to slide 8. Asset management generated strong profitability, up 19% versus last year. Operating net revenue was up 1% at $748 million, with market appreciation more than offsetting the impact of net outflows. As Jim discussed, outflows were elevated in the quarter from low fee, former parent related outflows, much of which we tied to specific events. We remain focused in bringing in assets at a higher fee rate than the assets we're losing to manage profitability. Our overall fee rate remained stable in the quarter at 53 basis points due to our mix of equity and fixed assets as well as strong equity market appreciation in the quarter.","We continue to maintain very competitive margins by tightly managing expenses with G&A down 4% from last year. Last year's expenses included a one-time legal settlement. Excluding that item, G&A was down 1%. Pre-tax operating earnings were $176 million, up 19%, and margins were up nicely at almost 38%.","Let's turn to annuities on slide 9. Variable annuities pre-tax operating earnings were up 8% to $127 million. This increase included the benefit of equity, market appreciation, partially offset by net outflows. Variable annuity net outflows were elevated again this quarter, reflecting a decline in VA sales as well as higher lapses, both of which are in line with industry trends. We are seeing a good portion of our VA lapses in qualified accounts for policies out of their surrender charge period. A benefit of our business model is that the majority of these assets stay within the firm, but move to other products.","We hedge the living benefits risks from our variable annuity businesses very effectively. As a reminder, our direct variable annuity hedge strategy is primarily designed for protection against economic risk and to mitigate volatility in GAAP earnings in addition to our macro hedge program. Under the statutory reserve framework, this direct hedging strategy can create non-economic strain in excess capital under rapidly rising interest rates. Therefore, we requested and received approval from Minnesota for a permitted practice to mitigate this impact, effective July 1, 2017.","This permitted practice leverages principles underlying the NAIC's related accounting proposal for certain derivatives hedging variable annuities interest rate risk. Fixed annuity's earnings declined to $15 million from $28 million a year ago, from low asset portfolio yields and decline in account balances.","As we described before, we wrote a block of fixed annuities following the financial crisis with a six-year surrender charge period. Over the past couple of years, we've seen higher lapses as those policies reached their guaranteed minimum interest rates and exited the surrender charge period. The book is continuing to run off at a pace we anticipated and is in line with our actuarial assumptions. This book is already at its guaranteed minimum interest rate, but we've had higher yielding assets run off and they were replaced at a lower rate, causing spread compression.","As you know, we conduct our annual unlocking in the third quarter, which is based on market assumptions around interest rates as of 6\/30\/2017. The 10-year treasury rate as of 6\/30\/2017 was higher than a year ago and above where we had expected it would be at that point. In the quarter, the behavioral assumptions will be evaluated to determine any changes from our prior year assumptions.","Turning to slide 10, Life and Health earnings declined 4% to $69 million due to lower investment portfolio yields. Life claims continued their improving trend and all other products were within expected ranges. Auto and Home results improved by $16 million from last year despite higher cat losses. We remain focused on managing our cat exposure. We entered into several new reinsurance arrangements to reduce net cat exposure in the first quarter and realized substantial benefits from them in the second quarter.","We expect benefits from those reinsurance agreements to continue in the second half of the year. We are pleased with the progress in our underlying loss performance for this business from the steps we have taken to improve results. Our non-cat loss ratio was 70%, which was 8 points better than the prior year. Underlying auto loss performance was particularly strong with nearly 12 points of improvement. Many of the policy and pricing changes are still rolling through our book, which should support continued improvement in these trends. Lastly, we continue to monitor our underlying reserve levels and the impact of policy and pricing changes on our current and prior accident year reserves.","On slide 11, you can see that Ameriprise continues to make progress, shifting its business mix to less capital-intense businesses. And for the first time, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management made up over 70% of Ameriprise's pre-tax operating earnings. We anticipate this shift will continue and reach 75% over the next couple of years. It is an important aspect of our continued capital return story.","You'll see on slide 12 that our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong with excess capital at $1.8 billion and an estimated RBC ratio at nearly 500%. We returned $481 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 2.8 million shares in the quarter, which was 109% of operating earnings. We continue to target returning 90% to 100% of operating earnings to shareholders as a baseline. And as we did this quarter, we will adjust, as we assess market conditions and our evaluation.","And with that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from John Nadel from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. My first question is on Advice & Wealth Management, Jim, I'm curious. It sounds from your commentary like you're really not stopping as it relates to making needed investments in the business, whether it's digital, training, or otherwise. But how much longer do you think the segment can continue to generate what appears to be pretty solid revenue growth without some level of corresponding growth in G&A? And then separately, in Advice, I'm curious if you think we should expect any meaningful impact, whether it's on revenues or margins, from the acquisition that closed at the beginning of the third quarter. I don't imagine that's going to really shift numbers, but just want to make sure we're tight on that.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So we are continuing to invest organically in the businesses. And you mentioned Advice & Wealth in particular, so we have some really good initiatives underway to further our capabilities in the digital world, particularly around digital advice and online capabilities to interact with the consumer and the advisor even further there in a much more integrated fashion. We also have things underway to enhance our CRM capabilities. So really what we've been doing, and you saw it from my commentary, we still have invested a lot of time and energy around the DOL activities. And so what I'm hoping is as we come to fruition on that, I could start freeing up my resources to go back to more of these growth initiatives. But in the meantime, we have more of the R&D and the development underway. And as we pass through the DOL activities, we'll move more to execution and implementation against more of the growth types of things again. So we're making those investments. As we free up resources that are being devoted to DOL, we'll put more of that money back to work on growth initiatives and capabilities more fully and try to get them rolled out over the next year or two as well.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then just real quick on that acquisition, should it have any impact?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So we'll work on that acquisition as we go to close and we get the broker-dealer approvals, et cetera. It's not going to have a major impact initially on a margin basis.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","What we'll do is, over time, support that business' growth and improve their productivity and the margins in that business by actually building out the business further. It'll add a good number of advisors. I think it's about approximately 200 to our line, but really what that will be is more of a build over time to get the types of margins and productivity that we think it's capable of.","John M. Nadel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then my follow-up question's just on the Asset Management side. I think last quarter, Jim, you had touched on, or you had quantified the former-parent AUM, the legacy AUM at about $70 billion. And that the revenue contribution from that \u2013 from former-parent AUM was about 8% of the segment's revenues. I imagine given the outflows this quarter, that $70 billion number has come down. Is that 8% still a reasonable estimate?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. A large part of, like the Zurich as I mentioned to you, was a low-fee pension-type activity and even in that, where those assets were lost, there's been some adjustment in some of our fee arrangements appropriately, so on a positive end. So I would actually say that was a very small revenue loss for us. It was appropriate for Zurich and appropriate for us at this point in time. And some of the changes we also made with U.S. Trust will adjust some of the pricing based upon that being a better economic scenario as well.","So we actually think that on a total basis, we'll be in good revenue on \u2013 adjusted for those assets. So will come out of the asset base, as you said, but there's been a market appreciation against that asset base. So we're still getting relatively about the same revenues based on the appreciation for the other activities. Remember, it was fixed income mainly in the Zurich, very low fee.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW Research. Your line is open, Ryan.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. As you got close to the June 9 applicability date for the DOL, did you make any additional fee or commission adjustments that we should expect to have any sort of meaningful impact going forward?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. No. As I said we've realigned all of our product line, due diligence elements, et cetera, reduced the number of funds on our lineup. It'll only affect about 6% of our assets and there's a transition period and those assets already mapped into other types of funds. So it should not impact the revenue or the activities from the advisor perspective.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then a follow-up on AWM, the 21.6% margin certainly recognizing you'll get future benefits from rate increases, but do you view the 21.6% as a good level to run rate and build off of going forward, or should we think about this as a particularly good quarter for that business?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So I would hate to just say every quarter is exactly the same based on seasonality and other things, but I would say the plus-20% is a good base level for us to operate under now. I've mentioned to you previously and the investors that we were targeting to get over the 20%. We feel now comfortably over the 20%. So we would probably say, I won't want to sit here and project every quarter, per se, based on levels of activity and market, but over the 20% margin rate, I think would be solid.","Operator","And our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Your line is open, Erik.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about the level of distribution expenses in Advice & Wealth and how we should think about those going forward? I realize there's some impact from the 12b-1 change, but are there other steps you're taking to reduce distribution costs?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. April, the last of the 12b-1s was captured. And so all of that now is at either investment advisory level fees or rebates back to the client. Listen, if the DOL comes forth and says, hey, there needs to be some adjustments as we go into commission-based products, we feel that we'll be able to move there and adjust. Nothing is really sold at targeted levels of what the retail price is. Everything is relatively discounted in some fashion. So we don't see a significant if we move to, like, a consistent share class at one fee, be it some adjustments up and down in certain areas, but relatively over the course of the remainder of the year, we don't see a change for the things we have already implemented. Most of those implementations were done previously.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it. So the ratio of sort of distribution expenses to fee revenue should be relatively stable.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes.","Erik Bass - Autonomous Research","Got it. And then switching to Asset Management. Is the level of G&A spending there this quarter a reasonable run rate? If you could talk about where the savings are coming from and if there were a downturn in equity markets, do you still have levers to maintain margins?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. Across the firm, if you're familiar with us, we do a lot to constantly reengineer our activities, looking at areas that were not generating value to free up resources, using technology better for servicing and activities from a client perspective. So in the Asset Management business, we're doing something very similar but we're making good investments in the Asset Management business whether it's the new systems and capabilities, whether it's investing in new product, whether it's adding talent. So we're continuing to do that. We've launched a new advertising campaign globally. So we're continuing to make those investments, but we are tightening up where we're not generating the revenue or the value, or getting the productivity that we need. So we'll continue to do that. Of course, if markets become tighter et cetera, yes, we would have to take more actions. But right now what we're doing is freeing some of the money and investing it in the areas we think will give us future capability.","Operator","And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Your line is open.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to start with Advice & Wealth and the cash balances there of roughly $26 billion, down a little bit sequentially but up about 10% year-over-year. I guess I'm a little surprised that given the market environment, maybe clients didn't put more of that cash to work. So just want to get a sense of where you think that's going to trend over the next couple quarters, because I think at $26 billion you're still quite a bit above where you've historically run.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So I think there's a few components. One is more money has gone to work. Having said that, I don't think either our advisors or clients are sort of overenthusiastic of jumping full scale into the market of where the market is situated right now on balance, but they're actually trending the money back in. It's actually interesting that money still went into the fixed income categories as well, but we're also bringing in a bit more flows from a client basis, so that sort of replenished some of the cash as well. So I would probably say if we didn't do that, you would have saw more cash go back to work based on our investments in wrap flow business, et cetera. So I think that's a positive trend. So as long as it continues, markets are in good condition and relative, I think it's good that money goes in over time rather than in one big swoop.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then I guess sticking with the AWM, in the past you've given us a little bit of a split between the employee advisor and the franchisee advisor channels in terms of margins and productivity. Can you kind of give us a sense of where you stand today in those two channels on those two metrics?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. So we've had nice improvement in the employee channel. Our margins are now in the mid-teens, solid and that's after the elimination of 12b-1s, et cetera. We're getting good productivity increases there as advisers have ramped up from the recruiting and actually uptake of even our financial planning activities. And so I actually see that leverage continuing to improve as we continue to grow that productivity there. And the margins in the franchise channel has held pretty well with the uptick in productivity that offset anything on the 12b-1s activity, as we've mentioned to you as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Your line is open.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. In Asset Management, you talked about the solutions business. Can you talk about the growth there and how should we \u2013 maybe how should we think about the inflows in the second quarter of $500 million compared to that in the first quarter?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So we actually \u2013 we don't talk about it this way, just like I've mentioned in some of the other space, but we manage over $100 billion multi-asset type categories for our clients. And so what we're doing now is trying to build out that multi-asset solutions set in a more customized fashion for institutions, but also have good products now that we've developed and we're going to continue to build upon in the retail space. So, as an example, our CARA product here in the United States has grown to now a few billion dollars \u2013 almost $4 billion \u2013 over $4 billion and we see good interest in that type of product that has excellent three-year performance, better than many of the strategy funds out there today. And same thing in the U.K. Our DRR fund has now launched nicely and growing and we're going to launch in the U.K.","So we actually believe that we have some really good capabilities. We have a really good team in place both here and the U.K. in multi-asset solutions being built out. In the U.S., it's under a gentleman named Jeff Knight; in the U.K. it's under Toby Nangle. I mean, we've got a good team. So we feel that this is a good opportunity for us, but again it always takes time to build, particularly as you start to branch off from some of your core activities, but we feel good about that progress and the ability to continue to grow there.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. And then in terms of the institutional pipeline, I think in previous quarters you talked about the pipeline remained pretty solid. But then we haven't really see that in terms of gross inflows, especially when you look at the first half in 2017 from gross inflows in institutional was probably roughly flat compared to first half of 2016. When can we expect to see some of these company mandates to come through and then show up in the inflows now outlined for institutional Asset Management?","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. Firstly, it's a good question. Unfortunately \u2013 and again, some people might have been impacted as well as when a large client starts to continue to redeem, not because of performance or anything, but because of the liquidity or change in what they need, it had impacted us. It was actually a larger impact in the first quarter than the second. And so, a lot of good funding sort of were offset in the sense by doing that. And the same thing here in the U.S. and we had some of the CDO that normally come up for liquidation at this point, but didn't refund during the period. And so, we had some of those fundings.","Now, other mandates that we're also working on, sometimes that take a little longer. In some categories, they got put on hold a little bit based on the environment or even where some of our concentration is, like in high yield and stuff. So, what we're looking at right now is that we're continuing to focus on what that pipeline is for the future, but we've been able to handle \u2013 and again, this is the ex-parent stuff \u2013 we've been able to handle the offsets of some of those liquidations with the new fundings. We would have liked that, it would have carved that way, but that's exactly what occurred in the first part of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the Asset Management business. Could you give a little bit more granular breakdown in terms of the U.S. retail fund flows just between the major asset classes, whether there's any notable drivers in the flows. And also, I had a question in terms of the new products that you mentioned, specifically like the multi-asset funds. Whether you can give us a sense of the fee rates on these kind of new products? Thanks.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So when we look at the categories we're focused on, we're getting good activity in many of our strategic and what we call our Anchor Fund areas. So like our strategic income, like the CARA product I mentioned, like in some of our high alpha equity products, or dividend income, things such as that, in some of our fixed income, but there's more for us to do there. I think we need to get better known in regard to our fixed income credit capabilities, and particularly in retail that we got some really good product, we see pickup, like in our strategic income, but we've been known more for equity than fixed. And I think we have got some really good capabilities that we got to continue to grow in. We've been seeing a nice pickup in activities in some of the major broker-dealers that we do business, and the independents. There's more for us to do. We're gaining traction. We're building the relationships. We're getting considered more as in model various portfolios. So, we're gaining good traction.","Having said that, there is the level of activity more broadly out there. And most of the actives have moved a bit more into fixed income, which we're not as known for, that I think we can get known for. And we're putting a bit more emphasis on, because we've got some good product there to sell. And in regard to the CARA product, as I mentioned, this is one that now that has hits its three-year track records and they're quite strong against the competitive frame, and it's something that we're getting more seen on. We're hoping that those flows will even pick up further.","Kenneth S. Lee - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Got you. And just one final follow-up question. Just in terms of, specifically, the alternatives category within Asset Management, granted still a small portion of the AUM, just wondering longer term, are there any thoughts in terms of like meaningful expansion within that area? Thanks.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. So, we'll continue, as I mentioned, to build out our solution capabilities. With that, as we build it out, not all the, what I would call, the sleeves in those categories will be manufactured by us, but they'll be sub-advised with other entities providing some of the capabilities similar to what we're doing now in some of our multi-asset solutions. That will be a complement. So, it'll actually \u2013 with the way we allocate the strategic risk management, the allocation methodologies we've used and the capabilities and how we actually construct will be ours.","So it won't slow us. But we are looking for some smaller types of acquisitions appropriately to fit into the alt space for us and we have a number of things that we're reviewing today. So over time, we feel like we'll be able to pick up some other types of capabilities that will complement our core equity fixed income space that we have today.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore. Your line is open.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Good morning. First question I had is, have you had to get more competitive with compensation packages now that 12b-1 fees are gone for your advisors, or how are you dealing with that? Because you described that as more or less a pass-through to them.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, no. When we look at it, as you are aware of, our actual compensation, and we're attracting actually much higher productive teams in the industry today. And if you look at the employee channel, the 12b-1s necessarily weren't captured by them in the employee channel to begin with. So, it has no effect there. And so, from that perspective, we're seeing good activities in the employee. But in the franchisees area also, we've actually had a stronger pickup in activity there with larger people coming, and because of the capabilities that we're providing, the support we're providing, the compliance, the training, even the idea that this is a very trusted brand. And some of them don't necessarily look to be completely independent anymore based upon the challenges out there. So, I actually find that where \u2013 we haven't changed the compensation packages, but what I find is that we're being more considered out there, based on what we've been able to achieve and how we can help them.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","And Jim, just a related question on that. Is that what's really driving the strong flows here? Is that the impact to new hires you're getting higher-end brokers, brokers with larger books, you're losing ones with smaller books? Is that really what's going on beneath the surface in terms of why...","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. It's only a piece. Remember, we have a network of almost 9,700 people. You're not going to get the type of productivity lift. We've got 14% productivity lift year over year. You're not going to get that just from a number of recruits. The recruits will continue, as we said, be a nice complement as an addition particularly more so in the employee channel as that continues to tenure now because the recruits there is a bit larger than the total of the franchisee. But what I would say is \u2013 and I showed the chart recently, that said if you look at us since 2011, 2009, whatever you want to look at, in productivity improvements against all the major houses, both employee channels and especially independents, we're relatively flat in productivity, but we are actually at the top of the charts in annual productivity increases across our entire network.","So that's what we continue to do to help our advisors improve their practice, grow their practice, serve their clients, deepen their relationships, our advice value proposition. So I'd like to add more productive groups, and exactly to your point that's exactly a piece of it, but when you grow productivity like we have constantly and consistently, it's based on what we've add as the value to the advisor.","Operator","And our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Thank you and good morning. I was hoping you could talk about the outflows in the annuities business and kind of where you think it'll shake out. And then I have a follow-up to that. Thank you.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah. We've always, as we've said to you in the past, unlike other providers that really ramp up annuities at certain periods of time or in certain markets to sell aggressively, we have never done that. And so our book continues to be very solid, consistent. The benefits consistent. The returns consistent. How we actually support and service the book, how that fits in as a solution set, but we've always sold within a rough range of $4 to $5 billion. We're just at the low end of that range. Yes. I think some of that fall-off in sales has been done because our advisors, like other advisors, were like what does this mean with the DOL or the fiduciary rule or what does that mean in changes, et cetera, et cetera?","Now, some of that we see is starting to stabilize and starting to refresh, but yeah, we went to the lower end of our range there which is fine. Those flows don't leave us. They just get put to work in other activities, which is also fine for us that we have good solutions, but we feel like our book is really good and stable and that activity will pick up over time in certain things, like some of our benefits or non-benefits. Actually what happened is we got increased sales in our non-living benefit sort of product in the variable annuities this last quarter and the quarter before it. So we think that it's good that there is always an adjustment where necessary, but we are able to take those flows in other categories, but the book remains very solid. And there may be a pickup back as we continue to go. We don't necessarily \u2013 if it doesn't pick up, we always operate in roughly this range anyway. So we feel very comfortable.","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","There's a follow-up on that, though. I understand you're at the low end of the sales range, but a lot of that outflow is also being caused by a market increase in withdrawals and terminations.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so again...","John Bakewell Barnidge - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Also, if you could speak to your thoughts on \u2013 my follow-up was, (54:18) put out yesterday.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah it's higher but it's within the range. It's not materially higher. And again, I think you see that across the industry as well. So some of that in the past lapses, people again start to put money to work a little bit differently. For instance, some of them feel, maybe, hey, the guarantee we don't need at this point in time as much because the markets have really stabilized. It depends on the client circumstance and the advisor and what they're looking at for the total portfolio. But these are all within ranges. And as I said to you, we're never looking to really grow our books to be very expansive. We provide them as a solution set. We can really provide good books and where we get good returns, we'll provide that. And where it makes sense for the client and the advisor, we complement with what we have on the shelf from other providers. So all of other providers are also on the shelf. Sales have slowed a little with their activities as well. So I think you see this across the industry. We're not an outlier but, as I said, the money goes to work in other areas, like investment advisory and other activities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Doug R. Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. First question. And I'm sorry if you had detailed this last quarter. I think you had, but if you could just review the issue of the loss of the 12b-1 fees and how they're transitional and maybe the timing of when you would fill that hole. And I guess the underlying question is, is it where you actually have the map specifically to new products to where you can specifically identify where you're going to get the revenue back through asset based fees and wrap account, for example, or something like that? Or is it where you lost the revenue and you think you know where you're going to get the revenue back, but it could take some time, if you understand what I'm asking.","James Michael Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Okay. So let's be clear. For all our wrap business, all the assets and all the investment type of advisory accounts, all of the 12b-1 fees have already been eliminated. The last piece of that came out in April and the bulk of it came out in the first quarter. So when you look at the second quarter numbers, those revenues have already \u2013 are gone. There's only a small piece that was there in April and that's gone now. But we have tried, through productivity, through a combination of other adjustments that we've made from both the cost as well as a revenue perspective, it's already been factored in and offset through what you've seen in the P&L today in the margins that we're generating. So that's already gone. Now 12b-1s are still collected in commission-based. And they are allowed to be continued under that category, even under the DOL. So those are still in the commission-based products and that will continue to go forward. So there'll be no change there.","So what we did when we replace the share classes with 12b-1s is if there was an investment advisory share class, an institutional share class that didn't have a 12b-1, that was what we used to replace it with. And if there wasn't, and that's still the only share class there, then what we do now and have done in the second quarter is rebate those back to, through the advisor, to the client, so they're not collected by either the firm nor the advisor. And that is already negated in the revenue as well. I hope that gives you a better understanding.","Doug R. Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. It's helpful. My follow-up actually, in a different subject, more on capital levels. You definitely have a very generous shareholder return policy and obviously you have the capital levels to support that, but I was wondering how much capital roughly are you generating every quarter? In other words, does your capital return approximate your capital generation? Are you slowly drawing down your excess capital position? Are you still building your excess capital position? This is all things being equal of course. I'm not asking for guidance or anything like that, but on a run rate basis.","Walter Stanley Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","It's Walter and we are generating free cash flow, which is pretty much approximately 90% to 100% discussion point that we've given as our target. So the answer is, it goes ups and downs, obviously, as different parts of the model shift but we are basically replenishing at the same rate.","Operator","Our final question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Your line is open.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Roughly how much of the margin expansion in Advice & Wealth Management came from increasing brokered sweep fees?","Walter Stanley Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","On a percentage basis, I would \u2013 21 \u2013 it's I would guess, maybe 1%, in that range.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay.","Walter Stanley Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","As it relates because you have to annualize the whole thing, but I think it's in that range.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Sure. Sure. Okay. And then just one follow-up on \u2013 in the Asset Management, the distribution expenses as percentage of retail AUM came down 0.37 versus running 0.39 or 0.4. Is that due to 12b-1s or is there something else occurring there?","Walter Stanley Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No, that's as you identified, it's 12b-1s.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

My name is Paulette, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provides insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials that are available on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and operating plans and performance.

We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I'll begin with my perspective on what was a strong quarter for Ameriprise and share how I'm feeling about the business. Walter will discuss the numbers in more detail, and then we'll take your questions.","As you saw yesterday, we reported record third quarter results with operating earnings at a strong 36%. I'm feeling good about how Ameriprise is positioned and the progress we're making. Activity is picking up, assets are up across the firm and we're maintaining expense levels as we continue to invest for growth.","Our Wealth Management business had another terrific quarter. And our assets under management and administration increased 8% to $735 billion, reflecting good advisor client flows and market appreciation.","Our capital and financial foundation, essential to our ability to grow and to navigate the environment remains in great shape. We have the capital strength, free cash flow and ability to return the majority of our operating earnings to shareholders annually, which we will continue to do. During the quarter, we returned $475 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the last 4 quarters, we returned 129% of our operating earnings to shareholders. With our strong earnings and capital return, we delivered a record high operating return on equity of 19.4% and we're moving forward on our path with purpose, executing the strategy we regularly discussed with you and achieving the returns that we've targeted.","Let's talk about our segments beginning with Advice & Wealth Management. As I mentioned, our AWM business is performing very well. Our strategy is working. We're continuing the progress we've made in delivering excellent financial results with room to grow. Operating net revenue is up 12% to $1.1 billion, and that's including the weight of low interest rates in our decision to exit the banking business.","Client and advisors are engaged and we're bringing in good client flows. As an example, this is the third consecutive quarter that we've seen at least $3 billion come in through our RAP program, which is on pace for a record year. Total client assets are up 13% to $389 billion. Our advisors are increasingly productive. Adjusting for the bank, per advisor productivity increased 16% from good asset growth and strong transactional activity. We continue to manage our overall expense base well. Margins grew nicely to 14.2%, close to a 200-basis-point improvement from a year ago, even after the loss of the bank earnings and lowest spread revenues on our large cash business. We're focused on what we believe are significant opportunities to strengthen our position, drive productivity and improve efficiencies as we help advisors use the resources and the capabilities that we have invested in for them.","Our priority is to continue to bring in new clients and assets and we're energized about how our Confident Retirement approach can help do that. Our advisors are telling us how effective it is and simplifying the conversation with clients and prospects to help them better understand what they need to think about for a secure and confident retirement. We're seeing good results. Our latest surveys show very high levels of client and advisor satisfaction, confidence and value provided. Our goal is to engage even more of our advisors through field training to take advantage of the Confident Retirement approach in their practices. And we want to continue to attract new people, both clients and experienced advisors to Ameriprise.","In terms of our brand and advertising, we're working with Tommy Lee Jones again, because we like the way he conveys our story and consumers and advisors have responded well. We're currently filming new ads that you'll see early next year. We're also helping advisors benefit from the investments we've made, included in technology with the brokerage platform and our e-tools and online. Our advisors are finding that our technology platform helps them increase efficiency and drive productivity.","Overall, our advisor force is engaged and motivated. In terms of recruiting, we're bringing in good people as more advisors look to Ameriprise as a place to grow and engage more clients. Another 86 experienced advisors joined the firm in the third quarter and the pipeline looks good.","External research has shown that Ameriprise is one of the most trusted financial firms in the industry. It was another excellent quarter for AWM. We're delivering good growth and profitability in both the employee and franchise channels. The business is consistently generating results we expected, and that we told you we could achieve. Our focus is to remain on the same path, execute well to maintain our momentum.","In Asset Management, we're executing our stated strategy as we focus the business in areas where we see strong opportunity for growth. We have more work to do. However, in the meantime, we're delivering good financial results and beginning to gain traction in key long-term growth drivers. Our assets under management reached $479 billion, up 4% for a year ago due to the positive equity markets in the U.S. and Europe and from the initial progress we're making. The resulting revenue growth is good and we continue to manage expenses tightly. Operating earnings are up 15% to $178 million and adjusted net operating margin is a competitive 40%. We continue to channel resources in the areas where we see traction.","Overall, we're delivering competitive long-term investment performance. We're making steady progress establishing our global investment teams as Columbia and Threadneedle align resources and strength to drive profitable flows. During the quarter, we added to our presence in Asia. We hired an experience Asian equities team based in Singapore as we build our manufacturing distribution and capability in the region. In terms of flows, Walter will get into the numbers but the outflows in the quarter were consistent with sources we previously identified.","Legacy insurance mandates, former parent affiliated distribution, a sub-advisor and share class changes in the RIA channel.","Similar to the industry in the third quarter, we experienced high redemptions in fixed income portfolios. We've been able to largely offset that pressure with good traction in some key growth areas. We're generating very good U.K. and European retail net flows as we overcome ongoing outflows of legacy insurance assets. This is a core theme at Threadneedle, managing a pool of lower fee assets in transition while growing the higher fee wholesale business. And domestically, we're beginning to see some traction in the underlying third-party intermediary channel largely in equities. When you adjust for the drivers we've discussed, third-party intermediate equity flows have improved as we focused our wholesaling efforts and benefited from the market conditions.","That said, we have a lot more work to do.","In institutional, we're gaining good traction. The traditional institutional business is healthy. In addition to a good flow of U.S. equity and fixed income mandates, we're winning mandates on a more global basis. Our pipeline is quite good. Our win rate is high and we more than doubled our new assets won versus where we were a year ago.","Overall, in Asset Management, we know that we need to execute well to strengthen our position in the marketplace. We're already getting good positive financial returns and we're beginning to gain some traction. There's a lot more work to do but we're moving in a positive direction.","Let's move to Annuities and Protection. Businesses that are important to us because of our focus in meeting clients long-term financial needs and our Confident Retirement approach. Both Annuities and Protection are performing well and in line with our expectations given the rate environment and weather related factors. Our Annuities business is well-positioned and we're generating good returns with lower risk and volatility. Revenues were up modestly and earnings were up considerably given the year-over-year unlocking swing, which Walter will discuss. We've built a differentiated business that we're growing at a pace we want with focus on serving Ameriprise clients. In variable annuities, cash sales and Ameriprise grew 14% and sales of our managed volatility funds have continued to increase in recent months, with improved equity markets and good wholesaling.","We've made strategic decisions to continue to de-risk the portfolio to lower volatility. We recently announced product feature and fee changes for some of our in force variable annuities with living benefit guarantees. These decisions reflect the market environment and our commitment to providing policyholders with additional investment options to help manage volatility.","And in fixed annuities, we feel good about our existing book but aren't adding to it given the interest rate environment. As I look to next year, we're working through our decision to reprice a portion of the book that could help relieve some of the spread compression.","In Protection, our financial results in the quarter reflected higher weather-related losses and an unfavorable, unlocking impact. That said, the underlying business is performing as we would expect. The growth of our Life business is directly aligned with the growth we're driving in Wealth Management. Our advisors offer our products to their clients as follow the Confident Retirement approach and we're seeing good growth in life insurance sales of 20% from last year. Index universal life sales continue to be strong and we're also experiencing improvement in variable universal life sales.","In Auto and Home, earnings suffered because of the external environment where we had higher cap losses in the quarter from multiple storms. That said, our Auto and Home business metrics are good. We had steady policy growth of 10% from a year ago. We're working to deepen penetration with our affinity partners and with our own advisors and we're seeing nice progress. Auto and Home is rated one of the best for client satisfaction and retention also remains very high.","To summarize, we had a strong third quarter to continue what is shaping up to be a very good year. Our business results and progress demonstrate that Ameriprise is on the right path. We're executing our strategy, serving more clients and growing as we drive improvements across the company.","Overall, we're generating excellent return on equity and we're going to continue to focus on improving it. With strong earnings and our ability to generate significant free cash flow, we're able to continue to return to shareholders as we have in the past.","With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered excellent financial results this quarter. Business fundamentals remain strong, top line growth was solid, expenses were well-managed and we had record profitability. Operating net revenue growth was strong at 7%, or 8%, excluding the impact from exiting the bank. This was driven by our targeted growth areas, Advice and Wealth Management and Asset Management. These 2 segments continue to deliver good growth and now represent over 60% of our total revenues.","Growth in Advice & Wealth Management, excluding former bank operations, was 16%, which includes the impact of low interest rates. The growth in this segment was generated by solid business fundamentals, including growth in client assets, good transaction levels, as well as market appreciation. The year-over-year revenue growth was 6% and asset management was impacted by redemption driven hedge fund performance fees realized in the prior year. Adjusting for these performance fees, revenue growth was 9%, primarily from strong markets, the asset mix shift and revenue reengineering.","In Protection and Annuities, revenue grew 3%, excluding the impact from unlocking, which is in line of our expectations, particularly in our continued low-interest rate environment.","Let's turn to earnings on Slide 4. Ameriprise pretax operating earnings growth was 39%, with particularly strong growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. Together, these segments represent almost 60% of pretax operating earnings. In Advice & Wealth Management, earnings grew 49% after adjusting for the bank exit despite the continued pressure from low-interest rates.","Asset Management earnings increased 15%, supported by market appreciation. Adjusting for hedge fund performance fees in the prior year period, Asset Management earnings grew 20%.","Annuities earnings growth was on target at 7%, excluding unlocking and the market impact of DAC and DSIC. The variable annuity earnings were good and fixed annuity earnings declined as expected given low-interest rates.","In the Protection segment. Earnings in the quarter were impacted by higher CAT losses and the annual unlocking.","Let's turn to EPS and return on equity on Slide 5. Operating earnings per share were $1.91, up a robust 45%, and operating return on equity hit an all-time high of 19.4%. Normalizing for items identified in the earnings release, these metrics are still quite strong with EPS growth of 17%, and return on equity of 18.8%. This performance has been quite strong given the low-interest rate environment, which impacted earnings by $39 million, compared to the prior year. The growth in EPS and return on equity reflect both solid business fundamentals and growth as well as our ability to redeploy capital, which we feel is a real strong point of differentiation for Ameriprise.","Moving to the segments. Let's start with Advice & Wealth Management on Slide 6. We continue to deliver excellent results in Advice & Wealth Management across the board. Business growth metrics, revenue growth and expense discipline, all of which drove strong earnings and significant margin expansion.","Pretax operating earnings, excluding former bank operations, grew 49%, from growth in client assets and advisor productivity. I will note that this growth was in the face of a negative impact of $18 million from lower spreads on cash sweep accounts and certificates. As a point of reference, brokerage cash sweep balances were $19 billion at the end of the quarter and the rate on a net basis was 15 basis points on average in the quarter, down from 38 basis points on average a year ago. Growth in client assets and strong activity levels, coupled with strong expense management have driven margins to a high of 14.2%, even with the bank exit and the lower interest rates.","Turning to Asset Management on Slide 7. Revenue was $777 million, up 9%, primarily from market appreciation, offset by outflows. In the quarter, earnings were up 15% to $178 million. Excluding the redemption driven hedge fund performance fees, earnings were up 20%. Earnings growth was particularly strong due to well-managed expenses. While total expenses were up with the markets, G&A was fairly flat year-over-year. Adjusting for the expenses associated with the performance fees in the prior year, G&A was up only 3%. Adjusted operating margins improved to 40% from 37.6% a year ago, reflecting good revenue growth and tight expense management.","Let's turn to flows in more detail on Slide 8. In the quarter, we had a total of $4.3 billion of net outflows. We had a total of $4.6 billion of outflows in the former parent-related and other areas we previously discussed. We had outflows of approximately $2 billion across retail and institutional associated with 1 large former parent affiliated distribution partner.","As we've said, outflows will continue as our share in that distribution channel normalizes though this quarter was a bit high given the rotation out of fixed income experienced by the industry and us. In the U.S. retail, we had $900 million of outflows at a sub-advisor and $400 million of outflows resulting from the share class change we made in the RIA channel earlier this year.","In the institutional business, we had $1.3 billion of outflows related to legacy insurance mandates at Threadneedle and former parent influence mandates at Columbia. Additionally, we experienced fixed income outflows similar to the industry. However, we are gaining some traction, including U.K. and European retail where we had good inflows, as well as in the U.S. third-party institutional where we have a very strong pipeline.","Turning to Annuities on Slide 9. Pretax operating earnings were $219 million, which includes a $73 million favorable impact from unlocking and the market impact on DAC and DSIC. Our variable annuity business remains strong with a high-quality in-force block and good growth in attractive new businesses. We also announced several proactive change to a small portion of our variable annuity block with living benefit riders in the quarter, including providing additional fund offering for existing clients. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings was $185 million, including a favorable impact from unlocking and the market impact on DAC and DSIC. The unlocking was primarily related to higher interest rates and bond fund returns as well as changes in assumed policyholder behavior.","In fixed annuities, pretax operating earnings were $34 million, with a minimal impact from unlocking. The results in the quarter included about $11 million of lower earnings from spread compression. However, the higher investment income from former bank assets transferred into this portfolio late last year offset the interest impact by $6 million. Operating return on allocated equity was over 20% for the Annuity segment, and it included $500 million of contingent capital allocated to variable annuities for stress scenarios.","Moving to Protection on Slide 10. Pretax operating earnings was $75 million, which included an unfavorable impact from unlocking, elevated CAT losses and pressure from low-interest rates. Underlying Life & Health business remains solid. We had good sales of both variable, universal life and index universal life. Claims experience was good and well within our expectations.","Auto and Home has continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, from our affinity partnerships. Earnings in the quarter reflected an increase in reserves, primarily from $15 million in CAT losses and our normal quarterly actuarial experienced model uptick.","Let's turn to capital on Slide 11. In the quarter, we returned $475 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you can see, we have been able to consistently return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders due to our business mix shift, risk management capabilities and strong balance sheet fundamentals.","Based on current market conditions, we expect to fully neutralize the EPS impact of exiting the bank by year end. We issued $600 million of senior debt in the quarter to retire existing debt. We have announced plans to execute a make-whole of $350 million of our outstanding senior debt that matures in November of 2015. We expect that this will result in approximately a $20 million loss in the fourth quarter, which will come through the corporate segment.","Overall, we have successfully laddered out our debt maturities and reduced our ongoing debt expense. We ended the quarter with continued strong balance sheet fundamentals and over $2 billion of excess capital. And we expect that our approach to returning capital to shareholders will continue to make Ameriprise unique.","With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. You guys did a pretty good job kind of dissecting all the moving pieces in the flows for the Asset Management business. But I was hoping, like taking a step back, maybe you can tell us a little bit more on the fees for the stuff that's kind of parent-related and running off versus, I guess, the new assets that are coming in because we know Zurich is low fee, but I was wondering, if you can kind of tell us on some of the U.S. Trust pieces and some of the Marsical pieces as well?","Walter S. Berman","Well, Alex, if you look at the overall fees versus our assets, we've been actually improving over the sequence. So, we are, as we explained, the basically, we're accreting on for the year-to-date on the assets that are coming in versus the assets that are leaving. So on that basis, we are mostly making up from a revenue standpoint. As you can see, our percentages have increased over the quarters. We don't get into the specifics as it relates to each one of the elements, but certainly, the elements are dealing with that in the way that we thought it would occur.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just so, kind of steady markets and assuming these dynamic continues because you guys still do have a decent amount, I guess, that could be running off. I guess we should continue to see an improvement in the fee rate, overall, that's fair.","Walter S. Berman","I think that's correct. That's a good observation.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just real quick on AWM, I was hoping you could remind us given the good improvement you've seen in sort of both channels in the franchisee and the employee side, where the pretax margins are on each one of these sub-segments within AWM?","Walter S. Berman","Well, okay. We really don't go -- as we said, the employees side of it is certainly moving into profitability as Jim has said and -- so that is making -- and that has the higher fix expense that we are getting into a positive margin there and we anticipate over time that we will certainly get to the levels of performance that we see in the franchise channel. Overall, you saw that we had a 14.2% and that takes into consideration, certainly, the bank last year was not there and that's a big impact and then the lower interest rates. So we do see the improvement in both of the -- in the 2 areas and you're going to see, I think, a greater improvement, obviously, coming from the employee channel.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So employee is profitable but not significantly profitable, right? So low-single digit margin is probably fair?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, that's fair, and again, it's building now because that has the high fixed and now we're making -- building in the volume and the activity level. So it's an, obviously, the lower pay outs that we will actually start to accrete our margin in that area as we build according to our plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi.","Unknown Analyst","This is Steve in for Bill. Given the lower G&A in the quarter for Asset Management, should we look at 40% as a sustainable margin? And is there room for margin expansion, x outside the AUM growth?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, I think on the expense side, and certainly, if you look at the trend line and the expenses that you saw in the third quarter is probably, a reasonably good run rate on that. And as far as expansion, certainly, we anticipate that we're at a pretty good level right now and, hopefully, as we get the AUM, getting the flow improvement, we would see that and the markets are certainly helping. But the expenses are pretty much in line where we anticipate.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then the performance on asset allocation equity remains strong. How is that playing out in flows and when may you get credit for that solid performance?","Walter S. Berman","Well, we feel that the longer-term track records are good. We had a little slippage in the 1 year numbers but we feel that those are larger quality portfolios that are more driven by dividend type of stocks, et cetera. So they've underperformed a little bit in the quarters. But I think our track records are strong, and I think they are playing well out there, and again, this is a focus area for us to improve our flows over time and we're gaining some traction in our institutional business in that way and retail is starting to pick up. So we do believe that it will hopefully pay some dividends as we move forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. First on Advice & Wealth Management, the advisor productivity statistic that you have in your supplement, I think, 110,000 per advisor. Obviously, there's lots of moving parts that kind of going into that number market-related fees, interest rates et cetera. But maybe just a high-level, Jim, could you kind of give us a sense of where you think that productivity statistic could go over time? And again, not putting any specific timeframe on it, but just kind of where would you like to see that number?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well. First of all, to a point reference of we've made some very good progress. Third quarter is usually -- seasonally a little slower period but we didn't see as a full out there, so actually on a relative basis, we'd say that we're continuing good momentum from the second quarter. And so we feel like that should continue. I think we have a lot of the pieces in place. Our advisors are focused. Client activity has come back. I -- We still have a good new inflow of assets. More assets have gone into our assets under management program. Our cash levels are still quite high. I mean, I think relatively good and strong, so it could be deployed even further over time. And we are much more focused on our Confident Retirement approach, which we think is actually helping as well to get even more clients engaged in our financial planning process and advice proposition. We are deploying a lot of the tools we invested in that are out there. The uptake is beginning to be very good and we know that the use of these tools and capabilities better engage clients and also frees up more time for the advisor and their teams, so that they can actually even become more productive. So we are very much focused on continuing this. I think one of the things we've always tried to do is continue the productivity, not just add new advisors but to continue productivity on our current base which we've been doing. So I look forward to that continuing and we are targeting that.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. In terms of the pieces. But just maybe stepping back, I mean, how -- we look at some of the benchmarking work that -- we've done some benchmarking work relative to other distribution systems and it seems like there's a pretty wide gap between where you are and where, say, Morgan Stanley is, or Bank of America is and I get that -- the disclosures are different and the models are different and I understand all of that. But assuming that there is a pretty sizable gap, how much of that gap do you think you could close on a go-forward basis?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. So what we'd have -- what we look at it is that -- so when you compare us to the wire houses, their focus is really on a bit more of the higher affluent type client on average and so their productivity per person is driven a little more by that activity. Ours is a little more on the massive flow into affluent and so we get a deep more consistent revenue stream from the multiple ways that we deploy and deepen the relationship through our financial advice. Now, on a -- against the independents, remember our franchisee model is more of an independent model. We are the #1 house on the street. Our productivity is way above the large houses there, if you compare us to some of the independents. So if you look at the franchisee channel, which is our largest channel, we are highly productive against the industry. If you look at us against the wire house channel, based on the nature of the type of business and where their focus is, yes, we have room to grow. Now our growth and productivity has been pretty significant over the years and we see there's a lot opportunity to further grow that. So I actually think that we will be able to penetrate those higher ranks. We are -- our advisors are focused on bringing in more clients at the higher asset levels today and position themselves to have all the capability, they have all the knowledge. We have actually some of the best tools out there and our advice proposition is strong. So that's exactly, to your point, where we are focused.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. So bottom line there, you see some decent upside to this $110,000 per advisor statistic that you guys reported in the third quarter?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And I guess, Jim, you had some comments, I think, in your prepared remarks about the Columbia retail business and how you're starting to see some third-party flows, I think, related to equities and I didn't quite get all the numbers. I am just wondering if you can maybe drill into that a little bit and give us some color in terms of what's going on there?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, I think there are 3 aspects where we see positive momentum beginning and one strong. So of course, it was Walter mentioned and I did, Europe continues to be strong in both retail in the U.K. and Europe. It was a little slow on a net basis because we have 1 large mandated fixed income that left in the third quarter but that was sort of a larger blip that occurred. Other than that, the flows were quite strong and it would have been in a larger net inflows during the quarter adjusted for that one fixed income mandate on the platform. In the U.S., our institutional business has picked up nicely. So we recorded and booked a bit more wins but there is a large win -- wins that have not funded yet and the pipeline is actually the largest that's ever been for us and continues to grow and so we, hopefully, will see that come in over the next few quarters. And that offset some of the x-parent stuff that we experienced in that channel and that's beginning to slow to, as that base of assets has diminished a bit. And then the last piece is on the intermediary and the third-party. It's hard to see some of those inflows because we, just like the industry, got hit with in the third quarter a bit more of the outflows in fixed income, so if you adjust for some of the x-parent activity in that thing or the Marsico RIA type thing, we did see a pickup in retail equity flows but it was offset by the fixed income that got a little higher redemptions across the channel. But we see that being a bit more positive as we move into the fourth quarter as well and we think that the fixed income outflows will slow a bit as we've been saying more recently, and I think, some of the buckets that we've mentioned, the sub-advisor and the RIA will also slow on the outflow basis. So that's sort of an initial feel, but again, we got a lot of the quarter to go.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then last question for Walter, I guess on the capital return. At some point, I guess we've been sitting here thinking that the $2 billion number would start to come down, especially as you're returning more than you're generating and earnings. But it seems like that excess capital is sort of staying at that $2 billion, slightly over $2 billion level. So I guess, at what point should we expect as we move into 2014 that, that feels sort of draw down some of that excess capital or how should we think about that going forward?","Walter S. Berman","Yes. Okay. We certainly, as we look at it, it's a bit of a high-class problem because we are generating a lot of free cash flow and capital and also been improving our requirements on it. So it's our intention again, as we indicated not to certainly, hold onto $2 billion plus, and certainly, we're evaluating those options as it relates to both from a dividend standpoint and from shareholder repurchase. So it is -- we are on track, like I said, if you look at the numbers, repurchase, so far, over $1.1 billion and the dividends, certainly, $307 million. So we are on track to achieve what we said for the year and certainly as we evaluate 2014, we had the capacity and capability to certainly, assess. We certainly still feel that with this room to refer valuation that we -- it still make sense to us and we would expect that it's not our objective to hold onto $2 billion.","James M. Cracchiolo","And I think, Walter, it's probably incumbent as much on is, again this year, as we've tightened and introduced various adjustments to our products and tightened our hedging and moved in some of the dynamics of some of our capital-intensive businesses, we've been able to free up a bit more capital and so that's the reason why we still have maintained a stronger capital days after returning the extra and part of that extra as you know, we did from the exit of the bank which will gives us a high returning overall company in the future. So I think over time, you'll start to see that adjust as we return -- continue to return well. But we also are generating more free cash flow because the type of the shift in the mix of the businesses.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","David Motemaden","This is David Motemaden on behalf of Tom Gallagher. Just have another question on the lower expenses in Asset Management. Just, really, was wondering what was behind that, mainly was it comp or non-comp expenses?","Walter S. Berman","No. In the Asset Management, actually, it is -- if you looking sequentially, the expenses in the quarter were actually -- we had certainly, we're upped our comp but the net effect was pretty much a normal quarter for us. If you do on a sequential, we had basically the CDO element in that quarter, the prior year and the hedge funds in the prior year to date. So expenses are tracking. As we indicated, we are managing them quite well and certainly, we feel that we can continue on this track. So there was really no aberrations in the quarter at all.","David Motemaden","Got it. And then I know, historically, there have been some higher performance fees from the alternative AUM. I'm just wondering how to think about that heading into the 4Q?","Walter S. Berman","No. I think, again, on the alternative, is certainly, it's -- we don't just see a big impact into the fourth quarter.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, that asset base has come down a lot as we've mentioned over the last number of quarters. So that should not be a major impact at all.","Operator","We have no further questions.

My name is John and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note the conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, operator and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Third Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website; on Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the Company's operations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.","These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2019 earnings release, our 2018 annual report to shareholders and our 2018 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide 3, you will see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that you will see our adjusted operating results followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. We completed our annual unlocking in the third quarter. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results excluding unlocking.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Good morning and thank you for joining us. As you saw yesterday, Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter. We're executing well investing for growth and are well positioned to capture larger share of the need for advice and solutions. This morning, I'll give you my perspective on the operating environment. Then I'll highlight our results and the traction we're getting across the business.","Turning to the markets. Volatility increased given slower global growth and uncertainty around trade policy, the Fed cut short-term rates again and long-term rates remain volatile. And U.S. and European equity markets have been mixed. So our average weighted equity index was relatively unchanged.","Next, let's review our business results in the quarter. I'll start by reinforcing three key areas of focus. First, our Wealth Management business continues to stand out producing strong results quarter after quarter. In today's climate, our advice value proposition is more relevant than ever before, and we're innovating to serve more of our clients and advisors needs and strengthening our position further.","Second, we consistently generate good returns with our Asset Management and Insurance and Annuity businesses. These are well managed, highly profitable businesses that deliver strong free cash flow and play an important role in how we serve our clients.","Third, our financial strength distinguishes Ameriprise and we've taken steps to further increase our capital flexibility. We are investing for growth and steadily returning capital to shareholders at very attractive levels.","At a consolidated level, our third quarter results were quite good compared to a year ago. On an adjusted operating basis excluding unlocking, we delivered revenue growth of 3%, solid EPS growth of 8% and a return on equity of 38%, which remains well above many peers.","Our assets under management and administration were $921 billion and within Wealth Management, Ameriprise retail client assets rose nicely to $612 billion, and advisor productivity increased to $650,000 on a trailing 12-month basis. We're proud of our track record and how we're helping clients while consistently delivering for shareholders. That brings me to our Wealth Management business our growth engine.","Advice & Wealth Management continues to perform well and we are investing for further growth. We delivered good revenue and earnings growth in the third quarter and our margins increased to 23.5% among the best in Wealth Management. Responsible investors want relationships with an advisor and a firm they trust. They're seeking perspective to help them make informed decisions.","That's what we deliver, a holistic advice across a clients full investment life, not a single stock trade. Comprehensive advice is a large and growing market and we are at the center of this opportunity. The way we deliver advice is setting us apart particularly with investors with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets.","There are some key factors driving our traction in Wealth Management. First, total client assets are up and client flows into fee-based advisory business continues to be strong. This is our 10th consecutive quarter of more than $4 billion of inflows into advisory, bringing total wrap assets to nearly $300 billion. We also saw a good pickup in transactional activity.","Advisor productivity increased 5% from strong client flows and advisors leveraging the support resources of Ameriprise. And on the recruiting front, we welcomed 96 top performing experienced advisors from firms across the industry. Top branded and independent advisors are attracted to our value proposition in the growth potential bringing their practices to Ameriprise.","We feel great about what we've put in place, but we're not standing still. Consumers continue to seek a personal relationship with an advisor complemented with digital capabilities that enhance the interaction and information flow. We're committed to meeting and exceeding that expectation, building up the strong capabilities, we already have in place.","To that end, we continue to invest significantly in our client experience, capabilities, products and solutions. We have strong personal relationships with our clients and we're using our goal-based advice expertise to expand our base and deepen these relationships even further.","Here are Highlights on four of our key initiatives in these areas. Our advice experience is coming alive as we work with more clients and continue rolling out additional digital capabilities as part of our confident retirement approach.","We've been training advisors to implement our integrated suite of tools and we're hearing good initial feedback. Clients who have gone through the experience are feeling more confident and satisfied about how we're helping them track against their goals, and we believe this increased engagement will translate into higher productivity over time.","In our advisory business, the rollout of our integrated customer advisory relationship is under way and will be completed in the next few months. With this program, our various advisory strategies work together on one technology platform giving advisors more flexibility to deliver personal investments and solutions based on client goals. This is a key capability as we serve a more affluent client base.","We're also moving to a new customer relationship management platform that will help advisors manage and act on clients that are in activity in one place. This is an important enabler of the Ameriprise client experience. This conversion is on track and will be completed by the end of the fourth quarter.","And following the bank launch, we continue to add deposits in the quarter with $2.5 billion of cash suite now transferred. In September, we launched a new line of Ameriprise Visa Signature premium credit cards and converted the existing Ameriprise portfolio.","Looking ahead, we will be adding a new mortgage program and a savings product next year. In terms of these initiatives, it takes time to go from introduction to full engagement. So, we expect to see the benefits as our advisors uptake these programs and capabilities over time.","And it's important to note that whenever we introduce new tools and capabilities, we fully integrate them into our ecosystem. I often hear from advisors who have joined us that this is a real point of differentiation for Ameriprise compared to other firms who simply provide advisors with individual tools.","Let's turn to our INA businesses. These are strong books to provide earnings diversification and stability. In the quarter, we delivered a combined $189 million in adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking. From a sales perspective, variable annuity sales were up 2% in the quarter. In Protection we had a nice growth in VUL sales reflecting the launch of a new VUL product earlier this year. However, total life sales were down, driven by IUL in this rate environment.","Overall, sales remained stable and helped to replenish the book. We're focusing on managing risk appropriately and ensuring we have the right product designed for the environment that includes our successful VA hedging program, which we continue to enhance. We've also made several product adjustments including lowering cap rates on certain IUL products and pricing and benefit changes for our variable annuities.","In regard to our closed-long-term care block, the strong actions we're taking in terms of rate increases and benefit changes are driving positive results and helping to offset the rate environment. As you know, we've reinsured a portion of the fixed annuity book and look to reinsure the remainder of the blocks when rates improve.","Now, I'll turn to Asset Management where we delivered another quarter of solid earnings and remain focused on pursuing long-term growth opportunities. We've built a global business and have good scale as well as investment strength and we're expanding distribution in key markets.","In a highly competitive marketplace, we're competing as a long-term player and making progress. Investment performance remains quite good over 1, 3 and 5-year time frames. On an asset weighted basis, more than 60% of our equity funds are outperforming and in fixed income, the outperformance is over 80%.","Turning to flows, they have improved $6 billion from the year ago with net outflows of $1.3 billion; and if you adjust for former parent outflows in the quarter, we were slightly positive. Let me take you through the drivers. In U.S. intermediary though there continues to be pressure from passive, we're making progress in gaining share inactive with many of our large focus firms having consistently [technical difficulty] quarters.","Redemptions have slowed and we're generating good momentum in strategies. I would highlight dividend income, strategic income, strategic municipal income and mortgage opportunities. When we look at our flow rates compared to active peers, Columbia Threadneedle retail equity rates have improved considerably.","In fact, we are in the top third of active players we benchmark ourselves against. For fixed income, our flow rate continues to improve and there is an opportunity to move this further. In EMEA, the challenges from Brexit and slowing economies have pressured retail flows for the industry.","We remain focused on building on our strength in the UK market and continue to expand our presence in key markets in Europe. Importantly, outflows in the quarter for institutional reflected the benefit of a large UK equity income mandate from an established wealth management that I mentioned last quarter.","In addition, we began to pick up some other wins and high yield in other strategies. Overall, in Asset Management, our assets under management ended the quarter at $469 billion and the earnings contribution to Ameriprise remain good. We are managing expenses well and delivered an adjusted margin at 38%, which is in our targeted range.","As we look forward, we are working to better deliver client solutions and investment strategies, generate consistent competitive investment performance and further improve our operational efficiency.","Now I'll turn to our capital strength, a clear differentiator. As you are aware, we successfully completed the sale of Ameriprise Auto and Home earlier this month. We worked hard to ensure a smooth transition of the business, including securing all regulatory approvals. Our priority was to find a strong partner and a good fit for policyholders and employees, and we delivered.","With the completion of the sale of Auto and Home on October 1st, we received over $1 billion and freed up $700 million of capital, adding to our strong excess capital position. We continue to focus on generating substantial free cash flow that we're reinvesting for growth and returning to shareholders.","As we informed you, we increased our buyback in the quarter, returning nearly a 120% of adjusted operating earnings in the period. Due to the share price volatility in the quarter, we were able to pick up additional shares. In summary, it was a very good quarter for Ameriprise. We are in a strong position and we're executing our plans.","With that, I'll turn it to Walter before taking your questions. Walter?","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise achieved another solid quarter of financial results. Ameriprise's adjusted operating net revenue was up 3% to $3.3 billion with limited equity market appreciation of only 1% year-over-year and year-to-date. Revenue growth was driven by strong 8% revenue growth in Advice & Wealth Management from an increase in wrap assets and improved transactional activity.","Asset Management revenue was within expectations given the cumulative impact of net outflows as well as lower market appreciation than we've seen in recent quarters. And Annuities and Protection, are stable businesses with limited revenue growth. We continue to manage expenses well across the firm with total expenses up 4% excluding unlocking and general and administrative expenses of 3%.","And we returned approximately 120% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders including increased share repurchase of $547 million or 4 million shares as well as $129 million of dividends. This resulted in a solid EPS growth of 8% and return on equity of 38%, which reflects a 680 basis point improvement.","Turning to Slide 6, you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with Advice & Wealth Management generating over half of the Company's earnings up from 42% two years ago. This profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well-managed expenses while investing for future growth. We've seen a consistent growth for the past few years, and expect this to continue as we focus substantial investments in areas of opportunity within the wealth management business.","Let's look at what took place in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7. AWM continues to perform well across leading and lagging indicators. Advice Wealth Management adjusted operating net revenue grew 8% with pre-tax adjusted operating earnings up 12%. This growth rate was impacted by the marginal growth in the WEI from last year, as well as headwinds from recent Fed rate cuts. That said, the quarter benefited from underlying organic growth that was quite strong, with wrap assets up 9% with net inflows of $4.1 billion in the quarter, and 6% improvement in transactional activity year-over-year.","We had an excellent quarter for experienced advisor recruiting with 96 advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter, and a nice pipeline as we head into the fourth quarter, and the expenses were well controlled. D&A was up only 4% excluding the bank. We are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume related to expenses given our activity levels. Finally, our margin was excellent at 23.5% up 80 basis points year-over-year.","As indicated, we have strong organic growth trends in Advice Wealth Management that you can see on Slide 8. Total client assets were up 4%, to $612 billion with wrap assets of 9% both on which have benefit from the solid trend of continued wrap net inflows in an environment where equity market depreciation was only up 1% year to date.","Advisor productivity continues to trend upward reaching $650,000 per advisor on a trailing 12-month basis. Strong experienced advisor recruiting, new digital tools and capabilities and serving more of our targeted client markets are key drivers of this trend.","Lastly, brokerage cash balances came in at $24 billion down slightly from the prior year and prior quarter. We earned 204 basis points up from 173 basis points a year ago, but down sequentially from 2010 reflecting recent Fed rate cuts. As other firms have mentioned, we too are monitoring potential Fed announcements and intend to pass along a portion of a Fed rate cut to our clients, while remaining competitive.","Let's turn to Asset Management on Page 9. In the quarter, we saw a substantial $6 billion improvement in net outflows to $1.3 billion excluding former parent related flows. We were breakeven in the quarter. This improvement reflects better trends in North America intermediary as well as the $1.8 billion mandate from St James's Place that funded in the quarter. However, flows in EMEA continue to be impacted by pressure from Brexit.","From a financial perspective, the business continues to generate substantial revenue and pre-tax adjusted operating earnings for Ameriprise. Pretax adjusted operating earnings were down 12% to $173 million driven by the cumulative impact of net outflows with limited offset from equity market appreciation of only 1% year-over-year and year-to-date.","We remain focused on tightly managing expenses while making targeted investments in appropriate areas for future growth and manage required regulatory changes. Margins in the quarter increased to 38% remaining in our targeted range of 35% to 39%.","Turning to page 10, results in Annuities and Protection are solid. Annuity earnings were down 8% to $119 million, primarily from continued low interest rates and net outflows. Unlocking was a favorable $1 million for Annuities which I will describe in more detail shortly. Protection earnings were up 8% to $70 million.","The prior year included a one-time unfavorable cost related to reinsurance. The year-over-year change was in line with the expectations given claims remain within expected ranges despite being higher than a very favorable claim quarter last year for our disability insurance as well as the impact from lower spreads. Unlocking was an unfavorable $13 million from interest rates.","Let's turn to unlocking on Page 11. In total, we realized a negative unlocking impact of $20 million which includes an unfavorable $118 million relating to interest rates. However, before we get into interest rates, I will explain some of the favorable offsets in unlocking. Annuities benefit from changes in equity-market volatility and correlation assumptions and long-term care benefited from the substantial work we have done to get higher expected premium rate increases and better uptake of benefit reduction offerings which more than offset morbidity impacts.","We have an established consistent methodology for setting our interest rate assumptions. Every year, we assess both the ultimate rate in the past -- which to get to the ultimate rate. Given the liabilities to these blocks of businesses are long in nature, over 50 years in some cases, we assess historical rate changes that can occur over a long period of time and we only make changes to our assumptions when there is compelling evidence that warrants a change.","Until recently, interest rate increases were consistent with the trajectory we have been modeling. As of 6\/30\/2018, the 10-year rate was 2.85% and increase to 2.84% by early November. By September 2019 rates dropped about 175 basis points. During a 10-day period in September, the 10-year rate recovered 44 basis points then dropped again. This volatility and velocity of change in recent periods supports.","I believe that this movement is anomalous in nature and is not representative of the long-term expectations for the block over time. So, we left our ultimate rate at 5%. Based on this volatility and velocity of change, we felt it was appropriate to extend the grading period to reach our ultimate rate by a year and held the near-term rates flat.","These interest rate assumption changes combined with the true-up for the actual interest rate at 6\/30\/19 relative to our prior assumption drove an unfavorable impact of $118 million. In the future, if we lower the ultimate interest rate by 50 basis points we estimate that the impact would be $65 million after tax. However, if we determine the environment was less volatile, we could change the grading period if it was warranted and it could reduce the impact.","Now let's move to the balance sheet on Slide 12. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow and our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent. Our excess capital was $1.8 billion at the end of the third quarter and it will increase in the fourth quarter from the Auto and Home closing.","Our strong balance sheet fundamentals and consistent financial performance across our businesses support our differentiated return of capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned $676 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends which was approximately 120% of operating earnings. This puts us on track to return 110% of operating earnings to shareholders for the full year.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","Maybe just starting off on capital. So, you ended the quarter at $1.8 billion, on October 1st you received another roughly $700 million of capital freed up from the Auto and Home sale. So, basically $2.5 billion of re-deployable capital, do you think you might go above the 110% target in terms of repurchases in the fourth quarter, you did 120% this quarter, or do you see any attractive potential acquisitions out there that might be available and of interest, maybe you could give a little color on that?","Jim Cracchiolo","Okay. Thank you, Andrew. As you saw, we did pick up a buyback in the third quarter and that was 120% of earnings. We actually picked up over 4 million shares because of the price volatility. We are continuing to think favorably, our stock values, we think, undervalued against any of those metrics we look at or a competitive frame. So we think there's good value there.","And as you said, we do have the capital. So I think one of the things that we will definitely be focused on is returning at a good rate to shareholders over time. If we go to acquisitions, we feel like we got a pretty good hand now, and we think that in time there may be some opportunities that come along, but we're not in any rush to use the capital that way unless there is something that really fits nicely and that we can get a really good return appropriate to our strategy.","So, that's the way we're playing it right now, and we think we're in a good position because we have a very solid balance sheet, we're hedged really well, we've got really good liquidity, a good cash flow and it's a good thing to have right now.","Andrew Kligerman","And then maybe a little color on the Bank that you started up. I understand there were $8 million of expenses. Could you tell us what the incremental earnings were in the quarter, where you think they'll be in 2020? And maybe, is there a way to mitigate potential Fed fund rate cuts into that Promontory account that you have, the big sweep accounts that's the $24 billion. Can you move some of those assets out your bank and maybe mitigate any spread pressures that we might be anticipating?","Walter Berman","Okay. Andrew, it's Walter. In the quarter as we -- we had about $3 million of incremental profitability. But now, if you looked at our basic stat supplement, you would see that it's in the certificate aligned with the bank, so certificate went down but that was about the profitability we had there.","Going forward, we do anticipate the Bank's profitability will be increasing as we get into the full year, the rate environment is a bit challenging, but you're correct. By bringing it on to our balance sheet, we can certainly take up our spread on that as we go forward.","Andrew Kligerman","And Walter there is an opportunity to move a significant portion of the $24 billion?","Walter Berman","Well, yes. As we indicated previously, we will be moving portions of it and we will evaluate the trade-off of doing that, but there is clearly an opportunity to move that and profitably into the bank and use this spread capability. It's a tough environment, but we will certainly be able to do that.","Jim Cracchiolo","And Andrew, as we've mentioned, we do have -- and the reason the profitability isn't there yet, but it will be growing nicely, is because of the ramp-up expenses that we bring on the resources, the platforms and do the launches of the various initiatives and products, et cetera. So that's well under way and very much appropriate to the plan we've put in place.","Andrew Kligerman","Excellent, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","It's for Advice & Wealth Management. What is your expectation for G&A expense going forward given some of the investments you've talked about and the continued ramp of the bank? Are there any seasonal impacts we should factor in for the fourth quarter?","Walter Berman","Sure, it's Walter. Yes, as you indicated, we are completing the initiatives of growth and certainly as we plan for the year and as you saw G&A declined sequentially. We do expect the expenses will come back to historic levels. But -- and seasonally in the fourth quarter, we do have higher expenses, but we do expect that in the season excluding that factor, it will return to that level.","Erik Bass","And when you said that level, you mean the historic level of growth in G&A kind of on a year-over-year basis?","Walter Berman","Yes, that's correct.","Erik Bass","And the fourth quarter, I think there is maybe some comp expense, is there a way to think about what size that spend historically?","Walter Berman","Not yet. But historically, I think last year I think it was about $10 million, but this year -- again, it changes, but that's the sort of seasonality, and we do have some year-end expenses of it in comp, but it's seasonally and it will be in that range.","Erik Bass","And maybe a bigger picture question. Recently a number of brokers and wealth managers have announced some fee changes, including reducing or eliminating trading commissions, non bundling advisory fees from investment fees for our separately managed accounts. Do you see this having any impact on your business, either from revenue or competitive standpoint and more broadly, are you seeing any pressure on wrap. Is there any move to unbundle the Advice and Asset Management components for route?","Jim Cracchiolo","At this point -- so first of all, what people have done is moved to zero fees in online trading, but if you recollect, it's gone from 20 to 16 to 11 to whatever it is, to 9 to 4 to 0, we really have not seen any impacts over the years ago. We're not really in the online trading, that's very minor activity for us, for our clients.","From our perspective, some others have said they're reducing some trading transaction fees and advisory accounts. We don't have any transaction fees to our advisors or trading fees in our advisory accounts and even the more recent one I think UBS came out with something. We are unclear of what exactly it means so if we do have discretionary accounts, Columbia funds we don't charge a management fee for today, but SMEs are a small part of our activity as well.","So we feel very good. As you heard in my opening remarks, we are very much focused on the value we provide against the holistic services we deliver rather than trading for stock or a transaction. That's not why clients come to us. It's not what we ask our advisors to do.","So we feel very comfortable with that and the more that we can get our advisors to serve the clients more fully around the advice value, we feel like we can sustain a very good level of fee revenue and even though if fees adjust over time, we feel like the services we provide can really counteract that in a sense of what more we can do for clients.","So, I feel good about what we're doing and where we're investing so that we can sustain the type of business model that we have, but we're not in the trading for no transaction fees or doing that to get people to just give us deposits to compete with the banking community. So we're focused on really what we do well, and I think that's why you can see the investments that we continue to make.","Operator","Our next question is from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","A question for Asset Management, like you've mentioned, the flows have been improving this quarter and then you called out in the press release that in North America, the retail flows were notably better. I believe your fixed income products continue to get traction and you've also got some new shelf space and at a distribution were kind of some of the key factors. Do you expect more expansion of shelf space and distribution relationship in the near-term?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So first of all you've said that back very well and understanding what we did say and we have been gaining good traction particularly in the larger firms that we're serving, we are getting more product on their platform as an example of some of the ones I've mentioned like our dividend income, our strategic income, munis, mortgage opportunities et cetera are actually gaining share and prominence, which is good because we weren't really known for on the fixed income side that much, but we have excellent products and excellent performance.","So, these are the areas we want to continue to penetrate and get more of a share that we think we can for the types of products and performance that we have. So we are hard at work there. The other offset benefit is, in the past, some of our good performing funds underperformed a little bit in the period last year and now the performance is back, and that will help us because we experienced a bit more attrition in some of those things that now that attrition or redemptions have come down, which is good.","So the combination of those factors we feel good about. Listen, it's a very competitive frame out there and depending on what happens in markets and volatility, but for the underlying we're making good progress, but we're going to keep at it. This is not a one event or a one inning so we just got to keep it up for nine innings here.","Humphrey Lee","That's helpful. Shifting gears to A&WM, the wrap net flows continue to be good, but I think it was a little bit light at this quarter compared to recent quarters. I think that may be related to kind of a little bit of a slowdown in the summer time as opposed to maybe a change in investor sentiment. Looking into the fourth quarter, I know it's still early, but can you talk about kind of your pipeline for the wrap net flows and how you think about the $4 billion marks going forward?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So I think it was exactly what you said, a bit of those seasonality but also a bit of volatility that we all looked at in the markets, where to stay tuned of what sort of is going to happen, and you can see markets pulling back and then recovering. I think right now it feels a little more stable and balanced. So, I feel that it's back on track. But there was a bit more of that volatility we experienced in the third quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","I have a couple of unrelated topics that I'm interested in. First, on the assumption review and specifically the interest rate component, Walter, so your ultimate earn rate assumption is unchanged at 5% and I think that's a new disclosure for you guys. But can you tell us how long you're assuming it will take to grade to that level?","Walter Berman","Yes, John. It will take -- we changed every year. It will take 3.5 years, but for -- in 2019, we are not expecting any increase in interest for those two quarters. So it won't grade until we get into the first quarter of 2020.","John Nadel","And what should we be using as a benchmark for that 5%? Is that like a single a 20-year, 30-year corporate or what is that?","Walter Berman","Actually, if you look at our investments and many of our investment, especially in long-term care and others are aware are actually above that, our investment strategy is certainly at that quality. But I -- we don't -- it's mixed across the board. So on that basis, it is really -- it's a 10-year treasury and but our investment strategy and our AER right now is actually in many cases over that.","John Nadel","Okay and then on the long-term care review, you mentioned that there is the benefit from premium rate increase is more than offsetting pressure from morbidity. I was just wondering if you could talk about what you saw in morbidity relative to your last assumption update a year ago. Obviously, it seems like it worsened. I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to order of magnitude there.","Walter Berman","Sure. So what we saw is as you expect -- as this experience continues and we get a more credible experience, an appreciable portion of that was related to that progression. And then we did see some changes taking place, but it was really at that level. Nothing that really surprised us as we look at the sales, looked at other elements we had going up, things going down, but really the thing to center on as this ages through, this will naturally -- you would basically increase that.","So on the morbidity side, we're feeling quite comfortable with it. And as I indicated with the strategies that we've put in place and the traction we've gotten on, it was more than, as you can see from the chart, more than offset that.","John Nadel","Yes, no, I'm just thinking about some companies who are still sort of stubbornly assuming that morbidity improves over time and I know you guys are not really assuming that. So, that's what I was getting at, and not really...","Walter Berman","No and John, as we've told you over since we've started this, we have constantly taken -- once we assess the actual experience, we've certainly adjusted for that, but there was nothing here of any surprise whatsoever.","John Nadel","And then the last one for you, I just wanted to follow up on the G&A question within Wealth Management. Maybe I can ask it this way, if we ignored the idea of some seasonally higher expenses related to comp and other, what's a better indication of sort of your underlying expectation for G&A, is it the second quarter level that was closer to $350 million or is it the third quarter level that was more like $35 million?","Walter Berman","That's an interesting question. What we were saying is the expenses are well managed with making the investments, we are indicating that we are certainly feeling comfortable about being at historic levels. And all we're saying is, in the course we're heading out of the third quarter into the fourth, you're going to see the normal increases. So that's what we're trying to manage people's expectation within that element, but we feel quite comfortable with the back and certainly be managed within the historic growth levels.","John Nadel","Okay. I mean the only reason I asked is, I think last quarter you guys indicated the second quarter was what you expect to be a run rate into the back half and obviously you did much better in the third quarter, that's all.","Walter Berman","The only thing -- let me actually, let me just try and reposition that. I think we said that the year would actually wind up because the second quarter was high, we said we wanted to give people expectations at the back half is that if we wind up lower and that the year would wind up about 6% in that range.","John Nadel","Yes. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it. Great quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. Jim, just maybe starting on flows, you had highlighted that the U.S. is seemingly having better traction here, but still some headwinds in EMEA, and it does look like though for the last couple of quarters we've been selected to a better level on flows, do you think we're going to sustain some of the improvement here for a while or when you consider what's going on in Europe, is there more of a chance that will revert to kind of that $6 billion to $8 billion of outflow quarterly level that you had been running at going back a year. Or do you think, you will sustain some of that improvement?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, Tom, I think if I -- and it's hard to know what's going to happen in the market or the political climate. I think what I would say is we have seen, to your point, more consistent improvement, not just the one-time. I mean, we did get an extra win, but it's from a long-term client that we have got wins over the years. It was just a little more lumpy because of something that happened there where they allocated a bit more funds to us in one quarter, but what I would say is, Europe is slower and the same thing with the UK because of the Brexit and because of some of the economic situation there.","But if that was to resolve a bit more, I actually think that the gates would open a little more and flows would come back in. So my team in London et cetera, feel good about where they're positioned. But if you look at many firms there, the flow situation has slowed tremendously because of that situation. So I don't think it will get worse. The question is, could it get better if they actually have some movement there.","And the answer, we feel, is yes but yes. But again, who knows, that's been going on. It looks like there is some positive movement, but we'll see if that happens. In the U.S., we've made some steady progress. We feel we can continue to make some steady progress. We feel like we've got some good products on the shelves and then more that we think we can get on, and it's really in the U.S. more about volatility and what happens. And but if the markets continue to be relatively in good shape, we think that the traction can maintain.","Thomas Gallagher","Walter, your comment on the cash sweep that you intend to pass on some of potential future Fed cuts to customers and you'd -- I guess it would be kind of a split between how much yield take and how much you'll pass on to customers. Is there going to be a point at which you can't pass any of it on to the customers anymore, just assuming you hit your zero crediting rate, like how far are you away from that scenario or do you still have a decent amount of room left?","Walter Berman","Obviously, let me start -- the thing that governs that is our competitive overview as we look at those rate cuts coming through, and that's what we've done and we've indicated approximately for these cuts that have just occurred that we bore 80% and 20% was passed to the customer. We still have room. We will evaluate it based upon -- again the competitive element within that, but there is still room to certainly have that done -- shared.","Thomas Gallagher","And I just wanted to get clarification on your balance sheet review, the 5% interest rate assumption. Is that a 5% 10-year treasury interest rate assumption that you're using?","Walter Berman","Yes it is.","Thomas Gallagher","Okay. I guess the question on that is, that's a bit above where peers are and well above and what's implied by the forward curve, if it's only a $65 million negative adjustment from lowering that, why not just lower it just because as of right now you're somewhat of an outlier in terms of using that assumption. I don't know if that, that's something that you all have thought about.","Walter Berman","It's a good point. Listen, we have studied this and we -- our actuaries have been through this and we have looked at, and we've been using the 5% and actually we were grading toward it certainly as we exited in 2018. And certainly, as we indicated, the rates were for the last three years grading toward that. So we did feel that this is an anomalous situation and as whether it being an outlier or not, we feel that rate is appropriate looking at the long-term nature of our liabilities and other aspects. So certainly we will continue to evaluate as we go through, but we felt that was appropriate.","Operator","Our next question is from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","As you think about your excess capital position and low interest rates, then you get toward year-end statutory cash flow testing. Would you anticipate much of a negative impact as you go to the statutory review at year-end?","Walter Berman","Again, we're going through review now but my handicapping is no, probably not, but I think at this stage, again, as you all know, it's a complex formula.","Ryan Krueger","And then just a high-level question, I guess you have an Investor Day in about a month. I think it's your first one in quite a few years, just curious if you can give us any kind of high level sense of what your key priorities are for that.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, we would like to walk you further through the transformation that we've made at the firm, areas that we've invested in and give you a little better flavor for what that looks like, and how we're operating and what it could mean to us moving forward, and just have a further chat with you. It's always hard to do it in these type of phone calls and so we thought it was time for us to spend a little more time with you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Couple of follow-up questions on the Bank, I guess, first -- sorry, if I missed it, but how much did the Bank contribute to net interest revenue this quarter and I guess the credit card portfolio, it was only there for about a month, so maybe, Walter, give us a sense of kind of what's the incremental benefit to revenues into Q4. I'm just kind of run rating the full quarter of the credit card portfolio coming over.","Walter Berman","As I indicated on PTI basis it was $3 million. I don't have the exact number now on the net revenue element of that, but again, so, Alex, that started up in May, so I will -- we can get you that number. As the credit card -- the credit card, again it's handicapping the contribution that's going to come from the credit card. It is a $200 million book of business. It is certainly well seasoned and it is going to have good profitability. I just don't have the exact number that we're anticipating at this stage.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, and I would just want to reconfirm. As we're ramping up the Bank, there is a lot of expenses including like in the quarter, as you mentioned, the transfer of the credit card portfolio and the launch of that et cetera. So, the judge on profitability, it will ramp up over time. We just got a lot of cost initially until we get the revenue streams ramped up.","Alex Blostein","Yes. Now, I totally get the profitability point for now and that actually going to speak to my next question. As you guys build out the Bank that could be an important shield to lower rates that you will be absorbing on the sweep accounts. So help us understand, I guess, maybe the difference in the spread between the NIM at the bank that you think you can realistically get today given where rates are versus what you are earning currently in the sweep account.","Walter Berman","Sure. Obviously, we're in a yield curve. So again our normal plans that we'd have in non-inverted situations are certainly has to be reevaluated. But by investing out in different instruments, I think we can pick up 50, 60 basis points at least and stay in -- if we stayed in floaters.","Alex Blostein","Got it, got it. Okay. And then when you guys talk about the excess capital think I know the answer to that, but that already takes into account the future capital that you will need to contribute to the Bank as you grow that, I think you moved some deposits over this quarter. I'm assuming, again that will come with some sort of a capital dynamic as well, and maybe help us think through like what are you ultimately managing that to? i think a lot of your peers, kind of could hover around 10-ish% leverage ratio or something like that. Is that a fair way to kind of think about the capital consumption of Bank?","Walter Berman","A little high, but certainly we have contemplated that into our certainly, analysis, as we indicated, growing the Bank from that standpoint. And so the $200 million plus we have in there now, certainly it was contemplated and then that came off with the -- if you just want to look at the reinsurances on fixed annuities from that standpoint, but our excess capital is quite strong and certainly the element of capital that will need for the Bank and the earnings that will be generated from the Bank, certainly not going to cause any issue at all. But you're a little high in the 10 percentage thing.","Alex Blostein","Okay, great. And then, Jim, just one question for you around more strategic angle, the Asset Management trends are clearly getting better, you guys made a lot of investments in the platform. And I think a lot of it's being rolled out next year, which should make you guys more scalable. How important a priority is M&A within that space for you guys, now the multiples have come down quite materially among the public players, maybe less so for the private, but you want to get your -- just check your pulse on the appetite for deals in the Asset Management.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, Alex, I think we actually feel good about the hand we have and so if something comes along that would really make sense or is appropriate. We can entertain it, but right now, as we said, we're really managing against what we have in place, continuing our transformation, rounding out the house a bit more in that regard. And so it's more, you know, if an opportunity came along that made a lot of sense, we would look, but we're not out there hunting.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just a question back on the assumption review, should we be thinking about any ongoing impacts in terms of earnings from the actions that you took in the third quarter here?","Walter Berman","No, not in VA and on the LTC it's flattened out, so, we really -- no.","Suneet Kamath","And would the same be true, if you lower that ultimate rate assumption from 5% to, you know, say, something 3% or 4% whatever it is. Would that be a one-time adjustment or would there potentially be some ongoing impact?","Walter Berman","I believe that will be a one-time adjustment.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. And then on the fixed annuity, I think you had said that you're looking to offload the rest of the block when rates improve. Should we be thinking about more of an environment like the first quarter of this year, would sort of be required to transact there?","Walter Berman","Actually, if you go back to when we did it, the rate was probably in the range between 250%, 270%. So again, then you do your calibration of what impact you want to have on seed. So, yes, that's a reasonable level to think about it, Suneet.","Suneet Kamath","And then maybe for Jim at a high level in terms of the wealth management business, I've just noticed it seems like there have been a lot of practices being added to Ameriprise and also leaving Ameriprise. I don't know if there's anything in the environment that's causing acceleration in practices moving around. But can you talk to maybe some of the departures that you've had over the past couple of quarters, I know you've said the pipeline looks pretty good, but I just want to get a handle on what's happening when advisors are leaving you guys.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, now, we own a net base, listen, there is always going to be recruiting against us and we pull in advisors, et cetera. I think the difference today is that in the past, it's always people who just try to recruit from us. So we do very well recruiting out in the industry. Our net pipeline and net production is quite good coming in, but you're always going to have some advisors leave for whatever reason or people want to pay up a little more.","So that's the nature of the, exercise, so to speak, but we feel good about our position. There is nothing that we feel is unusual. I think some players are just trying to pay a little more these days that we don't know how rational it is, but that's what they do. But having said that, our retention is quite strong, you can see it. Year-over-year is very consistent. And our net gain is from really higher producers coming in versus the ones leaving. So we're pretty much on track.","Operator","Our next question is from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnidge","This is a question back to the race for zero among online brokers. Could you actually see this as an event that could cause an increase in inbound interest from advisors at those platforms that are now interested in joining AWM platform?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, what we -- you see, I think the question comes is more of how those firms are thinking about what business they're trying to attract and where they've always played. So to me, when they move from, as I said $9 to $4 is the same as moving from $4 to zero. So they have continued to focus on what type of people they want to attract and some of those firms, one in particular, is probably focused more on deposits. I mean it's a tremendous part of their whole business right now. We're focused on wealth management and advisor planning and and clients around a longer-term wealth management and protection.","So in our regard, it hasn't fundamentally changed as far as people are attracted to us, they do come to us. To your point, based on the value proposition, about the more holistic advice rather than a free trade or that they're going to someone who is looking at that activity in that regard or part of a banking activity, more broadly. So to me, it does situate us well and that's the reason we are attracting some good people coming to the firm but also our advisors feel really good about the investments we're making to further support them with this value proposition.","So it's an excellent question. But yes, I think it does have some aspect, but fundamentally, the last move they made I think is more to make headlines than anything else.","John Barnidge","And then my follow-up question on the flip side, younger investors generally are more comfortable with robo advisors and index investing and maybe not engaging with wealth management advisors like prior generations have done. What is Ameriprise doing to adjust to that type of environment and bring them in-house now, possibly keep intact advisor client relationship for the next generation? Thank you for your answers.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So I think the question is, we've done a lot of research around this. And actually what we found is, don't get me wrong, just like if you go back a decade, two decades, as the discounters grew, there were some people who really continue to do self-serve or complemented their activities with some self-serve activities and that continue to grow. What's happening now in the robo et cetera, is the people who are actually gaining most of those assets are still the same type of discounters that are there if you look at where the growth is as they switch from the mutual fund supermarket to whatever.","So for us in our research we find that actually the millennials are more attracted to working with a trusted advisor, but they want the digital capability, the information flow, the interaction. But they actually say to us that if they're going to entrust their money, they want someone that they can work with that they trust, that they can converse with in some sense, but they definitely want to be surrounded by the digital capabilities and that's why we're doing the investments we're making to round that out in further support.","So for the people we go after, we call it the responsible mindset, we feel very good about continuing to appeal to them and your next question, what we're doing is the generational transfer. So, we are trying to tie back their parents and grandparent to the children and grandchildren, a bit more and that's an area that we're very much focused on.","Operator","And our last question is from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","High-level question on the Advice & Wealth Management margins, over the course of this call, you've discussed several of the underlying drivers, some of the things with regards to the banking initiatives, the core underlying trends, what's happening with expenses, but on the negative side we're facing the headwind with Fed rate cuts. Maybe you can pull that all together and discuss how you're thinking about the sustainability of the all-in modules you achieved this year as we look toward 2020 and beyond?","Walter Berman","Again, we -- as you indicated, the areas of strength that we have and the other aspects, there is certainly some headwinds against us, but the margins we believe are certainly sustainable. Obviously, as we look at it, there'll be some impact coming from the interest, but we do see a good trajectory with the growth we're seeing and the productivity and certainly, our ability to manage expenses is a key factor.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."],"2291":["Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

My name is Sylvia, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide two, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our second quarter 2019 earnings release, our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and our 2018 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide three, you\u2019ll see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the second quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results which management believes and enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Thank you, Alicia, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you saw in our earnings release Ameriprise continues to perform well. We've delivered another strong quarter completing a good first half of the year.","Today, I'll discuss a few important themes. First, our wealth management business is leading the way. It's the front end of Ameriprise and our growth engine. Second, our high quality asset management insurance and annuity businesses complement our leadership in the growing wealth management space. They deliver both competitive profitability and strong free cash flow.","And third, we have an excellent financial foundation which provides important capital generation and flexibility. We continue to take steps to free up capital, invest to accelerate our growth and generate shareholder value while returning significant amounts of capital to shareholder.","Turning to the operating environment; the economy continues to improve. Equity markets have recovered nicely from the pullback in the fourth quarter. Long-term interest rates have come down in the first half and it also looks as though the Fed may cut short-term rates in the near-term.","During the quarter we achieved some new milestones. Assets under management and administration reached an all-time high of $916 billion, and Advice and Wealth Management retail client assets grew 7% to more than $600 billion also a new record.","Additionally, we delivered double-digit EPS growth of 14% building on our track record. We've long maintained industry leading ROA and have taken it even higher to 37%, an increase of 670 basis points over the last year.","Let's start with wealth management which is driving our growth. Our comprehensive advice based approach is highly relevant, effective and uniquely Ameriprise. Our approach is supported by a broad suite of solutions and anchored in strong personal relationships to meet clients evolving needs.","Importantly, assets remain in Ameriprise through clients lifestages as their needs evolve from asset growth to preservation, income generation and estate planning. In fact, a recent report by research from Hearts & Wallets found an Ameriprise is a top performer in terms of average share of wallet across customers of all ages.","This is an important distinction at a time when many investors are choosing to work with multiple financial service providers. We not only serve our clients full range of needs, we also derive consistent revenues for the business across market cycles. This recognition reinforces how we operate and serve clients.","It complements our Temkin credential where across the investment industry Ameriprise number one in trust, number one in customer service, and number one in consumer forgiveness, and we're number one customer loyalty. Our advisors are also standing out in the industry.","So far this year 335 Ameriprise advisors have earned prominent industry recognition including top rankings in Barron's, the Financial Times and Forbes. I'm proud to see our advisors recognized in the marketplace for their excellent client service and practice success.","In terms of financials we're delivery meaningful revenue and earnings growth while we invest for the future. In fact, AWM generates nearly 80% of firm wide revenue when you include contributions from our complementary businesses. Our AWM margin remains strong at nearly 23% which is among the best in wealth management.","One of our key growth drivers is fee-based advisory. Assets were 13% to nearly $300 billion. In fact, we had $4.8 billion of net new inflows in advisory, our ninth consecutive quarter of more than $4 billion.","Another important metric is advisor productivity where we delivered a new record high, strong client flows coupled with the extensive support Ameriprise provides help drive a 6% increase. We've delivered excellent productivity growth quarter-after-quarter.","Regarding advisor recruiting, we welcome 72 experienced advisors. As a group they were 19% more productive than advisors we brought in this time last year. This continues our track record of bringing in larger producers who appreciate the Ameriprise brand and our advice value proposition.","I feel good about our results and the ability to grow. We see a significant opportunity to serve more clients with advisor, especially those with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets who value and advice relationship backed by strong capabilities in a trusted firm.","We're also investing significantly in our client experience. These investments include enhancing our advice experience with new digital capabilities. In early spring we began rolling them out along with extensive training.","Advisors are sharing success stories with me about the different it makes in their clients lives and for their practices. We're also in the early stages of advisor uptake and looking forward to building on this initial success.","Another key investment we'll discuss with you is our new customer relationship management platform that we're rolling out through the fall. This integrated system help advisors define and manage contacts, consolidate client's data and track client progress. This will make it even easier for advisors to engage client to personalized contact.","We're also taking steps to fully integrate our investment advisory platform. Later this year we're introducing a customer advisory relationship program moving from multiple different programs to one cohesive program where our various strategies can work better together freeing up time and effort for advisors to serve clients. And we launched the bank in the second quarter.","And in June, brought more than $2 billion of money market cash sweep balances on our balance sheet. Later this year and in 2020 we'll add new deposit base product, credit cards, mortgages, as well as price lending.","Ameriprise is a well-established advice leader with an excellent reputation. I'm energized about what we have today and what we're doing to further strengthen our position as a leading wealth manager.","Now, I'll turn to asset management where we continue to deliver competitive profitability and focus on targeted growth opportunities. Overall, we have a high performing lineup across equities, fixed income and asset allocation strategies and where we had pockets of underperformance we've seen good improvement this year which bodes well. Our overall investment track records remain competitive and strong.","In terms of flows we've seen an improvement in the level of outflows that we experienced from the last two quarters. Our market share in North America improved that several of our top intermediary firms with good flows into strategies where we're placing more emphasis such as a dividend income, strategic income, mortgage opportunities and municipal income.","In fact, we saw a meaningful reduction in our outflows each month of the quarter. We think we can gain even more traction in fixed income both in the strategies I've mentioned and in a number of others where we have good investment performance. We're beginning to position these strategies even more prominently.","The risk of trade in Europe and the ongoing uncertainty of Brexit impacted outflows. That said, outflows have stabilized with improvement in the UK, Benelux, Italy and Spain. You may have also seen that we won a $2 billion UK equities mandate with the majority of the funding occurring in the third quarter. In institutional, where net outflows reflecting the market environment where investors were a bit more cautious.","That said, we're making progress in our global investment solutions business that we've invested in. We're building a good pipeline and we won some mandates in the quarter. We're also working to grow our SMA model delivery business where the fee levels are in line with institutional mandates.","We now have more than $10 billion in assets under advisement. In addition we won a new 800 million mandate in the quarter. And as you know these mandates are not included in outflows. These are few areas where was seen good progress.","And as you know industry headwinds for active managers continue. Despite these pressures earnings overall Columbia Threadneedle remain strong and we ended the quarter with $468 billion in assets under management.","Our net adjusted operating margin in this business of 37.1% remains very competitive within our targeted range. We're investing where we see long-term growth opportunities and benefiting from our reengineering to help offset higher Brexit and regulatory expenses that we and others are experiencing in the UK and Europe.","Keep in mind, we run this business as part of Ameriprise with a long-term perspective. With regard to insurance and annuities these are well-managed books. These businesses provide earnings diversification and stability. They are seasoned books of businesses that replenish with client flows generating strong free cash flows for a company.","With regard to the quarter our variable annuity flows were down from last year. And while VUL and UL sales were down year-over-year we saw improvement from the first quarter driven by a pickup in the VUL. Given the environment these results are what we would expect.","We built the business to serve our Ameriprise clients and therefore have differentiated risk characteristics. We effectively hedge variable annuity guarantees. In fact, our net amount at risk as percent of account value is one of the lowest among major variable annuity writers.","With regard to our long-term care business we continue to be proactive in managing our book. In fact this current year, we saw greater rate increases and benefit adjustments than we did in past years. The Auto and Home business continues to show improved results and we're on track to close the transaction in the fourth quarter.","That brings me to a capital strength and flexibility. Both are clear differentiators. We're generating substantial free cash flow that we reinvest for growth and return to shareholders.","You can expect us to continue to build on our track record of strong capital management. As we've grown we've consistently return about 100% of our adjusted operating earnings to shareholders through steadily increasing dividends and buybacks annually.","In this last quarter based on freeing up additional capital we began to take up our buyback consistent what we've shared with you. We are in an excellent position to continue to generate shareholder value.","Our priorities on the capital front are clear. Continue investing in the business, evaluating inorganic opportunities and maintaining a return in capital to shareholders at attractive levels. Lastly, I'm pleased to share that in June Ameriprise reached a 125th anniversary, very few public companies in the U.S. has reached this milestone.","We're proud to have been in business for more than a century and I believe it's because we've always put client's needs first and have constantly evolved. As we look to the future we're energized about the growth opportunity ahead, the strength of our business and our financial foundation.","Now, Walter will take you through the numbers.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise achieved another solid quarter of financial results. With earnings per diluted share up 14% even with marginal equity market appreciation compared to a year ago, this was led by strong performance in Advice and Wealth Management and continued stable results in our other businesses.","We delivered an industry-leading return on equity of 37% which reflects a 670 basis points improvement. We are generating substantial free cash flow and maintaining excellent balance sheet fundamentals to underpin our businesses with excess capital of $1.9 billion to the end of the quarter.","I will take you through the details beginning on slide six. First, I'd like to note that our weighted equity index was up only 3% versus last year, much lower than the growth seen in the S&P 500 year-over-year.","Typically, our WEI trends similarly to the S&P 500 and the disconnect of 4% this quarter is much larger than usual primarily due to underperformance of European indices. Ameriprise's adjusted operating net revenue was up 3% to $3.2 billion driven by revenue growth in Advice and Wealth Management.","The impact from marginal market appreciation was offset by strong growth in wrap assets and improved transactional activity. Asset management revenue was on target given the cumulative impact of net outflows, as well as lower market appreciation than we've seen in recent quarters, and annuities and protection are stable businesses with limited revenue growth.","We continue to manage expenses well across the firm. With total expenses up only 2% and we returned over 100% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders through increased share repurchase and dividend. This results in very strong EPS growth of 14% and ROE of 37% as I mentioned.","Turning to slide seven, you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with Advice and Wealth Management generating over half of the company's earnings up from 36% just three years ago. We've seen the consistent trend over the past few years and it should continue as we focus substantial growth investment on areas where we're seeing opportunity within the wealth management business. Additionally, wealth management sources the majority of the company's revenue 80% over the past 12 months.","Let's turn to Advice & Wealth Management beginning on slide eight. AWM continues to perform well across all dimensions. Advice and Wealth Management adjusted operating net revenue and pretax adjusted operating earnings grew 7%, this growth rate was impacted by the marginal growth in the WEI from last year.","That said, the quarter benefited from underlying organic growth that was quite strong with wrap assets up 13%, with net inflows up $4.8 billion in the quarter and 6% improvement in transactional activity sequentially. Higher interest earnings on brokerage sweep balances and expenses were well controlled.","In addition, we launched back in the quarter and continued strong advisor recruiting both of which benefit revenue and earnings going forward. Expenses remain well-managed when you factor in the following.","We had higher volume related expenses due to the increase transactional activity I mentioned. We continue to make substantial investments for growth including the bank. There was a mark-to-market impact on our advisor deferred compensation program and there was an additional payroll day on a sequential basis.","We anticipate expenses will remain in this range for the remainder of the year. Finally, our margin remained very strong at 22.7%. As I indicated, we have strong organic growth trends in Advice & Wealth Management that you can see on slide nine.","Total client assets were up 7% to $608 billion with wrap assets up 13% both of which have benefited from the solid trend that continued wrap net inflows over many quarters. Advice and productivity continues to trend upward reaching 638,000 per advisor on a trailing 12 month basis.","Strong experienced advisor recruiting, new digital tools and capabilities and serving more of our target client market are key drivers of this trend. Lastly, brokerage cash balances came down $1 billion sequentially to $24 billion.","We earned 210 basis points, up 157 basis points from a year ago, but down a couple of basis points sequentially. As other firms have mentioned, we too are monitoring potential Fed announcements and intend to pay us a longer portion of a Fed rate cut to our clients, while remaining competitive.","Let's turn to asset management on page 10. Revenue and pretax adjusted operating earnings performed well. Similar to AWM we had a marginal benefit from equity market appreciation.","In addition, the year-over-year growth rate was impacted by cumulative outflows and unfavorable foreign exchange translation, which was offset by the time of performance fees.","Additionally, Jim mentioned several recent mandates won and the benefits from those will be seen in future quarters. We remain focused on tightly managed expenses while making target investments in appropriate areas for future growth and managing required regulatory changes. Margin in the quarter increased to 37% returning to our target range of between 35% to 39%.","Turning to page 11; results in annuities and protection are solid. Annuities earnings were up 6% to $229 million, primarily from lower sales and higher living benefit writer fees. While sales remain down year-over-year, we saw a 19% increase in variable annuity sales sequentially, which support the improved transactional activity I described in Advice and Wealth Management.","Protection earnings were up 3% to $65 million. Claims continue to be within our expected ranges and the underlying business is performing well. Clearly, interest rates remain a headwind for these businesses.","We are currently completing our unlock and review and we'll discuss the outcome of the review in the third quarter. It's likely that interest rates will have a negative impact on our unlocking. However, there are numerous factors that contribute to our unlocking.","Let's move to the balance sheet on slide 12. We continue to generate substantial free cash flow and our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent. Our excess capital reach $1.9 billion and we expect this to grow further when we closed the sale of our Auto and Home business later this year.","Our investment portfolio is well-positioned, diversified and high quality. Our hedging program remained extremely effective. These factors combined with strong financial performance across our business support our differentiated return of capital to shareholders.","In the quarter, we return $570 million to shareholders through buy back and dividends, which was 102% of operating earnings. We expect to have nearly $2.5 billion of excess capital at year-end 2019, while targeting to return a 110% of operating earnings to shareholders for the full year.","With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. Can you talk about the outlook for Advice and Wealth margins especially as a short term interest rates do you move to being a headwind? And related how much were expenses elevated this quarter due to the investments you're making it higher comp? Can you talk about how you see the investments flowing through to the bottom line over time?","Walter Berman","Sure. This is Walter. From margin standpoint again assuming the Fed does cut. That certainly will affect them, but we still that the margins will stay in the approximate rate, but again, we have good revenue growth and good profitability coming through. So it's difficult to take full -- exact estimate. But certainly we believe that the margins will remain in this range. As relates to the investment, the investment spending is a large portion of the expense increase and as we indicated we continue to expect that we can factor through the remainder of the year. And they are generating good returns. I don't have the quantification of that. But they certainly are giving us the paybacks as we see strong revenue growth.","Erik Bass","Got it. I think you'd mentioned a couple of higher comp expense items as well. Are those things that could recur? Or are those more one-off expenses in the quarter?","Walter Berman","The comp there -- if you're talking about an AWM?","Erik Bass","Yes.","Walter Berman","In AWM that was really on deferred comp and is related to basically -- we hedged portions. Some portions can't hedge. And that was the differentials that impacted us. So it's really subject to markets. But \u2013 and we are certainly mitigating some of them.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then finally, can you provide an update on your targets for the bank and the timeline for bringing on the credit card portfolio and other products you've talked about?","Walter Berman","The credit card portfolio will come on the balance latter half of this year. And the rest of the products will start coming through beginning in 2020 going through the year. But the credit card will come on in probably the third, beginning of the fourth quarter.","Erik Bass","Got it. Was there any way we should think about the earnings kind of building from here, I think it's probably neutral to a slight drag this quarter and you've talked about being profitable by the end of the year. But with those products coming on how should we think about the build out?","Walter Berman","Okay. What you're going to see for -- the bank came on basically in June and so there's very little of the sweep balance that was moved over. It was impacting the profitability. You'll see that obviously impact the third and fourth quarter. And we're targeting with certainly, a changing interest rate. We'll probably be a small positive for the year. As it relates us, we're building at the bank and the credit card portfolio would really be a slower build on that in 2019 and start building in 2020.","Erik Bass","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Walter, just to follow-up on the cash sweep, how should we think about the difference in terms of economic between sweeping to third parties versus just keeping them on your balance sheet?","Walter Berman","Sure. Okay. As related to the initial funds that we've moved over that was basically \u2013 that full benefit will \u2013 it was being realized by us was came out of them, basically a money markets on that basis, so that is a full benefit to us picking up majority of that from the investment less the amount that we're creating to the client. As we go into the transferring additional sweep balances, obviously from that standpoint the difference becomes much less because it's the investment trade-off sweep account versus what we then gap on to the balance sheet. But there will be a positive element of incremental earnings relating to monies that are moved over. This environment we just have to gauge the impact of it, obviously the interest rates where they are.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. And then you talked about the Fed cut or potential rate cut, you will be looking to pass along some of the impacts to clients. How fast can you pass along that? Is there kind of like anything that preventing you to move the impact directly to the clients?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, this is Jim. If it\u2019s one rate cut, let's say 25 basis points will be able to pass along a piece of that. Just like we took a piece and gave it to the client as the rate came in. As that rate -- if the Fed cuts more than that rate we'll again adjust, but bulk of that will just be absorbed by the firm similar to what we did on the uptake. So, what I would say is the first cut, part absorbed by the client, part absorbed by the firm and we're able to handle that as we continue to make our adjustments of shift with the bank et cetera. But it depends on the number rate cut just like we increase our margin because of the rate cuts.","The margin will be adjusted down to some extent based on in the short term.","Now aside from the margin increase from interest rate, we've got nice margin improvements from the core business. So we still expect us to continue on that path. But remember when we moved from the high-teens into the 20s, part of that was due to the increases in the Fed rate and therefore some of it will come back down in a similar fashion.","Walter Berman","It's Walter. Let me just amplify on one thing as your question on frequency. It's fairly quick because majority money is invested in Fed funds and so the influences of the credit rates are adjusted as so are earning rates.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","Hey. Good morning. I have a couple of questions. But Walter I want to come back to a statement. I think it was in your one of your final slides thinking about the capital return. I think you mentioned that you're targeting 110% of operating income for the full year, not just for the second half of the year. So, if I'm calculating it correct I think you're running it just south of 100% in the first half of the year. It seems -- I think what you're indicating to us is that the pace in the back half of the year is going to be substantially above the 110% to get to a full year 110%. I just want to make sure I have that right?","Walter Berman","You do have it correct. Obviously, it will be factoring. But that's our intention right now that we will certainly have to increase that substantially to get to that 110% for the full year approximate.","John Nadel","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe one for, Jim, I'm just -- I'm thinking about the fixed annuity book and your commentary about accelerating the free up of capital from various portions of the enforced block. After the transaction with Global Atlantic on the first 20% of the block, I think the message was very clear that you're looking to accelerate that free up. How much has the drop in long-term rates since then impacted the potential of moving forward with additional capital raised from the remaining fixed annuity block or from other pieces of the portfolio?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, I'll let Walter to cover a little more of the detail. But the way we think about it is as you'd see we have a good amount of flexibility. So it's not as though in this rate environment if rates continue to go down that we need to execute a transaction. What was really good about what we did so far and Walter and team is, it set up that capability for us and then we will work appropriately based on the appropriate arrangements and the timeframes that we're interested in with the rate environment to execute those transactions.","And so I think that gives us some more flexibility if we wanted or needed. And at the same time we don't necessarily have to do it just based on what circumstances dictate today.","Walter Berman","So it's Walter. John, certainly with our access position we don't have to do it now, but \u2013 and the interest rate will impact it will have to evaluate that. But as Jim said we have the capability in place and certainly are evaluating that and. And it's our intention in the right set of the circumstance we will then commence the remainder of it.","John Nadel","Okay. That's helpful. And then if I can sneak one last one in on Advice & Wealth Management. If I look at the first half of the year, G&A growth was around 8%, but revenue growth, little over 5%. That's the first time in a long time that I can recall that there's been that kind of differentiation or a disparity between G&A growing faster than your revenues. If G&A is going to stay around the same level as the 2Q for the remainder of this year, if we set aside the Fed and its actions, should we expect the operating margins going to decline from here?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, let me let me start and then Walter can continue. As you heard in my opening remarks we're taking the opportunity. First of all, I've mentioned to you about recruiting as an example. We're bringing in much larger books of businesses across and doing that just the transition close to people coming on board and [Indiscernible] and all that stuff. Our transaction revenue has gone up. We've had some mark-to-markets on our deferred comp that's also in those numbers. So part of the 8% is having to do with some of that.","In addition, I've mentioned some of the investments we're making. So I'll give you an example. Putting in a new CRM platform you've got all the implementation because you're actually paying for two systems overlap for the year. So there are a number of things like that. But we feel that in this timeframe where we see the growth opportunity the strong margins we have AWM as well as our potential for growth. This was a time for us to increase those expenses.","Remember, in the last year I had a cut back a bit of them because of all that DOL expense and the regulatory. So we wanted to shift that back to growth investments. We think those investments will pay us good dividends moving forward. But that's part of the reason why the G&A. So if you ask me for the future outside of those investments and some of the things I've mentioned to you. Would that continue? The answer would be no because we will firmly control our expenses particularly in a more difficult environment. But we feel right now making those investments even though G&A is up a bit. Remember we've been able to hold the line pretty well with a strong growth business.","My margins are significantly above some of the other people that you guys look at and track. And my returns are significantly higher. And that's fully loaded. That doesn't \u2013 that's not EBITDA, that's PTI. So what I would just look at is, the expenses will be higher for this year, but it's based on the things I've mentioned, if for whatever reason the market slows down and other things will climb back on their expenses. But some of that is due to the investments we make in the overlap and the growth in some of the other things that we covered in the activity levels.","Walter Berman","So John, it's Walter. The only thing I'll add to that is, listen, obviously we have good revenue trajectory, but one thing is in the second quarter we only had two weeks of the earnings coming from the bank as related to the transfer. You'll have the full impact of that starting in the third and fourth quarter.","John Nadel","Yes. That's kind of where I was going. It was -- so the bank will be a partial offset. Then if I can paraphrase for you, Jim, it sounds like what you're articulating is, as we turn the page to 2020, you'd expect us to be seeing revenue growth exceeding G&A growth?","Jim Cracchiolo","Absolutely, I mean that's what we're focused on that what we've been able to deliver. But I just wanted to say to you. I mean even with the incremental it's not as significant based on what we've been able to do. But we think this will pay some good dividends for growth in the future and the expenses will come back in line along those means.","John Nadel","Perfect. Thanks for all the time. Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey, good morning. I want to follow-up quickly on John's question about the 110%. That would imply buybacks of close to 600 million per quarter for the next two quarters. But I think about the capital position where Ameriprise sits, $1.9 billion excess capital, another 700 plus incremental by the end of the year from Auto and Home. And then you talk about these annuity blocks. So would it be fair to consider that perhaps you could ramp up the buyback considerably more even than $600 million a quarter. Where would you be thinking more about acquisitions?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, what we would say is, we feel very good about to your point the ability to return. We'll be ramping up our buyback and opportunistically continuing to look at that depending on market conditions. But it also gives us a lot of flexibility moving into 220 both from a whether it's a return of capital or it could be based on some incremental acquisitions depending on the market and the climate and the valuations and the type of business opportunities we see.","So what I would say it's a good sort of a hands to sort of play. But as Walter said, we'll be stepping it up a bit towards the end of the year depending on market circumstances if the opportunity arises, maybe more. On the other side of that, it gives us a lot of flexibility moving into 220, which I think would be a positive in your thought process.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. And I mean historically as I've seen Ameriprise, you've acquired when market conditions were weak, when others didn't have the capital. I mean, is that still the mentality? Or do you see a lot of opportunities out there that you'd like to take advantage of with this capital?","Jim Cracchiolo","So there maybe some opportunities come along. They're opportunistic depending on strategic and what we think. But having said that, I do favorably believe in the Warren Buffet mentality and we have a lot of flexibility to do that. As you know, we are actually quite strong in a down market as well.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. Two quick questions. I thought I heard Walter you mentioned a variable annuity unlocking. Could you provide a little more color around that is if something coming that would be material?","Walter Berman","Okay. So, Andrew, right now we're going through the process. We have not completed it. And so we'll do that at the end of the third quarter. We were just making the statement that the interest rates will have a negative impact. But right now, it\u2019s a little bit behavioral. The other aspects we're working through it, but we don't see anything surprising as yet.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. So nothing overly material is that from\u2026?","Walter Berman","Nothing we're seeing now.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. And then lastly just\u2026","Walter Berman","It [contemplates] but nothing we are seeing.","Andrew Kligerman","Okay. So far. Okay. Rate increases in long-term care. You mentioned that you are getting better than what you had anticipated. Could you give any sense of the magnitude there?","Walter Berman","No. Right now it's on two fronts. Obviously, we have instituted appropriate, but increased rate increases. But we're also making benefit shifts that we're seeing good percentage take-ups that are higher than we've seen previously. So we have not yet quantified, because that's part of the unlocking also. But we are certainly seeing positive aspects, both on the rate increase side and the benefit shift proposals that we've made, there is more acceptance.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. Thanks so much.","Walter Berman","You are welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Barnett from Sandler O'Neill.","John Barnett","Thanks. Given the risk transfer that was completed for the annuity segment, can you talk about a possible reduction in stranded costs going forward for that business?","Walter Berman","Are you are talking about the fixed annuities?","John Barnett","Yes.","Walter Berman","Basically it's been profit neutral. So technically there is no stranded cost implications to us from that standpoint, because it's not large in its space anyway from that standpoint.","John Barnett","Okay. And then now that we're kind of one quarter into the bank launch. Can you talk about maybe lessons learned that you can position the business for growth in the next year or so? I know when you're planning for a launch, you think things are going to go in certain way and it happens and you learn some lessons from it.","Walter Berman","Okay. It's interesting, because this is our second launch. So we've had experience in doing it. And I can say that, it's actually been quite smooth from that standpoint. And certainly the -- bringing back to credit card portfolio is moving quite well. And from the transfer of the sweep accounts and then bringing up the infrastructure, we've actually not had a lot of surprises. And like I said, we've done this before. So I think it's moving well.","John Barnett","Good. And then my final question. It sounds like there was a nice client win in the quarter for the Asset Management business. Can you talk about maybe where you're seeing opportunities in the market and how you're positioning the company in a fee pressure environment? Thank you.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So the win was really in the UK in our equities area. As you saw there has been some transition, some fund managers, et cetera. And we're well thought about. We also see some opportunities. And again, I think all of us are a little surprised, et cetera, with the Brexit delay and that has caused a little more of people holding back and risk-off in Europe and the UK for Brexit as well as some of the signs on the European economy. But we're starting to see that stabilize.","And we actually think that some of our activity will begin to pick up in Europe and the UK, as well as we move forward. And we're starting to see some more interest come back. And the other thing we're seeing is in our solutions business. Institutionally, we're starting to get some mandates. We just got one out at Asia and one or two at Europe. And the pipeline is building, and it takes time for you to really get in front of people with some of your capabilities. But I think that's starting to take hold.","The other thing we see is, in the U.S., I mentioned, but from sort of our good capability, strong performance and income-oriented strategies, both from an equity perspective, as well as fixed income, we're seeing a pickup in sales. I actually would say, if you looked at the second quarter from an active equity, we're probably doing pretty well relative to the industry. We're not getting a strong inflow as we should in the fixed income and that's where we're putting more emphasis.","We've always been known more of an equity shop and equities have been a little more active on the pressure, but we have really good strategies and fixed income. The sales group and distribution in North America is starting to shift some of their emphasis to include the fixed income more prominently and having more conversations around it. I think we could pick up some greater share there that would help the flow picture in North America in the active space.","So, we're feeling good about some of those things. Having said that, the headwinds are still there. We are continuing to shift where our investments going into, things like better in and analytics, to better enable. We're putting emphasis around some of our research capabilities, investing in some of our new solutions and infrastructure and real estate. We're getting some wins starting in the real estate from the firm we bought. So there are some good things on the horizon. Having said that, as you know, this space has been a little more difficult, but we're starting to gain some traction that hopefully will reduce our outflows.","John Barnett","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I just had one follow-up on the bank. Can you give us a sense of the spread that you're earning on the $2.2 billion of -- that was moved into the bank?","Walter Berman","That's 250 basis points.","Jim Cracchiolo","And that's AWM's earning. Okay. Look at it from that way, it's not getting into the transfer pricing discussion, about 250 basis points from the AWM standpoint.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. 250 basis points. Thanks. And then just how big are the credit card portfolios that you expect to move over the next couple of quarters?","Walter Berman","It's about -- I think it's $200 million, $220 million, something in that range.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blaustein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blaustein","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just on this last point and I had a couple of other questions on the bank. But 250 basis points, it's a pretty widespread given where rates were today. Can you tell us where you're investing that, if you look at agency spreads available out there? It seems a little strategy.","Walter Berman","Basically, we were investing right now in -- basically, in mortgage floaters and high quality for paper. And what you really seeing is a spread, because candidly it's coming off the money market. So therefore that's where the bulk of the difference is. That is very little earning rate that we would. Okay.","Alex Blaustein","Right.","Walter Berman","It's not so much we're stretching the investments, the investments are all in high quality floaters.","Alex Blaustein","Got you. And then the yield on the credit card portfolio. The $200 million you guys going to transfer in Q4. What is that? And I guess, what does that going to do to net interest margin at the bank in the near term? And then, I guess, bigger picture point, as you kind of look out a couple of years, I know you guys talked about, I believe, pre-tax income within five years getting closer to something about $200 million bucks. How is that going to evolve?","So, maybe you talk about the size of the bank within five years, kind of aspirationally where you hoping not to be? What are sort of the composition now the book would look like? And within the $200 million target, what are you assuming for credit costs, because you do think largely that's going to be consumer loan portfolio?","Walter Berman","That's a lot of questions. Let me-- I can't really give you [Indiscernible] because that work is now coming over from a third party, where we only get a small portion of the feed. Now we're going to start getting it. So I'd say, actually I don't have the exact amount on the credit card margin. So that one we can get back to you on. The issue as it relates to building the bank is really going to be in the basis. The bank is going to transfer over, as we said, substantial amounts of sweep accounts as we go through the period and certainly picking up the spread on that as we look at investing differently.","So that is really going to be the lion share of the benefit that we're going to derive on that basis and getting into probably the range of $5 billion, $6 billion , $7 billion in total. And then the rest is going to come from a help of certainly a higher profitability on the credit card as we have that profitability since we're in the underwriting with one of our partners, and then building up, as Jim said, the pledge loans, the deposit base and the mortgage base as we go through. But the real contribution is going to come from being able to use the balance sheet more effectively from -- and garner more earnings versus the sweep.","Alex Blaustein","Got it. Okay. So we'll circle back on some of those other ones. Shifting gears a little bit, just thinking about the rate sensitivity within AWM broadly, I think the brokerage cash sweep revenues are running at around $130 million this quarter. Obviously, it's a pretty clean way to think about the flow down from lower Fed rate cut. So that's pretty straightforward. I was hoping to get a sense on how the other piece of kind of the rate sensitivity in the model, so like that net interest investment income and the net expense against that. I think it's about $65 million a quarter for you guys. How is that going to evolve? I think it's basically you're certificates business with lower rate. Just not so clear on the sensitivity there to Fed cuts.","Walter Berman","The Fed cuts, obviously that one is spread, it will be impacted. But again, we have -- I would -- it would be -- I can't give you an exact amount, because that one is really we manage through a very cautious program of protecting on the liquidity. So the investment impact will be reduced. I just can't give you the exact amount, it's going to be reduced, because that is invested out further with a bell bar effect invested in certificates and different longer-term investments, but it will be impacted less because the investment earnings are -- we have a large portion of that going out right now.","Jim Cracchiolo","It shouldn't be significant.","Alex Blaustein","Yes. A little more fixed, I think, on the asset side there. All right. And the last one, just a cleanup around some of the G&A discussion and just want to make sure that I'm getting the message here. So clearly the investments spend makes sense in 2019. As we look out into 2020, G&A in AWM is that essentially going to stabilize at kind of current run rate level and then we should go back to more of a normalized growth, which I think historically has been kind of in mid single-digit range for you guys. So kind of take whatever you guys are running out for 2019 that's in you run rate and then maybe just grows a little bit slower than it was in 2019?","Walter Berman","I think that's a fair estimate. I'd say, that's definitely fair.","Alex Blaustein","Awesome. Great. Thank you very much guys .","Operator","Our last question will be from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to the AWM margin for a second again, just to make sure I'm understanding what you're communicating. So the idea here is that, the margin may kind of stay in this 22%, 23% range in kind of the rest of the year. You have the bank, but you have some of the things going on in terms of rates. And then it will resume, what has been a kind of a steady climb higher as you move into 2020. Is that a high level commentary that you're giving us?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, what I would say, Suneet, would be along that lines, but again there is some variables in there depending. So the variables are very clearly how quick does the Fed cut, right? And you can do those calculations to figure out what that would look like. But let's say, hypothetically, if the Fed only cuts ones then we feel comfortable at the margins we have. And the expense growth that we have incremental over the business activities, advisor growth and stuff like that transaction. We have that extra investments in 2019 that -- which sort of come down thereafter.","From a relative level of getting business growth that the environment is still as good, we'll start to grow back that revenue growth with the expense being well maintained again. The interest rate is the wild card, so to speak, some we can make up, for some we can't, some we will offset with as Walter said what we're able to do as we start to move more of our sweep activity into the bank and invest differently to offset some of that spread erosion from the Fed.","But I think it all depends on market and rates and the instruments at the time. So it's hard for us to predict that. But those are some of the things that would be an offset, but if the Fed doesn't cut rates dramatically, then we'll be fine and continue to grow from there. But if they do, we'll try to offset it with the bank activities and as expenses come down from the investments, but some of it will hit the margin as you would well now in the short term.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. All right. And then just two quick ones or two on Asset Management. First, I think the former parent outflows have moderated pretty significantly of late. So are we at a point where we're at this kind of a run rate kind of going forward and how big are the underlying assets in that category that you call former parent?","Walter Berman","I don't have the numbers of -- we could get to get back to that. But the balance is there, as we've always said to you, the fee revenue from our relationship with Zurich maintains pretty well, the flows will always be somewhat negative based on just how that happens, but the asset base pretty much has maintained roughly where it's been over the last number of years. There's always some ins and outs if they close a pension or other things, but market has been able to offset that.","The U.S. Trust business which is the other larger mandate. I think it's stabilized at a certain number. I don't have it in front of me. Alicia can get back to you with some of that information. But, yes, the outflows have slowed a bit and with market appreciation and dividend reinvestment, et cetera, they've maintain certain levels, but Alicia can give you that.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just my last one on Asset Management and I appreciate the improvement inflows that you're seeing. But also you've cited numerous pressures facing all companies in that industry. So, I guess, how top of mind is doing something more significant there, be it a sizable acquisition or joint venture? Thanks.","Jim Cracchiolo","So again, we feel very good about the asset management business that we have and what the team has been able to put together. In some of the areas we feel like we're quite strong enable to continue to proceed well even in this difficult environment. Having said that, we do have capabilities for acquisition, we've proven that, we've been very successful in integrating. So it has to be the right property, we're open for way that we would work with partners and thinking about that.","And if something they come along or the market in some way felt it's stressful for others more so than us, we will have the opportunity to work in some fashion. But again it's not something when needing to like have to do and we're really continuing to fine-tune our business, manage expenses, regear our activities to generate a good return in this environment, but I think -- we've proven our capability, we've proven our financial strength and we've proven our ability to look at alternatives in the right way strategically and that's what we'll try to do.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for participating.

My name is Don and I will be the operator for today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first quarter earnings call. Unfortunately Jim Cracchiolo, our Chairman and CEO is not feeling well and is unable to join today\u2019s call. Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer will review financial performance in the quarter and then take your questions.","As a reminder we will be hosting our financial community meeting on May 14th at 9 A.M. The meeting information and registration are on our website. During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials available on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.","A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, and our 2013 10-K report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Walter.","Walter Berman","","Thank you Alicia. Jim sends his apologizes and looks forward to providing you with an update on our strategy and business growth initiatives in a few weeks at our Investor Day. I will touch business highlights and focus on the financial results. Ameriprise delivered excellent financial results again this quarter. Business leading indicators remain strong with solid revenue growth and disciplined expense management. Assets under management and administration increased 11% to 783 billion reflecting strong Advice client flows and positive markets.","Let\u2019s start with operating net growth on page 3, in total operating net revenues grew 8% led by strong growth in Advice and Wealth Management up 13% and asset management up 8% versus last year. This growth coupled with effective expense management resulted in a record 15.8% margin in AWM and a 39% margin in asset management. Together Advice and Wealth Management and asset management operating earnings grew 36% from last year and now account for 61% of earnings representing substantial progress in shifting our business mix.","Turning to slide 4, operating return on equity reached an all-time high of 20.8% up over 400 basis points from last year.","Operating earnings per share reached a new record level of $2.04 up a strong 28%. The combination of our strong financial results and the level of free cash generation is a strong point of differentiation for Ameriprise that is creating clear shareholder value. ","Moving to slide 5, we continue to deliver excellent metrics and financial results in Advice and Wealth Management with pretax operating earnings up 39%. This was driven by asset based activity which was up 18% and transactional based activity up 6%. Clients are engaged in activity increase again this quarter was exceptionally strong wrap net inflows.","After a record year in 2013 wrap net inflows hit another record level in quarter one of $4.2 billion. Total wrap assets are now a 159 billion up 19% from a year ago and total client assets were up 12% to a 418 billion. Importantly our advisor force remains strong and retention and satisfaction rates remain high.","We continue to recruit, good productivity people and brought in another 76 experienced advisors in the first quarter. We have also seen significant margin expansion which reached a new record high of 15.8% in the quarter up 300 basis points from last year. We delivered the strong business and financial performance in the face of an $8 million headwind from low interest rates.","The spread earned on the 19.3 billion or brokerage cash decreased to 16 basis points from 37 basis points a year ago. At the current level the downside risk from continued to low short term interest rates is marginal. That said there is substantial upside opportunities associated with an increase in short term interest rates. Overall it was another excellent quarter for AWM.","We delivered good growth and profitability in both the employee and franchise channels. The business is consistently delivering the results we indicated that we could achieve.","Turning to asset management on slide 6, revenues increased to 807 million from 746 million last year, primarily from growth in assets under management. Assets under management increased 8% from market appreciation offset by net outflows which I will cover in more detail in a moment.","We also continued to manage expenses tightly. These have resulted in strong earnings growth of 33% to a 183 million and margin expansion to 39%. In the quarter we had a total of 3.9 billion of net outflows. Outflows were concentrated in two areas, first, we had 1.8 billion of outflows from legacy relationships including a legacy insurance mandate at Threadneedle and a former parent affiliated distribution relationship at Columbia.","Secondly, we had 2.1 billion of net outflows associated with the manager change on the U.S. equities team at Threadneedle. The outflows are inline with what we expected and we may see some additional outflows this year. Excluding these items, results remain mixed. At Columbia, excluding the legacy outflows I discussed retail outflows were 2.2 billion and included 1 billion of outflows in the defined contribution investment only channel.","This reflected poor performance in a few funds and changes have been made to improve results. Overall, we\u2019re gaining traction. We\u2019re gaining some platform wins and have been added to a number of model portfolios and continue to improve wholesaler productivity.","However, this is taking a bit of time to translate into gross sales. At Threadneedle excluding the PM departure, retail inflows were $1.2 billion with particular strength in our UK and global equity products. In April, we won a $5.5 billion retail mandate to manage assets in a strategic managed fund which holds a combination of global and UK domestic equities and bonds. We expect it will fund in the second quarter.","In institutional, we had net inflows of $0.5 billion excluding the legacy relationships I previously mentioned. We\u2019re winning mandates and continue to have a good pipeline. Overall in asset management we know that we need to execute well to strength our position in the marketplace and drive profitable net inflows.","We are making good progress in growing higher fee business while reinforcing strong client relationships and building our global organization. Our teams are collaborating across multiple areas of our business and we\u2019re launching a number of investment products and solutions using to the bond capability of both Threadneedle and Columbia.","As I discussed there is more work to do but we\u2019re moving in a positive direction.","Turning to annuities on slide 8, pretax operating earnings were a $176 million. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings grew 38% from a year ago driven by the impact of clients moving to managed volatility funds and improved equity market performance offset by lower mean reversion.","Existing policy hold the movement to manage volatility funds remains very strong and has been higher than we anticipated. This resulted in a benefit to earnings again this quarter as the managed volatility funds require lower reserves. In fixed annuities pretax operating earnings were $31 million down 16% from a year ago. These results are in-line our expectations particularly given lower overall market sales.","Fixed annuity account values declined 5% primarily reflecting continued elevated lapses on product sold through third parties where rates have been reset. This is offset by the change of crediting rates, which decreased the level of spread compression in the quarter. Approximately $1 billion of this lot will be repriced in the balance of the year.","This initiative is proceeding in-line with our expectation in terms of lapse and the favorable impact on spreads. Moving to protection on slide 9, pretax operating earnings were 59 million down significantly from the prior year due to losses in auto and home.","Our life and health businesses remain solid and earnings are aligned with expectations. We continue to have good sales up 22%, claims experience was good although at a higher level than last year. Auto and home earnings were impacted by severe winter weather that affected the industry and by a reserve increase.","Based upon additional analysis and information regarding continued adverse development bodily injury claims associated with accident years 2011 and 2012, we increased reserves.","We believe that this reserve strengthening appropriately addresses this issue. To-date the 2013 accident year have better experience than 2011 and 2012.","That being said our auto and home business metrics are good. We had steady policy growth up 11% from a year ago. We are working to deepen our relationships with our affinity partners and our own advisors and we\u2019re seeing nice progress. Auto and home is rated one of the best firms for client satisfaction and retention also remains high.","Let\u2019s turn to capital on slide 10, we ended the quarter with continued strong balance sheet fundamentals. Approximately 2 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of over 500%. We returned 457 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter.","We remain committed to continue to raise our dividends and announce a 12% increase yesterday. This brings our payout ratio to the high 20% range. Additionally our Board of Directors approved a new 2.5 billion share repurchase authorized over the next two years. Return of capital is an important driver of our ROE expansion, we reached a record 20.8% which is above our target range of 15% to 18%.","With that I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","A couple on Advice and Wealth to start, first I guess the margin as you discussed was 15.8% in the quarter and I think the commentary suggested that the expenses in the quarter were a little light. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering, how do you see that margin progressing over the course of 2014 particularly as expenses start to ramp up?","Walter Berman","Okay, if you look at the year for 2013 it was 13.8% we ended at 14.2%. Looking at it and looking at the revenue growth we see and trying to manage our expenses basically flat or little above that. Probably I would say somewhere around 150 to 200 basis points above that should be a reasonable target range for the average for the year.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","So 150 to 200 over the 13.8%?","Walter Berman","","Yes that\u2019s correct.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Got it. And I guess on the employee advisor count, I think we talked about this last quarter, but you lost another 50, I guess sequentially. I know there was some nuances last quarter that caused the advisor count not to grow. But I am just wondering at what point will we start to see the employee advisor count actually start to grow, because my sense is that\u2019s a decent driver of the margin upside in that channel.","Walter Berman","Yes and again as Jim has said, the issue -- the number\u2019s important no matter -- but it's actually the quality of the advisor we\u2019re bringing which from a trailing 12 and the AUM we\u2019re bringing on is substantially higher than we have seen in 2013. So Jim has indicated that we certainly at one point will start to grow the number but really the most important thing to concentrate on is the quality and the activity levels in AUM they are bringing which is really leverages the profitability of the AUM activity.","Again we\u2019re looking at and we\u2019re dealing with trying to drive profitable growth and so on that basis that will be the focus and certainly I agree if you -- more you bring on but again profitable advisors is the key here.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Are you still running sort of in the 60% to 70% utilization of capacity in that channel?","Walter Berman","We\u2019re actually approaching over 70% right now.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Last one is just on Columbia retail flows. I just want to go back to your prepared remarks. It seemed like your comment suggested that things are taking a little bit of time in terms of getting on these third-party platforms. I just want to understand are your comments consistent with what you've said in the past, or are you sort of suggesting to us that perhaps things are taking even a little bit longer than you had thought previously?","Walter Berman","I think it's taking a little long. I think we\u2019re making good progress but it is taking a little longer from that standpoint and certainly we seeing sales that are good and redemptions are slowing. So we feel good about it but it is certainly taking a little longer than we indicated.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Please go ahead.","Steve Fullerton - Citi","This is Steve Fullerton filling in for Bill. Just touching on Advice and Wealth again and the margin, some of your competitors have talked to increase competition for advisors. To what extent are you guys seeing maybe a tick up in Q1 in competition, and how that might affect the margin going forward?","Walter Berman","Yes we\u2019re seeing some tick up, again we\u2019re staying within the target zones that we talked about on the pay backs from a P&L standpoint under three years. Probably the biggest thing that is causing more I would say resistance from moving over is the market. When you get markets that are this strong it does create complacency but we\u2019re still able to attract the type of advisors that we want -- which will drive profitable growth and it certainly is a bit more challenging but the team is doing an excellent job.","Steve Fullerton - Citi","And then just the Threadneedle, the $5.5 billion win that you guys had. What are kind of the main drivers there? And behind that, how does the pipeline look for these type of wins? And just digging in specifics, what drove the win on that mandate?"," ","Walter Berman","Again the mandate was based upon our capability and certainly demonstrating not just of the performance of the PM but the total capability of Threadneedle. Once they decided to leave their prior investment house we basically went into a bidding with them and certainly they demonstrated the capabilities that we had and they felt comfortable. As far as pipeline I can say as we talked about in the announcement the U.S. equity was down 2.1 billion but if you back away from that it was very, very strong growth both in retail and instructional. So it was a very good pipeline there and so we are feeling quite good about that and certainly we are quite I guess favorably taking with the -- awarding of the 5.5 billion from St. James it was certainly a good recognition of our capability.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","I guess in the past you've talked to -- with the advice margins about the opportunity to significantly improve the margin from the employee advisors. Hopefully you can comment on whether some of the improvement that we saw this quarter was kind of driven by that channel with that -- how important was that as a driver for the improvement we saw?","Walter Berman","Nigel I\u2019m having a little trouble because you\u2019re breaking up. Could you repeat the question? I just don\u2019t want to not answer it appropriately.","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","Sure absolutely. So the employee advisors, you talked about them having margins in the low single digits before. Did we see -- was an improvement in the margins from the employee advisors one of the drivers that we saw improving the overall advice margins this quarter?","Walter Berman","Yes. Generally what is happening as we talked about we\u2019re clearly seeing an improvement and as Jim has said it has moved from actually a loss situation into a positive. It's margins are in the 4 to 5 range and what you\u2019re having is again advisors being attracted in. They are vintaging out, and they are also making a greater contribution to the fixed base. So we certainly think it's on the right trajectory to sort of yield the target of profitabilities that we see, but that has certainly occurred in the first quarter.","","Nigel Dally - Morgan Stanley","And just one in property and casualty I guess another charge this quarter raises the question over whether those operations are really strategically important for Ameriprise? Do the charges that we saw lead Management to reassess the strategic importance of those operations to the company looking forward?","Walter Berman","The charge we took in the quarter, yes, back in the fourth quarter we took a charge of $20 million relating to bodily injury and uninsured motorists and what that related to was the 2011, 2012 primarily and what was happening we are seeing more legal claims moving into legal status from that [ph] which elongates them and certainly takes on a different reserving profile. We saw that continue to deteriorate after extensive review in the first quarter and that\u2019s why we decided to take the reserves up. But we also took a look at 2013, while certainly it's a travel with that but certainly the initial indication is that some of the actions that we took plays in 2012 and 2011 as it relates both the pricing risk changes that we made and also looking at it from a credit linking to pricing and then focusing more eliminating or slowing down on the non-client is really starting to pay dividends, it's little early victory but certainly we\u2019re seeing concrete evidence of improvement. The business is an excellent business, it really does, their service levels, their capabilities and meeting their affinity group. It is a real asset to the firm and yes we\u2019re dealing with this and looking at it and we feel that we\u2019re making the changes and it's a valuable portion of the form, while it's not core. It certainly adds a good diversifier and it's an important element.","So again no guarantees but we certainly feel -- we\u2019re dealing with it and they have good growth and a matter of fact they just added another line of business in the travel accident which again will add another dimension to their capability. So we think again working with them to look at an improved the value proposition as we move forward."," ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","A couple questions. I guess starting with AWM or I guess continuing with AWM. It sounded like there's been a slightly elevated sale of non-traded REIT products in the quarter. We've seen a similar dynamic from some of the competitors. I was wondering if you guys could size how much that has contributed to revenues this quarter kind of over and above the more normal run rate. And then I was hoping you can just give us an update on generally how things have progressed into April given the fact that market obviously got a little bumpier, so I was just kind of curious how the retail engagement overall has fared in the month of April.","Walter Berman","Again it's not, certainly the activity contributes to it but I will say we also saw a slowdown in annuity sales which negated it to a degree but it's not really material. The real as I mentioned, was the impact of the expense and again the timing of the expense. So we get the certainly the syndicates and REITs are coming through at different times we don\u2019t know. But it was not a major-major element, we certainly had great performance in the quarter without that. I have not seen looking at the information and I\u2019ve seen that I believe our productivity and performance characteristics and the growth in our assets and wrap assets are continuing.","So again there was a little -- if you get into I don\u2019t want to make excuses, there is a little weather activity going on the first as you saw in our auto and home which certainly didn\u2019t help the situation but I think we\u2019re tracking.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","So staying on the topic, you guys highlighted 76 financial advisors that came over in the first quarter in the kind of more experienced bucket. Can you give us a sense of the productivity for those advisors relative to 450,000 to 460,000 run rate that you guys are seeing in the rest of the book?","Walter Berman","I don\u2019t have the exact number. I will get that back to you but it's certainly my recollection it was certainly, it was above that but let me get back to you on that.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","But overall the experienced bucket is continuing to kind come in above the run rate of what's in the book overall.","Walter Berman","Absolutely. The quality of what we\u2019re bringing on again is certainly at a higher level both from a production and from assets under management.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","And then last one for me just shifting to I guess the asset management for a second again. Threadneedle, so obviously a challenging area with the U.S. product and then obviously a nice win from a big competitor in the UK. Can you help us understand, I guess, what else is at risk from the U.S. product? I know you said a couple billion dollars left this quarter, but my understanding is there is still a decent amount of assets left. How do you guys plan on keeping these assets intact? And then the flip side, the $5.5 billion win that you had, can you give us a fee rate on that?","Walter Berman","Okay. So let me deal with the first one. As we said we do anticipate there will be additional outflows, the Threadneedle team has done a superb job both from the team that we have in place with Diane. She has been there, she is excellent. We have supplemented it with people from the U.S. also and the full team and they are out of Threadneedle and performance has been very, very good and in addition to us PM performance, the entire support of the firm and both from distribution seeing every client discussing it. So we do feel there will be some. It will come through in different times but certainly we do not believe that anywhere near the full amount is that risk and this is actually pretty close to where we thought it would be. We will see -- the second quarter it will certainly diminish from that and we will work our way through -- and the team is working very, very hard and the performance has been very good.","As far as the fees, we really don\u2019t disclose that but I can\u2019t say it's less than the U.S. equity one, all right, to put in proportion, all right?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","I just wanted to follow-up on the employee advisor margin. I guess the 4% to 5% range that you're talking about for, I believe it was the first quarter, where do you think that can get to overtime as these advisors continue to ramp up without the benefit of short-term rates? If we just leave rates where they are, where can that 4% to 5% get to over the next couple of years?","Walter Berman","Double and triple.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Double and triple over the next couple years without short term rates?","Walter Berman","Right.","Operator","Thank you. I will now turn the call back to Walter Berman for closing comments.","Walter Berman","Thank you everybody. I just look forward to seeing you at the FCM and again thanks.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

Alice you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, operator and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website; on Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance.","These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.

We make no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide 3, you will see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. Below that you will see our adjusted operating results which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results.","Additionally, we are providing an annual update to our long term care disclosures as an appendix to the slides posted on our website today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Good morning and thank you for joining us. Ameriprise delivered an excellent fourth quarter completing a very good year. As many of you know we held our investor day in November to give you even deeper understanding of our go-to market strategies and long term growth plans. I want to thank everyone who attended. We enjoyed our conversation with you. Regarding our growth strategy as we discussed there are four key areas driving our momentum. First, we have a significant opportunity to build on our strong position and further grow as a wealth management leader with deep client relationships.","Second, we are transforming our global asset management business to meet the important needs for active management. Third, we are managing well developed insurance annuity books of business that generate significant consistent free cash flow and finally Ameriprise is delivering profitable growth, has a sound balance sheet and is generating a high return for shareholders.","On our call today I'll discuss our results. The operating environment and our progress executing the growth drivers which outlined at Investor Day.","Turning to the markets, U.S. equities reached yet another record high and our average weighted equity index that reflects the mix of assets we managed finished up strongly for the year. As you know, the Fed interest rate cuts in 2019 are a headwind and yesterday the Fed said that interest rates remain unchanged. As January comes to a close equity markets remain strong but would a pickup in volatility. We cannot predict the year or market cycles but with deep client relationships, good cash flows and a strong balance sheet Ameriprise is built to manage these cycles and emerge stronger.","Now let's discuss the quarter. On a consolidated level fourth quarter results were quite good compared to a year ago. On an adjusted operating basis we delivered revenue growth of 6% excluding auto and home revenue in the year ago period. Solid EPS growth up 11% even after absorbing some additional expenses in corporate. A return on equity of 38.6% XAOCI and unlocking which remains well above many peers and with the sale of the auto and home business we generated $161 million in net benefit on a full year gap GAAP pre-tax basis. Our assets on the management and administration reached a new high up 18% to $973 billion. We also achieved new records and wealth management for retail client assets and advisor productivity that I'll discuss further.","With that let's now turn to our growth engine Advice & Wealth Management. We delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the fourth quarter even with significant decline in short-term interest rates. Margin in AWM was nearly 23% and continues to be among the best in wealth management. I'm pleased with how we're executing our priorities. We're growing our client base serving more affluent investors in deepening client relationships.","It all starts with the large and compelling market that we're concentrating on. Responsible investors with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets. They are looking for comprehensive advice and strong digital capabilities from an advisor and affirm that they trust. Ameriprise is uniquely positioned to serve this market and it's translating into terrific results.","We had an excellent year in Advice & Wealth Management including some nice fourth quarter highlights. Client assets [were up] 19%. Our fee based advisory business continues to stand out with more than $4 billion of inflows into advisory in the quarter. This brings total wrap assets at $318 billion to 26% increase.","Importantly we had strong client acquisition results in the quarter particular in our fluent target market and we saw a good pickup in transactional activity as more clients engaged with us in financial planning relationships. And in the quarter advisor productivity increased 6% as advisors leveraged the extensive support we offer to help them grow.","In recruiting we had another good year. We continue to attract experienced advisors from across the industry. In addition another 63 advisors joined us and it's one of the best quarters for recruiting large production practices.","What's behind our continued success? The deep long-lasting relationships we work diligently with clients and we using a goal based device expertise and enhance client experience to deepen these relationships even further.","We are also leveraging our recent investments to drive future growth. Here are some updates. We continue to increase uptake of our digitally enabled advice experience to even more clients. We completed the rollout of our custom advisory relationship program. We\u2019ve finished the conversion of our new customer relationship management platform, and we're growing the Ameriprise bank. We brought more than $1 billion of cash sweep balances on the balance sheet in the fourth quarter bringing a full year total to close to $4 billion and we will continue to bring sweep deposits on the balance sheet. This year we will be adding additional capabilities including a mortgage program, pledge loans and a savings deposit product.","I also like to point out that outside of the bank Ameriprise wealth management expenses will come back to more normalized levels in 2020. We also continue to receive important recognition in the industry. Ameriprise was recently certified by JD Power for providing an outstanding customer service experience. Our teams work hard to deliver industry-leading service. So this means a lot. I leave you with this take away with our advice value proposition and the investments we've made we have a great opportunity to continue to grow in the wealth management business. I'm energized by the opportunity we have in front of us.","Now I will turn to our INA businesses. These are strong books that provide earnings diversification and stability. We're focused on delivering insurance and annuity solutions that satisfy client needs while continuing to evolve a solution mix. In the quarter we generated $185 million in adjusted operating earnings for the protection annuity businesses in line with our expectations.","And we continue to generate strong free cash flow. In terms of annuity sales total variable annuity cash sales were up when compared to a slower quarter last year. And for the years sales were in our typical range of about $4 billion. This month we\u2019ve launched our structured solutions annuity product designed exclusively to meet the needs of Ameriprise clients. We expect this will help shift even more of our books away from products will guarantees.","Fixed annuity sales were down year-over-year in line with our plan. In protection we focused on continuing to shift from IUL to VUL where we had a very strong growth in VUL sales compared to last year. Overall life insurance of course remained stable at $195 billion.","As always we focus on managing risks appropriately and ensuring we have the right product designs for our clients in the environment. We will also continue to evaluate further action regarding reinsuring the remaining fixed annuity block this year. Moving to asset management earnings was strong and flows continue to improve. We remain focused on serving client needs and pursuing long-term growth opportunities in key areas.","Columbia Threadneedle ended the quarter with $494 billion in assets under management up 15% on improving flows and positive markets and the earnings contribution to Ameriprise remained good. We're making good progress executing our strategy and you can see that in our flow picture.","We generate $3.3 billion in net inflows in the quarter which was up $8 billion from last year. This is our third consecutive quarter of improved flows. Investment performance was excellent in 2019 across equities, fixed income and asset allocation portfolios. On an asset waited basis for our Columbia funds over 75% are above medium for 1, 3 and 5 year time frames.","For Threadneedle funds over 80% beating their benchmarks for those same time periods. And we're seeing improved results across strategies and regions with global retail leading the way. In U.S. retail we have been increasing our market share at six of our top eight broken deal partner firms and gross sales in our key strategies are good.","Our equity flow rate in the quarter was strong. In fact of the 17 active firms we\u2019ve benchmarked we were in the top five and one of the few that were in net positives for the quarter and in fixed income we continue to go on a good flows and we feel that we can improve even further.","We are seeing a particular strength in our income franchise, for example, our dividend income, strategic income and mortgage opportunity funds generated more than $2.2 billion in combined net inflows in the quarter.","In EMEA retail with BREXIT now moving forward and reduced uncertainty in the UK settlement in Europe has improved. Net flows improved by $2 billion from last year. We are making good progress. In fact, we were in net inflows and nearly all of our key markets in Europe. Now that we have built out our [indiscernible] product range and in global institutional net inflows improved by more than $2 billion experienced to a net outflow of $1 billion. We are gaining traction in number of areas that we talked to you about in November. It was another good quarter in asset management. We have a strong product lineup, excellent performance and global reach and we're focused on executing well to maintain our momentum.","Now, let me turn to a final key area of focus our capital strength, which is outstanding. Last quarter I highlighted our strong excess capital position and the benefits of the successful sale of the auto and home business in terms of freeing up capital and focusing our efforts on our core businesses. Ultimately, we ended the year at $2.2 billion of excess capital. In the fourth quarter as a continuation of a strong return of capital we\u2019ve returned 125% of operating earnings through the pickup in the pace of our buyback. And for the year, we reduced our overall share count by 8%. To summarize it was an excellent quarter and year for Ameriprise. We're in a strong position. Later this year will mark up 15th anniversary as an independent publicly traded company. We're incredibly proud of what we've accomplished. Importantly, we're proud of how we recognized for our client service, our records of outperformance and how we consistently deliver for shareholders with poised and energized to build on our record of performance and growth.","Now Walter will discuss the financials in detail and then we'll take your questions. Walter?","Walter Berman","Thank you Jim, Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and business metrics. We've adjusted operating EPS of 11% to $4.20. This was supported by strong 6% revenue growth excluding the auto and home business that we sold in the quarter. The quality of earnings across our businesses was quite strong. However, within the corporate segment there were a few timing related expense items that I like to explain.","First, we incurred higher-than-normal impairments in our low-income housing portfolio, totaling $25 million. The portfolio continues to perform well, and we do not anticipate any impact to our going forward expected tax benefits.","Second, as part of our re-engineering process and evaluation of our overall expense base going into 2020 we took an elevated level of a severance charges in the quarter of $11 million. This action positions us well moving into 2020.","Finally, we had significant share price appreciation in the quarter which required us to mark to market some of the previously issued share based compensation awards. This was a $6 million absolute impact in the quarter, but an $18 million variance year-over-year.","Going forward we expect our corporate segment losses to return to the $70 million range. On October 1 we closed the sale of auto and home to American Family. The transaction generator net benefit of $161 million over the course of the year, but it's not recognized within our operating results. We returned the 125% of earnings to shareholders in the quarter and 110% for the year based upon the sale of auto and home and the changes in our risk profile. We entered 2020 with strong balance sheet fundamentals with $2.2 billion in excess capital and a lower risk profile with long-term care continue to perform well, which you can see in the appendix.","In 2020 we will evaluate reducing leverage or remaining committed to return capital at a pace of 100% plus. Let's turn to page 6. As I mentioned adjusted operating net revenue was up 6% to $3 billion after excluding auto and home from the prior year period.","Revenue growth was driven by Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. In Advice & Wealth Management we had a substantial increase in wrap assets and improve transactional activity driving an 8% increase in revenue. In asset management revenues grew 9% including strong performance fees. Annuities and protection revenue was essentially flat.","In summary, we delivered strong EPS growth of 11% and a return on equity of nearly 39%. Turning to slide 7, you can see that our business mix continues to evolve with Advice & Wealth Management generating over half of the company's earnings up from 33% five years ago. This profitability improvement has been driven by fundamental organic growth and well managed expenses while still investing for future growth.","We've seen a consistent shift in our business mix over the past few years and expect this to continue as we focus substantial investments in areas of opportunity within wealth management business.","Advice & Wealth management continues to perform well, of course leading and lagging indicators. As you can see on slide 8 Advice & Wealth Management adjusted operating net revenues grew 8%. Wrap assets were up 26% to $318 billion with net inflows of $4.4 billion in the quarter.","Transactional activity also increased 5% year-over-year. We had a good quarter for experience advisor recruiting with 63 advisors joining us from other firms in the quarter with much higher trailing 12-months productivity.","And market levels improve nicely. Pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were up 5% or $19 million in the face of a $22 million headwind related to recent Fed rate cuts.","A strong increase in revenue allowed us to continue to drive profitable growth despite short-term interest rates. G&A increased 6% excluding the bank consistent with expectations. We are continuing to make substantial investments for growth and seeing elevated volume related expenses given strong activity levels. Our expectation is that G&A growth excluding the bank will be in the range of 3% to 4%.","Finally, our margin was solid at 22.6% and we expect we can maintain it in this range. Let's turn to asset management on page 9. In the quarter we saw a substantial 8 billion improvement with net inflows of $3.3 billion. Excluding former parent related flows net inflows were 4.2 billion benefiting from continued improvement in retail in North America and Europe as well as from reinvested dividends.","From a financial perspective the business is demonstrating an improved trajectory. Asset management continues to generate substantial revenue and pre-tax adjusted operating earnings for Ameriprise. Pre-tax adjusted operating revenue was up 9% to $770 million driven by strong performance fees and market appreciation with lower pressure from the cumulative impact of flows.","Underlying expenses remain well managed. Within the quarter expenses were impacted by elevated performance fee and year-end timey related compensation adjustments as well as a higher distribution expense associated with revenue growth. Margins in the quarter were 36% remaining in our target range of 35% to 39%.","Turning to page 10, results in annuities and protection are solid. Annuities continue to perform in line with expectations with very consistent profitability. We saw good improvement in variable annuity sales up 9% in the quarter. They are still down for the full year. We have launched a new structured variable annuity product in the first quarter that will further diversify our offering away from living benefits features and our variable annuity net amount of risk still remains one of the lowest in the industry.","Protection earnings were down slightly to $65 million. Claims remain in line with expectations.","Now let's move to balance sheet on slide 11. We accelerate the pace of capital return to shareholders in 2019 with $2.4 billion returned via buybacks and dividends. This is a continuation of our long-standing track record of capital return. In fact, over the past 10 years we have returned over $18 billion to shareholders and reduced our diluted share count by approximately 50%.","We continue to generate substantial free cash flow which along with excellent balance sheet fundamentals will support continued capital return.","We\u2019ve entered 2020 from a position of strength with 2.2 billion of excess capital. We remain committed to returning capitals to shareholders assessing potential changes to our capital structure to best support our current business mix and evaluating additional reinsurance opportunities.","With that we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","Hey good morning. So I'm looking at the advisor count and you're at 9871. It's roughly flattish with the last year's number. Could you talk a little bit about your ability to grow that count going into 2020 and the productivity of those advisers? I know revenue per advisor was up 6% year-over-year. A lot of moving parts there. So how do you see that evolving in 2020 as well?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, so we think that the advisor count would probably pick up a bit as we go forward. We actually netted out a number of advisers in the IPI area and others as we reformed and restructured that channel as well as in some of the central sites as we shifted things around. But we actually feel good about the recruitment. We're actually focused a bit more on higher productivity. And so the average productivity of the people who are leaving us are still much lower. So we focused mainly on the growth of that productivity and the type of people we are bringing in but I think the advisory account should probably pick up a bit more like we were doing more at the beginning part of the year and I feel good about the type of productivity we're bringing in in the recruitment end and the ramping up of the people who are here.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And staying on Advice & Wealth, fee rates they were around 108 basis points by our calculation in the quarter and that's kind of versus the recent 109 to 111 basis points range over the last two years or so and so I don't know is that a function of moving upmarket and why is that and where do you see the fees kind of shaking out in 2020 and \u201821?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So I think it's part of the idea of us continuing now to bring in more clients at a little higher levels where then the rates get a bit lower as the asset levels managing are a bit higher and so that's actually it's a good positive thing for us. I mean our net inflow of client activity is pretty strong, continues to be good and consistent and we are bringing in more clients and the more affluent and we're probably going to embark on something this year to even focus a bit more even on the higher net worth channels. So I think that's a favorable for us.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And one last quick one. 110 payout ratio, 110% in 2019, $2.2 billion of excess capital. Could you get that ratio even higher in 2020?","Walter Berman","We could but the answer is I think as Jim said at the investor day we are targeting at this phase 100% plus and but we are certainly monitoring and evaluating Andrew as we do but certainly we have the generation capacity and we will be evaluating that as we move forward. ","Andrew Kligerman","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking our questions. A question related to the G&A expenses. I think Jim in his prepared remarks you talked about expenses should normalize in 2020 and I think specifically in W&M, G&A expenses excluding the bank would be kind of 3% to 5% growth but I guess when you look at the overall enterprise how should we think about the expenses in general and then also how much of a banking related expenses, do you anticipate for A&WM?","Jim Cracchiolo","Okay. So, I think as we indicated, yes I think what you said for AWM the expense range around after log non normalizing for the bank is be in the 3% to 5% range. As relates to AMP, it is lower than that and it normally would be in the range of 2% and at that range.","So, we anticipate that will continue as we look but as we evaluated but that is what is reasonably good expectation.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. So, including the bank or AMP, overall and G&A expenses would be in the 2% range. Is that kind of what you're suggesting?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, the bank will be above that because we normalize or at the AWM level it's about 200 basis points, if you add for the bank. So, I can on this you know and again its obviously be a little less for AMP because the AMP size of expense base will be neutralizing forward; gives a little less impact.","Humphrey Lee","Okay.","Jim Cracchiolo","But that is basically from that standpoint and normalized number.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, got it. And then, in again in your prepared remarks you talked about the fixed annuity block. It doesn\u2019t look like these are the lower interest rate right now effects how you think about the block in terms of potential transactions. Is that a fair statement and then also can you remind us how much pressured kind of flow that you have right now backing that business?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, listen the interest rates do effect it but we do believe there is and we're evaluating that there is potential liability and certainly pursuing a fixed annuity reassurance and we are in discussions. We\u2019ve evaluated that. This is a general range, it's probably around an area of $750 million to $800 million that we can free up.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","The following question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.","Kenneth Lee","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one within the asset management business, a follow-up on the prepared remarks you touched upon seeing improving investors sentiment within the U.K. EMEA region due to breadth of clarity.","I'm wondering whether you would expect to see further improvement in that fund flows of this year due to the increasing clarity and perhaps you could just tell us which products investment products you could see potentially gaining from this improving sentiment. Thanks.","Jim Cracchiolo","Okay. So, I think you're more explicitly asking about U.K. and Europe our EMEA business. Yes, we saw a nice improvement bounce back occurring in the fourth quarter, moving from some negative in the first month of the quarter to actually inflows in the second and third month of the quarter.","And we see that continuing. Europe was actually positive for us good, U.K. was a still a coming back but was still a bit weaker but we feel like that will start to change in remitting now that they gone through the elections at the end of the year. So, we're pleasingly optimistic that there will be with a little less uncertainly.","I mean there's still uncertainty to extent of what is that trade agreement and things at the end of the year. But the people in London are feeling better and feel like the business can't come back there and the appetite would increase. And we have a good lineup.","I mean we have excellent performance in our funds. U.K. equity type products are really good, we've gained even then a negative year, flows there. And we now have a full aligned products in the CKF range in Europe. And that both well for us as there is a pickup and we're seeing that pickup in things like European equities and various things like that.","So, we're positive on that to be an improvement this year.","Kenneth Lee","Great. And just one follow-up if I may. Looking at the former parent company related outflows, looking back over the past years so and that outflow is related to that have been declining. Just wondering whether we would expect a similar kind of trajectory going forward or I just want to get your thoughts there. Thanks.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, I think we've seen some improvement in the domestic part of that and the outflow from our relationship here. The Zurich activity has been pretty consistent, once in a while they'll have a pension the closes and then some lumpiness but it's pretty much been running like what we've seen from quarter-to-quarter just based on the drawdown of these closed books and assets.","But as I said the assets that remained there through the combination of appreciation and even some difference in some of the products that we replaced that have a bit higher fee. The revenue gets so upset even though that flow negative and that book is there.","So, but I would probably say it's been running that way consistently for a while, so I don't see much change there from a flow. But the revenue's been pretty stable.","Kenneth Lee","Very helpful, thank you very much.","Operator","The following question comes from John Barnidge from Piper Sandler.","John Barnidge","Thanks. Deposit volumes in 4Q '19 for VAs was the highest since 2Q '18. Thought it was somewhat surprising given the client and rates during the year and associated repricing activity. Can you talk about your positioning in the distribution environment there? Thank you.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. We did see a bit more of a pickup. I mean, a year ago this quarter it was a slower period for us. But we saw a bit more activity towards the end of the year. We actually just in the end of this month we just launched our structured annuity product and we actually think that would pick up some traction as well in the current year and shift some of the business from the guarantee product.","I mean, we still sell a reasonable portion out of annuities without living benefits as well which is good. So, we're not looking for substantial growth but we're looking for probably a bit more growth but also is shipped to now some of the structured product as well which is good for us.","So, we want to keep that book growing or stable with slight growth which is good. And the mix improving, so that's what we're probably seeing right now.","John Barnidge","Oh, great. And my follow-up, does breadth of clarity change your view around M&A for asset management as I believe the fee rate for retails a bit higher on EMEA than in the U.S.?","Jim Cracchiolo","No. We want to continue to growth in EMEA and Europe to the point you referenced based on fee rates and the use of actives as well. So, we keep our eye out for opportunities but we actually feel like some of the investments we're making in the expansion of resources that we're putting on the continent gives us some opportunity for further growth there as well.","John Barnidge","Thanks you for the answer.","Operator","The following question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Just a question on the AWM growth, just looking at page 13 of the supplement, it looks like total client AUM versus the wrap accounts is growing a bit slower. Just curious if or using outflows in the non-wrap business and overall how was that impacting your growth in that business and just overall economics.","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, looking at the client flows that's still pretty very good. So, there in excess of the 4 billion. I don\u2019t know exactly with the ins and outs there is some ins and outs. But a shift between the non-wrap to wrap has slowed a lot. I mean, it's sort of leveled out.","I can't tell you know like from period to period might be slight. But the net of the effect of what those flows are gross client net client inflows in total. So, it's within that realm I will probably say with the fourth quarter we just, the market's being where they were, I'll probably think activity was slow at a little more for investment purposes.","Just because people were waiting for the next shoot to drop but I think it's been pretty stable.","Tom Gallagher","So Jim, just following-up on that. Would you say overall flows into the complex from a total client assets or would be closed to the 4 billion mark?","Jim Cracchiolo","It's not the 4 billion but in that range in the fourth quarter.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, that's helpful. And then how should we think about total capital return, I mean I know you returned more than the 90%. Certainly last year, you're sitting on substantial excess as we stand today.","How were you thinking about utilization of the excess, so you're thinking more strategic M&A, are there opportunities out there and then maybe doing more buybacks if nothing if you don\u2019t find anything like where are you leaning now more toward with deployment of that excess particularly after the P&C capital free significant amount.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, as you saw we did pick up the buyback as we said. Walter just mentioned that we're probably looking to continue usually saying 90 to a 100, we're seeing probably a 100 plus at this point in time not knowing the world and the et cetera. But if it\u2019s things presents good opportunities for additional, we do that.","But we constantly monitor the cash flow continues to be quite good and strong. As Walter also said, we're probably looking to reinsure some more as we go through the year. So, I think buyback is still would be probably be the main return mechanism. We will look presenting to the board about a dividend increase again this year whether consistent with all the years that we have done that.","And we always look at for some M&A strategically to fit in but that depends on opportunities that may come along and not but we have enough capital flexibility that should not affect our buyback trajectory.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our following question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to start with the A&WM margin. So, if the fed is on hold now, is the impact of the what they did last year in terms of rate cuts sort of fully baked in to the 22.6 margin?","Walter Berman","Yes, basically it is, could small deviation but basically it is.","Suneet Kamath","And then at Investor Day, I mean I don\u2019t want to nitpick here but you talked about a 20% plus margin in A&WM. Now on this call you're saying you could maintain a 22.6%. Is there sort of a change in how you're thinking about that margin relative to what you told at Investor Day?","Walter Berman","No, not at all.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then, the last one I had is on the bank. I think we have a good sense of what the expenses are but can you give us a sense of what the bank revenues are and how you expect that to progress as we move through 2020?","Walter Berman","Yes. So, as we indicated, we had a small profit in 2019 and we do expect with the launches of different products and adding more transversely money over the revenues will grow. Obviously, this is a challenging market for investments. But on that base we do see that revenue is growing and it's us increasing our profitability in 2020.","Suneet Kamath","Do you have a sense of the revenue base there right now from the bank?","Walter Berman","Let me. I don\u2019t want to guess, so I will get back to you.","Suneet Kamath","All right. Thanks, Walter.","Operator","Our following question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you, couple of follow-ups on advising `well sort of a long same line as Suneet's questions. I guess first would you expect cash yields to be pretty stable going forward if the fed remains on hold, are there any competitive dynamics that could create some noise there?","Walter Berman","No. I don\u2019t believe that we see any. Obviously, we're constantly monitoring and measuring but no we don't see any of this at this time.","Erik Bass","Got it. And then, Morgan Stanley recently provided a target of getting its wealth management business margins to the 28% to 30% range over the next two years.","And I realize there are differences between its business in years. But do you see getting to kind of a mid-20% margin is something that maybe achievable over the intermediate term as the bank reaches scale and if you continue to improve advisor productivity levels.","Walter Berman","Yes. I would say, listen I mean one of the things very clearly as you have sort of compressed rates out there with what the fed recently did versus some of the banks that might have been started previously where based on their investments and other things like the warehouses with their banking entities and the use of that.","But I would actually say if we get a bit better in some of the yield curve or some pick up a little better on some of the longer rates not substantially. I think you can see with what we're shifting into the bank with the development going through the bank. But that could be adding to margins even if the fed maintained rates right now.","So to speak, depending on what happens in the larger climate. But we're ramping up the bank in a period when those things are pretty compressed.","Erik Bass","Got it.","Walter Berman","But we feel good about it because we it gives us the opportunity of things normalize a little better again.","Erik Bass","Got it, thank you. And is there a correlation between productivity and margin or just productivity just help drive revenues but kind of your payout stay the same and it's sort of margin neutral?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, the productivity over the years have definitely, I mean, you can see our margins have gone up pretty tremendously. We do, you see and still have sort of an independent and employee based, the employee margins have increased nicely, are independent sort of quite good.","And so, we have added to margin based upon the productivity increase and the business growth. And I don\u2019t see that changing substantially. I think what we're just managing is you have spurts in markets and other things. So, we just will averaging that outright now.","But as Walter said our expense growth should come down a bit outside of the bank back to more normalized levels. So, we feel good about maintaining and improving that margin over time but again things are with the environment which you can always predict that and what the impact maybe in the short term.","Erik Bass","Certainly. And thank you for the comments.","Operator","And the last question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey guys, thanks for taking a couple of questions here. I have a few one AWM mostly. So, I guess first there is it possible for you to give us a sense how much in net interest income you expect to generate at the bank in 2020 and sort of what that contemplates, in other words are there more deposits you kind of move from sweep or whatever you move that's enough to kind of just put in into loans or other things you guys doing at the bank is my first question.","Walter Berman","I guess, let me -- first, since we start the bank mid-year, obviously we'll get the calibration effects that we'll get to manage at the moment increase on that basis. We will be increasing certainly as I indicated this week, flows into the banks so that will.","But again as Jim mentioned, market, the rates are fairly constructive and we are certainly looking at book launching and have being more emphasis on our privileged loan program and certainly getting into a deposit program.","Alex Blostein","Okay. But no rough sense of in terms of the revenue dollars do you expect to get out of the bank this year?","Walter Berman","No, not exactly it did. Again it's new to FL, we'd have to we're not forecasting but certainly there'll be an increase and again we're assuming an increase in profitability but I don\u2019t have the exact correlation.","Jim Cracchiolo","And Alex, we are forming as we have started to ramp up the bank, the shift in the sweep looking at the current environment regarding both the lending and investment strategy, the roll out of some of the products this year. We will be forming that and as that gets more informed.","We will be chatting with you and informing you as well. So, it's just that the early stages of that. But all the ground work, all the foundational elements even the initial shift in the launch of the credit card, the initial sweeps et cetera have taken place. So, we're right on track to our plans but the second level of that will be forming as we going through this year.","Alex Blostein","Got it, thanks. And then in terms of the asset growth, so at a high level everything you guys are talking about sounds great in terms of recruiting, higher productivity et cetera. When we look at the wrap flows this year, they've decelerated versus last year despite the fact that what feels like it's been a very robust environment for the industry as well as some of your peers.","So, what's been driving the decline in wrap accounts this year, what do you think is a reasonable EBIT dollar amount organic growth you expect to get out of that over the next kind of 12 to 24 months. And then, when you look I guess at the fee rate on wrap accounts, that's also been coming down for the last couple of years.","So, can it help us reconcile all those three maybe? Thanks.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. We don\u2019t really see that what you're saying per se. I know the wrap account in previous year to were a bit higher. But remember that was part of an industry shift, we were part of that moving with the deal well and activities and accelerating some of that transfer.","But from an organic level as I said a $4.4 billion is still pretty nicely organically growth. And we see that continuing. We feel like our fee rates are pretty good as you've said as we continue to move up market. Some of the fees will be lower naturally based upon pricing. But now, I don\u2019t see you know it could move slightly from what we said but I don\u2019t see a slowdown per se.","Our client activity is good. But we do a lot more business than wrap. And so, importantly it's not just a wrap business per se, we try to do more comprehensive business. But I feel that that's not necessarily I see a slowing. I see things go period-to-period but I think over the longer term we feel pretty good about it and we think that that will continue.","Our wrap balances were up 26% year-over-year. So, I'm not sure at a line many thing in the industry, there may be some further shift for some people where they were behind on it and accelerating at that. We've always had a good strong wrap business.","Alex Blostein","Got it, great. Thanks, very much.","Operator","We have no further questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for your participation.

My name is Serbia, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s first quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website; on Slide 2 you\u2019ll see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our first quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2017 annual report to shareholders, and our 2017 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. Below that, you see our adjusted operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.","I\u2019d like to point out that effective January 1, 2018 the company changed the naming convention for its non-GAAP financial measures from operating to adjusted operating to more clearly differentiate between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The definition of these measures remains unchanged. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on adjusted operating financial results.","Additionally, in the first quarter Ameriprise adopted a new accounting standard; revenue from contracts with customers on a retrospective basis. The adoption resulted in changes to certain advisory revenues that are now recognized on a gross rather than a net basis. All information discussed today reflects this restatement.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Good morning. Thanks for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I\u2019ll provide my perspective on the business, and then Walter will follow with our detailed financials. Let\u2019s begin.","I\u2019m pleased to share that Ameriprise reported strong first quarter results. We\u2019re generating good earnings growth in both the Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. So far in 2018 the overall operating environment has remained positive but fluid. After a strong January, market volatility increased the markets ended down for the quarter. In March, the Fed increased short-term rates and longer term rates have begun to rise though they remain at low levels. And the regulatory environment is clearer, so we\u2019re encouraged by that.","In the first quarter we had good growth in client assets and activity. In terms of financials, assets under management and administration were $887 billion up 9%. And on adjusted operating basis, net revenues grew nicely excluding the impact of 12b-1 was 9%. We delivered significant growth in earnings up 30%. Earnings per diluted share grew a meaningful 37% and our return on equity is consistently among the best in the industry at 29.3%.","Maintaining a strong financial foundation is core to how we operate and gives us flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. We return 91% of adjusted earnings in the first quarter consistent with our return over the last several years. And yesterday we announced another increase in our regular quarterly dividend up 8% to $0.90 per share. This continues our record for consistent dividend growth over the years and marks our 13th increase over the last 13 years and since 2012 we doubled our dividend.","Let\u2019s move to our business results. In Advice & Wealth Management, our advice value proposition and premium client experience are important differentiators. We work diligently to earn excellent clients\u2019 satisfaction. Proudly, Ameriprise is also recognized in the investment industry for our trust, customer service, consumer forgiveness and likelihood to recommend.","And in the first quarter, Ameriprise was ranked as a Hearts & Wallets Top Performer in four important areas; understands me and shares my values; explains things in understandable terms; has defined, repeatable processes for producing results; and has knowledgeable, timely and tactical investment ideas. This terrific recognition builds on our existing credentials and reinforces that what we do for our clients and how we do it continues to differentiate Ameriprise in the industry.","In an improved operating environment, Ameriprise client assets grew 12% from a year ago as clients put more money to work. Activity was strong and we had an excellent quarter for net inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts of $5.7 billion, an increase of 44% over last year. Our investment advisory platform is one of the largest in the industry at more than $250 billion growing 18% from a year ago.","We continue to invest significantly in our brand, technology, tools and training to help our advisors grow their productivity and to further strengthen awareness of Ameriprise and our value proposition. We\u2019re building on our successful Be Brilliant national advertising campaign and launch new broadcast and online advertising during the quarter with continued high awareness levels.","We\u2019re spending significant time on delivering our highly effective advice value proposition more consistently. Many advisors are taking advantage of our extensive leadership coaching programs on advice and generating client referrals. We\u2019re serving more clients with comprehensive advise and financial planning as well as more million dollar plus clients.","In addition, we invest in our digital capabilities so that clients can work even more collaboratively with their advisors. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in our servicing capabilities as well as data and analytics to better understand client preferences and help advisors deepen the relationships. And our field team is strong and successful. Ameriprise advisor production was up 16% excluding net 12b-1 fee change. Our advisors have consistently increased productivity at a higher rate than most of our competitors and we had continued strong productivity growth in the first quarter.","In addition, another 79 experienced advisors joined Ameriprise in the first quarter from wirehouses, regionals and independent firms. And we have the largest number of Ameriprise advisors ever named to several top advisor industry rankings. Our insurance and annuity solutions are an important part of the largest solution set that we offer. Sales of variable annuities have ticked up by about 20% from a year ago and variable annuity account balances grew 3% driven by equity market gains. In insurance we\u2019re seeing continued good sales in VUL and UL, which were driven by IUL, lump sum sales in the quarter.","For both our insurance and annuity businesses, we\u2019re simplifying and streamlining our sales processes to help deepen advisor and client engagement, and meet client\u2019s needs for retirement income and protection. In Auto & Home, we had underline improvement in profitability and the changes we\u2019ve implemented are having a positive impact. We\u2019ve improved claims management pricing and underwriting and the changes are working their way through the book. Unfortunately like the industry, cat losses drove down from prior quarters were a bit above our expectations given the storms in the Northeast and Midwest.","In asset management, we continue to deliver good financial results and competitive investment performance for our investors. Our first quarter financials were strong. Pretax adjusted operating earnings increased 30% from a year ago. And assets under management were up 4% to $485 billion. Regarding investment performance it remains very good. At the end of the quarter about 70% of our funds, equities, fixed income and asset allocation were above Lipper medians or benchmarks for one- , three- and five-year timeframes. And results were particularly strong in the U.S. across domestic and international equities as well as taxable on tax exempt fixed income.","Clients are benefiting from our efforts to establish a global investment operation, which is resulting in increased collaboration and insight sharing across a range of investment portfolios. Net outflows were elevated in the quarter. The main driver was in institutional where we were impacted by clients\u2019 tactical asset allocation decisions, a large sovereign wealth client who redeem for liquidity purposes, and the late fundings given the market environment. It was not performance related. We expect improved sales in the second quarter as more number of our wins are expected to be funded.","In Global Retail, the increase in outflows were driven by higher redemptions in EMEA given volatility. We do anticipate it to bounce back in the second quarter given expected platform fundings. In U.S. retail we will remain in outflows as we are still experiencing pressure from redemptions in equities like the industry, though sales at major intermediary clients have improved from last year. In each quarter we expect the level of outflows from our closed block of low fee former parent assets, and the flow rate in the quarter was in line with our expectations and improved a bit from a year ago.","With regard to what we\u2019re doing about our flow situation; in institutional we are working to have more strategies approved with consultants, and deepen relationships with current clients while we continue to further expand internationally. Then we go to Retail, in February we added a new Head of North America which aligns our regional leadership similarly to EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We\u2019re working hard to get more strategies on platforms, enhancing our segmentation strategies, and ensuring our wholesalers are engaging their clients about their particular needs.","In EMEA, we\u2019re investing more resources to expand the distribution reach in key markets in Europe to compliment our UK\u2019s strength. We\u2019re also investing to strengthen our Columbia Threadneedle brand awareness across our regions, including in key markets in Europe as well as in the U.S., where we\u2019re seeing a good lift from our television ads and digital strategy. In the quarter, we completed a significant portion of the planned integration of our front middle and back office operation platforms that will increase our flexibility and ability to offer customized solutions, and we continue to prepare for Brexit, and that work is going well. In Asset Management we have more work to do and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.","Overall, Ameriprise is in a strong position, we have a great foundation upon which we can build. Very few financial services companies are generating this level of consistent performance returning to shareholders like Ameriprise has, while continuing to deliver good earnings. We have an excellent financial foundation and balance sheet that we manage very well. Our diversified business provides important flexibility and our Wealth Management business is one of the best in the industry and has significant growth potential, and is responsible for driving approximately 75% of the company\u2019s overall revenue.","We\u2019re confident on the investments we\u2019re making as we focus on serving more clients and growing the business, and therefore we believe Ameriprise is undervalued and represents a compelling opportunity both today and for the future.","Now Walter will review our financials, and I\u2019ll be back at the end for questions.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered strong results in the quarter. We continue to make significant progress in delivering our long-term shareholder objectives with strong growth in revenue, EPS, and return on equity.","Let me take you through the details beginning on Slide 6. Ameriprise reported adjusted operating EPS of $3.70, fueled by our strong growth businesses. AWM and Asset Management earnings were up over 25% in the quarter. Overall revenue growth was strong, up 9% in the quarter. Strong growth in client assets, particularly in wrap accounts, and market appreciation drove substantial 16% top line growth in AWM.","Asset Management revenue was up 7% from markets and a vendor credit relating to completion of our front, middle, and back office integration. Annuities and Protection\u2019s stable revenue was in line with our expectations. Expenses continue to be well managed across the firm with G&A up only 1%. I will go into details on expenses in each segment on the subsequent pages.","We returned more than $500 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends. Given the lower share price in February and March, we increased the amount of share repurchase to the highest level over the past five quarters.","Let\u2019s turn to AWM on Slide 7. Advice & Wealth Management delivered another outstanding quarter, across all dimensions. Revenue was up 16%, driven by strong net inflows and improved transactional activity levels, as well as higher equity markets and interest rates. Expense growth was primarily driven by higher distribution related expenses. G&A increased 6% which included higher volume related impacts due to strong growth, increased investment for business growth and the addition of IPI.","AWM had substantial 27% earnings growth and 230 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. The adoption of the new accounting standard impacted margins in both periods by approximately 40 basis points.","I\u2019d like to take a moment to review the quarterly drivers of earnings. First, there are only 90 fee days in the first quarter, 91 days in Q2, and 92 days in Q3 and Q4. Given the growth we\u2019ve seen over the past years in our wrap business, the impact of each fee day has increased to approximately $14 million of revenue, and $6 million of PTI. Second, there was one pure E&O day, which negatively impacts revenue by $3 million. Last we have some seasonality in our expenses that we have discussed in the past. As it relates to the first quarter, we had hard payroll tax expense of $7 million.","Let\u2019s turn to Asset Management on Page 8. Asset Management financial performance remain very strong. Revenues were up 7% from strong market appreciation, the acquisition of Lionstone as well as the vendor credit I mentioned earlier. In addition, the fee rate was consistent with our expectations in the 52 basis points to 53 basis points range.","Expenses continue to be prudently managed. Excluding acquisition of Lionstone, G&A increased 3% and included elevated research and regulatory cost in the UK and Europe. We delivered particularly strong margin of 40% in the quarter. We continue to expect the margin to be in the 35% to 39% range in the near term.","Let\u2019s turn to annuities on Slide 9. Variable annuities were flat at $116 million. Equity market appreciation increased account balance year-over-year, but earnings were flat due to lower mean reversion than a year ago. Variable annuities continue to be in outflows, though at a slower pace than last year in both our internally distributed block, and the closed block that was distributed by third parties. We\u2019ve also seen a 20% increase in sales of our variable annuity product. Fixed annuities pretax operating earnings declined $7 million as lapses in interest rates continue to impact results as expected.","Turning to Protection on Slide 10. Life & Health pretax operating earnings declined 4% from the pressure of continued lower interest rates. Total claims are in line with expectations, so we did see a slight uptick in mortality in the first quarter that was offset by an improvement in the disability income. We had good sales momentum as we started the year, but typically for our Indexed Universal Life product which is up 9%.","In the Auto & Home business pretax operating results in the quarter were impacted by elevated net cat losses of $14 million that were concentrated in the Northeast. We continued to reduce Home exposure in Colorado and Texas from the cancellation of one of our affinity partnerships. This has resulted in our Home policies enforced declining 6% year-over-year and 3% within the quarter.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11. We are continuing to grow our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses at a faster pace than Insurance & Annuities. Advice & Wealth Management made up nearly 45% of the earnings in the quarter. Combining with the Asset Management, the fee-based businesses has made up 72% of our earnings for the quarter. This mix shift supports our strong fee cash flow generation.","Next I would like to spend a few minutes on our risk management framework and inferences that have been drawn above the reserve adequacy of our long-term care businesses. As you\u2019re aware we have developed sophisticated ERM program that utilize analysis and stress testing to inform our risk appetite, and understand our capital return capability across the range of potential scenarios. And it is just framework that supports the recommendation and make quarterly to the board regarding the level of our share repurchase as well as the amount of our annual dividend increases.","Long-term care obviously is part of our ERM framework, and we remain very comfortable with our exposure. There are three primary levers to manage the long-term care business. First, premium rate increases, we have taken a balanced, but active approach to steadily increased rates since early 2005. The average approved cumulative rate increase is 138% on our nursing home only indemnity business, and 63% on our comprehensive reimbursement business. This has mitigated some of the need to build reserves.","Second, investment income, here we have prudently managed our investment portfolio. Third, our reserve processes which I will go into in a bit more detail. We have a rigorous process of diligent reviewing our long-term care reserves on an annual basis. Our reserve levels reflect the policy features, and risk characteristics of a book of business, as well as ever increasing incredible claims data. So policies with richer benefits have higher reserves.","We have complete reviews with our orders, and no concerns had been raised about our reserve adequacy. Also, we periodically engage in an independent actuarial consulting firm to validate our conclusions. We have been setting our reserves using over 20 years of actuarial data. In the third quarter of each year, we had another year of experience and incorporate any deviation from our assumptions into the reserve calculation. The annual adjustments have been very small percentage changes of the total reserve.","Material changes of reserves are not consistent with our approach or the process that I just described. We have not experienced nor do we expect to experience sizeable reserve increases on this business. Let me be very clear, I can confidently say our long-term care will not impact our ability to return capital to shareholders consistently.","Turning to Slide 13, Ameriprise balance sheet quality, cash flow generation and capital return capability remain very strong. Ameriprise\u2019s capital position remains strong with $1.4 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of over 500%. In the quarter, we returned over $500 million of capital to shareholders, which was over 90% of our operating earnings. Also we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of 8% to $0.90 per diluted share, reflecting our ongoing commitment to capital return and confidence in our future cash flow capacity.","With that we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks, good morning. First question was on buyback. Walter, you mentioned that you stepped it up from the last few quarter run rate. Is this something that you think can be sustained going forward or did you view that as more of an opportunistic increase in the quarter?","Walter Berman","It can be sustained. Again, we will evaluate it each quarter looking it opportunistically and certainly we have the capacity on that basis to continue to buyback at the levels that you saw. Again, we will evaluate it each quarter.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, thanks. And then one on G&A expenses in Advice & Wealth Management, the 6% increase. How much of that was driven by IPI and, I guess, what would be your general expectation for G&A expense growth going forward?","Walter Berman","IPI is a small part of it. It\u2019s probably on the expense side because it\u2019s new and it\u2019s about $4 million. And going forward, I think as we talked about it\u2019s in the 3% and 5% range. You do know we\u2019re investing for growth, but certainly we feel that is a reasonable range that you should anticipate.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning. First off a question on the SEC\u2019s announcement recently regarding the fiduciary standards. Jim, any sort of early thought there, your reaction or the firm\u2019s reaction to what\u2019s happening now?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So first of all we\u2019re going through the really \u2013 the details of it, there\u2019s over a 1,000 pages. On the surface it looks very good. In a sense that it is a bit more principle based, it\u2019s more appropriate against what would be supportable regulation that\u2019s out there, in case that\u2019s out there that is appropriate for us to in the industry to conduct business, but still serving people in their best interest which we fully support. So we\u2019re very encouraged by it. There\u2019s always you got to read the details of it and figure out how that looks in reality. But we think it is appropriate for the SEC to take the broader role and have it consistent across all activities, so we\u2019re very favorable to that. And as you also saw there was a major court ruling there, so unless the DOL appeals it then that rule will be out.","John Nadel","Yes, understood. And then on the wrap flows, Jim, I mean, exceptional results, I guess the question, sort of using Ryan\u2019s term, can we talk about the sustainability there, what you think is really driving that increase in wrap flows? I mean, I know productivity has improved, experienced financial advisors recruiting all these things, but at the core of it, do you feel like this level of flows is really a sustainable level?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, I would say we feel very good about the productivity of the system and advisors. I think the focus is the back to work and they\u2019re not worried about the next regulatory overhang that really had converted. Remember, last year we had to converted a huge amount of their business, eliminate 12b-1s, we had to put them on the best interest standard consistent with the DOL. So there was a lot of work and lot of activity and training and now the advisors are much more focused.","Now what we\u2019re doing to work at this point is we\u2019re investing real strongly back into the core of the business, our advice value proposition, our digital capabilities, we\u2019re enhancing our ability for our advisors to really seek out and serve more clients, and clients that have more wealth, and so we feel really good about that. Client inflows are really good, our productivity of the advisor base is strong and growing. So that\u2019s really what we\u2019re continuing to be focused on.","Our transaction activity also has picked up in the quarter. So it wasn\u2019t just flows into wrap, we saw a good flow situation coming in from clients. And even with the volatility people have been very disciplined, about how they\u2019re working and engaging their clients.","John Nadel","And then if I can sneak one more in, just going back to Slide 12, I really appreciate the color on the long-term care business, I think that\u2019s clearly been topical I believe. The last bullet on the slide talks about significant protections in place to effect re-mitigate counterparty risk. I guess specific to that \u2013 in the event that your counterparty suffered significant downgrades of its credit or claims paying ability. Is there protection in place against the incremental capital that river source lays would potentially need to hold against a lower rated reinsurance recoverable?","Jim Cracchiolo","Basically the issue is, it would have to be tremendous movement and we feel with the protections that we have that we keep on talking about that the impact to us would be minimal.","John Nadel","Even under rating agency, capital models like S&P?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. Because we are dealing with again what we feel the protections are in them and what the net exposure would than be. And it\u2019s a complex process, but as we indicated we feel very comfortable for those protections and the net amount of that exposure we think will be certainly very manageable.","John Nadel","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.","Kenneth Lee","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just had one on the Asset Management side. In terms of the institutional flows, wondering if you could give us a sense of the recent trend of the unfunded institutional mandate and where they stand right now?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So we actually, again, you can\u2019t necessarily with certainty always say exactly when, but we do have a nice number of wins that are waiting to be funded. We do believe that some of the investors held off in the first quarter and some of the disciplines that we had that were approved, and so we feel the institutional business should become much more positive than what we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter, would have bounced back in some of those wins and fundings.","We do have a good number of products that have been approved on the consultant side, and more that are in the hopper and we\u2019re having good discussions with our clients including on some of the multi-asset solutions that we have. So we\u2019re hoping that will continue to trend in a more positive direction as we move through the year.","Kenneth Lee","Got you. And just one more follow-up. Any way that you could break out by asset class just that the total outflow; whether there was any particular concentration in specific asset classes? Thank you.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. We\u2019d love to see if we can do that for you.","Kenneth Lee","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair.","Adam Klauber","Thanks, good morning. Your revenue growth \u2013 the change in revenue growth is pretty impressive. In 2016 it was roughly negative 2%. 2017 moved up to 4%. This quarter jumped up to 8% to 9%. A revenue growth level in the high-single digit; is that sustainable or is this quarter just better than we should expect going forward?","Walter Berman","No, again, if you look at the business drivers that they are certainly with the markets and with our growth, I can\u2019t say there\u2019s going to be at the same levels, but certainly with also the changing interest profile certainly it will be higher than we\u2019ve experienced and the ones you\u2019ve talked about and we\u2019re quite comfortable with that. We always have been the situation from that standpoint with the insurance which grows and annuities which grow at a slow pace, but the Asset Management and Advice & Wealth Management businesses are in good trajectories. So I can\u2019t give you, it\u2019s going to be at that 9% level, but certainly it\u2019s going to be higher than we are seeing.","Adam Klauber","Okay. And in the last year, so you\u2019ve done like two more bolt-on acquisitions last deals. How\u2019s the pipeline? And could we see one or two more deals in the next 12 to 18 months?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, I think listen \u2013 I think the activity in the industry has picked up a bit and we very much have the capability and the ability to continue to bolt-on. We are seeing a nice fit with Lionstone that we acquired. And we think there are some additional capabilities that we would like to add on to our asset management capabilities.","Adam Klauber","Okay, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O\u2019Neill","John Barnidge","Thank you. Just a housekeeping question. In Asset Management, when we have flows on an ex-former parent company basis been this bad?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, you meaning other than the ex-parent?","John Barnidge","Yes.","Jim Cracchiolo","Right. So I would say there are probably if we go back \u2013 it really depends on the cycle and unfortunately in the first quarter we were sort of hit with fundings being held, and at the same time people relocate out of some of the disciplines like high-yield and other things like that because of the market pullback and change in the fixed income area. Equity is the same way with the volatility that picked up. So Europe moved into nice inflows last year and again the first quarter it was a little bit of holding, and so you got the redemptions coming without necessarily the sales.","But the sales right now are starting to pick it back up again, and the redemptions are calming again. So we did face a level of volatility in the first quarter and we also in the first quarter always have people that review their portfolios and make some reallocations which we didn\u2019t have. So we think that will bounce back. We didn\u2019t expect it to be that high. Having said that, I do believe we are making good focus and good progress in certain areas, but it\u2019s not something we\u2019re happy about, but we are diligently trying to work to improve that situation.","John Barnidge","And then related to the Protection segment, the pricing environment for Auto & Home has improved, underwriting margins in Protection are trending in the right direction. Your ex-cat combined ratio has averaged a couple points below 100 for the last seven quarters. How much further improvement do you think is needed before the company would consider exploring strategic alternatives for that business? Because there\u2019s obvious a clear push towards more asset management like businesses of the company.","Jim Cracchiolo","So, again, I think we are well on our way to showing good progress in the business. I think the unfortunate point over the last number of quarters have been the level of cat activity and we\u2019ve actually done some good work to minimize that, we\u2019ve actually adjusted some of our affinity relationships so that we can reduce the extra exposure there. We like that to continue to work through the book because at the end of the day we\u2019ve built this book over a long period of time, it is one of the best we think affinity, direct play is out there, and we really would like it get it back in a good situation for our partners. And once that can sustain and start to excite the growth there and then we\u2019ll continue it, we will evaluate it, I\u2019m very clear on that. Having said that, I think we just want to continue to make some good progress there that shows true through the earnings.","John Barnidge","Thank you for the answers.","Operator","Our following question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research.","Erik Bass","Hi, thank you. Can you provide some additional detail on what drove the increase in your RBC ratio this quarter? I guess, what were the discretionary reserves you released related to and what\u2019s changed in your thinking about the need for them?","Walter Berman","Well, actually since last year I think we discussed that we had discretionary reserves as we looked at both the tax situation and others. And those reserves clearly were discretionary and they have been reversed, and obviously we also declared a dividend. So we feel comfortable at the current NAIC levels that the RBC ratios are in the level that we think are appropriate.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then on the last call you alluded to potential interest in getting back into the banking business, can you just provide any update there on your thinking and discuss what you see I guess is the potential incremental benefits to your interest margin from owning a bank? And also I guess would having a bank change your capital requirements or have any material impact on excess capital?","Walter Berman","Okay. Yes, we certainly continue with our interest. And as we evaluate that and we feel that is will be beneficial situation to expanding the scope of our product capabilities and will have a reasonable amount of margin as it does with certainly some of our peers. And as it relates to the capital we feel based on initial evaluation, it should have a minimal impact on the consolidated excess capital position other than the capital that goes into the institution.","Erik Bass","Got it. So it would be both an expansion of kind of product capabilities as well as an increase in the interest margin as you would be able to keep more of the economics, I guess, particularly as rates if they continue to move higher?","Walter Berman","Absolutely.","Erik Bass","Thank you.","Operator","Our following question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning. Wanted to start with long-term care; just given your confidence in the level of reserves and frankly the lack of reserve bills on an absolute basis and relative to peers. Is there any hope that maybe at some point you could sell this business for exit it? Are there any sort of structural limitations in terms of your ability to do it or is it just boils down to price?","Walter Berman","I think there is no structural limitations for us to do that, obviously interest rates play an important part of it, but also, yes. So the answer, if an opportunity came up, we would certainly explore it and maintain the economic sense. We understand the book, and like I said, this book is something that we feel like a lot of our products is been managed in a very effective way so that\u2019s why we feel as confident. So yes if the opportunity came up for the right situation, and interest rates certainly would help going up, we would certainly listen.","Suneet Kamath","And we\u2019ve been reading a little bit about interest from third parties in these types of blogs. Is there anything \u2013 is it sort of cricket out there in terms of conversations or are you actually getting some feedback in terms of interest without naming specific?","Walter Berman","I think we\u2019ve seen more interest lately, and certainly in that blog \u2013 so, yes, I can say we\u2019ve seen more interest.","Jim Cracchiolo","Suneet, one of the things I would say is as there\u2019s a lot of activity out there for books that may not have been of the quality of ours, so I think what has to occur a little more is people understanding really to differentiation and I think you\u2019ll find whether it\u2019s in our protection or in our annuities books. These are asset accumulation, good, strong clientele built over the decades, very good returns, very low risk, very good hedging, very good in the way we reserve et cetera. So I actually believe this is a very quality \u2013 high quality portfolio and as people start to evaluate that, there will be differentiation.","Suneet Kamath","And I know, Walter, you mentioned interest rates need to be higher. Is there a rough sense of how much higher they need to go before such a transaction makes sense?","Walter Berman","It\u2019s an interesting question. Certainly if you look at \u2013 if you get into the 5% to 6% range or 4.5% to 5.5% you certainly get to a point where you can make an intelligent valuation around.","Suneet Kamath","And that\u2019s on the 10-year or is that something longer?","Walter Berman","That\u2019s in the 10 year.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just one last one for Jim, in the past you\u2019ve given us sort of periodic updates on the margin in employee channel versus the franchisee channel within AWM. Can you give us a sense of where those two channels are today?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So we continue to create a margin and build it in the employee channel. It\u2019s up in the mid-to-upper teens, I think roughly around this point, and it\u2019s tracking very good, it\u2019s also off a larger base, meaning that the size has grown. So we feel very good about that and the continued progress that it makes, and we\u2019ll continue to build utilization in that system with the recruits that we\u2019ve brought on board. So it\u2019s tracking very well.","Walter Berman","Suneet, this is Walter. That just make sure \u2013 I\u2019m talking about not 10-year treasure, and I\u2019m talking about 10-year corporates, okay?","Suneet Kamath - Citi","10-year corporates. Okay that\u2019s helpful thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Hey, Jim, Walter, good morning. Question for you guys will follow-up around the bank strategy. I guess, may be just a little more color on a, what kind of ROE threshold you guys would need to see in the business when you\u2019re considering to kind of pull the trigger or not? And I guess would you guys have to acquire or is that something you guys can just build internally and start a new bank charter?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So, as you recollect, we had a bank charter before. We still have a trust \u2013 a bank trust charter. And so it\u2019s really building out our capabilities, getting the approval and our licenses in place et cetera, so there\u2019s level of working activity that you have to do appropriately in that regard. But it would really be around Wealth Management product. We\u2019re not looking to do commercial lending like some other institutions have et cetera, et cetera. We really want this to be more around supporting our clients\u2019 activities and their individual asset loans, et cetera, et cetera.","So we have the capability in the past to have done that. We have the knowledge and so we need to put that back in place and go through the appropriate approval and set up the various systems and capabilities for it.","Walter Berman","Yes, as it relate to the returns, certainly the book we have to build, but again it\u2019s internally and with the product we\u2019re building, but certainly we get into \u2013 expect to get into the teens.","Alex Blostein","Yes, any sort of timeline we should be thinking about as you guys are considering this?","Jim Cracchiolo","Probably as we look out to next year.","Walter Berman","Yes.","Alex Blostein","Got you. And then my second question is just around the brokerage trends and the cash. So looks like the implied betas, deposit betas on the business remain quite low, something I think in the 30-ish percent. I guess, as you progress through the rate cycle, and again, this is not just you guys are seen across the industry, but as you progress through the rate cycle, what you guys see these deposit betas go in. Again, feels like they held up much better than expected and then ultimately, I guess, where they peek out?","Walter Berman","Again, it\u2019s depending on the competitive situation as we go, you\u2019re right. Certainly the level before the increases that have taken place have been at a higher level because it\u2019s competitive and certainly it\u2019s been evaluated. And actually a lot of that \u2013 even though one in December has not worked its way totally through the quarter. So the issue is we see it, at some point it will stop being shared, but again it\u2019s a highly competitive situation than we\u2019ve seen in the last two, that majority of it has been retained.","So it\u2019s tough to really estimate, but it\u2019s certainly at some point when you get to much higher levels, I assume it will stop being distributed in a more \u2013 basically more to higher percentage clients than it is today.","Alex Blostein","Got you. But where you standing today, you\u2019re not seeing material changes versus what we\u2019ve seen over the last kind of three to four months?","Walter Berman","And we stand just quite thoroughly. We are certainly marched up with our competitors and certainly look at it and we feel it\u2019s a fair rate that we\u2019re offering.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore.","Tom Gallagher","Thanks. Few questions on the long-term care, Walter. In terms of the reinsurance that you have in place, do you have protections over and above the assets that are currently in the reinsurance trust? I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is, if there was a shortfall of assets in the trust and your reinsurance partner suffered further financial difficulty, do you have extra protections to fill that asset need?","Walter Berman","Okay. The issue is \u2013 let me discuss straight to it. Our protections have geared to what they estimate reserves that are necessary for it, and we certainly work with them and understand it because we have been bonded with it, and they certainly we feel \u2013 we follow a protocol, they follow a protocol that those reserves are adequate.","I\u2019m not going to speculate, if it\u2019s not but the \u2013 it is something we\u2019re constantly monitoring and basically reviewing and certainly reviewing the strength of glick and the firms that supported. So I feel comfortable at this stage, it\u2019s certainly we are well protected.","Tom Gallagher","Got it. And I guess another issue that I\u2019ve heard out there that\u2019s a concern related to that. ","I just wanted to see if you could shed a little light on it is that I think your counterparty is viewed as using more aggressive reserving assumptions than everyone else in the market. And from the disclosure we\u2019ve been able to see, it looks like you guys are holding about the same amount of reserves for that business that\u2019s been reinsured to that company at around $2 billion. Am I right on that or is there a difference between the reserves you\u2019re carrying for that book versus what your reinsurance partner is, if you\u2019re able to comment on that?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, I can comment on ours, we do our own calculations on our reserves and certainly feel comfortable, but we\u2019re also aware what they are doing and currently, in discussions we are not concerned.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. And then my final question on this topic is, your 10-K indicated that your analysis of long-term care reflects to one or two additional rate increase rounds over a four-year period. I just want to be clear, I understand that. Is that what\u2019s embedded in your GAAP and statutory reserves? Or one or two additional rounds of rate increases over four years? Or is that something different? I just want to be clear?","Jim Cracchiolo","It is based on evaluation and that is what we felt is appropriate and based on what we feel that we would be able to garner.","Tom Gallagher","And Walter, that\u2019s for both GAAP and stat?","Walter Berman","No, that was for the GAAP.","Tom Gallagher","That\u2019s just GAAP, okay. All right, thank you.","Walter Berman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust.","Doug Mewhirter","Hi, good morning. First question on the method, I know you\u2019ve been working on the Threadneedle side, but also maybe also in your North American business have you sort of zeroed in on what kind of expense impact that might have for the balance of the year?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, okay, on the research fees, the unmet related to met are as we engaged is around $2.5 million that we had in the quarter so you can go out there we\u2019re constantly looking in valuating, but that is something that we experienced that basically we had in the first quarter.","We are doing some development, but again that\u2019s in our development plan as it related to meeting certain other requirements as we go forward. But that should be, I would say $1 million or $2 million in that range as it relates to MiFID.","Doug Mewhirter","Okay, thanks for that and my second and final question. With the long - and middle of the long-end of the interest rate curve finally inching up a little bit. Have you seen increased interest in your annuity products, I know it looks like you had an increase in sales, I didn't know if that was just a better marketing effort or if there is or if it was more of the - more comfort with the regulatory environment or if there is some sort of \u2013 they are more attractive because of higher interest rates and do you think there\u2019s a level where you would actually hit an inflection point where you could actually turn the negative variable annuity flows into positive flows?","Jim Cracchiolo","So we have seen in the last two quarters a pickup in annuity sales and again I would probably say it\u2019s a combination of factors I can\u2019t point to one, it could be you know where people are more comfortable now that they understand what is appropriate from a regulatory, best interest, et cetera, as we said we haven\u2019t really changed we\u2019ve always had a very comprehensive compliance practices, nothing in that regard has changed, I think it\u2019s more of a comfort of where the annuity fits back in, in that regard. I think there was a bit more of a focus or a little bit of a hesitation there.","Having said that I also believe that the advisors are back to looking at where the annuity fits as part of a holistic solution. And in that I think is how we think about that, we have always had annuity sales in the $4 billion to $5 billion range unlike a number of competitors that really turn on the faucet and then turn it off when something happens there, we have been very consistent, we have a good core product capability and benefits that our advisors understand.","We compliment that where other products from other providers on our shelf as well, so we\u2019re not necessarily looking for sales of the annuity to rise tremendously, there is a level of redemption in our book or pay downs because of the client portfolios and drawdown, but that\u2019s appropriate for us . We look at this more holistically and as you can see, clients - we have good client flows, we have good flows going into a combination of products, which include the wrap, includes annuity, protection, et cetera, and that\u2019s really what we look at.","We don\u2019t necessarily look that the annuity business has to grow by leaps and bounds, I think part of the sales coming off also has to do with the fixed side, where the interest rates aren\u2019t there at this point for us to get the spread that we\u2019re looking for, but that could change longer term as well. So we are feeling very comfortable about that book and the sales that we do get and it does sort of go up and down within a good range, so it\u2019s a good client persistent portfolio, and that\u2019s really what we look for.","Doug Mewhirter","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning, thank you for taking my question. On Asset Management in terms of the fee rates that you charge on the asset that is coming in versus the assets that are going out, can you update us in terms of the differential between the fee rates?","Walter Berman","The fee rate is higher for the - certainly for the activity coming in versus going out I\u2019m trying to remember, it\u2019s around 4 basis point or 5 basis points I think I will get back to you on that, that\u2019s what I think it is it\u2019s certainly been higher.","Humphrey Lee","Yes, I think in the last quarter you said it\u2019s kind of roughly 15% higher between I mean for the inflows versus the outflow, I\u2019m just trying to see if there\u2019s still some what kind of in that ballpark.","Walter Berman","That sounds a little hard to me, but let me check.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, I think it was that way in the fourth quarter but again, it varies based upon what the fundings are in the redemptions, so it\u2019s not like a perfect science.","Humphrey Lee","Okay, understood. And then you talked about some of the expected funding in the coming quarters given the wins that you have, but in terms of the redemptions do you anticipate any more kind of liquidity related redemptions or kind of re-bouncing kind of in the coming quarters?","Walter Berman","Again, you can\u2019t speak to what was going to happen in market conditions et cetera, but we did see a bit more of that sort of rebalancing and reallocation than we\u2019ve seen in other quarters and I think you can see that with interest rates backing up with the markets particularly in February with how the volatility spike. So I would probably say we don\u2019t expect it to be at that level going forward. We see that sort of have calmed down tremendously as we got through March and in to April.","Humphrey Lee","Okay I think the single client have the redemption for liquidity reason. They took money out last quarter \u2013 last first quarter and then some in the second quarter, would you anticipate something similar in terms of pattern?","Jim Cracchiolo","You know that\u2019s hard to \u2013 the client was very clear that it had nothing to do with the performance of the product et cetera, so I think those are the decisions that they have to make and we\u2019re informed like others. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re an isolated case on that hyper liquidity from the type of clients, so I think that\u2019s more of what others have experienced as well.","Walter Berman","So it\u2019s Walter let me just, the fee-in versus and fee- out is about 6% higher.","Jim Cracchiolo","Okay Thank you.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating you may now disconnect."],"2124":["Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

My name is Ellen, and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia A. Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's first quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks we'll be happy to take your questions.","During the call you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials available on our website. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. ","These forward-looking statements speak only as of today and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2014 annual report to shareholders and our 2014 10-K report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'll begin by providing my perspective on the quarter and the progress we are making. Walter will follow me with a detailed review of the numbers. ","Overall Ameriprise had another good quarter and was situated well. However higher equity market volatility, unfavorable foreign exchange and continued low interest rate did effect results as did the long-term care reserves increase. That said, our capital position, ability to generate good free cash flow and deploy capital, all remained excellent. For the quarter our operating earnings per share were up 7%. From a return on equity perspective we continued to deliver. ","With a combination of solid business results and significant capital return operating return on equity reached another high. Excluding AOCI we ended the quarter with operating return on equity of 23.1% and that\u2019s up 230 basis points in the past year.","Assets under management and administration grew 4% to $815 billion from client net inflows and market appreciation and that includes the negative impact of more than $17 billion from foreign exchange. We remain committed to an effective capital management and maintaining our financial strength as we continue to invest in the business while delivering differentiated shareholder return.","In the first quarter we returned $459 million in share repurchase and dividends. And yesterday we announced a 16% increase to our regular quarterly dividend and we consistently increased our dividend by double digits over the years. As we stated we expect to continue to return strongly to [ph] shareholders and have targeted a 90% to 100% range of earnings annually. ","In Advice & Wealth Management we are positioned well and are building on our strengths. We continue to generate good growth. Operating earnings were $210 million, up 16%. In the first quarter we did experience a little more market volatility. Overall we are serving more clients and bringing in more client assets with 8% growth in retail assets, and an increase of 30% in fee-based advisory asset under management. And for the quarter advisory net inflows were $2.8 billion. Advisor productivity also grew again by double digits, 11% year-over-year to a record $505,000 per advisor on a trailing 12 month basis.","In terms of advisor recruiting we continue to attract strong candidates and they are increasingly higher producers. During the quarter another 77 experienced advisors joined Ameriprise. These advisors relate well to our strong branded advice value proposition and leadership. As we discussed with you we are working to help advisors grow their practices. As you know we share both less affluent and affluent clients. As we move forward we are making a larger commitment to serve more affluent clients who want and need advice. We are confident in our ability to serve them we believe based on the value that we provide that this will become an even larger percentage of our client base. ","We also want to provide comprehensive advice to more Americans. We know from our research that our confident retirement approach and advice value proposition resonate even more strongly with affluent consumers. Our brand and reputation appeal to these consumers so this is a long term effort to drive growth. ","In addition to the affluent market we are also looking to serve more consumers who are still cumulating well in earnest close to retirement. In terms of investments for growth advisors are benefiting from our online and paperless office capabilities that are both integrated and time saving. They are using our digital and social media to create brand awareness for their practices, generate leads as well as deepen relationships with current clients.","Overall we are growing nicely in AWM. Both client and advisor satisfaction remained strong and we are focused on helping advisors expand their client base and grow productivity. As we move to insurance and annuities we are focused on driving advisor uptake of our solutions, while we maintain the differentiated strength of our risk profile. These are high quality businesses that deliver important benefits to our clients at Ameriprise, especially as we expand our Confident Retirement approach serve more consumers.","Year-over-year operating earnings were down but they were items from the current and previous quarter that Walter will discuss. In terms of the annuity business, variable annuity account balances were up slightly on market growth and $1.2 billion in new sales, down slightly from a year ago and consistent with the industry. That said we have seen a pickup in sales of VAs without living benefits, reflecting good wholesaling activity and a positive reaction to educating clients and advisors about the advantages these products can provide. Sales of VAs without living benefits represent about a third of total VA sales in the quarter up from 25% a year ago. There is really no change in fixed annuities given the current rate environment. ","In protection we continue to work with our advisors on the benefits of insurance for our clients. Life and health care sales were down a bit year-over-year which we believe is also consistent with the industry. Our overall client retention in these solutions continue to be very good which helps enhance the long term nature of the Ameriprise client and advisory relationship. In auto and home, we built a strong business with our affinity relationships and are pleased to have renewed the Costco contract. They are an important client and we will continue to offer their customers excellent value. ","We are focused on improving overall auto and home returns through changes in pricing underwriting and claims management to get back to historical performance levels. We are taking the right steps to strengthen the business and believe we can properly grow and serve more clients as we move forward. ","With asset management we are executing our strategy as we go to market more globally. Our assets under management for this business are just over $0.5 trillion, reflecting significant headwind of more than $17 billion of foreign exchange that I mentioned earlier. Financially we generated good operating earnings of a $191 million in the quarter and have compelled [ph] adjusted net pretax operating margins of nearly 40%.","In terms of where we are putting our time and attention, we are investing and aligning resources to leverage the strength of both Columbia and Threadneedle. As you saw we introduced our new global brand, Columbia Threadneedle Investments a few weeks ago. The new brand represents the combined resources, capabilities and reach of both firms. Moving to a global brand was a natural next step of the business as our teams have been working together for more than two years for the benefit of our clients. ","In third party institutional, we have further aligned the resources to run it globally. Our current pipeline is quite strong as we continue to build on the traction we gained in 2014. We are looking for our institutional business to be a growing and larger part of our overall asset management business as we move forward. Though we had outflows in the quarter they were mainly driven by funding delays caused by market volatility. We are expecting a number of large mandates to fund over the next few quarters. Part of our future growth will come from the solutions space. We continue investing in talent, product and capabilities and in building our large base of assets under management and we see this as a good opportunity. ","During the quarter we began to gain traction in our fairly new Columbia adaptive risk allocation fund. In regards to retail we made a number of changes in U.S. intermediary distribution. We are beginning to see positive signs from our segmentation strategy and enhanced business intelligence efforts to improve wholesaler productivity. And we are better aligning product, marketing and sales support functions to gain share. We have seen some improvement. However it\u2019s been obscured by the elevated outflows in the Acorn Fund. Our investment team is taking steps to address the fund\u2019s performance but we expect continued outflow pressure here. ","In the UK and Europe retail flows are beginning to improve with the outlook of Europe becoming more favorable with their larger program of quantitative easing. And in Asia we are generating good performance in funds we launched last year. And now that we are nearing our one year anniversary we are starting to garner some interest. ","Our investment teams in the U.S. and internationally are generating strong equity and fixed income investment performance across a broad range of products, both domestically and internationally. So in asset management we are continuing our efforts to drive flows and align resource to lever the strength of Columbia and Threadneedle. ","Overall with regard to Ameriprise we are generating good performance in our asset light businesses and very strong cash flow. This gives us the ability to continue to invest in our business as well as return to shareholders through continuation of our buyback program as well as increases in our dividend. And with our strong capital base we also have the ability to continue to look for small acquisitions that can add to our strategy and complement the company.","Before I close I want to take a minute to comment on the DOL\u2019s fiduciary rule proposal. Like many of the firms across the financial services industry serving the retirement market, we are carefully reviewing the proposal\u2019s hundreds of pages to understand its objectives and potential implications. There are a number of steps that need to take place before any changes will be made, including the 75 day common period and subsequent review by the administration. ","We won\u2019t advocate [ph] for the importance of access to financial advice for all Americans and providing clients\u2019 choice and products and services they use to reach their goals. Our high client satisfaction and long-term relationships stem from this comprehensive personal approach. In fact Ameriprise already operates as a fiduciary under the SEC standard for advice when we are acting in an investment advisory capacity. We have established policies and procedures to support our clients and advisors, including extensive and appropriate disclosures which puts us in a good position. We are at the starting point of the rule making process and any final rule would impact many firms serving more than 100 million American saving for retirement. Therefore we must take into account both the intended and the unintended consequences, the details do matter.","We want to make sure that the creation of a new third standard would not be overly burdensome for clients and would work with the existing SEC and FINRA standards. We have dealt with regulatory changes before and we will work with our trade associations and other stakeholders throughout this process to advocate for our clients with the goal of most appropriately satisfying the DOL\u2019s objectives.","In closing, as we execute our strategy for growth I believe we can continue to navigate the markets, deliver a terrific experience for our clients and advisors while generating good return for our shareholders. With that I would like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. As Jim indicated Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter financial results in the face of a fairly volatile market environment. Let me provide some additional context. Equity market volatility was elevated at the start of the year. Interest rates also moved a lot during the quarter, with the 10 year treasury rate starting the year at 2.17%, falling to 1.64% at the end of January and settling at 1.92% at the end of the quarter, and the strength of the dollar did impact AUM and earnings at Threadneedle.","These environmental factors impacted revenue and earnings directly, as well as influence activity levels with retail and institutional clients. With that as context let\u2019s look at the results in the quarter. ","Operating net revenue was $2.9 billion, up 3% from last year. Operating EPS was $2.18 and included a few one-time items. We increased reserves on a long-term care block by $0.11 per share. Additionally there were a variety of smaller items netting to a negative $0.02 per share that we detailed in the earnings release.","Excluding these one-time items operating EPS was $2.31, up 13% from last year. And operating return on equity reached a new record level of 23.1%, which is above our target range of 19% to 23%.","Turning to slide four, you will see that our business mix shift continues to evolve. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management represents 64% of pretax operating earnings this quarter and as we grow we expect the mix shift will continue and should reach 70%. We continue to expand margins in Advice & Wealth Management reaching 17.1% this quarter.","Margins in the employee channel were over 10% in the quarter and were over 18% in franchise channel. This demonstrates the strength of our model, the success of our strategies to grow this business and the opportunity we have to drive profitability even higher. Asset management margins were a solid 39.7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis, reflecting continued good expense discipline.","Let\u2019s turn to the segments on slide five, Advice & Wealth Management business is performing quite well across key growth and activity metrics and delivered solid financial results, particularly given the market conditions. Revenue is up 7% to $1.2 billion with good client flows and market appreciation, partially offset by slower sales in a couple of product areas and the impact from volatile markets.","We kept G&A expenses flat year-over-year. This resulted in earnings of $210 million, up 16% and a record margin of 17.1%, up 130 basis points from last year. It should be noted in a sequential basis results were impacted by having too fewer fee days this quarter than the fourth quarter, which equates to approximately $6 million of PTI. Overall the business continues to deliver consistent, good results demonstrating the strength of our business model. ","Turning to asset management on slide six, operating net revenue was flat at $807 million as the benefit of market appreciation was offset by the impact of higher fee outflows from the Acorn fund Threadneedle\u2019s U.S. equity [indiscernible] as well as $15 million unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Expenses were down 1% to $660 million, reflecting lower distribution expense and continued good G&A expense control, even with the additional relocation expense associated with the move to our new office space in London. This resulted in pretax operating earnings in the quarter of $191 million, up 4% from last year. Excluding the foreign exchange impact and the office relocation expense pretax operating earnings would have been up 8%. It should be noted that on sequential basis results were impacted by having two fewer fee days this quarter than the fourth quarter, which equates to approximately $8 million of PTI in the segment. ","Turning to flows on next slide, we had net outflows of $5.8 billion in the quarter. Retail net outflows were $3 billion, with outflows concentrated in a number of areas we have previously discussed, namely $2.3 billion in the Acorn fund and approximately $600 million from the former parent affiliated distribution and a sub advisor. Excluding these items, we are seeing some positive trends sequentially. ","Retail flows in the UK and Europe improved following a slow fourth quarter and we also had a large flow into our Asian Pacific fund. We are increasing awareness and beginning to see traction with our new Colombia Adaptive Risk Allocation Fund and we are optimistic that momentum will continue and we continue to make progress to improve retail distribution in the United States.","The institutional business had $2.8 billion of net outflows in the quarter. Let me provide some additional detail on the two reasons we saw a higher level of institutional outflows than in recent periods. First, we had approximately $1.8 billion of outflows from low basis point insurance mandates in the UK. This includes a normal level of [indiscernible] outflows at $800 million. Additionally it includes $950 million of outflows from [indiscernible] associated with asset reallocation to funds we do not offer. However we expect to cover some of those assets later in the year into a higher fee product, so net impact of these flows should be neutral on a revenue basis for the year. ","Second; we had outflows in third party, mainly driven by a slowdown in the funding of new mandates. We expected several large mandates to fund in the quarter that will push back to the second quarter. Additionally we have redemptions in both high yield and short duration at the beginning of the year that we would expect to get back in the later part of the year.","Turning to annuities on slide eight; Annuities pretax operating earnings were $172 million, down 2% from last year. However the prior year results include a significant benefit from clients moving to our managed volatility funds and the mean reversion benefit was similar in both periods. Without these items underlying annuities earnings were up 15%. Variable annuity pretax earnings grew 22% from a year ago to a $132 million, without the benefit of clients moving to managed volatility funds and mean reversions in both periods, these were driven by higher account values. ","Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings decreased 10% to $28 million as account values declined. Lapse rates on LIBOR [ph] expectations following the re-pricing of our five year guarantee block that are now coming out of surrender charge period. Given the current interest environment there are limited new sales and as a result this book is expected to gradually and earnings will decline. ","Let\u2019s turn to the protection segment on slide nine. Protection pretax operating earnings were $51 million in the quarter, impacted by $32 million claim reserves strengthening for long term care. As we announced last quarter we conducted a long term care review of our claims reserve based on additional information received from Genworth, the firm that reinsures half of our long term care book and administers all of our claims. As you know this is a small closed block with no new sales since 2003. We have not seen adverse claims experience in the book and have been making appropriate premium increases since 2004. At the end of the quarter we had $2.2 billion of statutory reserves, net of reinsurance with about $400 million in claims reserve and the remainder in the active life reserves.","Based on the information provided by Genworth management\u2019s best estimate of a claim reserve resulted in a $32 million reserve increase. The most significant drivers were updates to the benefit utilization rates and claims termination rates, partially offset by a benefit from higher discount rate. After reviewing the analysis we received from Genworth we decided to engage a third party to validate their analysis. This review may result in a fine-tuning of our reserve and we anticipate that it will be completed in the second quarter.","Excluding the long-term care serve increase, the life and health businesses performed in-line with expectations. We saw marginally higher claims than we have in recent quarters though still within expected ranges. The auto and home business had a modest operating loss of $4 million in the quarter. We are booking reserves for the 2015 accident year at a level consistent with the 2014 accident year loss ratio assumption we changed in the last quarter.","The business was also impacted by $12 million of cat losses, of which $4 million was related to the prior year. As we discussed last quarter we are phasing in changes to our pricing to risk models, in addition to modifications to underwriting claims and operations. We are seeing early signs of improvement, specifically at targeted slowdown in sales across all product lines. For the full year we expect marginal profitability for auto and home with a more meaningful improvement to earnings in 2016.","Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on slide 11, our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $2.5 billion of excess capital and our risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 630%. We continue to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders with $459 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. We remain committed to continuing to raise our dividend and announced a 16% increase yesterday. This brings our dividend payout ratio to the high 20% range. ","With that we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik James Bass","Hi thank you. I guess we could start on department of labor issue, are there any specific buckets of revenues that you would be focused on as sort of more potentially at risk as a result of changes and I guess do you expect there could be any impact on sales of either alternative products or things like mutual funds or other products that you manufacture through the advice and wealth management channel?","James M. Cracchiolo","The department of labor as you know, there is hundreds and hundreds of pages and there are level of areas [ph], exemptions et cetera. So we as the industry are shifting through that to fully understand what they are looking to accomplish and with that how you can continue to work with your clients against their needs that they have. Explicitly within, from what we have been able to reach so far there are certain things excluded, like things like REITs et cetera that they wouldn\u2019t sold and qualified accounts. In our business REIT as an example makes up a very small percentage of what we do and we have the ability, as an example since we work more holistically with the client, if that\u2019s still a need we could probably deal with it by offering it in the non-qualified section of their investment asset. ","So there are certain things like that that they are saying at the outset are precluded. Many other products like mutual funds et cetera, there are exemptions for as long as you have appropriate disclosures et cetera as we are currently reading it, but it\u2019s still too early to really tell, and I think, us and many other companies across all the industries in financial services who deal with retirement will be in some way affected by it and what we want and I think many of the companies in the industry and the associations want is that we are able to continue to work with clients as their needs are requiring and appropriately do so.","Erik James Bass","Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful and one follow-up question on long term care. I was just wondering why you chose to only look at assumptions and reserves for the disabled life reserve. I guess wouldn\u2019t changing assumptions on the disabled life reserve also affect the active life reserve which I think we have seen with other companies such as Genworth where there has been an impact of the changes in assumptions on both.","Walter S. Berman","Okay, well, number one the information on the claims reserve is supplied by -- based on information supplied by Genworth. If you look at the active, there are many assumptions that go into it and including claims that we have been managing and evaluating over time [indiscernible] and we also factor in terminations, factor in price increases over longer term. So we feel that reserve is actually adequately looked at it and looked in the light of the situation information we have gotten from Genworth. So we felt the only adjustment that was needed was in the claims reserve.","Erik James Bass","Got it, so you did sort of factor in -- you made no changes to the active life reserve but you did sort of contemplate the new data relative to the assumptions that you are making and is that\u2026?","James M. Cracchiolo","That\u2019s correct, we have been factoring in the actual claims and looking over the full life of it, we have been doing that, so there was no -- including the upper elements like you said termination and price increase and other things that go into it, and we felt that reserve is adequate.","Erik James Bass","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Nigel Dally with Morgan Stanley ","Nigel Dally ","Great thanks, good morning. Just to follow on the DOL and the fiduciary standards, I guess in addition to the pay pressure and [indiscernible] proprietary product sales, some of it is concerned about higher compliance costs, just hope you can discuss whether that\u2019s also a factor.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, again as we said first of all, I think relative in the industry we are probably one of the best prepared to deal with fiduciary because we are very actives fiduciary in much of our client activities today under the SEC standard. I think what I have mentioned in my opening remarks was that this establishes a third standard, and so with a third standard, of course, you are going to have additional compliance and figuring out how the third standard works perfectly with the first two standards and we are hoping that the regulators and the people who are over sighting this appropriately would take that into account and figure out how the regulations wouldn\u2019t be overly complex to deal with, and that would be appropriate and operate with each other in an appropriate fashion. ","So having said that I think that\u2019s yet to be determined and I think that\u2019s part of the work that needs to be done. But having said that as with any regulatory change of this extent there is going to be increased level of compliance and increased costs to get those things implemented and executed. So I would definitely say that there will be increased compliance costs. On the other side I would say at least today Ameriprise already operates with much of the compliance and supervision. We have the compliance resources already in place, but it will still increase the levels and so what you are doing now is a bit different and applies in a more special fashion to this particular activity.","Nigel Dally ","Okay, thanks, that\u2019s helpful. Second question, just on advisory, you talked about the few days impacting results and guessing that\u2019s purely an impact on revenues doesn\u2019t impact margins, is that correct? Also it is possible that whether it will impact client activity and if so we should expect some catch up of that business in the second quarter?","Walter S. Berman","You are right, it doesn\u2019t impact margin, but doesn\u2019t impact PTI and again we do believe there was too few days were aligned with the activity we have seen in the industry and we do believe that we are on track and we should recover as again markets and things of that nature.","James M. Cracchiolo","So there was, to Walter\u2019s point of two fewer, three days that did impact the PTI that he gave you the numbers on. What I would say is a level of volatility, also a level of weather. It\u2019s hard to break that out and clarify it but as you would imagine January was also a very difficult weather month for many parts of the country. That would have impacted advisors as well as how they served the clients. So we don\u2019t necessarily put that in, we just saw that activity did slow a bit in the first quarter, not so much. We saw it come back stronger in February and March but January was the slowest of the months.","Nigel Dally ","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Yaron Kinar with Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question. I have few questions first. Going back to the Department of Labor proposal, I think there have been -- there\u2019s been speculation that it would also create maybe an increase in potential losses down the road and wanted to hear your thoughts on that and maybe how you can preempt some of that, realizing that these are still early days?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, again it\u2019s hard to say exactly what it would derive in the end. As I said it\u2019s very important to know both the intended and the unintended consequences of anything of this substantial. And let\u2019s remember there is a $100 million Americans being served here by all types of companies, well they be distributors or manufacturers, all types and remember it covers every one of these. So if you are selling any product into a qualified account and yes, so it\u2019s not just relevant for someone who has a financial advisor, it could be direct players, it could be product companies et cetera and so I think one of the things that we, the industry and many of other participants in the associations are looking at is what are those activities and does it qualify [ph].","So yes you can have additional disclosure, the question is it\u2019s unclear if you have that disclosure if you work and operate within the exemption rules, what that may result in and of course those are things that are undetermined at that this point in time. But again it\u2019s like that with any regulatory change, we work through it, we figure out what those things are appropriate and we ensure that we supervise against it. But we have to get clear on what that exactly is. ","Yaron Kinar","All right, then turning back to our long term care, so I think you mentioned on the call that, in the script that against the assumption changes you also had an offset from an increase in the discount rate used and of course I guess it\u2019s a little counter intuitive, just given the rate environment today. So I was wondering if you can give us little more color on what led to that.","But second can you give us any sense of what was the proportion of the change, was there any way to quantify that? ","James M. Cracchiolo","What we do is when we are reviewing is, we realized that we were using a rate, discount rate was lower than our asset earning rate, that\u2019s pretty much used in the industry, so we basically adjusted that little over than our asset earning rate to be aligned with the industry. Then on the proportions, you should figure it out on that basis it\u2019s about somewhere near around $15 [ph] million. And the same thing was applicable to our GI [ph] because the accounting was treated the same way and we took that one, that discount rate up obviously it\u2019s less than the long term care because of the length of duration of investment.","Yaron Kinar","And can you give us any sense of how much of a change in the discount rate that was, was it 25 basis points, 50?","Walter S. Berman","It was approximately almost 200 basis points for the long term care portion.","Yaron Kinar","Operator","The next question is John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Hey, good morning everybody. My question on Advice and Wealth management first is I recognized there were two fewer fee days and that had some impact on revenues but I think you did also mentioned some softness. Can you give us a sense more what kind of impact, you feel like the softness I assume that softness was really more on the insurance sales side but maybe I am wrong, because your overall fee rate did come down quite a bit quarter-over-quarter, even if I adjust for the number of days. So I just wanted to get a sense for that, and then relatedly you are doing a terrific job managing G&A to be flat year-over-year, especially in light of investments and continued ongoing recruiting. I am just wondering if you think we should expect that G&A can remain flat, as we look forward on a year-over-year basis or if we ought to expect some increase there?","Walter S. Berman","No, it's Walter, you should expect the G&A to stand in that range. Certainly we will gauge it depending on the environment, but certainly we have a focus on scope [ph] providing to our clients, but we are very focused on maintaining the G&A, so that's a reasonable range. It could 1% or 2% but it -- certainly we are very conscious of the G&A management. And on the slowdown it is in insurance and it is in other parts, non-traded REITs but it is something that we believe in the latter part we will see a pickup and we do believe the volatility, like I said it was industry aligned and we anticipate that we will see improvement going forward.","John Nadel","And then Walter just a quick follow up on that G&A in terms of it remaining flat, should, can we think about that as flat on a dollar basis with the first quarter results or flat year-over-year?","Walter S. Berman","I would tend to say, I would look more on a total year basis, quarterly you get your seasonality coming through.","John Nadel","All right, that's helpful. And then just second question on the asset management side, margins are really solid at around 40% adjusted, without a significant change in the outlook for flows though, can we really expect that, that margin can get a whole lot better from here?","Walter S. Berman","I think the margin is that rate which is again we're talking about a pretty high rate, in the high 30s, almost 40% and yes, we are feeling the impact like we talked about the U.S equity that\u2019s flowing off from the UK and the Acorn, so there is some pressure but I think the margin will stay in that range.","John Nadel","And you mentioned a drag on EPI from FX, I just didn't catch the number in your prepared remarks, if you can just follow up with that?","Walter S. Berman","No, I didn't give it so but it's $4 million or $5 million.","John Nadel","Okay. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Wonderful, hey, good morning everyone. So a couple of questions, I guess starting with Advice & Wealth Management business, it\u2019s really just kind of a follow up on the last point. When we look at the distribution line, clearly there is a lot of kind of market-based assets or revenue sources in there. So I was hoping you can kind of help us isolate the decline quarter-over-quarter that came predominantly from the transactional part of the business, kind of the pure commission stuff and sounded like it\u2019s non-traded REITs maybe some annuities. But I was wondering if you could help us isolate that and back on the outlook I was getting down 10% or 11% quarter-over-quarter, I was just wondering if you could provide more color there?","Walter S. Berman","Sure. It was in the VA and the REIT line, non-traded REITs and with the non-traded REITs we believe it's timing because there are new regulations out about disclosure, which we are working through with our advisors which we believe in the back half of the year we will pick up on that.","Alexander Blostein","And I guess given the increased scrutiny on non-traded REIT product in general and I appreciate it's still obviously very early in the Department of Labor conversation, but I guess what gives you confidence that the financial advisory industry just doesn\u2019t start pulling back from that product ahead of time, given potential risks down the road?","Walter S. Berman","Okay, if you look at our track record and non-REITs is only the diligence we put through it and the returns it\u2019s giving to our clients, the non-traded REITs are an important part of retirement, it well, it has liquidity elements which are certainly fit in to our time and aspect to it, it gives a return characteristic that's quite good. And so I think again we have to study it, there is as Jim said we have different elements we can put in but it\u2019s an important product and it's worked very well for our clients.","James M. Cracchiolo","But Alex to the point reference I think again it's another product, a type of alternative product et cetera that should only be a small part of anyone's portfolio and that's the way we utilize, our advisors utilize it with their clients and it just complements some of the income streams that they are looking for. So as again I mean it's only a few percent for us in our total activities and you know if that was to change and I don't think it would be that material to us and we would look for other products that would satisfy those similar objectives.","Alexander Blostein","Yeah, no I agree with that point, just kind of curious from an industry perspective how financial advisors could react to this ahead of kind of finalized regulation. Staying I guess with AWM segment and the department of labor, I was wondering if you guys could help us with a couple of numbers, A; it would be helpful, I think to better understand what percentage of your revenues as a whole in AWM comes from a relationship that\u2019s pretty fiduciary standard. I know you said it\u2019s a bulk of it but I was wondered you had a number.","James M. Cracchiolo","I would say that we have a strong part of it, probably majority, a little over majority of where we do operate in a fiduciary standard, with the assets that we have. I mean we mentioned that there is a 180 some odd billion of assets under management there, those are all within a fiduciary. We also provide financial planning and advice complement to that against the entire client\u2019s portfolio activities. And so I think it\u2019s a reasonable portion of what we do already today, and it\u2019s a growing portion, as our advisors continue to look at more holistically how they help their clients satisfy their objectives. ","So again I think we are well situated for any continuing and we were very supportive with the SEC move to one larger fiduciary standard that would be more appropriate in how firms like us and others should operate. The question is when you get a combination of three different things going on, which we operate into both the fiduciary standard under the SEC, the FINRA standards for brokers and commission-based activities, now you overlay in a third standard and that\u2019s really the complication of how all those three work together and what role each regulator plays and how they play it.","Alexander Blostein","Got it, understood. And then switching gears to asset management business for a minute, two questions there I guess, one on the numbers side, I was wondering if you could size the mandates that are yet to be funded in the second quarter, sorry if I missed out but it sounded like you had some slippage there? And then second question there just broadly, when, Jim your comments earlier about your business potentially shifting more towards institutional, just given the successes as you guys are having in Institutional Columbia and continued kind of struggles on the retail front, so as that business continues to evolve and move towards institutional how would the margins in that segment be impacted overtime?","James M. Cracchiolo","So I think what -- so let me answer the first one. I think what we saw and again I can\u2019t say it was something abnormal, is we saw a number of institutions that we won mandates and we thought that they would fund within the first quarter, as we were predicting from the fourth quarter but because of the level of volatility that was experienced during the first quarter, as you saw our interest rates back going down and then backing up and in fact down again, people put a number of those things on hold, so to speak. ","They didn\u2019t say they were changing what that is, they just said that they were going to fund them a bit later. So I do believe that we expected a bit more of that come in in the first quarter and will come in over the next few quarters we think because no one has changed what they are looking to do, it\u2019s just the timing of them doing it. And so again, we still feel good; the pipeline is as strong as ever, our win rates are good. So nothing has changed from what we were seeing in the \u201814 period other than the timing is what I am getting from our institutional business. ","In regard to how we would like to grow that, very clearly we have a large institutional business today it\u2019s not as though we are not looking to continue to grow the retail. It\u2019s just that we think there are a level of activities, as we now have a more global platform we are working with between Columbia and Threadneedle, we are increasing the number and level of activity that we do, not just here in the States or in UK and Europe but to the Sovereigns, to Middle East and Asia and we think overtime, particularly as we add solutions and that could be a growing part of the business. ","Now with that if you can grow that institutional business a bit more there are good margins if you can get continued scale in a number of those product mandates which we think we can. So I don\u2019t think that, that would lower our margins. I think it actually would be complementary for us, and leverage a bit more of the infrastructure and investment teams we already have.","Alexander Blostein","Sure great, thanks so much.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Krueger with KBW.","Ryan Krueger ","Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow up on the institutional flows, you mentioned the pipeline\u2019s very strong, there were some delays in funding. I guess you had $800 million of third party institutional outflows in the quarter, based on what kind of you're seeing now, would you expect those third party flows to be positive in institutional for the balance of the year?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, I think as we look at the third party yes, we would and I think Walter mentioned that of the institutional outflows we experienced $1.8 billion, and one was almost the billion from Liverpool, Victoria [ph] which is one of the large insurance mandates that we have, that was just a few basis points and it was appropriate for them as they did their reallocation from it, but they already gave us a nod to some other product that we already have, that they will be funding over the next few quarter at a much higher fee rate, that would more than offset that loss. ","Zurich [ph] is the typical -- Zurich activities again basis points. So what we are looking at is for the third party business to be an inflow this year consistent with what we are seeing as a trend line last year and that's what we are still calling for at this point.","Ryan Krueger ","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then shifting to recruiting, it was pretty strong in the quarter can you just give an update on how the recruiting environment is these days and also what has been the mix of recruits into the employer versus franchise channel in, I guess in recent quarters?","James M. Cracchiolo","So recruiting continues to very good for us. As we said we added 77 new people. They were very good productivity in both channels. We are seeing higher levels of productivity from the people that we're recruiting and the pipeline continues to look good for us. We are getting, probably of the mix, I think a bit more has gone now into the employee platform and we continue to do, probably relative basis, based on the production we're bringing in. So I would say it's probably 50-50, but we are getting very strong production increases and very good ones into the employee channel.","Ryan Krueger ","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Eric Berg with RBC.","Eric Berg","Thanks very much and good morning to everyone. I am still trying to clarify why it is that you are already under a fiduciary standard, and from my question I mean this, in my sense that as a general statement, meaning there are going to be exceptions, FINRA regulated registered reps [ph] or registered reps are regulated by FINRA and they are broker dealer, in this case Ameriprise is broker dealer and that there are generally not subject to a Fiduciary standard, but rather there\u2019s an ability [ph] standard. So how does it come to pass that you are already under a fiduciary standard?","James M. Cracchiolo","So you are correct in how we are regulated by FINRA, on the rep business that we do as part of the broker dealer and commission-based activities but as an investment advisor we were managing client's money under an ADV, under the SEC we are an investment advisor and therefore we have to and we are governed under the fiduciary rule to operate in the best interest of our clients, rather than a suitability role.","Eric Berg","And just so that you can, I have one more question after this, of an unrelated nature but just to build on your answer, when you say we, do you mean Ameriprise or its advisors and in particular do you happen to know whether an advisor can be at once a registered rep and a registered investment advisor or must the advisor choose?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay, so our advisors operate under our investment advisory charter with the SEC. They are both, they can work in both standards because of how we set up our compliance and based on the activities that they currently do, we supervise them appropriately and we ensure that for each one they operate with the correct supervision and compliance and meet those standards.","Eric Berg","Okay. Separately just a quick one on Threadneedle, I think you said a couple of times in the course of the call that in contrast to Columbia, which enjoyed progress in the quarter there was a little bit of, I guess you said a setback at Threadneedle in the United States. What is different about Threadneedle\u2019s operations here that would produce a different outcome for it than what we are seeing out of Columbia.","Walter S. Berman","Eric it\u2019s Walter. I think may be, let me clarify it, when I said U.S., it is U.S. Equity they manage a fund that was called U.S. Equity Fund that the -- basically the team left when we had run off, that was what I was referring to. It was for -- there are the PMs for the U.S. Equity Fund that they sell overseas. ","Eric Berg","And what happened, was there a change, it was implied that there was a change in the\u2026?","Walter S. Berman","Last year the team left and we have been building back teams, hence we had basically redemptions which we talked about.","Eric Berg","Okay, so this is the sort of the ongoing effect of the residual effect of what happened last year.","James M. Cracchiolo","What Walter has mentioned is last year we had those assets. A part of that team left and therefore we suffered a level of redemptions in the first few quarters of last year. That has completely slowed. We have part of that PM build back for person who were there in part of the team and we have added more resources. So that\u2019s working well now. What Walter was talking about is the year-over-year effects on the redemptions that occurred a year ago.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to go back to the DOL one more time, if I could. Just based on your reading of the proposals, is there anything in there that suggests distribution of proprietary product, whether its mutual funds or annuities or even life insurance through your channel, could be at risk?","Walter S. Berman","Again we are sifting through the 700 pages but from our early read on this, there are exemptions as consistent with any other product sale, including for products that have revenue share and et cetera, that you can meet those exemptions and they are allowed. We fully today, just [ph] and clarity on this is part of the importance of what we already do, is to meet the various standards of both FINRA and the SEC today, we sell our product like every other product on the platform and let\u2019s say our mutual funds compensations, exactly the same. There is no different incentives, there is no different fee arrangements and what we charge in the various loads and non-loads et cetera.","So we feel very comfortable that Columbia product as an example can continue to be sold as with our annuities. The only question on the annuity front, as one had raised is can they be allowed in non-qualified and in qualified accounts? And we think again, I think if you are thinking about things with living benefits and those guarantees that are very important for the clients who get assured income in the future. So again those might be very much allowed with the exemptions as appropriately done.","So we don\u2019t have a concern about the proprietary and different than any other products sold on the platforms. And remember, Ameriprise even though we have a large advisor base, whether they be direct players, all those platforms and they have their own product on them, or even any one of the other houses, all have the similar mix of products. Some of them are proprietary, some of them are networked [ph] in, but again everyone would have to meet similar standards. We feel very comfortable because we fully disclose everything today as we should and there is no variation in how we market or sell them.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, just following up on the annuity point, you have been highlighting your shift in terms of new sales away from living benefit products. It seems to me if we are moving towards an environment where the benefit of the annuities is -- comes into greater focus, I mean do you anticipate a reversal of that where going forward more of your sales will actually come from living benefit products?","Walter S. Berman","Well, I would say, again we have a nice mix that we would like, to your point and very, very clearly would like to grow the portion that\u2019s non-living benefit and we think there is very good value for that including with the benefits from a tax perspective for a client, and also the type of product in there to generate income, that\u2019s tax beneficial. And so we would probably again just gear more of that as we do today, to the non-qualified portion of the clients\u2019 accounts. ","One of the things that I think we continue to look at is we don't just serve qualified separate from non-qualified. We look at holistically how we help a client achieve their retirement, their income level that they need, of the allocation of their various assets that's tax preferred versus not, those are all real value clients get from working with advisors. It's like if you remove an advisor, it\u2019s like removing any of the professional you may work with, you could so treat yourself for medicine or doctor or even your tax attorney or your lawyer but it's not advisable. ","Part of helping clients is not just that they can get a product that is low cost, the issue is how do you use that product, when do you put in when do you maintain it, the biggest issues with loss of assets is the individual behavior around managing those assets. So they get frightened at the wrong time, they invest at the wrong time. They don't look at it and they write probably in more objective fashion because there's still a lot of behavior motion involved.","So we think, again we understand what the DOL is looking to achieve, we hope and just want that to be in the best interest of clients. We just want to make sure that clients can be served as best as they can. We think a holistic way of doing that would be continue to be very beneficial, but I think the industry is going to have, as they go through this as you'll find each industry participant will be impacted in some way and will have to deal it.","Suneet Kamath","Yes. That's helpful. And maybe last numbers question just bigger picture, you've talked about your progress towards the 70% earnings contribution from asset management and advise and wealth management, just wondering if we kind of look forward a little bit longer ultimately where do you see the mix in terms of segments kind of settling out?","James M. Cracchiolo","I think what Walter mentioned, I think is a very fair thing. It's again you know we look out for the next periods or two and we are saying we'll get from the 64 to 70. I actually believe overtime again as we continue to grow these businesses that we are investing in, it will be much higher than 70% overtime, not because the insurance and annuities aren\u2019t good businesses but again they are only a part of the solution set that we only market as part of our client base. Asset management we're looking to grow more fully, external to our own channel as well as in our channel. So there is a growth beyond that if we are successful. And then the advice and wealth management business as example we look at holistically managing more client assets with more advisors and so it's just natural that it will be a part of that solution set but it's not going to be the majority of that solution set.","Suneet Kamath","Right. So maybe 80-20 is the\u2026?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yeah, yeah, I think that would be reasonable to assume as we look out.","Suneet Kamath","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"1944":["Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

My name is John and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. (Operator Instructions). I will now turn the call over to Ms. Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Welcome to the Ameriprise Financial\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe, provide insight into the underlying performance of the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials available on our website.","Some of the statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking statements, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties.","A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, our 2010 annual report to shareholders or our 2010 10-K report. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings discussion. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our business performance and some thoughts about our positioning for future growth, and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail. After that, we\u2019ll take your questions. ","We finished the year with substantial progress with a solid fourth quarter, despite continuing challenges from the environment. Markets recovered a bit in the quarter, but remained highly volatile, which caused clients to become more cautious and move to larger cash positions, and interests rates remained near zero which resulted in further spread compression.","My key message for you today is this, as always, we have ability to navigate through the short-term challenges, and we are focused on the medium to long term, which holds great potential for us. Our financial foundation remains one of the best in the industry, and it continues to give us important stability and strategic flexibility. ","We believe our financial strength enables us to weather the current storms and maintain our strong position in the future. We continue to generate significant capital and we are still holding more than $2 billion of excess capital and that after returning $1.7 billion or 135% of our operating earnings to share holders through dividends and buybacks during the year. ","In addition, in December we announced a 22% increase in the dividend which will be paid in February, and we now have increased our dividend five times in our six years as a public company. ","Even with the significant capital we\u2019ve returned, I believe we are in a stronger capital position now, than we were a year ago. As our business has become less capital intensive, we\u2019ve been able to free up capital to return to shareholders and invest for growth, while maintaining our ratings. ","Our many strengthens many our highly diversified and proven business model, to our client focus to our financial position allowed us to generated record operating earnings of $1.23 billion and a record operating revenues of $10.1 billion for the year. ","Now I will provide you some commentary on our business segments, and then I will give you my thoughts on the year ahead. First, in our Advice & Wealth Management segment, we\u2019ve delivered another strong quarter and our most profitable year ever. ","The market volatility and low rates seem to be affecting firms across the industry, with clients once again seeking safety and moving to cash and other low risk options. Still, our advisors generated good quarterly production and a record 384,000 of annual operating net revenue per advisor. We\u2019ve generated strong client asset flows highlighted by 1.4 billion in wrap net flows for the quarter, and 7.3 billion for the year. ","We also recorded our third consecutive quarter growth in the number of advisors. Our long term work to reengineer our advisor platform is largely complete, and has given us the lift in advisor productivity that we anticipated. ","At the same time, we stepped up experience advisor recruiting efforts and generated good momentum, with a 105 advisors joining us during the quarter, and a total of 337 for the year. The momentum is continuing in to this year. In fact, January was one of our best recruiting months ever with [new] recruits joining the firm. ","In the quarter, our margins in the Advice & Wealth Management segment decreased slightly as a result of our increased investments for growth and slowing client transaction activity due to market volatility. Even in the difficult operating environment, we are investing in the business ","Beginning in September, we increased our national television advertising presence, and we are finding that the ads are resonating well consumers. We are continuing to roll-out our new brokerage platform, which is a major multi-year investment. The conversion has gone smoothly for our employee advisors, and now we are in the process of converting franchise advisor systems, which is the larger part of our overall network. ","The brokerage platform investment will continue at a fairly high level this year, but we expect the process and related expenses to wrap up in 2012. We\u2019ll also invest in new avenues for long term growth, including the launch of a financial planning business in India. That power with India advisors bringing our holistic approach to the Indian consumer is off to a promising start. ","In addition, we will soon open a new operation site in Las Vegas, where we have been able to take advantage of the good labor market and low real estate prices. Our building there will house several functions, including advisors, technology support staff and client service people. ","We continue to invest, while we are beginning to tighten our management of discretionary expenses to offset potential market volatility. We are doing that across the firm, and I will comment further on this topic in a moment. ","Now we\u2019ll move on to Asset Management where the fundamentals remain solid and our growth opportunity is quite attractive. With the quarter across the segment, we generated 4.3 billion of net inflows. That number includes the 14 billion institutional mandates Threadneedle 1 from Liverpool Victoria, which was one of the largest single pieces of institutional business that went up for bid in the UK in 2011. ","Apart from this significant win, as we mentioned during our financial community meeting in November. We experienced 6.7 billion in redemption from low revenue in form of parent accounts. We expect some lump outflows to continue including about $4 billion of former parent-related outflows in the first quarter, and an additional 3 billion of these low margin assets as the year progresses. ","We also still expect to loose the previously announced 1.8 billion outflow from the New York 529 plan at some point this year. It\u2019s important to note that the vast majority of the expected outflows from former parent accounts should be completed this year. ","Retail assets remained a significant challenge for the industry, with almost $50 billion in net outflows from domestic long term equity funds in the fourth quarter alone. We remain in net outflows and retail funds at Columbia; primarily because of weakness is sub-advised accounts, which accounted for 1.3 billion of net outflows in the quarter. ","That said, we are seeing significant improvements in sales early this year, particularly in our focused funds. As a result, we are generating net inflows in certain fund areas that are on significant outflows across the industry. ","The institutional business is also making progress especially in third party channels. We have won several mandates that have not yet been funded and our pipeline of potential new business continues to grow. ","In terms of investment performance at Columbia, our shorter term numbers dip somewhat, but our longer term record remained strong. We are seeing good improvements in performance earlier this year. In fact Columbia generated very strong performance month in January. ","Internationally Threadneedle continues to generate strong results, with excellent investment performance and reasonable flows given European market conditions. I should note that Threadneedle also retained the mandate to manage substantially all of the Zurich assets to a competitively re-tender process. Like Columbia, Threadneedle is off to a good start this year with good net inflows in January. ","Overall, we feel good about our position in global Asset Management, and what we created with Columbia. The integration will be complete in this quarter. We have our wholesaling teams fully engaged across the country and they have strong performance to back their efforts; and we are developing new business collaboration between Columbia and Threadneedle to drive global growth opportunities. ","Now we move on to annuities and insurance. The annuity business continues to perform in line with our expectations both in terms of sales and risk. In total the variable annuities business generated new inflows of 227 million and the Ameriprise channel delivered net inflows of 442 million. ","Overall flows continue to be impacted by our decision to exit outside distribution of variable annuities, and we continue to feel good about that precision given the interest rate environment and the current risk return parameters of the business. ","With regard to fixed annuities, we continue to be in net outflows, because we have not put new product on the books due to the low rates. Walter will discuss this in more detail. Overall both the fixed and variable annuity books continue to deliver solid returns and our risk is well managed. That said, we recognize that the economics of this business are changing.","To accommodate the changes brought on by the years of near-zero short-term interest rates, we\u2019ve decided to raise fees and new variable annuity riders, and we\u2019ve communicated the decision to our advisors. The higher fees are likely to dampen sales in the short term, but we believe this is the right move to ensure we can continue to meet the long term guarantees of many of our annuity contracts and deliver strong shareholder value from this business. ","In addition, in the second quarter of this year, we will introduce new variable annuity products that we believe will meet client needs while providing sustainable economics. In fixed annuities, with low rates continuing and with the Feds operation twist last year, we expect spread compression to continue in 2012. ","The Protection segment delivered strongest quarter of the year, primarily from improvements in auto and home results. That business returned to more normal claim levels and is once again generating solid growth and profits. Auto and Homes policy accounts continue their steady increase, up 7% over a year ago. ","In the Life business while clients continue to be reluctant to commit cash to long term contracts given the tough economy involved for markets, we have seen some improvement in sales. We generated good sales of our new indexed universal life insurance product, which meets an important client need in volatile markets. ","During the quarter, we were recognized by insure.com as the number one life insurer in terms of client satisfaction, and those kinds of accolades served us as good sales [through] for wholesales and advisors. In total, life insurance in force remained essentially flat at a $191 billion ","To summarize, 2011 was a very good year for Ameriprise, despite significant environmental challenges. While the economy in the US is slowly recovering, the market environment remains quite challenging, and I think you are seeing the impacts across the broader financial services industry. ","Even with a recent bounce back, equity markets are exceptionally volatile. Interest rates will likely remain near zero for three more years, and the regulatory environment is changing rapidly. We are very conscious of the environment and its effect on our revenues. ","Expense discipline has long been one of our core competencies, and we are further stepping up our expense management efforts now. We are taking a close look at all discretionary spending across the firm, to ensure we are operating as efficiently as possible. That said, we are continuing to make important investments for the year and beyond. We are focused on a number of initiatives that we believe will drive the business forward. ","I like to briefly review just a few of them. We are going to emphasize our retirement capabilities through our advertising and new approach to help our advisors to discuss retirement with their clients. ","You all know that the retirement need is very large. We think we are ideally situated to meet the holistic needs of people approaching this milestone. Second; we\u2019ll continue to invest to help advice become more productive and to bring in highly productive experience devices. We are providing the technology and marketing support advisors need to serve clients efficiently in bringing new clients. ","Third, in Asset Management, we are focused on flows and broadening our distribution. We believe we have the investment performance to drive improved flows, and we\u2019ve emerged merger related impacts in the US. ","Now we are investing to build the Columbia management brand and to promote our investment performance. At the same time, we are broadening our distribution reach to new markets with Threadneedle making inroads in the Middle East, Continental Europe and Asia.","Overall, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of the extremely compelling consumer need for retirement products and advice, and we have the financial strength and talent to realize our opportunities. So we will continue to invest to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. ","We have demonstrated our ability to succeed in good times and bad, and I believe we are in excellent position to navigate this period and emerge stronger, just as we did following the financial crisis three years ago. ","Now I will turn it over to Walter.","Walter Berman","Operating earnings in the fourth quarter clearly reflected the challenging environment. While equity markets have rallied about 5% in January, market volatility remains with us in 2012, and it is clear that interest rates are unlikely to increase until 2014.","Looking at revenues in more detail; you can see that excluding the hedge fund fees, revenues would have been about flat to last year. The underlying slowdown in revenue growth reflects low client activity from weak market sentiment. ","Clients are increasingly focused on capital preservation and generating income. This impacted revenues in two ways; lower transactional volumes and an increase in cash balances. How long the shift in behavior continues is difficult to predict. Revenues were also impacted by low rates, with net investment income down 4% from last year. However, the underlying fundamentals of the business remained strong, with a growing advisor base and good asset growth. ","From an earnings perspective, operating earnings per share grew 2% despite lower revenues, as we managed expense levels and continued to make substantial investments in brand and technology. We also realized synergies from Columbia integration and saw a good improvement in auto and home results.","Turning to slide 4; operating return on equity in the quarter increased 13.1% compared with 12.9% a year ago. As a reminder, we calculate return on equity on a trailing four quarter basis. We saw a big swing in DAC unlocking and model changes year-over-year. Excluding these impacts, underlying return on equity group from 12.5% to 13.4%. As we look ahead to next year, we are on track to hit the 15% to 18% range we provided in November.","Underlying our return on equity is our strong balance sheet fundamentals. Our hedge program is effective; our capital ratios are strong with debt-to-cap of 18.5%; the investment portfolio is high quality. We had only $11 million of impairments in the quarter, and as we have said, we have no holdings of [stopping] debt in financially troubled European countries.","Turning to page 5; we ended the year with over $2 billion of excess capital, and about 600 million of debt capacity. ","In 2011 we returned 1.7 billion of capital to shareholders or about 135% of our earnings. We received 2.1 billion of dividends for our operating companies this year, with most of that coming from our life companies. ","In the fourth quarter, we received 850 million dividend in the form of securities from the Life company. These securities are highly rated and very liquid. ","This additional dividend will reduce investment income at the Life company, by about 2%. As for the dividend, the RBC ratio remained strong at 490%, which was our targeted level.","Turning to segment results starting with Advice & Wealth Management; operating earnings in Advice & Wealth Management decreased 14%. We continue to see good asset growth and retention, with net inflows of $1.4 billion in the quarter. ","However, earnings were impacted by a slowdown in revenue growth from a decline in transactional volumes and from clients holding more cash. This is a trend being experienced throughout the industry.","Cash [sweep] accounts increased to $15 billion, and we are currently earning just 42 basis points. ","In the quarter, we continued our investments by launching our new brand campaign and the development and implementation of our new brokerage platform. The new platform is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2012. ","In total, growth investments were about $14 million higher in the quarter, and we would expect that elevated level of expense to continue through 2012.","Turning to Asset Management. Asset Management earnings declined 36 million, primarily due to hedge funds, where earnings were down 21 million year-over-year. ","The remainder of the earnings decline reflects the expected impact from both markets and its outflows. Expenses excluding the hedge fund impact were about flat year-over-year, and includes funding additional brand divestments.","Adjusted net operating margins were 31.4%. The Columbia integration is progressing well, and we realized net synergies of 130 million, in line with our target for 2011. The technology integration is on track for separation in mid-2012.","Annuity earnings were up a bit this quarter. However, we see different trends in variable and fixed annuity books. In variable annuities, operating earnings grew 13%, excluding some favorable adjustments. ","On a year-over-year basis, the DAC and DSIC impact was about the same, given very similar market performance in each period. We had client inflows and also had $10 million of favorable items, including improvements to our models and the market impact on our debt [band] of reserves.","Variable annuity sales in Ameriprise channel declined 9%, compared to sales a year ago, when we introduced our RAVA 5 product. Net flows in this channel were about 442 million. ","In the quarter, we also announced plans to increase fees on variable annuity new business. We believe this is an appropriate action to reflect the change in economics for that product.","In fixed annuities operating earnings declined 32%, which includes an unfavorable adjustment to the reserve for indexed annuity contracts. ","As we previously indicated, we expect fixed annuity earnings to decline, as we invest asset at lower yields. The incremental annual negative impact will primarily be about 35 million after tax for all Ameriprise, and as I mentioned earlier, the reduction in investable assets at the Life Company will add additional pressure on net investment income.","Let\u2019s move on to Protection. Operating pre-tax income in the Protection segment increased 30%, driven by improved earnings in auto and home, and stable earnings in the life and health area. ","Auto and home revenues increased 6% over last year, primarily driven by growth in sales through our partnership with Progressive. We saw improvement in trends in auto and body injury claims, which are back to more normalized levels.","In closing, we delivered strong results in 2011, and continued to demonstrate our ability to be successful in a range of market conditions. ","As Jim said, we are managing for the short-term, but we\u2019re focused on the long-term. We have strong financial fundamentals, and we\u2019ll continue our focus on enterprise risk management to drive shareholder value. ","With that, we\u2019ll open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction). Our first question comes from John Nadel from Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","Obviously a lot of margin pressure in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management this quarter. 9ish in A&WM and maybe just shy of 17x items in Asset Management. ","I\u2019m just interested in the 12% target and the 23% target for those two segments respectively. I know client activity, etcetera, pressure points; my question is; are those targets achievable and over what timeframe?","Jim Cracchiolo","John, this is Jim Cracchiolo. I\u2019ll respond first and then Walter can compliment. If I look at the AWM segment, we were hit with a bit of impact due to market volatility. I mean, fees were lower, our Wrap business went down a lot in the third quarter because of market depreciation and our underlying flows are still fine; that started to come back in the fourth quarter. But of course you\u2019re taking the fees for every month during the quarter and they would\u2019ve been impacted.","Second, if you look at a number of companies are already reporting, and in the industry a lot of client activity did slow in the fourth quarter, whether you look at the retail firms, the direct firms or wire houses because of the market volatility. It does impact client behavior. ","So even though we\u2019re sitting here now in January and the markets are back, during that period if we recollect in August, September things were looking pretty ugly again, and it does give people pause and there was a large amount of volatility in October, November, etcetera.","So we\u2019re no different. I mean our client activity is looking at CNBC and the news and looking at how many times that stock index moves up and down and the European crisis and the political climate that\u2019s out there. ","Now, will that come back if things start to again continue to show stabilization etcetera? The answer will be yes. But it does your top line revenue. Now in addition to that, what we thought appropriate so is we are investing in our multiyear platform. ","We didn\u2019t want to slow that down, and so we started the conversion to our franchisee system, integrating in the full brokerage to all of our other systems and capabilities, and going through that conversion that will continue through this year, as we get to the fourth quarter, it will be pretty much complete.","That was a step up a bit in investment. We also were investing in a number of other things to continue to build out our systems, mobile, etcetera, apps and a number of things that funds get committed before and your project work going on before. You can tell with the markets going to do (inaudible). ","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","I understand that. If I could just interject. If I think about that $14 million year-over-year higher expenses on those items that Walter had mentioned; that\u2019s about 150 basis points as I calculated on the margin for the segment. ","So in other words should we think about the remainder of the difference to your 12%, which is about where you were the last couple of quarters, as being just, we got to watch we got a see consumer sentiment, we got to see transactional volumes, and client activity picked back up and we regained that difference?","Jim Cracchiolo","","We will regain that because remember, our systems development was through the year. We had a little extra in the fourth quarter, but it was through the year. The only thing incremental was the relaunch of our new campaign, which started in September when we had a full year impact. ","Now, that we are going to continue that campaign through the first quarter, and then we\u2019ll evaluate how much we spend later in the year. But I would say this. We do have the ability to control some of our discretionary expenses that we\u2019re looking at. ","I do believe, again, I can\u2019t dictate the markets and client activity. But I would say we will be in the 12% margins this year in the AWM business. So I don\u2019t look at that one quarter as an issue. ","I would actually say there\u2019s strong underlying growth, the indicators are there, advisors are not going to stop their productivity, but clients do have to get a little settled.","So I feel good about that segment and I feel good about what we\u2019re doing in it. As I said, the investments we\u2019re making, they\u2019ll start to roll off like that technology this year, and there will be a big upside because we are running two systems, we are converting thousands of advisors and we are doing a lot of systems development. ","A lot of that was in last year\u2019s P&L and we still got good margins. So once that rolls off, it will help tremendously.","In the Asset Management business, to be very clear on that, we have a level of depreciation. We\u2019ve lost a number of assets because equity markets weren\u2019t best to get flows where we thought we would get. ","The parent stuff, I know people look at the volume of those dollars, but we always sort of thought that we would lose them. They are not a lot of fee basis. So I would say that 23%, no, I would probably put more in the 20%, 21% based on just where markets are, because I think that compressed us where we thought things would improve in the market situation. ","Again, if markets come back it will be a different sorry, but if we\u2019re thinking about that on a relative sense today, that\u2019s probably more where I would target it. Having said that I do see some underlying things changing around there. ","Now flows in the industry aren\u2019t great, but Threadneedle is doing good. I think Columbia is starting to gain some traction through its third party institutional, and retailer\u2019s outflows are slowing. ","So we\u2019ll get over the hump of the parent stuff. I identified it just as I told you in my talking points, so that no one\u2019s surprised at it, but those will be lumpy. But at the end of the day again, I think we are making a good underlying traction.","John Nadel - Sterne, Agee","Just one last quick one, is your buyback currently curtailed or is it operating just at a lower level than we\u2019ve been accustomed to?","Jim Cracchiolo","","We did not curtail it. Again, going into the fourth quarter; now looking back you can always say hey, markets why did you do that? But markets were bit more volatile. ","We are looking at what it looked like. We did a substantial amount over the course of the year and we are also looking at potential opportunities at the same time. ","But no, buyback is not curtailed. We will continue it this year. We just sort of adjusted it depending at the same time. We don\u2019t have a perfect crystal ball on things.","Walter Berman","","Let me just add to that, if you looked at the share price, it went from like 37 to 50 in the quarter, and so is completely volatile. We actually purchased on the average. ","But, as Jim said, it was just looking at a pretty volatile market, and in retrospect you can always say could\u2019ve bought more. The reality is I think we bought (inaudible) but no curtailment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Sanford Bernstein. Please, go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein","I just wanted to follow-up on John\u2019s questioning on the margin. I am actually surprised to some degree that you feel comfortable with the 12% Advice & Wealth, and you are sort of lowering Asset Management. The reason is you\u2019ve reaffirmed those targets or those objectives in sort of November at your Investor Day. ","From Investor Day to the end of the year, I think the markets were higher in terms of helping the Asset Management. I get the fact that client activity is weaker, but again you\u2019re affirming the 12% in Advice & Wealth. ","So I\u2019m just trying to understand like what\u2019s the delta between what you said in November in terms of Asset Management and what you\u2019re saying now?","Walter Berman","","As you talk about looking at it from that standpoint, certainly the markets have rallied, and as we\u2019ve seen the volatility with it, if you\u2019d just take a straight line projection up certainly, as Jim said, you might get to a higher number. ","But it is challenging for where these markets are, and the more you get shifts coming in and out of that nature, it does affect us from the equity and fixed income flip. ","So I think that is really where the leverage is going to go in and out. It\u2019s just this volatility in the market, it\u2019s just at a pretty steep basis, and so, I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing us be a little cautious on that.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein","","Maybe getting back to Advice & Wealth then, 12% is a pretty big lift for the year. I know you touched on it in answering John\u2019s question, but what specifically do you think gets you from where you are today there? ","Is it really a throttling back of some of the advertising expense beyond the first quarter or what are kind of the big levers that you have to get to the 12%?","Walter Berman","","So let\u2019s look at it. From a perspective, again, I can\u2019t predict activity during the quarter in fees. So for instance if you say, and that goes for the Asset Management; if you say the markets are going to just continue to go up from here or even manage stability from here and rise, then we\u2019re talking about a different story. ","Our forecasts, our projection is just based on last year was we didn\u2019t take that right. It was up, it was down, and you don\u2019t get on average the fees all the time. ","So part of our difference may be from what you\u2019re looking at is that if we\u2019re here and we\u2019re continuing to rise on a nice even slope, that\u2019s one thing. If you got a level of volatility it\u2019s another thing.","In regards the margin itself, I do believe we can manage some of the discretionary expenses. I think we\u2019re going to set some internal targets to tighten up on something that\u2019s nice to do and nice to have. But if the revenue is weak, we got to adjust that. ","At the same time as I said, we want to complete some of these investments like that technology, get it behind us. That will help our margins in the future. Interest rates also affected us a bit more when the [NACE], we were even using the yield curve last year. That\u2019s a little out so we want to make up for some of that by tightening those expenses.","Now will revenue rise as much? Maybe not, but I can still tighten the margin even if revenue is a bit lower. ","So we are guarding against the revenue weakness. If the markets come back here and stay stable then I think we\u2019ll continue to show the rise we did in the first few quarters of last year. If it doesn\u2019t then I need to tighten the ship a little bit.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein","","Understood, and one quick follow-up. When you said earlier that you expect to hit 12% margin in Advice & Wealth in 2012, is that for the full year or you staying sort of by the end of the year?","Walter Berman","","That is for the full year. That was the expectation.","Suneet Kamath - Sanford Bernstein","","And that\u2019s still your expectation?","Walter Berman","With the caveats that you mentioned, yeah.","Jim Cracchiolo","","We can\u2019t guarantee anything. What we\u2019re saying is we\u2019re still trying to shoot that, and we have a number of things that we are working on to help make that happen.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from UBS. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS","","Just following on that last line of questions, it would imply to get that 12% margin, you need to use these discretionary spending initiatives to maybe cut at least $15 million a quarter in expenses. Is that the objective, and maybe Jim or Walter, a little more clarity on those potential initiatives?","Jim Cracchiolo","","I haven\u2019t done your exact calculation, but it is a combination of, certainly as Jim said, as you look at the revenue on managing the expense based upon that revenue base. So yeah, I think we have degrees of flexibility on that. I haven\u2019t done the exact calculation the way you have done it. But it is a combination of factors that go through.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS","","Anything specific you could lay out (inaudible), Walter?","Walter Berman","","Really what it is across the board is this. We do a lot of technology spend for enhancements, new initiatives beyond the brokerage platform conversion. There are numerous program on the marketing and support levels that we have. There\u2019s a number of things that we truly invested in, enhanced training and setting up new initiatives like onboarding our new advisors and even increasing our advertising there. ","So there are number of different things that we\u2019ve done that we could tighten a bit depending on what the market situation looks like that would be helpful in this environment. Controlling some of our staff expenses that get charged in from the different units into the AWM business that we can tighten. ","Listen, when we were growing in a number of areas, etcetera. We wanted to continue to invest more heavily. We had a big investment agenda and we might just have to temper that a bit and tighten it, and we\u2019ve been used to doing this. ","We\u2019ve always reengineered. We have a number of new initiatives that our resources were consumed with the integration of Columbia that we\u2019re freeing backup; that we can work on again reengineering and moving things and enhancing the way we operate and process. And some of the things we\u2019re looking to do will help in that line.","So this apart we need to do, this is part of what we\u2019ve always done. Again, I\u2019m not putting the 12% as a firm thing as the most important objective. I\u2019m just saying I think I have opportunities and we are still believing that we are growing the advisor force, we are growing ways that they can deepen their relationships. ","We are introducing things that hopefully will help them deepen and gain more assets. So some of that will come from revenues, some of it will come from expense tightening.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS","","Okay. And then maybe just shifting gears to the Asset Management area, particularly Columbia, where the one-year number for your above-average (inaudible) numbers. It went from 62% asset weighted in 2Q to 56% 3Q, down to 38% in the fourth quarter and that kind of dragged down the three-year numbers well. ","Could you give a little color on where you expect that number to go in the near term? What\u2019s causing that struggle in performance, and what you think the implications are for retail net flows going forward?","Jim Cracchiolo","","So there are two things that occurred, and I\u2019ll give you a little more color to it. On the one year performance, what occurred is that we had a number of our domestic equity funds falling a bit low the Lipper medians. ","Now the differentials between the second and third quartile were very small in 2011, and while we under-performed and since it was so small, we could make up that ground, in most cases, quickly and January is already showing that, that\u2019s come back around. So we think that we\u2019ll start to show improvements.","The big change was we had one of our funds move below, and it was a big fund, move below the median and that was because a good quarter rolled off and the bad quarter rolled on in the sense of hurting that. ","But already January performance is good there as well, and we\u2019re hoping that, that will start to turn its colors as well. But we think it has a lot to do with that movement so to speak, and our investment people are feeling good that there\u2019s an ability to continue to see improvements there.","Andrew Kligerman - UBS","","Got it. And then just lastly M&A; it seemed like you were alluding in an earlier question to the fact that you\u2019re looking at opportunities. Do you think that\u2019s the environment [heated] up a bit in terms of opportunities, and in what areas? Asset Management? Advice & Wealth Management?","Jim Cracchiolo","","Well, I think you\u2019re seeing a bit more level of activity out there in the Asset Management world. We\u2019ll continue to look a potential opportunities. It doesn\u2019t mean there was one for us, but we\u2019ll continue to look and see if there is something that\u2019s good that we could potentially do. ","We have the flexibility to do that, and incremental to what we\u2019re doing now, we\u2019ll continue to look at the buybacks as I said as part of what we\u2019re going to continue to execute on, and we\u2019re going to continue to review our dividend policy as well.","We did another raise at the end of last year. So we\u2019re going to look flexibly of how we can create shareholder value using the strength of our balance sheet and the free cash that we continue to generate. ","That\u2019s why as I look at the fourth quarter, it wasn\u2019t what we ideally would want. But having said that, I think if you look at the underlying of what we\u2019ve been able to invest in, what we\u2019ve been able to do, and even though one can estimate what that will always be to next quarter, I think if you look at the underlying things we have just accomplished over the last few years, we want to continue to build upon that. And we\u2019re going to continue to work hard to do that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","","So just to go back to the margin discussion and AWM; I understand it\u2019s hard for you to predict environment in the markets and the level of productivity, etcetera. But it does feel like you guys are bringing in higher-producing advisors in the employee channel where planning capacity and incremental margin on that should in theory be higher. ","So kind of taking that into consideration, do you think there\u2019s some room for margin improvement from this 9% to 10% level, assuming markets don\u2019t really change from here?","Jim Cracchiolo","","Yes. Complemented to what I said. But yes, that was another thing you just pointed out very clearly. We are adding a lot of productivity from new people joining us. It takes time to ramp up. The ones that were added two years ago are ramping nicely. The one we added last year will help the ramp up this year, and we are accelerated the number of people we brought in towards the latter part of the year.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","","On Asset Management, you told us about the same redemptions at the Investor Day a month and a half ago. So net-net you are probably seeing maybe $8 billion to $9 billion of [still] redemptions come in that you know of in 2012. ","But then you guys also talked about institutional pipeline, that was pretty good and there\u2019s some mended that you won but haven\u2019t funded yet. Can you quantify those, and what you think those actually going to fund?","Jim Cracchiolo","","Well, as I said, we have some fundings already come in like in our Threadneedle area and in the Columbia area. We have some good wins that we won in the fourth quarter and December, etcetera, that we think will be finding in the first quarter. ","We have others that were in the pipeline that we\u2019re bidding on; the pipeline is quite strong. So here again, I can\u2019t give you numbers per say right now, but I would just say that the improvements are there. We think that we\u2019ll win. ","Again if you adjust for these parent stuff that I just mentioned, I think that this will be one of the areas that we\u2019ll look for improvement in growth this year based on the traction that we\u2019re gaining.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Shifting gears a little bit on capital management and potential acquisition opportunity for you guys, Jim, on current operating earnings basis you guys spit out, Walter, you pointed at 135% of your total operating earnings between the buybacks and the dividends. ","Given the slowdown in the fourth quarter, but I mean maybe we should think about more on an annualized full run rate basis, is that kind of the total payout that you guys are thinking about for 2012? ","That\u2019s question number one and then the follow-up to that on the M&A side, I guess, what areas in Asset Management do you guys still feel you have some product holes that you would need to fill?","Walter Berman","","Alex, we don\u2019t set a hard fast target, but we have about, as of the end of December, about $1.450 billion left in the authorization, and that spreads over approximately six quarters. So you can get a pretty good idea what the standard of this playing average is, and then as we said, we\u2019ll be opportunistic about it. ","So really, while we bought back a [250 billion] in the fourth quarter, we didn\u2019t feel that was really retreating from it. As I indicated it was extremely volatile markets so we will just gauge that. ","But certainly I don\u2019t forecast earnings; as you look at it, we do gear as we understand that as Jim said we\u2019re looking at which way whether its dividends are it\u2019s going to be buybacks. ","So I think those sort of indications should give you some comfort zone of where the minimum standards are.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And the product holes potentially?","Jim Cracchiolo","","I think we would like to continue to grow our international businesses. I think if we look at the US, it\u2019s not so much product holes per se. Now that we\u2019ve completed and upgrading our systems etcetera and we have good things in place we could probably take on more assets and expand a bit more there and in some of the areas. ","So it\u2019s more of what would help us to continue to position ourselves well and gain from the position that we put in place, even gain some more profitability in revenue. So, I think that\u2019s what I would say. ","If you are looking at areas to expand in, it would mainly be more international than domestic. If we are looking for more of an ability to consolidate onto something we\u2019ve built, it would be more in the US.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Schuman from KBW. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","I think we hit the Wealth Management margin pretty well. I maybe got a little bit lost on the Asset Management margin comments. In response to John\u2019s question you mentioned 21%. I wasn\u2019t clear if you are suggesting that as possibly a relevant aspiration for 2012 or whether that is the new 23% sort of longer term more basic aspiration?","Jim Cracchiolo","","No. I was just commenting on 2012. Again I am not here to predict or project by actual numbers, because again a lot goes into it. I mean if we had a good read on markets and what goes into happens in equity and whether there\u2019s a shift back around in flows in equity, I\u2019d be able to secure and give you a better calculation. ","But I think just off the top of our heads here and thinking about the 23 and just based on what we\u2019ve been seeing and have, we sort of adjusted that in our view right now for 2012 not for the longer term.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","Well, that\u2019s very helpful, Jim, because we\u2019ve seen a lot of margins over time and I think for a period we operated under some pretty clear goalposts and you are advancing on those goalposts. I think we were also on the same page and over the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve all got a little bit disoriented. So understanding that things are fluid, it\u2019s still very helpful that you\u2019ve given us some sense of where you could go in 2012.","Jim Cracchiolo","","No, I agree with you. As I said if we go back a few years on the AWM, we accounted on getting a lot of margin from interest rates rising to get to the 12%. As I said to you, we\u2019re trying to shoot for that 12% even in these volatile markets with heavy investment without that interest margin. ","So if Bernanke changed their view of the world, you\u2019re talking about a substantial improvement there that we\u2019ve just again put off again for another year and a half because of his latest views. ","So these things are a bit fluid, the markets are a bit volatile. When they go down in Europe you lose flows, when they come back you start gain them again. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s a consistent feeling that anyone has, but it\u2019s fluid, but the underlying focus has not changed. ","I want to be very clear to you about the analysts and investors, it has not changed. We\u2019re working hard on it, and as I said, we\u2019ll continue to look at using both the balance sheet flexibly as well as some of our current base spending and investments. ","There are just some things I won\u2019t entail because we\u2019re halfway through them and I think they\u2019ll pay good dividends after we\u2019re finished.","Jeffrey Schuman - KBW","That\u2019s very helpful. Just one other thing if I might. It\u2019s pretty clear that you\u2019ve probably gotten some good traction building your brand with customers, and certainly for a while the brand was attracting advisors. ","Can you kind of give us maybe update on how the brand is positioned in the advisor world? Are you still kind of drawing people in the same way you were, post financial crisis or has that moderated or how is the momentum I guess?","Jim Cracchiolo","","No. Actually, the momentum is good and we\u2019ve ramped up our efforts last year, the latter part of last year, pipeline has built. We started to even part of the increase in expenses. We started to actually put our name out there in trades as recruiting. We never did that before because we never recruited before. So we sort of ramped up our advertising there. ","We have a good pipeline as we said, we\u2019ve added 52 people in January, which is our strongest probably ever productivity. The people we\u2019re adding is higher than it was. Also, just so we know, the brand launch that we did, the advertising and a number of research things that we\u2019ve looked at, it was the number one rated financial services ad in the quarter, and it\u2019s really hitting with the consumer. ","So that\u2019s why we want to continue it through the first quarter as well, and then we\u2019ll see where we go. But Tommy Lee Jones in those ads are excellent for us; it\u2019s telling our story and the retirement market is going to be here through this volatility, and the need is going to be there. So even though we can debate as you saw the results, in profitability in the quarter, I\u2019m feeling more optimistic about that segment and business.","In the Asset Management business, everything we put in place, I feel good about everything that\u2019s underlying that we have in place. But having said that, you saw the industry flows over the last year, and there are only a few places where people are getting inflows that it\u2019s usually a targeted area or a targeted fund or global bond or something like that. It\u2019s not in any large case across equities or large case across all areas. ","Fixed income is starting to pick up again which is good. We\u2019re starting to push that a bit more as part of our focused sales. So listen, if the environment continues to stabilize and improve, we\u2019re in good shape. Nothing has changed fundamentally from what I told you in November, nor what I told you a year ago and I think we\u2019ll continue to gain traction.","The one other thing I will tell you and don\u2019t underestimate is the idea that we are freeing up more capital. Our capital requirements are continuing to go down, we\u2019re continuing to work on those things even more, including in our annuity business. ","The decisions we made there we think were excellent in that regard and we\u2019re going to continue to put some new products out that will continue to help that in more volatile environments. ","So listen, I think the markets will be the markets, the environment is such, quarter-to-quarter I can\u2019t do your modeling, but I would say that if you\u2019re looking at this as an underlying strength in core investment, I think we\u2019re in good shape.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","First question, Walter, just on your ROE guidance on slide 4, 15% to 18% ROE accounting for the DAC change, that implies a range of let\u2019s just call it approximately 570 to 670, pretty broad range. ","Is it safe to assume, given what you\u2019re telling us about Asset Management margins that you\u2019re going to be at the very low end of that range? Or can you give a little bit of perspective about sort of the puts and takes there?","Walter Berman","","Can you help me, Tom, a little? When you said the 15 to 18 certainly what we said at the financial committee meeting, but I didn\u2019t catch the point about the 570.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Sure. Walter, I was calculating looking at what you\u2019re adjustment on book value is going to be, assuming some growth in book value throughout the year. I\u2019m just implying 570 would imply a 15 ROE, a little over 670 would imply an 18 ROE. ","So my question for you is very simply, in lieu of what you\u2019ve told us about Asset Management margins being below previous range, is it fair to say that we should expect the absolute ROE for 2012 to be at the very low end of the range? Or can you just give us a little bit of sensitivity around expectation, because that range is very wide.","Just any light you can shed on that just kind of broadly speaking.","Walter Berman","","Well actually the range is basically it\u2019s the same as we had before is the 12% to 15% to 15% to 18%. Again not forecasting here; certainly with the understanding as we just said the mix of the businesses and things of that; I believe that we\u2019re certainly in a reasonable about the 15 and it\u2019s again depending on what takes place, we should be able to move into reasonable safe territory. ","Again, I just don\u2019t want to forecast it, but certainly I feel that making a statement that we\u2019ll be in that range with these challenging events I think is a good statement. So remember we\u2019re still finalizing our EITF and going through there and from that standpoint so factors are coming in. ","But the business shift is taking place, and I think that we see a good trajectory to get us into those ranges. And that\u2019s why I said it in the comments.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","That\u2019s helpful. So you feel like comfortably above 15 at this stage in the game?","Walter Berman","","We feel that we could go above the 15.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Sure. The next question I had on the Asset Management margins is; is it fair to say that the reason you\u2019re expecting kind of subdued margins at least relative to plan for this year is really just simply because you\u2019re seeing no momentum on active equity management, which is your [High Sea] business. ","So when you are seeing recovery inflows it\u2019s going into low-fee fixed income? Is it really just that simple at this point?","Walter Berman","","I think it\u2019s actually (inaudible) what Jim is saying, because as we know with the volatility that takes place in certainly we are driven more towards equity. We are trying to evaluate the implication of that because when you get this much volatility, we get reasonable share in to fixed income; the profitability for us is higher on the equity side. So in these markets, it\u2019s certainly has not been as conducive. ","So that I think is exactly where we are positioning. And again it\u2019s been extremely volatile. Certainly as we indicated, the rates have gone up 5% and you could start saying the world just takes off from here, that\u2019s great. ","But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s difficult to calibrate off that. That\u2019s exactly where it is. As Jim said we are getting close and things of that nature. But the issue is its mix and it\u2019s really the volatility in the market.","Tom Gallagher - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then Jim, last question, just circling back on Advice & Wealth Management. I hear everything you said about the dampening impact of client funds moving into cash slowdown in client activity weighing on the margins in 4Q. What have you seen? ","You talked a bit about what you seen thus are within Asset Management. What have you seen in Advice & Wealth Management so far year-to-date? Have you seen any kind of recovery in client activity in [shales], and have you seen any kind of mix shift moving back out of cash or is that still likely the pressure things into 1Q?","Jim Cracchiolo","","Well, I think you got again two things. One is you see an increasing back of fees again because the markets have recovered a bit. And as I said we didn\u2019t see people pull money, we just didn\u2019t see as much money continue to investments into the equity funds, etcetera, in the fourth quarter. ","So I think if things continue to show what they\u2019re showing, we\u2019ll start to see it move back. I also believe that people today, I mean I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a spurt back in anything. I think you could see some things happening across the industry where things have settled. ","But I think it might take a little time for it to start to get back to more normalized in a sense. Well, I don\u2019t even know what normalized is anymore; it\u2019s more of how long are you in a more stable, less volatile period for people to feel comfortable.","So January it\u2019s early yet. I really don\u2019t even have all the information for January in for me to give you a better read. I would just say on a fee basis, it should be better because the markets have come back. On a transaction basis, I think it hasn\u2019t gotten worse, so I think it\u2019s starting to stabilize, and maybe it\u2019ll start to improve if this continues. But I think it\u2019s still early in the quarter for me to give you a read.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","Jim, I\u2019d like to return first to Suneet\u2019s question, if the markets have been so volatile, affecting retail activity and affecting willingness in people to invest in mutual funds as well as institutional flows. And that was true all of 2011 and it has continued into 2012, why the change now? ","In other words, again, my thinking is if that was the case as of Investor Day, so as of your financial community conference, so what has happened between then and now that would lead you to revise downward, admittedly for 2012 only, your margin guidance for the or your thoughts on margin in the Asset Management business? What\u2019s happened in the last few weeks is really what I\u2019m asking?","Jim Cracchiolo","","So, Eric, I think you embedded two things. One is some of the Retail things that I said and the Asset Management so let me separate the two. First of all, I do believe there was nice improvement last year in the level of client activity and engagements with the markets. ","I think where we saw a fall-out earlier in the year in Europe that affected European flows in the Asset Management, but didn\u2019t really affect Retail flows here in the US in the AWM business. That sort of changed when the market really collapsed in the third quarter and was collapsing. ","So people don\u2019t look at the first time it goes down, they look at the added effect of that, and then, they start to pull back and get concerned but what if it went down another leg and fell from 1100 to 900, etcetera. I think that\u2019s what happened there.","I think if you look at all retailers across the industry that have reported, you\u2019ll find 15% down in dots or transactions or fee levels, and I think many of them have commented. So we\u2019re not an outlier there. We probably fall a little less, but it takes us a little more to get back quickly based on just client activity. ","But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re an outlier there at all. I think you can see that if you just look at other people and what they\u2019ve said in their reporting and what has been published on the industry.","In the Asset Management business, as we looked at the numbers, etcetera, what we\u2019re continuing to see is that there isn\u2019t a big move into equity funds. Now, if that changes, maybe based on what\u2019s happening and settling in Europe. ","But when you don\u2019t get a lot more move into equity funds particularly in the Retail business, that\u2019s your higher-margin business, and when you continue to add that up and also when you assume that, and maybe it\u2019s a wrong assumption on my part, but I\u2019m just assuming continued volatility that we saw last year. ","So, when you start to think that way, it does impact your fees. You can\u2019t adjust your costs consistent with that up and down; you need to continue to drive forward. So, I think you\u2019ll find that when you do that and you take some revenue out, even though the market may end up higher, you start to compress because you have a fixed expense base.","Eric Berg - RBC Capital Markets","But given that Columbia with RiverSource now is such a broad and vast complex, I would think you\u2019d have sort of what some people have called an all-weather portfolio and that if customers don\u2019t like equity, well you have a broad portfolio of both municipal and taxable bond funds, and I would think you would be seeing strong flows there and that you\u2019d be okay. ","That\u2019ll be my last question. Why are we seeing out flows in Retail is my last question. You get my point.","","Jim Cracchiolo","Yeah, Eric, I would say last year, we didn\u2019t actually garner as much in the fixed income, because we got really hit particularly in our tax exempt at the beginning part of the year for places like the US Trust business. I think that\u2019s starting to come back. ","As I look at new sales coming in right now, tax-exempt has picked up, fixed income has picked up. We\u2019re selling and focused a lot about selling equity. I think the wholesaling and distribution in the pipeline even institutional has shifted that now to balance that with more fixed income focus. ","So exactly what you said occurred, but we did not have that the way it was for the reasons that I just mentioned to you. So yeah, I think we will continue to gain flows there. But when you gain flows in fixed income or an institutional fixed income, you\u2019ve got different margins than if it\u2019s retail equity.","Operator","I\u2019ll now turn it back to Mr. Cracchiolo for closing remarks.","Jim Cracchiolo","First of all, I appreciate your questions today and also trying to better understand what\u2019s happening underlying the business. I\u2019ll just leave you with this. I think that as you look at our company and you look at the quarter, but put the quarter in light of last year. We had nice improvement in profitability in AWM. We had nice improvement in profitability in Columbia and Asset Management with Threadneedle. ","We have a continued strong and appropriate base for our annuity business. We have managed risk quite well. Our Protection business has come back where we were having some issues with the catastrophic losses in the auto and home and that has recovered. ","We\u2019re continuing and have made stronger investments in the business for future growth. We also have put in place a stronger platform as you mentioned in the total of our Asset Management business.","So I can\u2019t predict by quarter exactly what you\u2019ll see, but what I could say is that we\u2019re building even a stronger foundation that we have all the capability and flexibility to ride out the markets. ","I do believe over time our margins will continue. I believe our earnings will continue to shift. I believe our capital requirements will continue to come down. The fourth quarter didn\u2019t change anything along those lines. The only thing I could probably say is that we probably didn\u2019t think that the volatile market would affect things as much as it has, but I think it did across the industry and I think you can compare it across the industry to see how that is consistent.","So with that in mind, if you have any other questions or comments please call Alicia and Chad and we\u2019ll try to follow-up with you. But I\u2019m just guarding against a continued environment that I can\u2019t predict, and I\u2019m going to continue to make some changes in the company so that we can handle that quite well in the short term. ","If the environment improves; and thinking about the equity markets continue to sort of stabilize and go up, then we\u2019re in great shape. So I\u2019m just guarding against this not being okay. Have a great day, and we\u2019ll talk to further as the weeks go on.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning, and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. Ameriprise achieved significant growth across many dimensions with a strong fourth quarter capping off an excellent year. As you saw, yesterday we reported revenue growth of 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year on an operating basis. Operating earnings per diluted share were up 9% for the quarter and 26% for the year. Our 2 growth businesses performed strongly. Fourth quarter pretax operating earnings in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management were $356 million, up 37% from a year ago. And for the year, we generated $1.3 billion in pretax operating earnings from these 2 businesses, up a very strong 31%. Because of the significant growth we've experienced in these businesses, they now represent 56% of our full year total business segment pretax operating earnings, and we're looking to take that number higher.","This morning, I'd like to cover how I'm feeling about the business, as well as my perspective on the quarter and the year overall. Walter will discuss the numbers in more detail and then we'll take your questions.","There are 4 highlights that I want you to take away. We're seeing good growth and profitability. Our results and progress demonstrate that we're executing our strategy, growing strongly and building off a solid foundation. Activity and assets continued to increase. Assets under management administration hit a record $771 billion. We feel good about our ability to capitalize on our opportunities in the financial services marketplace, and we've demonstrated that we can continue to invest while maintaining excellent expense levels. Our financial foundation remains one of the best in the industry. It provides important strategic flexibility and enables us to generate strong returns. In terms of our level of shareholder and capital return, we're at the higher end of the scale for a large cap financial firm. We have the capital strength, free cash flow and ability to return the majority of our operating earnings to shareholders annually.","During the quarter, we returned $475 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And for the year, we've returned $1.9 billion or 130% of our full year operating earnings. With strong business results in capital return, we delivered another record high operating return on equity, excluding AOCI of 19.7%, setting ourselves apart from many of our competitors.","Let's talk about our segments beginning with Advice & Wealth Management. Advice & Wealth had another terrific quarter. We continue to build on our reputation as the company with the right expertise to help clients feel confident about their retirement and financial future, as well as a place where productive experienced advisors can grow even stronger practices. At the same time, we're delivering excellent financial results. Revenues, earnings, client assets and advisor productivity all grew by double digits. Operating net revenue was up 12% to $1.1 billion reflecting good fundamentals and positive markets. Clients continue to return to the markets and we're bringing in good client flows. Total client assets grew 16% to $409 billion, aided by a record year for our wrap business. Wrap net inflows were up 38% with clients investing another $2.8 billion during the quarter. For the year, we were north of $13 billion of net inflows, which helped grow the platform to more than $153 billion. Our advisors are very engaged and productivity continues to grow nicely. Adjusting for the loss of bank earnings per advisor productivity increased 14% from good asset growth and strong transactional activity, generating a yearly rate of $440,000 per advisor. We continue to effectively manage our overall expense base well. Walter will give you the details, but margin grew, again, even after adjusting for the bank and with lower spread revenues on our large cash business.","Our success in AWM comes in part from the deep relationships we have with clients and the fact that they stay with us a long time. That's the ideal situation. We're focused on delivering a superior client experience and helping our advisors use the capabilities we've invested in to serve more clients and grow their practices. We're focused on deepening relationships as well as bringing in new clients and assets. Our new confident retirement approach, which builds of our financial planning proposition, is proving to be successful in serving existing clients, as well as gaining new ones. Clients and prospects are responding very well and is resulting in higher flows and activity. In fact, we're quite excited to launch, on February 8, our first formal advertising campaign to promote Confident Retirement.","Working with Tommy Lee Jones, the campaign conveys how our advisors are uniquely positioned to help people answer their toughest retirement questions. In fact, you'll see a lot of Ameriprise on major TV programming, including during the Olympics, as well as online through the first half of the year. In conjunction with this campaign, we're also launching an interactive online experience on our website that allows consumers to explore and evaluate how prepared they feel for retirement, see where they stand versus their peers and be directed to an Ameriprise advisor.","In addition to advertising and marketing support, we continue to invest in our online and web experience to ensure that doing business with Ameriprise is simple and easy. Technology clearly plays an essential role in delivering a better experience in driving productivity. With tools like e-Signature, check scanning and e-Paper, advisors can now submit new business online, as we move to a more paperless office over time, one that is both efficient and secure. Our advisors are finding that our technology platform helps them serve clients better, increase efficiency and drive productivity.","In terms of recruiting, we continue to bring in good advisors who value our culture, our leadership and what we do to support advisor growth. 80 experienced advisors came on board in the fourth quarter and the pipeline looks good for the year ahead. Clients and advisors want to work with a reputable trusted firm. I told you last quarter that external research ranked Ameriprise as one of the most trusted financial firms in the industry. Our advisor engagement is strong and growing. Our client retention and satisfaction also remains in excellent stead. We have a great value proposition and in fact, in the 2014 Forrester Customer Experience Index, Ameriprise was rated #1 in customer experience across investment firms.","In summary, It was another terrific quarter and year for AWM. Our brand is strong, our momentum is good. We're focused on ensuring our advisors have the right resources to serve clients well and grow productivity. We're delivering good growth and profitability. We continue to have excellent client and advisor satisfaction and the business is consistently generating the results we expected and we told you we could achieve.","In Asset Management, we're generating strong financial results, executing our strategy and we're focused on becoming a tough tier global asset manager. For the segment, our assets under management reached $501 billion, up 10% from a year ago, from positive equity markets in the U.S. and Europe, as well as good progress we're making in the U.K. and European retail as well as in institutional. We grew our revenues nicely and continue to manage expenses tightly. And for the year, Asset Management earned $715 million, up 28% from the prior year. I'm pleased with the earnings growth and I recognize we have more to do to overcome outflows from our ex-parent relationships.","The story in Asset Management remains consistent with what I've been sharing. We continue to channel resources in areas where we see traction. Overall, we're delivering competitive, long-term investment performance across many areas of equity and fixed income. There are few areas where our short-term performance weakened slightly, but we're addressing it. We're growing our higher fee business, especially in institutional and at Threadneedle, which is showing up in the P&L. And we're making steady progress establishing our global investment teams as Columbia and Threadneedle align resources and strengths to drive profitable flows. In terms of flows, we experienced $5.5 billion of net inflows in the quarter, which included a high level of reinvested dividends at Columbia given the market appreciation last year, and the related gains in many portfolios. At Columbia, our sales were up in the quarter with strong traction in October and November. However, December was challenging for the finance [ph] industry, which we experienced too.","Overall, we're focused on gaining traction in the third party intermediary channel. Our wholesaler productivity is improving and we have an excellent product line to sell. Advisors are learning more about our research strength and core capabilities, including in the income space where we have particular strength. The pieces are in place to gain share on some key distribution platforms and models, and we'll be stepping up our advertising, marketing and due diligence meetings this year.","In terms of net inflows at Threadneedle, we continue to maintain good traction in U.K. and European retail funds. In January, however, we lost part of our U.S. equities team at Threadneedle. A veteran member of the team who has directly managed about 1\/3 of the fund's assets, and who has had strong investment performance has taken over the management of these funds. In institutional, we're pleased with the steady growth we've seen in third-party institutional where we continue to see mandates funding, maintaining a strong win rate and have a good pipeline of new activity. This is helping to offset the legacy outflow pressures I've discussed. Overall in asset management, we're delivering competitive financial results and we're investing in the business. We know there's more work in front of us, but we're moving in a positive direction.","Now let's discuss Annuities and Protection. These businesses are essential components of our value proposition and to bringing in more assets and deeper client relationships. Our Annuities business continues to deliver the results we're targeting. Revenues were up modestly and earnings were up nicely, up 9%. In variable annuities, cash sales increased 3% year-over-year. With continued strength in the equity markets and focused wholesaling efforts, ending account balances are up and sales of managed volatility funds are growing. As we told you last quarter, we've taken steps to further de-risk the portfolio, including providing policyholders with volatility controlled funds. We've seen a good response from advisors and significant asset movement from clients. From a capital perspective, we have set aside capital in excess of our requirements in the events of market movements, particularly for variable annuities.","And in fixed annuities, we feel good about our existing book, but aren't adding to it given the interest rate environment. We're in the process of repricing a good portion of the book that should help release some of the spread compression caused by low rates. This began last quarter with the majority of the block repricing in the first half of 2014.","In Protection, the Life and Health business is performing well with good sales, asset growth and good claims experience. Our advisors offer our products to their clients as part of their confident retirement approach, and we're seeing good growth in life insurance sales, up 16% for the year in 2013.","Indexed universal life sales continue to be strong, and we're also experience improvement in variable universal life sales and steady growth in variable universal life and universal life assets, given the markets we've had. We recently introduced the insurance e-application, which streamlines the new business process for advisors and our back office. It's getting good results. We've also simplified our underwriting for a better client experience. In Auto and Home, premiums were up 10%. We're continuing to see good policy growth across Home, Auto and umbrella lines. We're working to deepen penetration with our affinity partners and with our own advisors. Our client satisfaction and retention remains very high. Walter will provide color on the financials for the Annuities and Protection businesses.","To summarize, we had a strong fourth quarter to wrap up a very good year. Ameriprise is performing well, especially Advice & Wealth Management, which continues to show excellent results. In Asset Management, we're generating solid returns, but we have more work to do to gain flows at Columbia to overcome ex-parent activities. Our Insurance and Annuity businesses are good books of business and complement our total offering. From a company perspective, we continue to be recognized in the industry for the client and advisor experience we provide and for how we run the company. During the quarter, Ameriprise was, once again, named as one of the leading community-minded companies in the nation in the second edition of the Civic 50. We have the same strategic focus for 2014 and I believe we're positioned well for the year ahead. As I mentioned at the start, we delivered record return on equity, and we think we can take it even higher. With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walt for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered excellent financial results this quarter and for the full year. Business fundamentals remained strong, top line growth was solid, expenses were well-managed, and we had strong profitability. Starting with operating net revenue growth on page 3. In total, operating net revenues grew 8%, led by strong growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. If you exclude the impact of low rates, revenues grew by 10%. We had double-digit revenue growth in Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, driven by increases in client assets, good transaction levels and market appreciation, which was partially offset by the impact of net outflows and asset management. Annuities and Insurance posted stable revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations. This growth in revenues has translated into strong earnings and margin expansion. AWM margins increased to 14.4%, up more than 250 basis points from last year. Asset Management margins were 40.2%. Combined, Advice and Wealth Management, and Asset Management's earnings grew 37% from last year and now account for 57% of earnings, representing a substantial progress in shifting our business mix.","Let's turn to earnings on Slide 4. We continue to grow operating return on equity, reaching an all-time high of 19.7%. Operating earnings per share were $1.87, up 9%. The underlying growth rate was over 20%, when we adjust for 2013 and 2012 disclosed unusual items. Performance has been quite strong, especially in light of low interest rate environment, which impacted earnings by $38 million compared to the prior year. Finally, our ability to redeploy capital has contributed to EPS and ROE growth and is a strong point of differentiation for Ameriprise.","Moving to Slide 5. Results for the full year are also strong and are similar to the trends, we saw in the quarter. In 2013, Advice & Wealth Management, and Asset Management, coupled with effective capital management were the prime factors behind our 26% year-over-year EPS growth rate. Earnings in these 2 segments increased over 30%. Excellent growth, considering the headwind from low interest rates and the exit of the bank. Throughout the year, we had solid business fundamentals, including growth in client assets, record wrap net inflows of $13.1 billion, good transaction levels, as well as market appreciation. For the full year, these 2 segments represent 56% of operating earnings.","Annuities and Protection continue to produce solid results with 9% growth rate. These businesses continue to have a strong and differentiated risk profile.","Moving to the segments, let's start with Advice & Wealth Management on Slide 6. We continue to deliver very strong results in Advice & Wealth Management. Pretax operating earnings grew 36% and was supported by revenue growth and effective expense management. We have also seen significant margin expansion, which reached 14.4% in the quarter despite a 100-basis-point headwind driven by the 20-basis-point interest spread impact on our brokerage sweep balances. There is substantial upside when short-term rates move higher. As a point of reference, 100-basis-point increase in short-term rates would increase annual earnings by about $150 million, and add approximately 300 basis points to margins, assuming that cash balance remain at the same level.","Turning to Asset Management on Slide 7. Revenues increased 11%, primarily from market appreciation, offset by the cumulative impact of outflows. Our total expenses were up with the markets. We managed G&A expenses effectively and it was up only 3% from last year. In the quarter, earnings increased 38% to $194 million and adjusted operating margin improved to 40.2% from 33.6%, a year ago, reflecting favorable leverage to rising markets and tight expense management.","Let's turn to flows in more detail on Slide 8. In the quarter, we had a total of $5.5 billion of net inflows, including $6.6 billion of reinvested dividends. This quarter was about $3 billion higher than the same quarter last year because of an increase in the level of realized gains in the equity funds. We had a total of $3.2 billion of outflows in the former parent related and other areas, we've previously discussed. This is in line with our expectation and consists of the following: we had outflows approximately $1.3 billion across retail and institutional, associated with 1 large former parent affiliated distribution partner. As we said, outflows will continue as our share net distribution channel normalizes. At Columbia retail, we had $300 million of outflows at a sub-advisor and $600 million of outflows in the RIA channel. In the Institutional business, we had $1 billion of outflows related to former parent influenced mandates at Columbia. We have areas of real improvement in strength. We had net inflows from the Institutional channel, where we are seeing strong growth in third-party mandates. And finally at Threadneedle, we had another strong quarter with $1.3 billion of retail net inflows.","Turning to Annuities on Slide 9. Pretax operating earnings were $187 million. Variable annuity pretax earnings grew 21% from a year ago, primarily from equity market appreciation and business growth. Our variable annuity business continues to have a high-quality inflows block with good growth and attractive new business. In fact, the risk profile at the block has benefited from the addition of new fund offerings to our in-force policyholders we announced last quarter. These changes have been very well received by advisors and clients. In fact, clients transferred $900 million of assets that were not impacted by fee changes. This resulted in about $26 million benefits to earnings in the quarter related to lower reserves. The managed volatility products require low reserve than the legacy products as the hedging is embedded in the volatility control funds. In fixed annuities, pretax operating earnings were $31 million. Results in the quarter include about $12 million of lower earnings from spread compression. As interest rates increase, we will likely see account value shrink from increased lapses, but the net result will still be positive.","Moving to Protection on Slide 10. Pretax operating earnings were $82 million. Underlying Life and Health business remains solid. We had good sales of variable universal life and index universal life. Claims experience was good and within our expectations, but at a higher level than last year. Auto and Home has continued new policy sales growth across market segments from affinity partnerships. Earnings in the quarter reflected $20 million increase in reserves, primarily from auto liability claims development.","Let's turn to capital on Slide 11. We returned $475 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter, and for the full year, we returned $1.9 billion. As you can see, we have been able to consistently return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders due to our business mix shift, risk management capabilities and strong balance sheet fundamentals. We ended the quarter with continued strong balance sheet fundamentals, nearly $2 billion of excess capital and an RBC ratio of approximately 450%. This does not include the $500 million of additional capital above required levels for variable annuity products. In 2014, our baseline plan is to return 90% to 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, and we expect that our approach to returning capital to shareholders will continue to make Ameriprise unique. With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Question on Asset Management to start. There's a comment in the presentation that indicates that you're increasing your penetration in intermediary platform. I am just wondering if you could provide some more color in terms of what exactly is going on, maybe some metrics that we could you use to track this because it's just hard to see progress when we just look at the assets going forward.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. It's -- as we mentioned to you last year, what we've been doing is stepping up our efforts of getting our product suite into some of the larger platforms out in the industry for the intermediary distribution. Some of the larger wire houses and third-party channels. And so we're seeing -- winning some of the mandates now to get onto their platforms and their model portfolios. That would help us start to actually increase our wholesaling activities in support of that. It does take time, but we're beginning to get considered now for some of the fund groups that we have, particularly in the large-cap areas that are starting to complement our wholesaling activities. So once you get onto the model portfolios given in some of the larger houses, that can help you step up your third party sales activities. And so, we're seeing more of that activity occurring. We are being considered in getting in there and we've stepped up our efforts in that regard. So it's sort of a sort of preview for the idea that we think that we can get increased sales going there. And we saw a rise in sales last year across these channels, I think in the fourth quarter, it was actually pretty good until December and December weakened a bit, and I think the industry saw some of that as well.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So would you say the improvement in sales from these initiative should be more of a 2015 story as opposed to 2014 story?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, I think it will take time to continue to develop, but we would hope to see some improvements through '14 and stronger activities into '15. But again, we're working hard at that. We're stepping up some of our marketing due diligence activities this year in these channels becoming some preferred providers in the channel. So we hope that, that will ramp up over the course of the year, because we believe, we have some good products that would make sense against some of the competitors out there.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Understood. And then just shifting to AWM, I guess, Jim, in your prepared comments, you talked about some increases in advertising spending, I guess, in the couple -- in the coming months. You clearly -- 1 of the stories of success there has been that the G&A has been held kind of flattish, so I guess, I'm just wondering, given these initiatives, should we start to think about G&A picking up as we move through 2014 on these higher expenses related to advertising and the like.","James M. Cracchiolo","No. I think, we're considering -- we're continuing to manage the expense base quite well. I think, what we've alluded to more is that similar to what we did last year, we're launching a new campaign this year, really talking about our confident retirement approach. We probably are putting a little more of that activity that would be web-based in complement to our top line advertising. But the amounts will be relatively consistent with last year. We just heavy up a little bit more in the first 4 months of the year because that's the prime time for us to advertise. And then it starts to go low again and then it picks up again in the fourth quarter. But it should be similar trend lines to what you saw in 2013. We're probably just making a more of a statement around how we're going to be focusing our efforts that we think will help our approach out in the marketplace.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then just the last 1 on the advisor count. Again, you added some experienced advisors, I think, in the quarter. The retention seems to be pretty good in both franchisee and employee channel. But if I look at the overall advisor count, it's down a little bit, maybe call it flattish. So I guess, I'm wondering, at what point, especially with retention improving, should we start to see the advisor count actually start to increase?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. So part of the reduction you see in the total particularly in the employee area was mainly due to -- we have a -- we call it our remote center, our AAC, which handles some of our client activities in centralized sites, and we made a restructuring of those areas. So that we can move to a bit more -- a different type of model that we think will even be more effective and in so doing it, we reduced about 100 people in that channel. And so the activity per employee there was very low. They're not season producers, and that's really the reason for the reduction. But if you look at the productivity that we brought in and the people that we're maintaining with the retention, the productivity of the channel has increased nicely and as I mentioned to you, we brought that channel now into profitability. We're still in the low single digits in margin and that should rise now beginning this year and continue to ramp up over time as the producers we brought on board become more productive. So the headcount that you're looking at was mainly driven by that adjustment, which is really in sort of a remote channel that handled some of our client activities that have moved from our advisor base out in the field to centralized.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, I was hoping you could comment on the retail activity in January and just kind of the near-term hiccup we had with U.S. Macro Data and all the turmoil in EM. Are you guys seeing any difference in terms of the re-engagement levels which, it sounded like it was picking up throughout the course of 2013 and started off pretty well in -- early in '14, but just to want to make sure, if that sort has continued so far.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I -- we don't see any material change. I mean, again it depends on what occurs over the next number of months and what the effect is -- how material. But we see a continuation of a good level of activity. It's hard to judge week to week right now just based on the nature of it. But we haven't seen any material shift.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then a couple specifics, I guess, on the AWM segment. In the press release, and in your comments as well you suggested that the pipeline of FAs continues to be pretty robust. Can you help us kind of with the sources of pipeline and the wire houses, other independent shops, et cetera, and then more importantly, if you look at the productivity, are we looking at 500 per FA, 600 per FA on an annual basis, kind of help us kind of size, I guess, how that compares relative to you guys currently have on the books?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay, so I would say, our pipeline, as we enter the new year, looks really good for us, as a continuation, as we sort of ended the third and fourth quarter. So we see that continuing. We're really recruiting from a number of different sources, so it does include the combination of the wire houses, but also some independents. And we're seeing good people come on board. The productivity we're averaging is now pretty consistent with our total of what you've seen that we've reported, which is in the mid-400 to 500 ranges. And so it's a consistent type of per person that we see into the level of productivity that we have here.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Shifting gears a bit, I want to touch on the Asset Management business and then, specifically, the U.S. team at Threadneedle. Can you guys help us size, I guess, the overall assets that the team collectively has managed, I know you said the new PM there or the PM that is staying managed 1\/3 of it, but can you give us a sense of the total and then maybe split between retail and institutional?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. We roughly have, for that total, about $15 billion and about 5 to 6s in the institutional line is in retail. The person that we have was actually a long-time PM that used to be at Columbia and actually had excellent performance in the mid and large cap value area. She actually had relocated over to London, a number of years ago, for relocation family reasons and she now -- she was part of that team for the last 4 years. She has excellent performance records. In fact, better than the team that left, part of the team that left. And she will be assuming full responsibility for the area. She will also be able to, even more formally, writeoff of a research we have in the U.S. since she is very familiar with it and we have great research capabilities that can really enhance the U.S. stock picking at Threadneedle. And so that the -- our investment offices there are quite excited about that opportunity. So listen, we're going through a change there, but we believe that we'll put in good resources and can continue to manage good money there. There may be some dislocation in the short term, as always occurs, but it's fortunate that we have a strong person there that can lead that team and shown from her past success.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I understood, makes sense, and then just the last one for me. Walter, you highlight a number of buckets in Asset Management that there's still legacy parent-related stuff. And so can you just give us an update again on -- as we think about 2014, kind of look on a quarterly run-rate basis, how much in total assets you guys still expect to see as kind of like gross outflow from these buckets just to kind of help us size the gap that you need to overcome to turn into positive flow mode?","Walter S. Berman","Sure, listen, we certainly still, as we talked about it, have remaining assets at Balboa, which is about $0.5 billion and then certainly in BAC pensions, which is still lower of $2 billion. So again, I can't give it to you on a quarter basis, but we are certainly managing through that within the ranges. Zurich will continue at its levels that we've seen. But certainly, we do see that several billion will be coming in, as Jim has mentioned, and that is -- but, again, we feel, we're making progress, but it\u2019s in that sort of level. I can't give you the quarterly on it.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Erik Bass with Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Within Asset Management, can you just talk a little bit about where you see margins going from here and do you think 40% plus is sustainable? And I guess as further improvement contingent on either AUM leverage from the market or improved flows. Are there other steps you can continue to take to improve margins?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, clearly, from our standpoint on managing the expenses and certainly, with the market and with looking at the asset levels, we just mentioned with -- I would do believe in that range is sustainable, and certainly looking as Jim said before, to even try and improve it. So I think it's a reasonable level to be at certainly in this high 30s, 40% range.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just for Columbia Institutional, obviously is a good quarter for flows here and it looks like, you've seen a nice pickup in terms of sales over the past year. Do you believe that this business is now at a point that it should be able to generate consistent positive inflows and maybe if you could talk just a little bit more about what is driving the pickup in sales?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, I would say, we're seeing good traction in a number of areas. Like we've said in the institutional, we've got good traction in Europe. I think, we're going to start to actually garner some greater flows from some global activities that we have started to work on and some of the products that we're putting into the market over time. And the U.S. activity, we see sales increasing and what we have to do is manage over some of the combination of the ex-parent books of business that we had, as well as just some of the spottiness from some of the things that we're continuing to be in redemption mode. So I don't want to sit and predict that we're going to be in net inflows as we go forward, but I would say that we're gaining traction. I do believe that it's going to be a bit lumpy. But I feel that we have some good product, that we are stepping up levels of activity in certain areas. But I think, as you just asked regarding the margins, et cetera, we feel like we have a good profitable business that we're able to make good investments. But it's -- this is a very competitive field and it's blocking and tackling everyday and that's what we need to do this year.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials available on our website.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2014 Annual Report to shareholders, and our 2014 10-K report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward looking statements.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello everyone, and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. This morning, I'll provide my perspective on the quarter and the progress we're making in the business. And Walter will follow to discuss our financials.","The company is performing well in a more challenging market environment. We're delivering meaningful results across a number of dimensions to mark a good second quarter and an overall first half of the year. However, we still have work to do in a few areas that I'll discuss. As you know, equity market volatility did pick up in the quarter. The strong dollar has also been a headwind in terms of foreign exchange translation and asset management, and we have the ongoing pressure of low interest rates. We also had the benefit of the long term care reserve release. However, this was offset by higher weather-related impacts in Auto & Home, which Walter will address.","Revenue growth in the quarter reflected a more volatile market environment, but we remain very much focused on executing our growth plans and managing expenses as we continue to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. We're consistently generating good free cash flow, growing earnings, and returning to shareholders at a significant level, while maintaining our excellent capital position.","For the quarter, operating earnings per share increased 12% compared to last year. Excluding certain items, EPS increased 15%. In terms of return on equity, an important measure for us, we continue to deliver at a differentiated level. ROE increased to 23.5%. This is up 180 basis points from last year and marks another record high. Assets under management and administration were up slightly to $811 billion, as asset growth was offset by the unfavorable foreign exchange translation of $12 billion. Overall, we're growing our fee-based earnings, driving the ongoing shift in our business mix.","Let's move to the business segments. In Advice & Wealth Management, we're continuing to generate good earnings with strong margin. Client flows were very strong, and asset levels hit a record high at more than $450 billion, up over $18 billion over last year. We're generating good inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts, with inflows of over $3 billion, up 9% in the quarter.","Our investment advisory platform is one of the largest in the industry, and a consistent growth driver for Ameriprise. We continue to get good uptake from our advisor capabilities we're investing in, such as our eFile Delivery and our Money Movement System. These capabilities help advisors share information more easily and process business faster. It's freeing up their time to focus on serving their existing clients more comprehensively. This was one of our best quarters for recruiting. We're bringing in more productive advisors in a very competitive marketplace, with 93 new experienced advisors joining the firm in the second quarter, with strong average productivity per recruit across both channels. And our ongoing pipeline also looks strong.","As we've shared previously, we continue to seek to serve more of the mass affluent and affluent markets and we see opportunity in two areas: people that are accumulating assets as well as those who are transitioning to retirement. Our Confident Retirement approach generates higher satisfaction, deeper relationships, more assets, and higher referral rates. In fact, for the affluent, satisfaction rates we're earning with clients served through Confident Retirement are some of the highest I've seen. Based on the results we've seen, there is more we can achieve as more of our advisors begin to adopt a simplified and engaging approach.","Now we're expanding Confident Retirement for wealth builders, people who are in the accumulation phase. This expanded approach has proven effective in our initial consumer research as well as with our advisor palette we tested in the quarter, leading to nice lifts in both productivity and flows. We plan to roll it out nationally to our entire field force beginning in the fall and through next year.","Also in the fall, we're kicking off a new brand and advertising platform, and we're shooting the ads for it this week, and will be working closely with advisors to take advantage of the campaign in their local markets. I feel good about its potential to engage our advisors, clients, and prospects in continuing to tell our story as well as demonstrate the benefits of working with Ameriprise.","We're also enhancing our digital presence in the Ameriprise website, incorporating responsive design to make it easier for consumers to access their information from multiple types of devices. As a result of these and other efforts, our advisors continue to grow productivity, which increased 9% year-over-year to a new record of $512,000 over a 12-month basis. Overall, we're delivering nice growth and profitability across the business with strong opportunity for further growth.","In regard to Annuities and Protection, year-over-year operating earnings were down in these businesses, but there are a number of items from both the current and previous quarter that Walter will discuss. In terms of Annuities, variable annuity account balances were relatively flat, but that was largely due to outflows in our closed book. Within Ameriprise, we had good sales growth up nearly 10% from a year ago, and we're seeing nice traction from the introduction of two new living benefit riders in the quarter.","We also continued to see strong adoption of variable annuities without living benefits, reflecting good wholesaling activity and a positive reaction to helping clients and advisors understand the advantages these products can provide. This has contributed to a good and moderate shift in the mix of variable sales products without guarantees. Sales of VAs without living benefits represented about a third of total VA sales in the quarter. There's essentially no change in fixed annuities given the current rate environment.","In Protection, we continue to work with our advisors on the benefits and insurance for our clients. Life & Healthcare sales were up 10% from a year ago with continued strength in Indexed UL. And our overall client retention in these solutions remained high. This helps enhance the long-term nature of the Ameriprise client-advisor relationship. We're simplifying marketing and sales materials, processing new business more efficiently and enhancing our digital capabilities. We also refreshed our disability income insurance product line in the quarter, as this remains an important feature of a comprehensive financial plan. These enhancements should begin to show in the third quarter.","In Auto & Home this quarter, we were particularly impacted by the storms that were more severe than usual in the central part of the country. In regard to the overall business, Auto & Home has a good client base with good distribution that garners a very high client satisfaction and retention. As we discussed with you, we have a number of actions on the way to address some increased developments we've experienced. This includes adjusting pricing, tightening underwriting, as well as improving claims management in certain areas across the book. The steps we're taking should get us back on track to the level of performance and return we previously delivered. It will take time as our initiatives work through the book. We expect to see good benefits in 2016 and beyond.","Now let's move to Asset Management, where we have a strong foundation of assets and are generating solid earnings and competitive margin. Assets under management were down slightly from a year ago, but that was largely driven by the foreign exchange translation. We're executing our strategy while investing in the business and being diligent about expenses. We're generating strong investment performance versus benchmarks and peers.","In the U.S., we continue to generate strong equity performance in short as well as longer-term time frames, particularly in large cap, core growth, and quantitative products. In addition, our small and mid-cap growth products continue to improve in the short term. Taxable fixed income performance has performed in line with our risk profile. Tax exempt performance remained strong. While the Acorn Fund is still underperforming over the medium-term, its performance has improved versus both against benchmark and peers in the short-term.","In EMEA, we continue to generate good short and longer term track records, especially in equities. While UK performance has been somewhat mixed recently, longer term performance remains strong. Both U.S. and European equity performances continue to improve and longer term track records are quite strong. In Asia, all of our locally-managed funds now have one-year track records and, in each case, are beating their benchmarks and peers.","Let me highlight some other things we're focused on, starting with retail. In the U.S., retail gross sales are up almost 10% from last year. We're adding to our leadership talent and distribution, marketing, and product, and we'll soon announce our new national sales manager that will compliment the leadership changes that we've made over the last few quarters.","Wholesaling focus is improving. We're strengthening our product training and better aligned our sales strategy. And we're investing in our marketing and advertising to reflect new Columbia Threadneedle Investments' go-to-market strategy. Our plan is to be in the market later this year with new creative.","While these actions are beginning to take hold, there's still more work to do. In the quarter, retail outflows were elevated in the Acorn Fund, which lost a large DCIO client. However, we're very focused on improving Acorn's performance. We're managing the planned leadership transition and increased concentration of our top holdings, returning the investment process to its roots and strong legacy.","In the UK and Europe, we're generating good retail growth sales and had net inflows of about $800 million in the quarter. We also have a very good UK property business with assets of about $13 billion that provide a meaningful contribution. In addition, at U.S. Trust, we experienced a level of outflows consistent with prior quarter. We've renewed our relationship with U.S. Trust, which remains strong. Over the next quarter or two, we expect outflows in some low-margin fixed income portfolios that U.S. Trust will take in-house.","In institutional, other former parent related outflows included a larger than usual outflow in low-fee Zurich assets, due to the sale of an annuity block. The underlying run rate of outflows have returned to normal levels as we serviced this closed block. That said, we're driving growth in our higher fee third-party business, including more than $900 million of net inflows in the quarter, as nearly all the mandate wins we expected to see in the first quarter funded in the second.","Client service, consultant relations, and sales are managed globally now, which has enhanced our support and ensures that sales teams offer our full portfolio of strategies. Our institutional sales pipeline is healthy and we have a good pool of high potential sales. We expect that over time, third-party Institutional will become an even larger component of the business. This includes the solution space where we're continuing to build out our capabilities and investing in our infrastructure and sales efforts to support longer-term growth.","More work remains to be done in Asset Management, but we're making progress on a number of fronts and believe we can continue to gain traction in key areas. We will still experience one-off impacts and legacy flow dynamics, and like the industry, we continue to deal with current market and geopolitical conditions. Our focus remains on improving our overall flows, as we continue to deliver competitive financials and look to earn share across key markets.","Now, let me turn to an issue that we're all focused on, the Department of Labor's fiduciary proposal. We support the DOL's objective in ensuring that investors, particularly those saving for retirement, receive advice that's in their best interest. The industry has supported a uniform fiduciary standard for years. Ameriprise has long served clients and served them well under a fiduciary standard. We believe that our track record and the high client satisfaction rates we consistently earn demonstrate that we have a beneficial business model for the delivery of advice.","We take the DOL seriously when they say that they intend to preserve beneficial business models for the delivery of advice. However, we think the DOL's proposal as currently drafted could have some significant, unintended negative consequences. We have submitted our recommendations and are supportive of the comments from the major trade associations, other member firms, and FINRA. These provide vital perspective on the broad range of issues that must be addressed and are responsive to the DOL's request to help them get it right.","Importantly, just in the last few days, the DOL has said that they will make significant changes to the proposal. We hope that that means that the concerns raised by many stakeholders in comment letters are being heard and will be addressed. Given they intend to make changes, all stakeholders should wait to see how the comments to the DOL are addressed before making definitive conclusions.","We've dealt with regulatory changes before and we will work with our trade associations and other stakeholders throughout this process to advocate for our clients with a goal of most appropriately satisfying the DOL's objectives. We continue to believe that Ameriprise is situated well and has the ability to respond to appropriate requirements to satisfy the DOL's objectives.","In closing, as I look at the company overall, we've been able to consistently generate good growth in EPS and strong ROE. We have a good combination of businesses and people to continue to execute the strategy we have in place. And I feel good about our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow with our mix of businesses as well as to navigate the market and consistently return to shareholders as we have. Our capital management remains a real strength. We recently increased our quarterly dividend and also increased our buyback in the quarter, as we saw more dislocation in the stock.","With that, I would like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Jim. As Jim indicated, Ameriprise delivered another solid quarter of financial results in the face of a fairly volatile market. Operating net revenues was $3 billion, up 2% from last year. Revenue growth was muted by the impact of a CLO liquidation in the prior year, as well as an unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Without these items, underlying revenue growth was 4%. Operating EPS was $2.33, up 12% from last year. However, it was impacted by several one-time items that we announced last week, specifically elevated CAT losses in Auto & Home, a reserve release in long term care, and an unfavorable mean reversion. Excluding these one-time items, operating EPS was $2.38, up 15%. And the operating return on equity reached a new record level of 23.5%, which is above our targeted range of 19% to 23%.","Turning to slide four, you'll see that our business mix shift continues to evolve. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management represented 65% of pre-tax operating earnings this quarter, fueled by strong growth in AWM. As we grow, we expect the mix shift will continue towards an intermediate 70%-plus target.","Turning to segment performance starting with AWM on slide five. The Advice & Wealth Management business is performing well across key growth and activity metrics, and delivered solid financial results, particularly given the market volatility. Revenue was up 6% to $1.3 billion, largely driven by an $18 billion increase in assets. While total expenses increased 5% year-over-year, it was driven by higher distribution expense. We kept G&A expenses essentially flat year-over-year, while still investing in key business growth initiatives, including more productive experienced advisor recruits, advisory platform product expansion, and investments to improve the ease of doing business for advisors and clients. This resulted in earnings of $220 million, up 13%, and a record margin of 17.3%, up 110 basis points from last year.","Let's look a bit more closely at the drivers of AWM's profitability improvement on slide six. We continued to generate good growth in advisor productivity, which reached a record level of $512,000, up 9% compared to last year. Productivity improved nicely in the franchise channel, which reached $532,000, up 8%, and we saw more substantial growth in the employee channel, where productivity increased to $433,000, up 12% from last year. Improved advisor productivity along with strong experienced advisor recruiting and expense discipline continues to support strong margin expansion. Margins have grown 350 basis points since 2013, when we established our 20%-plus margin opportunity.","Looking at it by channel, margins in the more established franchise channel are now 18%. Margins in the employee channel were almost 12% this quarter and continue to expand nicely. Over time, we intend to drive employee channel margin expansion, and they should approach the level of the franchise channel. We remain focused on driving improved profitability through continued productivity improvements, as well as recruiting and retaining advisors. In addition, we see the opportunity for margin expansion when short rates rise. We have approximately $20 billion in client cash sweep accounts earning about 22 basis points. Since we have not benefited from short rates yet, we would expect a substantial margin lift when the Fed funds rate increases. Together these growth dynamics demonstrate the strength of our model, success of strategies to grow this business, and the opportunity we have to drive profitability even higher.","Our strong performance on the absolute basis is matched by our strong relative performance as you'll see on slide seven. Our AWM segment revenues are almost $1.3 billion, which is a 9% CAGR over the past two years. Over that same time period, our margins have expanded 340 basis points, substantially surpassing the margin expansion of peers. We believe our growth has been quite competitive on a relative basis, including relative to other large wire houses and online brokers that benefited from banking and market-making activities.","Asset Management continues to provide a solid contribution to Ameriprise's revenue and earnings as you'll see on slide eight. Operating net revenues declined 1% to $832 million. However, the year-over-year comparison is distorted by the timing of the COL (sic) [CLO] (21:45) liquidation of $23 million in the prior year, and an unfavorable $17 million impact from foreign exchange translation in the current quarter. Adjusting for these items, underlying revenue growth was about 3%.","Pre-tax operating earnings were down 1% to $197 million. Again, adjusting for the timing of a $17 million CLO liquidation in the prior year, and an unfavorable $6 million impact for foreign exchange translation, underlying earnings were up approximately 12%. Expenses continue to be tightly managed, and we were essentially flat, adjusting for the items I just described. We remain focused on maintaining profitability and margins at the current level, while investing in growth initiatives to improve flows.","Turning to Annuities on slide nine. Annuities pre-tax operating earnings were $150 million, down 12% from last year. However, the prior-year results included several items distorting the year-over-year comparison. Adjusting for these items, earnings increased 6%. Underlying variable annuity pre-tax earnings grew 7% from a year ago to $123 million, when we adjust for the year-over-year impact of clients moving to managed volatility funds and mean reversion. While the move of clients to managed volatility funds drove a significant initial earnings benefit last year, it also improved the risk profile of the block. Underlying earnings growth was driven by higher account values of variable annuities sold through our own advisor channel and the runoff of the closed block distributed through third-parties.","Fixed annuity pre-tax operating earnings was flat at $30 million, as the benefit of repricing the block was offset by elevated lapses. Lapse rates are in line with our expectations given the current interest environment. There are limited new sales and, as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off, and earnings will slowly decline.","Turning to the Protection segment on next two slides. Protection pre-tax operating earnings were $72 million in the quarter, impacted by $48 million of CAT losses in Auto & Home, and an $18 million reserve release related to our long term care disabled life reserve, both of which were previously disclosed. Let's focus on the Life & Health business first. Underlying Life & Health pre-tax operating earnings were impacted by higher claims activity and a lower interest rate environment. On the claims side, life claims were elevated in the quarter and slightly higher than expected. While disability claims were still quite good in the quarter, they were higher than a very favorable experience in the prior year.","I would like to take a few minutes to discuss the long time care disabled life reserve review that we conducted in the quarter. As you are aware, we announced $32 million reserve increase in the first quarter, following a review of our claims reserve based upon information we received from Genworth. After reviewing the documents we received from Genworth, we decided to engage a third-party consultant to validate their analysis. This additional review identified that actual claims and termination experience for our block was more favorable than the information Genworth initially indicated. As such, we released $18 million of claims reserve that had been booked in the first quarter. We are working with Genworth to improve the accuracy of the data provided and enhance the processes associated with setting the claims reserves.","The reserve review conducted over the past couple of quarters is related to claims reserves only, since we used data from Genworth to set that reserve. The adequacy of the active life reserve is determined using our own data and is reviewed regularly. As part of our annual unlocking process, we will evaluate all of the non-equity market assumption across our life, LTC, and annuity products in the third quarter.","Let's turn to Auto & Home on slide 11. The Auto & Home business had an operating loss in the quarter, which was clearly impacted by the significant level of CAT losses. We planned for $23 million of CAT losses, but actual CAT losses came in at $48 million. This was driven by higher exposure to the central part of the country that experienced an elevated level of severe weather in the quarter.","Underlying Auto & Home results reflect the current year loss ratio provision. As you recall, we are booking reserves for the 2015 accident year at a level consistent with the 2014 accident year loss ratio assumption we changed in the fourth quarter. As we discussed last quarter, we are continuing to phase in changes to our pricing to risk models, enhance claims and underwriting processes, and improve operations. We are seeing clear indications that the changes we are making are working. There has been a slowdown in new policy sales across product lines with the most material decline in auto. We are on target to achieve marginal profitability for Auto & Home, excluding excess CAT losses in 2015 with a more meaningful improvement to earnings in 2016.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on slide 12. Our balance sheet fundamentals are strong. We have approximately $2.5 billion of excess capital. Our risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be approximately 560%. Our hedge program is effective, and our investment portfolio is well-diversified. Our business mix shift is continuing to generate strong free cash flow, allowing us to return a substantial amount to shareholders. Given the share price in the quarter and our current valuation, we accelerated the level of share repurchase. We returned $549 million to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, which is our highest quarterly level. This equates to over 125% of operating earnings. As always, we will continue to monitor both the macro environment and our relative valuation, and look to bring down our excess capital over time.","In summary, Ameriprise delivered another good quarter of financial results. Our growth engine remains the AWM business, where strong fundamentals will continue to drive margin expansion. In Asset Management, we are maintaining competitor profitability and our business initiatives are focused on improving flows. The Annuity business is delivering sound growth with an improved risk profile. Life & Health earnings remain solid and we're taking the necessary steps to improve the financial performance of the Auto & Home business going forward. Our business mix transition to higher growth, higher fee businesses is ongoing and generates strong free cash flow. And all of this rests on a solid balance sheet and enterprise risk management framework, and is clearly driving shareholder value.","With that, I will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. My first one is around Advice & Wealth Management. You saw net revenues continue to grow pretty nicely, roughly in line with the growth in productivity. I guess I'm curious, Jim, whether you saw any significant change in the underlying mix of the sales by product? And I know, for example, last quarter, you saw a fairly late contribution from Annuity sales. And I'm assuming that picked up this quarter with the overall VA sales growth.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that's correct. What we have seen is, again, strong take-up, again in our fee-based wrap businesses. We've seen an increase in our sales on the guaranteed, on the annuities side. Things like various transactional business and brokerage, such as REITs, are very low. It represents about \u2013 less than 1%, around 1% of our sales activity. So, it is really, again, sort of the core products and services that we have offered. We have seen a good flow improvement and good activity across our network.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. And then anything this quarter that you'd characterize as a \u2013 sort of, a noticeable early impact from advisors, maybe, shifting some business in response to the DOL proposal, recognizing it is only a proposal?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not at all. In fact, our advisors feel very good about what they do for the consumer, whether in qualified or non-qualified. We've had a pretty consistent mix. We get unbelievable satisfaction levels from our clients and they are really very comfortable and happy with \u2013 achieving their retirement goals, if it's in their \u2013 against their retirement needs. So, in fact, we think we're well-situated based on the business that we do. And again, the products that we sell in are needs-based. So, at the end of the day, I think we're doing what we need to do appropriately, consistent with both the regulatory, but more importantly, from a client need and disclosure perspective.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you. And then I just have two real quick ones in Asset Management. G&A seemed a bit higher than, I guess, I would have expected. It's not that significant, maybe it's about $5 million or so. Just curious whether we should think about the $345 million of G&A in the quarter as a run rate, or if there was anything unusual there in the second quarter?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I think the only unusual is, as Jim mentioned, I think, we launched our brand. And, certainly, we had the expense in there, but we believe the expenses will just be on its normal run rate.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, and we did the relocation of the Threadneedle premises in London. So, we had some additional expense there, so.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And then on the fee rate, it looks like you're starting to really see some upward momentum there. I guess I'm curious, based on what you're seeing in the underlying mix shift. I know you said some of the legacy outflows, maybe were elevated this quarter and maybe that had some impact. But how much further do you think that fee rate can go, let's say, over the next couple of years, based on sort of an underlying mix shift there, Jim?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we had a little uptick in some of the fees from the performance fees in the quarter, which, you know, are not \u2013 doesn't happen on an equal basis every quarter, but there, I think there is a little more on the performance fee basis there.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I do believe, as you said, some of the legacy lower fee coming out, and over time, I think, as we build a bit more on the institutional through third-party or some of the solutions, will be higher. Unfortunately, the Acorn was a little higher fee that we lost on the retail side. So if we can stem that and continue to get some growth in the sales as we saw in the other retail channels like international and even domestic, I think we can offset that and start to add. But I would just say the bit of increase I think you saw was just a little lumpy from some of the performance fees.","John M. Nadel - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful. Thanks a lot, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to start with the capital deployment. So could you maybe explain a little more the rationale behind the elevated buybacks this quarter compared to I think a very consistent $350 million quarterly run rate the last three years? And can we extrapolate from that, or think of an elevated new run rate going forward?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's Walter. Again, as we've always indicated that we have the capacity and we will evaluate both the environment and our valuation, and we felt in this quarter that it was warranted to take that up. We did take it up $75 million. We will continue to evaluate that. We certainly have the capacity to do that. And I think at this stage, we're going to be opportunistic as we look into for the remainder of the year.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then in Advice & Wealth Management, the recruiting efforts clearly were quite strong, and then you say the pipeline remains strong as well. Do you see any impact from the DOL proposal there? Do you see that impacting your recruiting capabilities?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think one of the things, again \u2013 the DOL will \u2013 once we exactly know what finally they come out with, we'll understand some of the implications. But we're probably situated very well in the type of business that we do, how we work with clients. We operate under a fiduciary standard across our network today. We have very strong compliance structures and it's one of the benefits of people coming to us. They like how we handle our centralized compliance, our disclosures, et cetera. We have a very strong client value proposition. And so we've seen a very strong, good pipeline of highly productive people both in our employee and franchisee channel.","The pipeline remains strong. So, no, we feel pretty good about it. Again, we're not \u2013 I think we're in good shape relative to the industry in general. I don't see any differences between us or the industry when you look at it from a DOL. In fact, I think we're very well prepared because we have a very strong advisory relationship around our financial planning activities today and our retirement value proposition.","So, again, we don't know exactly where the final regulation will come out, but I think you can see very strong responses out there from the industry, from the associations, even the regulators like FINRA. I just saw a note going out from the SEC Governor. I mean, so there are a lot of responses out there that hopefully the DOL would understand what they need to accomplish. We're very supportive of that objective. We think we can satisfy that objective very well. But, again, it's the way they go about doing it I think is where the rub is.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And a quick final question, if I could, also on the AWM segment. So I think you mentioned in the script that you're expanding into clients in the accumulation phase. And would that mean that we should expect some maybe offsetting productivity pressure coming on the revenue per head just because you are now targeting individuals that are probably not quite at the same level of net worth that the existing base is?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, not at all. In fact, I think it'd actually be a great complement. What we are doing, we're rolling out to our advisors right now, we've done a lot of work and research, both a combination of our brand, our value proposition, our Confident Retirement approach, Confident Retirement accumulation approach. We've built our \u2013 our heritage is based on accumulation for retirement, so I actually believe that we can serve the higher end of the mass affluent, and the affluent quite well and those really accumulating for retirement, the generation X coming up, et cetera. So it's really getting our advisors a little more focused on going back to that opportunity and combination, and it's really against the upper market here. So I actually think it will be a good opportunity for us and complement to what we do, and longer term to build long-term relationships as we have in the past.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much for taking my questions again.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Good morning. Thank you. Question for you, guys, again on margins in the AWM. So clearly, really nice trajectory, nice expansion so far. As we look out and kind of thinking of the current environment stage, sort of, what it's been for the last kind of six months, maybe a little bit more a range bound market, how quickly do you think you'll be able to get that 17% margin that you have, the 17.3%, slightly higher which I guess, you guys are targeting closer to 18%, assuming no higher interest rates?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, Alex, I think as we said, I mean, we moved the needle pretty well and pretty fast over the last number of years, going first at our 12% target, then to 15%, now we're in the 17% and change rate here. So I think if we continue to \u2013 just continue to execute, help our advisors just continue to drive their productivity and get our asset flow as we continue to focus our business even more on moving our center to a bit more on the affluent space, uptaking some of the tools and capabilities we're putting in place, we're coming in with a new branding approach at the end of the year. We have a new wealth builder approach for accumulators. So we're recruiting pretty well. The people we're bringing in are higher productivity. We're attracting a good number of people in the higher end.","So I think we're doing the things. What that means quarter-to-quarter, I can't tell you, and I can't dictate sort of the market dynamics of just \u2013 but I think that in combination, we know at hopefully one point this year, the Fed is going to start to rise. Remember, we don't have contracts that are rolling off as some others where they're locked in. We're actually at a low point, so any benefit there goes right to the bottom line for us as well.","So I think we're situated well, and I think we're going to continue to work against that. We don't necessarily just focus on a margin improvement; we focus on a strength and growth in the entire channel that leads to that margin.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Alex, it's Walter. I'll just add, if I could. As we talked about it, the employee channel certainly has been one that has demonstrated an improvement in its margin, and again, as we bring on years, and certainly a higher productive years, and they start building up productivity, they're making a greater contribution to the fixed, and that will also continue to go. So I think there's a lot of things in play that will continue. Again, you can't just predict quarter-to-quarter, as Jim said.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right, understood. Thanks. And I guess, shifting gears a little bit on the Asset Management business, can you just give us a since on the low margin fixed-income portfolio that you're saying U.S. Trust has been sourcing. And just from a modeling perspective, help us understand how much it is and what's kind of the fee rate on that business. And then, Jim, you highlighted continued strength in the institutional pipeline. It would be helpful to kind of get us a sense at least directionally where that stands maybe relative to last quarter as we think about the kind of Columbia Institutional flows ahead.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I don't know the exact number at U.S. Trust, but we're probably $1.2 billion or something like that. I'm not exactly positive. But it's more of some separate accounts, their lower fee. For us, it's not, though, they are a higher-margin business at all. But, again, it's something that makes sense for U.S. Trust as what they're doing. It's not a major to us, but I just figured, I noted it, because we sometimes look at the flow number rather than necessarily the revenue.","From a perspective on institutional, it's quite strong. The pipeline's quite strong. The fee rate is quite good. We're getting mandates both domestically as well as internationally. Europe is picking up. We think there is good opportunity for us, as we continue to look out. And again, we don't know exactly when those things go, and when they eventually even if you win them fund only because people are looking at the market situation, the geopolitical interest rates. But having said that, I think we got a wide range of good pipeline there that we're competing with, and hopefully that will continue to show some strength.","Alexander V. Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. First question on DOL. So, you have had three months or so since that proposal has come out, and I recognize it's still fluid and there might be changes, but just curious if you've done an internal analysis to assess, kind of, the range of potential impacts that you think this might have on your business? That's my first question. I realize you haven't disclosed anything publicly, but have you done something internally yet, in a fairly comprehensive way, to assess potential impact? That's my first question.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think as \u2013 we, as a business look at it, as many have, you don't have clarity yet of what the regulation is. There's an exemption that people say, yes, you can definitely sell an annuity, et cetera. And then some would say, well, maybe you can't. So, at the end of the day, it really depends on how you interpret that. It's not as clear. What I could say to you is this \u2013 and this is one, maybe, that would be helpful in you analyzing it. We are a business that serves our clients for all of their life needs, including retirement. So, roughly 50% of our assets in qualified, similar to others in this industry. In that regard, we have a majority of what we do in investment business in the qualified through advisory fees.","We're one of the biggest and best-growing in the industry against that and we have strong platform capability to continue to drive that, if that's where the world goes appropriately. But we do look at the needs of our client. We do put them in the product that's appropriate to them, and that's what we're asking the DOL to make sure that they look at the best interest of the client. And best interest may not necessarily be what they think at the upset. And you can see that from many firms in their comment letters, including, whether it's FINRA, the SEC, you can look at it from the associations, you can even look at it from even major brokerage and even investment firms, including those in ETFs that have made the similar statements. So, I think, at the end of the day, that's what we're saying.","But, from a mix perspective, same thing with annuities, most of our business is in guarantees, which the Treasury Department said is important. If you looked what that would have done to the consumer not having those products in the last downturn, it was significant. But we're no different than the entire insurance industry, annuity providers selling annuities and the percentage we have in qualified is similar. So, we're not an outlier in any of those things. Now, how is this interpreted across the industry? I think all of us can come to a little different equation on that. But, I don't think anyone knows for sure. So that's what we're saying. And if we just quantify things based on how we interpret versus how others interpret, I've looked at what others said, whether that's correct or not, I don't know.","So I think that's what we're saying is until we know more, until you know more, until we know after this comment period and after what the FCC comes out with, but once that happens, we'll be very clear of what that means and how we can respond to it. I would just say that we have very strong capability here. We serve our clients well. We have an unbelievable level of disclosure and compliance today. We know how to serve people with the best interest and across our entire network of advisors. And so we'll be able to respond. Hopefully, it will be against what the DOL truly wants as their objective that would make it efficient and appropriate for us to do that, so we can serve even the smaller consumer.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","That's helpful, Jim. And then, I guess, just a follow-up on that. Yeah, and I hear what you are saying, in terms of there is a fair amount of latitude and discretion you can probably use to interpret the context of the proposal at this point, so it would probably be pretty hard to quantify. So, let me ask it in a slightly different way. If you had to look at some of the areas or issues out there, do you legitimately see this being a bigger issue for \u2013 we'll say, revenue momentum in the Advice & Wealth business, fee pressure in the Asset Management business, or just the overall cost associated with the implementation of this? If you look at those three areas, what would...","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it would be \u2013 let me give an example. I mean, if, let's say, one product becomes more difficult to sell, you're going to over time switch that to other products or services that make appropriate sense for the client and do that orchestration, so from a revenue longer term, I'm not sure that's \u2013 there may be some period, because you're trying to figure out what that is, and how to actually do that and put that in place. But even there, it depends on the lead time that is provided in this. And again, that's another issue.","I don't think based on what they want done, that lead time is at all reasonable for many providers. And we're probably one of the best that have the technology capability and clients' capability, et cetera, to do it as quick as anyone. So I would just say that's one aspect you got to take in account. The second aspect I think you take into account is, the change in what's required in there. And again, based on what was originally spent, you're talking about extensive changes that would be required from a client, a disclosure, a change in what they're looking at, a level of information, down to account holder.","I mean, so all of that provided, it's a little mind-boggling. I mean, you're seeing some of the quotes across some consultants said to that (50:26). So again it's hard to jump at any of that and say that's ultimately what will come out. I think the biggest issue more than anything that would be confusing to a player like us is this: how does that align with the regulations already in place? Will the SEC change what they're require and how to think about it? I mean, there's a lot of case law behind this. There's a lot of regulations built over very informed information over decades that people follow in this industry, not just for Ameriprise, but every broker-dealer, every investment firm, every product company selling their products.","And so all of those things or it's the level of complexity that we say, what's the unintended consequence? So, again, that's why I'm not sitting here overreacting to it. I think it has to get sorted out, it has to be rational, it has to be ability to serve the client. Remember, there's 100 million-plus U.S. retail consumers saving for retirement. And so, again, as I said, I think Ameriprise is well situated. I think we have a great value proposition. Yes, any change, you always have to look at how you respond to it, but hopefully this will get very rational, because we're probably one of the first firms to say we want to serve clients in the best interest. And we do that today.","So I can't answer your question yet. I wish I could. And I know it's what you're all saying as one of the implications for us, but I would just say if you look at the financial services industry, you look at a retail investment firm like us, and you look at product companies, we are situated as well as anyone.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","No, that's good perspective. I appreciate it. Just one last question, just on, Walter, you'd mentioned you're preparing for your annual review of FAS 60 and FAS 97 products and I guess you do that every third quarter. My specific question is long term care, I know you did the claims review. Can you comment on active life, whether that's a risk of a reserve charge? I think you've been losing a little bit of money, or roughly breakeven, a small loss every quarter on an operating basis. Should we be looking at that as a potential risk here?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think we're looking at \u2013 specifically, we want to go to long term care. We're looking at all of the products annuity and other products. And as we evaluate it there are a lot of positive elements within it as we look at different factors. Certainly, one of them as you're aware is the interest rate, which will be part of the evaluation. We've made no judgments at this stage, certainly where we thought the interest rates would be at this time last year is certainly lower, and we will evaluate all those factors. But nothing pops out from the standpoint that we are concerned about other than just looking at where the interest rates are at this stage, all the other behavioral aspects, certainly our price increases, other things, we're very confident that's what the actuaries are doing right now.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, good morning. I just want to go to Auto & Home for a second. Just given the consolidation in the property casualty industry as well as your comments about the turnaround maybe taking some time, have you given any more thought to a more, I guess, a sooner exit of that business?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Suneet, as we look at \u2013 so let me start with this. I do believe that what we are able to do with the business, because the business is quite strong. We've had the business, evaluated its model. It has one of the best distribution-type platforms. It's one of the lowest-cost providers in the industry, et cetera. It has one of the highest customer satisfaction. In fact, it was rated second from the big rating company that usually you hear about, but you can't just necessarily talk about.","So I would just say there are tremendous attributes we already have. So it's not a problem for us to grow what other people have. It's more of we had to put in place a bit enhancements on some of the areas that have changed a little bit in the industry. We're tightening a little underwriting, adjusting pricing, a little more sophistication around that. Getting a little more, what we would call, expedited on some of our claims, adding some resources there, rather than relying on third-party. So there are a number of things that we're doing that are well-known that the industry and we can do. And we have the right resources that we've put in place to get that done. So we actually feel very good about our ability and that this will add to nice earnings next year and the year after, even more substantially. So I think that would be a positive as you think about it, and also a carrier for the business.","Now having said that, we do recognize what's happening in the industry. We do recognize the level of consolidation. So we'll always think about how to evaluate that, but again, I don't feel like this is something that wouldn't add tremendous value to Ameriprise one way or the other over time.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Suneet, it's Walter. The only thing I just want to clarify is, again, all the initiatives we're talking about are pretty much on track. Certainly, the heavier CAT that we experience that will certainly change the profitability. But the other initiatives and where we think this \u2013 and how long it's going to take is pretty much on track.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Your question is good. It's appropriate. We always do think about and evaluate it. So, again, we'll see as the world in the future.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah, I appreciate those comments. But at the end of the day, it's not making any money. I'm spending a disproportionate amount of my time talking to investors about a business that, frankly, I just don't see why it adds value to your company. It just seems like it doesn't fit. And, like I said, there's consolidation in P&C. I just still scratch my head and try to figure out why it merits the amount of attention that you are spending on it.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Suneet, I appreciate your perspective. And, certainly, as we look at \u2013 this is not the return, not the way we want. But we do believe the basic underlying is quite strong and we're fixing it. And then, as Jim said, it's not core. We'll evaluate it. But it's something that we put the resources in, dedicate it and are turning it around and then have to evaluate it (57:10). This is not the way \u2013 the sort of returns and characteristics that we would want from one of our businesses.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Or have had in this business.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right. This business has actually, many years ago, it actually had returns. We certainly have seen it and it has substantial potential. Your perspective is certainly is valued.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Appreciated, right. Thanks.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a couple of quick others. On the JHS Capital Advisors, I'm just curious if \u2013 can you give us some background in terms of how that deal came about? Is that something that you approached them? Or did they come to you? Just want to get some sense in terms of how that deal came about.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Actually, we have the capability \u2013 or we've been looking at many different ways of evaluating the environment, and certainly we have a group of people that look at and assess. And it was a combination, I think. And we assessed both their \u2013 in fact, they had an employee base and franchise base. And conversations evolved. And it was really we do look, and we basically reached out to them.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Yaron's question. I mean, I know we're not talking about DOL on specific terms, but would it be unreasonable to think that if the DOL proposal sort of passes as it's currently drafted that there could be further consolidation in Advice & Wealth Management?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, listen, I think one of the things that we're finding out there is advisors, even that have moved to a level of independence, et cetera, are recognizing that today's environment is a bit more difficult to do business in, and that they're looking for a firm that would give them the support for a range of things, including having good strong compliance in place. So I mean, we're attracting independents back into our franchisee channel for those reasons. So it's not far to say if expenses and people don't have the right scale or appropriateness to respond to changes that that will cause some further level of consolidation. I would say, again, we've made a lot of investments in our company in technology, in marketing, in compliance, in training, in development support. So, again, I think we're well-situated, if that continues to come about.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from Erik Bass from Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thank you. Just wanted to come back to capital management. I was hoping you could update us a little bit on how you are thinking about your excess capital, as it has now been around $2.5 billion for an extended period? I guess, is there a level you intend to keep as either a buffer or as dry powder for M&A? And, if not, what are the factors, other than just your stock price, influencing how quickly you would return that to shareholders?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, okay. It's Walter. The level of capital has been at $2.5 billion, again, as we do \u2013 and certainly we generate a substantial amount of capital and then we've been, certainly, using it to return to shareholders. We certainly don't lock and load at $2.5 billion. And it is opportunistic. And, as I indicated, we will certainly start returning more to and we'd evaluate. We have the ability and we're constantly assessing both the environment and the opportunities out there as we evaluate to basically inorganically or organically and return to shareholders. So, I would say that we will start now, as we talked about. It's not our objective to keep $2.5 billion that we will \u2013 you should see us deploying that capital. But we do generate a lot and we anticipate still continue to generate a lot as the mix shift and other things take place in the way we manage the required capital.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, again, we \u2013 if you look over the last number of years, we've been returning more than 100% of our earnings, and that's because we have been able, as Walter said, through the mix shift, through freeing up capital in certain lines and better risk management again (01:01:17) and changing some of our investment portfolio, et cetera. So, I think we've been generating more, even though we've been returning it, which is a good thing.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Certainly, a good problem to have. I guess, is there a level of capital you want to keep for inorganic opportunities, if they do arise?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we always said that we would maintain a level of flexibility. Again, it depends, if there's a strong opportunistic reason that we should buy back a lot more because of the stock \u2013 we think the value is way low or something, that's one thing. But on the other side, we always said that we wanted to maintain some flexibility. But that doesn't have to be $2.5 billion for some additional acquisitions or things that come along that may fit in nicely that we can easily duct in and get some good shareholder return. I think the nature of it was that, over the last number of years, we've just been able to free up a lot of capital, even though we've been returning it, and that's why it's been roughly about $2.5 billion.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it, thanks. And just one quick question, just on the tax rate, if you could talk about what drove the lower tax rate this quarter? And I guess, Walter, do you think of the 26% rate being sustainable beyond 2015? Or how should we think about taxes going forward?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I would \u2013 It's strictly 2015. And, certainly, as we go through the year, we evaluate all of the moving parts, as it relates to the business mix, other factors that go in, our tax planning, and the tax rate is \u2013 again, quarters, they always deviate a little, but the 26%, we're reasonably comfortable is the achievable number for 2016. And then we will evaluate going forward. That's about as far as I would look at this stage.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. But we should think of it gradually increasing over time, I would assume, as your mix shifts more towards businesses with 35% tax rate.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the marginal tax rate, yeah. And, again, with the \u2013 it is the 35%, but certainly we do a lot of tax planning with the mix of business we have. So, right now the 26% is there, and then we just evaluate on the marginal as it changes, and then whatever tax planning we do.","Erik J. Bass - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.

I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financials fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO, and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide two you see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2017 earnings release, our 2016 annual report to shareholders, and our 2016 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","Turning to slide three, you will see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. As you are aware, the tax cuts and jobs act was established in the fourth quarter resulting in a $320 million unfavourable charge in the quarter. Given the charge is one time in nature, we are also provided our operating results adjusted for the tax re-measurement impact. Management believes this enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis.","Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results adjusted for tax re-measurement. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James Cracchiolo","Good morning and thank you for joining today's earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business. Walter will speak about the numbers and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Let's get started.","I\u2019m pleased to share that we had an excellent fourth quarter concluding what was a very strong year for Ameriprise. Clearly, the strong markets and operating environment we experienced throughout most of 2017 remains favourable in the fourth quarter. In addition, we had the beneficial impact of improving economies globally and the pro-growth agenda in Washington which boosted financial markets and investor sentiment.","As I reflect on last year, we remain focused on what sets us apart providing a top quality experience to clients and advisors supported by strong solutions what we executed and invested in our strategy for long term value creation.","We delivered strong results across the firm, with excellent momentum and returns in Advice & Wealth Management. Assets under management and administration reached a new high of $897 billion up 14% driven by continued strength in Ameriprise client flows and equity market appreciation.","As you saw, while we took a one time charge in the quarter for the new tax act, we expect the ongoing benefits from tax reform to be positive. The lower corporate rate will provide additional opportunities for further free cash and capital generation, which we\u2019ll further invest in the business while generating a good shareholder return.","Regarding our operating numbers, excluding the tax impact we highlighted, we reached new highs on many metrics. Both earnings and earnings per share grew significantly from a year ago.","Earnings were $502 million, up 13% and earnings per diluted share were $3.26 a 19% increase. When we look at full-year operating results, Ameriprise achieved a new record, earnings were $1.9 billion up 35% with earnings per share of $12.27, a 45% increase.","In addition, we achieved a new high return on equity at 32.3% which is one of the best returns in financial services. Very few financial services companies are generating this level of hourly and capital return. And Ameriprise has consistently grown these measures at a meaningful rate.","In 2017, we continued our growth investments and excellent expense management discipline and at the same time maintain our strong financial foundation. And consistent with our long-term strategy, we grew our lower capital fee-based businesses of wealth management and asset management to be 73% of our total operating earnings for the quarter, complemented by our protection and annuity businesses.","Let\u2019s move to the businesses. Our Advice & Wealth Management business is powerful and growing. The consumer opportunity around the need for advice is increasing. Ameriprise is one of the largest providers in the industry and we are very well situated with our leadership position and an advice value proposition.","Recently, I met with our field leadership team to kick off the year and reminded them how a year ago our industry was facing a great deal of uncertainty with the Department of Labor role.","Ameriprise devoted considerable time and resources to ensure we were well prepared. We kept our advisors focused on serving clients and running and growing their practices while managing significant regulatory changes.","The way we work with and support our advisors, reflects the strength of our culture and why Ameriprise is so attractive in the industry.","Moving to some of the key metrics for the quarter, Ameriprise retail client assets grew by 17% to $560 billion as we continue to serve more clients including more affluent clients and deepen our relationships with them.","We brought in good client flows and our wrap net inflows grew 51% to $5 billion for the quarter. As a result, we continue to grow productivity nicely with operating total net revenue per financial advisor increasing 15% year-over-year, adjusting for net 12b-1 fee impacts. As a result of our consistent investments and the support we provide our advisors, we help them grow at a higher rate than the industry competitors over the longer term. With good growth and productivity as well as our expense discipline, we expand the pretax operating margins in AWM significantly to 22% in the fourth quarter, and if you look at the full-year, margins grew 300 basis points to 21.1% for the full-year.","It also was another strong quarter for recruiting with 99 high quality advisors joining the firm, in fact it was one of our best quarters in terms of quality and quantity of advisor recruits, and we continue to see larger size practices joining Ameriprise.","There are changes occurring in the recruiting landscape, but I believe we well situated to continue to attract good advisors who appreciate our advice value proposition and client centric culture.","These are important differentiators and key to a strong reputation in the industry. In addition, we earned a number of important accolades in 2017. Number one in customer service, number one in forgiveness, number two in trust, a top performer in serving clients best interest and we also ranked first for the likelihood to recommend the firm to friends or colleague.","And recently Ameriprise ranked number one for customer loyalty in the investment industry in the 2017 Temkin Index. We\u2019re going to continue to tell our story through our integrated TV, digital and social media platform and we picked up 2018 with new ads for Our Be Brilliant and we\u2019ll continue to invest in our brand and marketing including in our digital experience to provide clients with increased capabilities and security.","As we move forward, our wealth management business is situated well. We\u2019re building off an excellent year and started 2018 in a favorable position. We know that the experience and the advice value proposition we provide to clients creates confidence in its industry leading and we want to help more consumers experience it.","Let\u2019s move to annuities and protection. We continue to serve our clients long-term financial security needs through our annuity and protection offerings. These are solid books that we manage well.","Total annuity and our VUL\/UL insurance balances were up due to equity market appreciation. Variable annuity sales overall have been at a slower pace consistent with the industry and essentially flat last year, however we continuing to see a nice pickup in sales of annuities without living benefits up 18% from a year ago.","And on the Life side, fourth quarter sales continue to show improvement over previous quarters particularly in IUL sales. We continue to help advisors provide these important solutions to clients from using data analytics to improve insurance underwriting, to implementing new digital and e-capabilities.","In terms of the quarter, RiverSource launched our first Fixed Index annuity, which is a long-term retirement savings vehicle that can add stability to client\u2019s retirement portfolios. Overall, we are focused on maintaining strong books of business in 2018.","In Auto and Home, our changes are taking hold and we\u2019re seeing good progress and results. We remain focused on increasing rates and enhancing segmentation and what discipline underwriting, enhanced reinsurance coverage to mitigate property cat risk and improving claims management.","Unfortunately, like the industry we are impacted by higher cat losses in the quarter on the wildfires in California. Overall, aside from those cat losses, we\u2019re seeing improvement in the underline loss development trends and that\u2019s starting to be reflected in our financial results and reserve position.","In asset management, we are generating good financial returns in managing and involving operating environment as we benefit from positive markets and our expense discipline. Regarding the business we are focused on executing our near-term plans while positioning the firm to compete globally over the long-term.","Assets under management were up 9% to nearly $500 billion, and we are generating competitive financial results in the quarter. Operating earnings were up 27% and the adjusted margin increased to more than 39%, this includes a strong quarter for performance fees and CLO unwinds.","In terms of the quarter, I\u2019ll start with investment performance. We continue to generate consistent competitive performance with about 70% of our funds, equities, fixed income and asset allocation above [Indiscernible] or benchmarks for one, three and five year timeframes.","We\u2019ve delivered strong results in North America across domestic and international equities as well as taxable and tax exempt fixed income. This performance is reflected in our strong line up of 114 four-and five-star Morningstar-rated funds globally. We\u2019ve also earned more than 50 investment awards around the world including terrific recognition as multi-asset manager of the year in the U.K.","On the product front, we continue to focus on our strategic products that are in high demand categories, and align with investor needs. We\u2019re also aiding products where we see opportunities that include our multi-asset solutions business where we are generating solid flows in our adaptive risk and diversify real return strategies in the U.S. and the U.K.","We continue to build upon these capabilities. We recently launched the Columbia adaptive retirement series, a unique product for the defined contribution market that incorporates our adaptive risk capability.","Another key priority is increase in Columbia Threadneedle\u2019s brand awareness. We\u2019ve had a good response to our ongoing advertising campaign centered on consistency. That included launching new ads on CNBC, awareness is up in our key regions and we are pleased with the results so far.","As part of this work, we are investing to strengthen our online presence. We were recently recognized in the U.S. as a digital leader in asset management for a website and social media channels, and how they help advisors create solutions and achieve investor goals.","And we continue to execute our multiyear project to move from regional operating platforms to a truly global front middle and back office operating platform. We make good progress in 2017 and once completed, we will strengthen our operating capabilities considerably, improve flexibility and our ability to offer customized solutions and increase efficiency.","And on the regulatory front we are managing a significant change of gender including MiFID II and preparing for Brexit. In terms of flows, total net inflows were $2.4 billion including reinvest in dividends and the Limestone acquisition.","In U.S. retail, overall we were net inflows of 3.8 billion including reinvested dividends. We experienced a more normal level of outflows at U.S. Trust given the characteristics of the legacy book.","I know fourth quarter mutual fund net sales in VD and IAD channels improved by about $2 billion reflecting progress in our segmentation strategy and enhance business intelligence tools.","We are making progress however with the move to passive there\u2019s more work. In the U.K. and Europe retail, we had another good quarter for both gross and net sales, with net inflows of about 500 million. It was the third consecutive quarter of net inflows in the U.K. Europe.","And in institutional, we had approximately 1.8 billion of former parent related outflows. In third party, we experienced elevated outflows of 4.3 billion which were very low fee fixed income mandates that had a weighted average fee rate of only four basis points.","And we completed the acquisition of Limestone investments which complements our strength in U.K. property and added $5.4 billion in assets. I would note that we\u2019ll remain in that outflows, particularly low fee third-party institutional former parent assets, our revenues and the fee rate overall for the business are up year-over-year reflecting the mix of assets we manage.","Overall, we are positioning the business for the long-term to deliver for clients and generate good returns. In closing, Ameriprise had a strong quarter and an excellent year. We continue to be recognized for the way we work together, as well as for our community involvement.","In 2017, Ameriprise received 100% rating on the corporate equality Index and we\u2019ve earned this for the last 12 years. We\u2019re again recognized as a best place to work. In the U.K. Columbia Threadneedle was named employer of the year at the women and finance awards.","In addition, we were again named the military friendly employer for the fourth year in a row, and the foundation for all of this our employees and advisors, our engagement with them is industry-leading, as it\u2019s been for many years.","The strength of the Ameriprise culture is essential to how well-positioned we are to continue to deliver long-term value to clients and all our stakeholders. Now Walter will cover the financials, and I\u2019ll be back to take your questions.","Walter Berman","Thank you Jim. Ameriprise results in the quarter and in the year demonstrated significant progress in obtaining our long-term shareholder objectives with strong growth in revenue, EPS, and return-on-equity. I will go through the results in detail on the following pages.","Moving to slide six, overall revenue growth was strong, up 10% in the quarter driven by Advice & Wealth Management Asset Management. Strong growth in client assets, particularly in wrap accounts and market appreciation drove substantial 17% topline growth in AWM.","Asset Management revenue was up 8% from markets, performance fees in our hedge funds, and U.K. property funds and the unwinding of two CLO\u2019s. Annuities in life and health insurance revenues were relatively flat consistent with prior trends. In the auto and home business revenues declined 7% due to the additional reinsurance arrangements established in 2017.","On slide seven, Ameriprise reported operating EPS was $1.18 including the tax re-measurement impact. Adjusting for the tax item, EPS was $3.26 up 19% from last year. This was fuelled by our strong growth businesses where AWM and Asset Management earnings were up 28% and 27%.","G&A expenses were up 6% adjusting for the timing of accruals for performance-based compensation, including asset management performance fees and foreign exchange translation, G&A was essentially flat, expense discipline remains the focus as we move into 2018.","We returned more than 1.8 billion to shareholders via buybacks and dividends as well as closing on two acquisitions in our growth businesses. Capital return was slower in the second half of the year as we would expect giving the share price appreciation.","Let\u2019s turn to AWM on slide eight, Advice & Wealth Management delivered an outstanding quarter and a year. Revenues were up 17% driven by strong rap net inflows, improve transactional activity levels and market appreciation.","Expense growth was driven by higher distribution related expenses; G&A was elevated from the timing of performance-based compensation and the on-boarding of IPI. Adjusting for these items, G&A was up 5% year-over-year based upon continued investment for growth and volume related items.","Going forward, we will be consistent and prudently manage expenses relative to the level of revenue growth AWM had substantial earnings growth and margin expansion in the quarter and for the full year. The margin in the quarter was up 270 basis points to 22% and up 300 basis points to 21.1% for the full year.","Let\u2019s turn to page nine, asset management financial performance remained very strong. Revenues were up 8% from strong market appreciation as well as performance fees and the unwinding of two CLO\u2019s in the period, in addition, the fee rate increase reflecting our mix of business.","The CLO business provided good revenue and earnings benefit in 2017 as a number of deals unwound. We anticipate fewer deals to unwind in 2018. Expenses continue to be prudently managed due to the timing of performance related compensation that I previously mentioned and foreign exchange translation. G&A was up 8% year-over-years excluding those items G&A would be up only 1%.","We delivered a 39% margin in the quarter supported by the strong performance fees in CLO\u2019s. We continue to expect the margin to be in the 35% to 39% range in the near-term.","Let\u2019s turn to annuities on slide 10. The annuity segment benefited from strong markets in 2017. Pretax operating earnings were up 17% year-over-year. Variable annuities earnings growth was 25% from strong equity markets with fixed annuities earnings being down to 14 million as expected.","Variable annuities continue to be in outflows, similar to the industry and the trends we\u2019ve seen over the past year. We\u2019ve seen an uptick in sales of a variable annuities product without living benefits. Our non-living benefit product now comprises about a third of our sales up from 29% of sales last year.","The quality of our VA book is excellent. Our net amount at risk is exceptionally low relative to the industry. As a percent of account value it is only 0.3% with living benefits and 0.1% with death benefits.","Fixed annuities pretax operating earnings declined $6 million as lapses in interest rates continue to impact results as expected. Turning to Protection on slide 11, Life & Health pretax operating earnings improved 16%. Overall claims experience is in line with expected ranges, though disability claims came in favorable to last year.","Interest rates continue to pressure earnings, however the portfolio is positioned well to benefit when interest rates rise. In the auto and home business, pretax operating results in the quarter were impacted by elevated cat losses of 38 million as well as the contractual reinstatement premium on our reinsurance program.","The prior year benefited from a $12 million reserve lease and lower cat losses. On an underlying basis, auto and home earnings were up from last year.","Let\u2019s turn to slide 12; we are continuing to grow our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses at a faster pace than insurance and annuities. Advice & Wealth Management made up nearly 45% of the earnings in the quarter. Combined with asset management the fee-based business is made up 70% of our earnings for the full year and 73% for the fourth quarter. This mix shift supports our strong free cash flow generation.","Let's turn to slide 13. As we announced early in January, Ameriprise had a one-time primarily non-cash impact in the fourth quarter related to the Tax Cut and Job Act of $320 million. This charge was related to the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets, repatriation tax and lower future tax benefits from low income housing assets.","On a statutory basis this impacted our RBC ratio by about 40 percentage points, but the ratio remains quite strong at about 435%. We expect RBC to improve as we move through 2018. Going forward, tax reform will be advantageous to Ameriprise.","We estimate our ongoing effective tax rate to be between 17% to 19%, driving an improvement in our cash flow generation particularly in AWM and asset management. Within two years we expect to earn back the charge taken in the fourth quarter.","Turning to slide 14, Ameriprise\u2019s balance sheet quality, cash flow generation and capital return remain very strong. Ameriprise\u2019s capital position remains strong with $1.3 billion of excess capital reflecting the impact of tax reform.","In the year, we returned about $1.8 billion of capital to shareholders, which was 96% of our operating earnings. As we move through 2017 our share price appreciated substantially. We lowered our share repurchase levels and allocated some of those resources to acquisitions.","With that, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to start with free cash flow on our post-tax reform basis, can you help us think through sort of what the annual pace of free cash flow generation is after the effective tax reform?","Walter Berman","Yes. I guess, the easiest way to think it from my standpoint is, we\u2019ve talked about it this particular environment situation that were generating 85%, 90% free cash flow. At this stage you could assume that that will go up by somewhere between 150 million and 200 million. I know I\u2019m giving you a percentage versus that, but it\u2019s the best way to think about because it will fall pretty at that level into the free cash flow category. Again assuming the mix of businesses and things don\u2019t change, just coming from the Tax Reform Act.","Suneet Kamath","Right. So take whatever our estimate is for earnings on a post-tax reform basis applied at 85% to 90% and then you\u2019re saying add 150 million to 200 million on top of that?","Walter Berman","Yes. That\u2019s a fair way and we\u2019ll be refining as we go through, but it\u2019s a good measure to go through.","Suneet Kamath","Okay, fine. And then as you think about tax reform just from a business perspective, do you expect to retain the benefits of the lower tax rate i.e. you have them fall to the bottom line or you expecting some potential offset either in terms of pricing or additional investment in the business?","Walter Berman","We will continue to look at opportunities for continued investment as we have and we modulate that appropriately, so we would say that some of that we would like to continue to invest \u2013 continue to invest as we do with the other aspects of our free cash flow and some of that will be return as well. So -- and return as you saw last year we did some small acquisitions, so we think that would also be a way that utilizes some of the cash that we\u2019re generating.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And just my last is just on the advice and wealth management business. In the past you\u2019ve talk about the reasons why you exited the bank largely due to regulatory concerns and with some of the deregulation that's going on across financial services, are you contemplating or considering getting back into that business?","Walter Berman","I think we are certainly evaluating that. And I think your observations are good ones.","Suneet Kamath","Hey, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. With several large firms now pulling out of the broker protocol, can you talk about how you see that impacting recruiting for Ameriprise going forward?","James Cracchiolo","Yes. We feel very good about the value proposition we have and our ability to track advisors. We tracked advisors not just from the protocol firms. Today we tracked them from firms that weren't in the protocol as well. And we have a good process in place. So we feel very good about our ability to continue to recruit appropriately if advisors are interested in joining us. We are in the protocol and so we\u2019re remaining in. And so from that perspective we\u2019ll continue to recruit in the marketplace and we feel that our value proposition is strong.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. And then sticking with AWM, can you us, I know expenses were somewhat elevated in the quarter for comp and performance related reasons. Can you help us think about what we should expect for G&A expense growth in AWM in 2018?","Walter Berman","I would say, if you -- as we go through, again, we\u2019re going to be looking to invest for growth. But I would say on normalize patterns it certainly tie to our revenue growth and growth in revenue, but getting back into three to five range and staying in that range, because we will be investing in the business and obviously there is volume associate expenses. But it will be correlated to what the revenue growth is.","Ryan Krueger","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Hey. Good morning everybody. Couple of questions for you guys around the De Young [ph] business. I guest first around recruitment, if I look at the quarter I guess you guys highlighted 99 new recruits for the year looks by a numbers over 360 or something like that. That\u2019s a very strong year. Can you guys remind us kind of what the productivity of these new recruits stand today versus kind like their run rate once all the assets that are transition over to you guys? And then I have a follow-up.","James Cracchiolo","Well, the new recruits coming in, our average productivity on them are actually pretty strong. They are actually above the average across our system right now, particularly in the employee channel. So that was quite good. But as I said, it does take up to three years for ramp-up, some sooner than others. But the nature on averages it takes two to three years for them to ramp up to their productivity. And so as an example if you look at our AAG platform which is the employee platform, you can see it more because the number of recruits there a bit higher against the base, but the productivity of the channel has grown nicely and so has the margins in that channel.","Alex Blostein","Right. You kind of hit on the second part of my question there; so if I look at the retention in the employee channel that improve nicely as well. So I guess should we think of that as a sign that you guys are sort of getting closer to the end of kind of phasing out lower producers and in other words that that net number in the employee headcount should start to kind of creep higher and grow from here versus you guys had really good recruiting but then some lower producers were leaving, so we are in a little bit more of a steady-state now?","James Cracchiolo","Yes. I think overall as you think about the core of the AAG business that is correct. We do and have added the IPI channel which is a new channel that were still going through an integration of or will over the course of the year, so that's an aside. But as a core of the AAG the answer is yes.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thanks for that. And then I guess separately just want to go back to the capital discussion for a second. I hear you on reinvesting some, but I guess if we think about the return of capital on a pro forma for tax reforms, kind of higher earnings base, is 90% to 100% payout, still what you guys are shooting for and the mix between kind of dividends and buybacks?","Walter Berman","Yes. Alex. That is still the guidance from that standpoint to 90% to 100%, again circumstance driven, but that's where we said that we would target.","Alex Blostein","Understand. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. In asset management in the press release you talk about the average fee rates for those $4.3 billion of redemptions were kind of around four basis points, which is pretty helpful. But what about the average fee rates that you\u2019re collecting on the inflows that you're getting, and how is that compare to the outflows?","Walter Berman","Well, overall our fee base on the rate basis points, I\u2019d say 2017 over 2016 is actually up, it's a combination of mix, some of the assets that we've added but also overall the assets that we managed or retain, which we do have a good portion, a good thing in equity. We did lose a bit more in the fixed income side in net flow picture which has very low basis points for some of those institutional and parent activities. So that's really the balancing.","The flow picture that we bring in from the new flows actually have good rates to them including in the institutional side of the business. So we still feel very good about the total that we\u2019re managing and echoes both domestically but also internationally. We\u2019re bringing in some good retail asset net inflows in the international marketplace as well as good fees.","Humphrey Lee","I think if you look at the overall average fee rates for asset management is probably around 52 to 53 basis points, which is say that the new business that you\u2019re bringing in would be higher than that or in line with that?","Walter Berman","It\u2019s Walter. It\u2019s a tad lower but it's -- if you take a look at the inflow versus the outflow for your question, the inflow basis points are about 15% higher than the outflow as we look over the quarter and looked over the 2017.","James Cracchiolo","And remember it's a combination of institutional and retail asset, so that's in OpEx.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then, staying with asset management, so you are going through the platform consolidation that was started in 2017 and my understanding is it\u2019s probably complete in 2018. And looking at your expenses you seems to be getting pretty good results from the consolidation in terms of expenses which is pretty much flat for the full year and at the most in large part. And my understanding is some of the benefits would have yet to come through in 2018. So how should we think about the potential efficiency gains that you can generate from the platform consolidation in 2018?","Walter Berman","Sure. It\u2019s Walter. We will generate some efficiency gains, but also we\u2019ll be incurring expenses as it relates -- relates to Brexit, relates to the every elements. And the benefits that we will start garnering with the capabilities that we have in this conversion is really ability and to offer products across the global aspects of this and the consistency on the risk management and you have a capabilities. So it's going to give us those capabilities. But we will get some dollars savings, but it\u2019s not going to be the main focus of it, because we\u2019ve we picked up some already and we will be spending money on new initiatives. But it certainly the capabilities that gives us is going to be vastly beyond the dollar saving.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Doug Mewhirter","Hi. Good morning. First question on message to \u2013 do you have \u2013 it\u2019s a better idea of what the impact to your G&A expenses would be for your European operations. I know it\u2019s very \u2013 from the other side of the table I know it's been a very complicated process. So I was just wondering if you sort of narrow that down at all as to what the impact would be?","Walter Berman","Yes. We've gone through an extensive process and obviously looking at the level of research and how to reengineer. So I would say that we bought the cost a bit down and still maintain servicing capabilities that were associated with it. So it should not be a major event for us in 2018, obviously where there\u2019ll be some of the course, but we have really reengineered those cost of levels that we can manage.","Doug Mewhirter","Okay. Thanks for that. And my second and final question maybe for Walter. What was that the dollar contribution from the CLO unwind in the fourth quarter?","Walter Berman","From CLO, the total was 32; it\u2019s around 16 [ph] or 60 [ph].","Doug Mewhirter","$16 [ph] million.","Walter Berman","Yes.","Doug Mewhirter","Okay. Thank you.","Walter Berman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber","Good morning. Last year you did two what I call bolt-on deals. How does the pipeline look for 2018 and if you do deals, were they\u2019ll be sort of that similar size?","James Cracchiolo","Yes. We\u2019re continuing to look at opportunities that still up in the marketplace or that we think would be of interest to us appropriately. As you know that ones you look at and ones that you can actually do appropriately that make sense. So we're constantly looking at that and will to 2018, we think the marketplace is open in that sense and things will come out this year. So it is something that we have as part of our plans. But there will be small acquisitions along those lines, but ones that we can bolt-on.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks. And then in advice and wealth management I know you don't give the exact data, but would you say your net new business in 2017 is that doing better than we saw say in 2015 and 2016?","James Cracchiolo","Yes. The answer is yes. We\u2019ve had very good strong client activity, new client activity and flows in even where the money being deployed our cash balances are still very consistently high from the new cash flow coming in. So we feel very good about that business. And our advisors are actually generating even nicer increase productivity. And we\u2019re actually going to do a bit more and helping the advisors grows this year.","Now that we\u2019re not concentrating on the DOL activities and we\u2019re investing both in technology as well as in a capability over the course of the year to even bring our client experience to life even more so, our advice experience, the digital advice tools that we\u2019re going to put into our advisors hands. So we feel very good. And some of the things Walter said is investment it's in some good technology including and some of our contact activities and engagement activities for clients. So over the course of the year we\u2019re continuing to really deploy and invest in better capabilities to help our advisors even be more engaged.","Adam Klauber","Okay. Thanks. And just one detail question. If you haven\u2019t said, what is the dollar amount of the performance fees and asset management for the quarter?","Walter Berman","Dollar amount performance fees, well, I gave you PTI, I don\u2019t if I have them. I\u2019ll get back. I don\u2019t to guess, but the\u2026","Adam Klauber","Well, the PTI impact\u2026","Walter Berman","The PTI impact, I gave you is a six and then had to go through the compensation. That was performance fees then you have the CLOS, the total is 32.","Adam Klauber","32.","Walter Berman","Total is 32 for CLOs and for \u2013 what you call again, for performance fees to property, but the breakdown how much was in the revenue and how much was so on the expense side, I just don\u2019t have that in front of me.","Adam Klauber","Okay.","Walter Berman","But I\u2019ll get it before I\u2019ll out.","Adam Klauber","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. Walter, the decline in excess capital of 400 million, was that all RBC tax reform driven? And does that imply that you\u2019re not changing your RBC target despite the fact that there\u2019s kind of been mechanical change in RBC. Can you describe what drove the $400 million decline?","Walter Berman","Sure. The answer to your question yes, it is driven by the tax reform. The answer to the second part of the question is the RBC and the effectiveness and the required RBC is driven by the rating agencies. To the best of my knowledge I have not given us any guidance that they will be changing what their required RBC will be. And we have the ability and will be building back your RBC as we go through the year.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And then just on the long-term care in the runoff corporate operation, the loss of around 13 million, that's the highest loss you\u2019ve had. I think as far back as I can see. And I know you guys called out clean severity and then it normalized in December. But how should we think about your comfort in reserves just given, I mean you had GE take a very large charge in the market for the same type of business. But can you talk a little bit about your comfort in that exposure?","James Cracchiolo","Sure. Before I go there I just want to say that 435 RBC that we reported actually is above the standard. So we're starting at a good place from that standpoint. As relates to the \u2013 you\u2019re saying is the loss 13, that was a PTI loss. That was not claims. That was not all claims. The majority I would say about only 30%, 40% was claims and that related to basically experience of having new claims come in and cohorts that were higher than on daily payouts and we book it. We do not believe that will change. Our active reserve adequacy as we look at and we did extensive analysis and that trend line has now subsequently changed.","The other parts of it, we had around $4 million to $5 million loss in LTC which is normal. We have that. And then the other part was really, we had to do with timing issue that we looking at transfers and some lapsing that we didn\u2019t pick up the exact amount. But again it is -- we feel extremely comfortable with reserves. It's gone through extensive reviews and certainly we feel that they are adequate and we constantly monitor.","Tom Gallagher","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. First, I had one follow-up on taxes and just wondering if you expect the lower tax rate to have any impact on pricing or fee rates and neither the advice & wealth management or asset management businesses?","Walter Berman","No. We personally look at the marketplace competitively, in asset management we make adjustments in fee levels appropriately based on whether it's institutional or retail in certain activities, but we\u2019ve been doing that on an ongoing basis, not necessarily or will be driven by the tax rate. And in AWM as well, it's based on client level of activity and value and appropriate for the adviser to decide for the activities with their clients and nothing is going to be holistically driven by the tax rate.","Erik Bass","Got it. So you\u2019re not seeing any competitive pressures with people becoming more aggressive on pricing as a result of the tax benefit gains?","Walter Berman","Not at this point.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then can you also update us on what you're seeing in terms of the competitive dynamics around cash fees and I guess what you're anticipating in terms of the benefit from additional rate hikes that we may get in 2018?","Walter Berman","Yes. We have seen \u2013 over the year there\u2019s been some increase and certainly we follow that because we\u2019re coming of a very low base, but it's been much less than we originally would've anticipate in the beginning of the year. So we are seeing competitors are being fairly consistent and we\u2019re certainly observing, but at this stage it's very tough to gauge the exact amount that will be proportionally to us and to shareholder based upon the situation.","So we will remain competitive and we are competitive and so will have to gauge. But I imagine we would -- the percent would increase if we -- that's what I would think and we'll have to gauge the competitive reactions.","Erik Bass","Got it. So you still expect to be able to retain at least some of the benefit of additional rate hikes?","Walter Berman","Absolutely. And we believe that is what the trend line is, yes, some.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Lee","Thanks for taking my question. Just looking at the wrap flows, it was a very strong annualized organic growth in the quarter. What would you highlight as particular drivers for the recent strength inflows, more specific I'm just wondering how much could be driven by potential shifts from my commission-based accounts? Thanks.","Walter Berman","Yes. So over the course of the year, but over the course of the last number of years there's been a shift from commission-based business to fee-based accounts and that's definitely included for the fourth quarter, but we also seen greater inflow of client activity that has been going to the fee-based business. And so as their advisors continue to look at doing business that way \u2013 more of the flows will continue to go into that area. We still saw a very good transactional activity in the fourth quarter, so we didn\u2019t see it as just a shift, we saw it as more client activity with a piece going to commission base, but more so on the trend line to the advised based, fee based business.","Kenneth Lee","Great. And just more quick one. Just in terms of the asset management assets under management, could you just remind us how much of that AUM is more general account versus I guess I would call that more third party AUM? Thanks.\\","James Cracchiolo","Yes. The Asset Management, how much is general account?","Walter Berman","General account is around $35 billion to $40 billion.","Kenneth Lee","Got you. Okay, great thank you very much.","James Cracchiolo","And we have an answer on the question on performance fees. The revenue is 34 billion and the PTI is 16.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Barnidge from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.","John Barnidge","Thank you. A couple of questions. There is a lot of catastrophe loss activity in 4Q and generally in 2017 in the industry. Can you talk about your pricing power as a result and then I have one follow up.","Walter Berman","When you say pricing power, the ability to raise our premiums because of it, is that what you...","John Barnidge","Yes.","Walter Berman","It\u2019s again dealing with cat losses, you have to demonstrate it then non-anomalous and that because they are it\u2019s very tough to pass rate. We have courage; it was really the unique nature of the California fires two of them. The first one of course being the most damaging. That basically, we ate the larger portion on that and it\u2019s \u2013 so we will evaluate and the team is evaluating what aspects will be then put into pricing and then obviously we have to be competitive, and ensure and pass through the years state filters, but certainly it will be evaluating if it is part of the regular trend line and is incorporated we will stop pricing for it.","John Barnidge","And then there have been a lot of press reports about the California Insurance Commissioner possibly pressuring rate for property insurers in light of tax reform so that the corporate reduction is passed completely along the policy holders. Is there any commentary you have about that?","James Cracchiolo","No, that one I don\u2019t, I really do not. I don\u2019t want to have to figure out myself, if you don\u2019t mind.","John Barnidge","No, that\u2019s fine. Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect."],"2288":["Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

My name is Paulette, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insights into the company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our third quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2017 Annual Report to shareholders and our 2017 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","Turning to slide 3, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the third quarter. Below that, you see our operating results, followed by operating results excluding unlocking, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. In the third quarter, we completed our annual unlocking. The comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results, excluding unlocking.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Hello and thank you for joining our earnings call. This morning, we'll discuss our strong results, give you an update on the business and our areas of focus today and going forward. Reflecting on the quarter, the macroeconomic and market picture has been positive for our clients and Ameriprise.","The U.S. economy is strong, and that was punctuated by the Fed's decision to raise short-term interest rates again. However, Europe is showing signs of slower growth. Global trade issues and political uncertainty remain, including in the UK, especially as the deadline for Brexit nears. Recently, global equity markets have been more volatile. We're navigating that volatility and are very much focused on our clients.","At the same time, consumer sentiment is strong. U.S. household wealth has reached a new high of over $100 trillion, which represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for Ameriprise.","Turning to the company, over the years, we've built a strong business. We're well-positioned based on our broad advice capability and our integrated model allows us to leverage resources and generates consistent results through market cycles.","Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter. On an adjusted operating basis, excluding unlocking, revenue increased nicely, up 5%. We continue to generate excellent EPS growth, the third consecutive quarter of 20% growth or better, building on last year's strong results. And our return on equity was also very strong, now at 32%.","I am pleased with the quarter and our long-standing track record for delivering results of this caliber. In addition, our assets under management and administration are now over $900 billion. As you know, our business generates significant free cash flow and we're disciplined in our capital allocation. We continue to shift our earnings mix to less capital-intensive business lines, with more than 70% of pre-tax adjusted operating earnings coming from our Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses in the quarter.","At various investment forums over the years, some of you have asked us when we would grow our less capital-intensive business lines to get to 50% or even 60%. Today, we're over 70% and we have the ability to continue to invest for growth and return to shareholders at a meaningful level.","Let's move to some business highlights. Very clearly, we know the mass affluent and affluent want to work in a personal, advice-based relationship with a trusted advisor. And these investors need either more advice as their assets grow, their lives become more complex and markets experience volatility. At Ameriprise, we're positioned very well to serve this growing need. We're focused on serving more investors in our target market, those with $500,000 to $5 million, and we're seeing good organic growth at the $1 million-plus level.","With good client growth and positive markets, Ameriprise client assets increased 9% to $588 billion. Our investment advisory platform is one of the largest in the industry. Net inflows into fee-based investment advisory accounts were $5.7 billion in the quarter, the fifth consecutive quarter of flows over $5 billion. And year-to-date, wrap flows are 14% higher than 2017, which was an exceptionally strong year.","Variable annuity sales picked up a bit, with growth of 3% in the quarter. And for our Life and Health insurance offerings, cash sales increased 5%. We only offer these products in our network to Ameriprise clients as part of a comprehensive solution set. As we discussed, we focus on targeted growth within the Ameriprise client base. These solutions provide important benefits for clients while providing risk-adjusted returns for Ameriprise.","Our client cash balances also remain high at more than $24 billion, and we're earning competitive returns and spread as the Fed continues to raise short-term rates. The result of these strong client flows and increased activity is continued good growth in advisor productivity, which increased 11% to $613,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the net 12b-1 change. This builds on many years of strong advisor productivity gains.","Ameriprise advisors consistently grow productivity at a faster rate than many industry peers. In addition, the level of service and leadership support we provide is reflected in our strong advisor relationships and retention rates.","Regarding advisor recruiting, we're attracting productive advisors with larger practices who serve the affluent market. In fact, third quarter was quite strong with another 87 advisors joining and their productivity was nearly 20% higher than those recruited a year ago. And for the rest of the year, the pipeline looks good.","The strength of our client experience and the external recognition we receive is an important differentiator. I'm extremely pleased to share that consumers rated Ameriprise number one in the investment industry for trust, customer service, consumer forgiveness and for loyalty, according to the most Temkin Ratings.","Across the firm, we're further investing in our value proposition and putting significant resources towards our client experience to further build on our client engagement, advisor productivity and practice efficiency. This includes enhancing our digital and financial planning capabilities, as well as upgrading to an advanced CRM system so our advisors can work in an even more integrated way with their clients. These capabilities are in development and testing. And we will be introducing them with training and support to advisors beginning and throughout next year.","We're also pursuing converting our National Trust Bank to a Federal Savings Bank and targeting a launch in 2019, subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we continue to invest in the Ameriprise brand. As you may have seen, we're back on the air with new advertising and we remain at record levels of awareness.","I'm energized about our opportunity, and so are our advisors. Over the last few months, I've spent time with our top advisors across the country. We've had excellent conversations about the Ameriprise value proposition and their opportunity to grow. They feel very good about the firm, the support we provide, and how we're further enhancing our client advisor experience to deliver value and drive growth.","What does this translate into? Another great quarter for our Wealth Management business. We grew assets, increased client activity, delivered double-digit revenue, earnings and productivity growth and are managing expenses well.","As part of Ameriprise, Columbia Threadneedle is focused on delivering relevant, quality products and solutions underscored by good service to retail and institutional clients while generating competitive returns.","The industry is under pressure. And like other active managers, our flows have been affected. And we've been taking steps to address it. We have broad set of capabilities and product offerings with good performance and global distribution. Importantly, the business benefits from the resources and scale of Ameriprise.","We continue to execute a strategic shift in our asset mix with declines in lower fee former parent assets under management and increased higher fee third-party assets under management. This change has helped us mitigate industry-wide fee pressures while maintaining assets under management levels and consistently delivering good profitability.","Looking at the business, investment performance globally remains good overall across equities, fixed income, and asset allocation strategies. For one, three and five-year periods, more than 60% of our funds are beating Lipper peers and related benchmarks. And where we have pockets of underperformance for the current one year, we're working to address it. We have a growth with a quality bias and with the recent market pullback, we're seeing some improvement in our short-term numbers.","In distribution, we have a good base of clients and are working to gain traction in areas we see opportunity while at the same time manage industry challenges. In U.S. retail, we continue to be in net outflows. However, our focus is on strengthening our presence at top wealth management firms and getting our products and models on these platforms and earning more business from advisors who sell our funds.","In the quarter, net outflows were higher and that included more than $1 billion year-over-year negative swing in model flows. In the UK and Europe retail, we're in net inflows of about $300 million, but flows have been softer. We're reinforcing our strong position in the UK and investing and expanding key European markets, including Italy, Germany and Spain.","Brexit remains a top priority. During this period of uncertainty, we've been supporting our clients as we begin to transition certain portfolios, while we continue to extend our CKF (00:12:00) fund range in Europe.","In institutional, we had elevated outflows as clients continue to derisk, rebalance and seek liquidity in this environment. We're working hard to convert opportunities in our pipeline, but the funding pace remains slow. We also had $1.1 billion of redemptions in our CLO business, given our leadership transition in our bank loan office.","Our outflows have been higher than we like, reflecting the rise of passive and pressure on sales as we compete for share in a very competitive marketplace. Our reengineering discipline allows us to free up expenses to reallocate for growth, improve service, as well as for regulatory and compliance costs.","An example of that is the enhancements we're making to move to a global operating platform. We completed the first main part of the work and reallocated expense saves to help offset higher regulatory expenses, including absorbing higher research costs.","We're also investing in spending time advancing big data initiatives, both in our investment department and improvements to data-driven distribution. In addition, we're broadening our product lines and adding to new structures to provide a greater access to our capabilities. This includes recent product launches that broaden our SMA capabilities in the tax-efficient space and in strategic beta.","In Asset Management, we have good scale and distribution, broad investment capabilities, and the ability to adjust the business and leverage our integrated model while continuing to generate a good return.","As I reflect on the quarter and the year so far, I feel very good about Ameriprise, the client experience we deliver, and how we're situated. We're generating strong results, see meaningful opportunity ahead, and are investing for growth as we continue to shift our business. We're executing consistently through market cycles.","I also feel very good about how we manage risk at the company. Our approach has served us very well for many years. As you'll hear from Walter, we're comfortable with how we manage our longer tail liabilities while maintaining the flexibility we need to capture market opportunities. Ameriprise is in a great position for future growth and to deliver an attractive return to shareholders.","Now, Walter will cover the numbers. And I'll be back to take your questions.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another excellent quarter, consistent with our longer-term performance. This is led by Advice & Wealth Management, which delivered 19% earnings growth and continued strong metric trends.","Our other businesses are generating good, stable earnings. Asset Management is delivering good profitability as we navigate an environment and regulatory change agenda. Protection and Annuities are generating very good risk-adjusted returns that are in line with our expectations.","In the quarter, we completed our unlocking and LTC experience review, which resulted in a marginal charge, well within historical ranges. As I previously indicated, Long Term Care will not impact our ability to deploy capital for business investments and return to shareholders.","Turning to page 6, Ameriprise delivered strong results in the quarter. We're continuing to make significant progress in delivering our long-term shareholder objectives, as demonstrated by strong 5% growth in revenue, 20% growth in EPS, and a 32% return on equity.","Let me take you through the details, beginning on slide 7. Overall, Ameriprise delivered strong revenue growth, up 5% in the quarter, largely driven by Advice & Wealth Management. Asset Management, Annuities and Protection had fairly stable revenue that was in line with expectations.","Expenses continued to be well-managed across the firm, with G&A up only 1%. I will go into detail on expenses in each segment on the subsequent pages.","In total, adjusted operating EPS was $4.05, excluding unlocking, fueled by Advice & Wealth Management, which now makes up 46% of our pre-tax adjusted operating earnings. Year-to-date, we returned over 90% of earnings to shareholders, a continuation of our track record of differentiated return. In the quarter, we returned $484 million to shareholders through buyback and dividends.","Lastly, we have maintained $1.4 billion of excess capital while achieving a 32% return on equity, up 150 basis points.","Let's turn to slide 8. As I indicated, Advice & Wealth Management represents 46% of pre-tax adjusted operating earnings, demonstrating a significant upward trend from 41% last year. We have diversified sources of free cash flow from our businesses, with Advice & Wealth Management driving much of our growth, complemented by Asset Management, Annuities and Protection. Our fee-based businesses of Wealth Management and Asset Management now make up nearly three-quarters of our earnings.","Let's turn to AWM on slide 9. Advice & Wealth Management is delivering consistent, strong financial performance that is underpinned by business fundamentals that have continually demonstrated an ability to drive sustained organic profitable growth. Overall, AWM had substantial 19% earnings growth to $355 million. Revenues grew 11%, driven by $5.7 billion of wrap net inflows and higher transactional activity levels, as well as equity markets and the benefit of higher short-term rates on cash sweep balances.","The third quarter had lower transactional levels than the first half of the year, which is typical in our industry, associated with the summer slowdown. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect transactional activity to return to a more normal level.","Expenses increased in line with revenues and included higher distribution-related expenses. G&A increased 7%, driven by higher volume-related expenses as well as elevated growth investments. We are diligently managing G&A while investing to improve the client experience and ease of doing business. We are making investments where we will see the best payback. And margins continued at a record high 22.7%.","We have seen strong growth trends in Advice & Wealth Management, both in the quarter and over the last several years. You can see some of these trends on slide 10. Total client assets increased 9% to $588 billion in the quarter, driven by growth in wrap assets of 16%, reflecting client demand for fee-based products. Over the past three years, our client assets are up 11% and wrap flows grew 21% on a compounded annual basis.","Brokerage cash balances remain substantial at $24.2 billion, down slightly from last quarter as clients are putting money to work. We are benefiting from short rates getting back to more normal historical levels, and we saw the spread increase to 1.73% in the quarter. While we have retained a high percentage of the rise in short rates to-date, we are closely monitoring crediting rates to remain competitive with peers.","Finally, organic advisor productivity also continues to steadily improve, reaching nearly $613,000 on a trailing 12-month basis for the quarter. This level has grown steadily over the longer term, with a combined annual growth rate of 8% over the past three years. This is well above the productivity growth experienced by many of our wealth management peers.","Let's turn Asset Management on page 11, where financial performance remains solid and profit margins high as the business and the industry face some secular headwinds. Earnings were $197 million. The year-ago quarter included a one-time $10 million gain on CLO unwinds. Excluding that prior-year item, earnings were up slightly. Adjusting for the CLO unwind, revenues were in line with a year ago.","The fee rate in the quarter was 54 basis points, slightly above our expectations in the 52 to 53 basis point range. Expenses continued to be prudently managed by generating operating efficiencies and reengineering, which is funding growth investments and higher regulatory costs in Europe to address MiFID II, GDPR and Brexit.","We are continuing to make investments in the business to build our brand, expand our product offering and enhance our distribution capability in Europe. We delivered a 40% margin in the quarter. We continue to expect the margin to be consistently in the 35% to 39% range in the near term.","Let's turn to Annuities on slide 12. Annuities are a core enablement capability for our Wealth Management business and part of our important set of solutions tailored to meet our clients' needs. This business continues to generate good risk-adjusted returns for the company. In the quarter, variable annuities earnings were $131 million, which was essentially flat to last year.","Equity market appreciation increased account values year-over-year, but was largely offset by net outflows. Variable annuities continue to be in outflows, though at a slower pace than last year. Variable annuity sales continue to be solid, up 13% year-to-date, which is above the industry. And nearly 30% of our VA sales are in our product without living benefit riders. Fixed annuities pre-tax adjusted operating earnings declined to $12 million as lapses in interest rates continue to impact results, as expected.","Turning to Protection on slide 13, Life and Health pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $65 million and included a one-time expense associated with a modification of cost within a reinsurance contract. Claims were in line with expectations, though claims were somewhat favorable to the prior year. Life insurance sales have been good, with 5% sales growth and acceleration from earlier this year.","In the Auto and Home business, pre-tax adjusted operating earnings were $17.9 million, excluding net cat losses. Earnings were down $3.4 million from last year, primarily due to the wind-down of the previously announced affinity partnership termination and delay in reducing expenses associated with this contract.","We continue to reduce home exposures in severe convective storm states from the termination of our affinity partnership I just mentioned, along with other actions. This has resulted in homeowner policies in-force declining 18% year-over-year. We expect this to improve our risk profile going forward.","Turning to slide 14. A cornerstone of our success as a company is predicated on a proactive, integrated risk management process, which results in sustained strong balance sheet fundamentals. We have a rigorous process to identify, quantify and mitigate risk that we use to make business decisions. Over the years and across all business lines, we have been successful and avoided surprises.","There are a number of underlying metrics that demonstrate our successful ERM program including ALM, where we are short duration and positioned for rising rates, as well as credit quality and hedge effectiveness. These underlying examples support our strong balance sheet.","In the third quarter, we completed our experience update as part of our comprehensive and consistent unlocking process. Overall, the impact from market assumption was marginal and behavioral characteristics were within ranges. Unlocking was consistent with our expectations, with a $58 million total charge, with $52 million coming from Long Term Care. The majority of the Long Term Care charge related to updating morbidity experience, which was offset by actual and expected premium rate increases.","Let me remind you, our reserves do not incorporate any future improvement in morbidity or mortality and we have a conservative approach to the level of rate increases assumed.","Let's turn to slide 15. Our LTC experience is some of the most extensive in the industry as we sell policies from 1989 to 2002. Each year, we do a granular analysis of our experience and update assumptions accordingly. Let me provide a bit more detail into the drivers of the level of credible experience that support our active life reserves.","Each year, we update our experience tables to incorporate an additional year of information. We have 29,000 policies that are closed with claim activity, as well as 8,000 currently active claims. We apply this claim experience to our in-force policies at a very granular level broken down by issue year, attained age and benefit features.","Another critical fact point is the 75% of claims experience provides statistically-valid information that is used in estimating our reserve assumptions. Policies with lifetime benefits have higher claim duration, and this is incorporated into our reserves. In the appendix, we provide additional insights into these areas.","Lastly, we have been pursuing rate increases since 2005 and have achieved substantial or appropriate increases. As we incorporate future rate increases into our assumptions, we are conservative. In addition, based on recent industry trends, we believe there is an opportunity for additional premium increases as well as benefit changes, both of which are not incorporated into our current reserve methodology.","Turning to page 16, we laid out the core assumptions for the LTC block and associated sensitivities. I want to focus on three key takeaways. First, our best estimate reserve assumptions are conservative and consistent with our actual experience based on our granular approach. To reiterate, we do not assume improvements in morbidity and mortality. For lapse and asset yields, assumptions are based on our actual experience. And for expected future rate increases, we consistently assume a lower level than what we've historically received.","Second, looking at sensitivities, the impact is minimal on a relative basis. As you would expect, the larger sensitivity is to morbidity, which is $127 million, significantly less than what others in the industry have disclosed. But this sensitivity is overstated because it applies across the whole book, rather than to the subset that does not have credible claims experience. If we apply the sensitivity just to that portion, the impact would be reduced from $127 million to $57 million.","Third, these scenarios do not reflect any potential benefit to reserves from additional premium increases and benefit reductions that are in line with industry trends.","Now, let's turn to free cash flow generation and capital return on slide 17. Ameriprise cash flow generation, balance sheet quality, and capital return capability continue to be very strong. Ameriprise's excess capital is $1.4 billion and our estimated RBC ratio is 515%.","In the quarter, we returned $484 million of capital to shareholders, bringing our year-to-date total to more than $1.5 billion. This is over 90% of our adjusted operating earnings. This demonstrates our ongoing commitment to capital return, as well as confidence in our risk analytics and future cash flow capacity.","In closing, Ameriprise delivered another strong quarter of financial results and organic growth that is exceeding expectations, with strong client flows and productivity gains in Advice & Wealth Management. We are meeting and exceeding client needs, as evidenced by our profitable growth and the recognition we receive.","We are continuing to invest for future growth. Our ERM decisioning process demonstrates that we effectively manage risk and avoid surprises. Our Long Term Care results in the quarter are no exception to that. As we've indicated, Long Term Care will not impede our ability to invest for business growth and return capital to shareholders.","Finally, our business model generates significant free cash flow that will sustain our differentiated capital return.","And with that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks, guys. So maybe just to start with Advice & Wealth, so revenue growth, 1%, quarter-over-quarter, despite the fact that we got obviously benefit of higher rates and your asset growth and core metric continued pretty good. I'm assuming it's all kind of slower activity rates, but any incremental color what kind of slowed the implied fee rates in the quarter.","And I guess more importantly, as you guys look into October, any sort of notable changes given the moves in the market in terms of client allocation or any noticeable moves back into cash or anything like that would be helpful.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Alex, so the third quarter was actually quite strong on a seasonal basis. As you would imagine, the summer months are always a little slower compared to the second quarter, and therefore, even the fourth quarter. I would actually even add a little more color to that because it was a very strong quarter, is in our third quarter, we have our National Conference, which takes our top 15% of advisors away for a week and some extend mainly for two weeks. And we also have our Chairman's Advisory Council, which is our very top advisors, and they were away for a week to two weeks as well in that quarter in addition to the National Conference. So that's a compounding which is our most productive advisors also out in the summertime for special events.","So we think it was an exceptionally strong quarter. And I think if you look against the industry, you'll find that the stats are quite strong.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And October, kind of how things are trending so far.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","And October, you know, listen, there's an experienced level of volatility. Our advisors are really engaged with their clients and they're sticking to their allocation methodologies, so we do not see a shift at this point. I mean, it's early in the quarter, et cetera, but it's part of the engagements that we have with the advisors, with their clients, and we give them a lot of support to work with their clients more thinking about it over a longer term.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just my second question around Asset Management, so obviously the industry continues to be under a lot of pressure and, frankly, the market volatility's only adding fuel to the fire here. So we've seen some deals in the space. You signed off Oppenheimer. You guys have been in the past thinking about potentially pursuing acquisitions in the space. So given the fact that scale is becoming more critical and you guys have your own flow problems, but thinking about opportunities to consolidate in the industry, given the excess capital position and just kind of updated thoughts around M&A in the space.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So we continue to do a lot to improve the way we operate at Columbia Threadneedle with the capabilities we're installing, the front, middle and back office globally to give us efficiency. We do believe as we continue this journey, we'll be able to add more assets to our platforms in a more efficient and effective way. And we do look at opportunities that do arise, but we are very practical and appropriate in understanding where we can extract some really good shareholder value as well as add strategically to the business.","So we'll evaluate those things as they come along. We have the means, capability, but more importantly, we want to ensure that we can really execute something, whatever we do, appropriately and leverage it appropriately, and so we will keep our eyes out for opportunities that may make sense for us that we can extract an appropriate return and add value to the business longer term.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks and good morning. So with Long Term Care, we've seen one of your peers enter into a transaction to reduce their exposure. Given your block is seasoned with very credible experience, is a sale of your block also a possibility?","And second, you provided all the gap sensitivities to the various factors, which is very helpful, just wanted to check whether the statutory impact would be roughly similar. Thanks.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So as relates to looking at alternatives, certainly we will evaluate it from that standpoint. And our statutory reserves are higher, but the impact will be pretty much the same. But the stat is a little higher than the gap.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. In terms of kind of the fees in A&WM, you've talked about for transactional fees, there's some seasonality in the third quarter. But how should we think about the financial planning fees? In your disclosure, there seems to be some volatility throughout the years. Just wondering if there's some kind of seasonality there that we should be thinking about going into the fourth quarter.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No, you know, on actual financial planning fees, I mean, it's really depends on how the advisor on a rotating basis they do their annual fees and renewals with their clients, so it does vary based upon the time of year that they've actually executed those. So I have not looked at that. We can look at it, but I don't see there is any material changes that we would expect from year-to-year.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. And then in terms of the productivity, I do believe kind of being able to do more financial planning is one of the drivers to get to a stronger productivity number. But I was just wondering is there any kind of metric that you can share in terms of kind of the penetration of financial planning activities in your customer base?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so we are very much, to your point, it's an excellent question. We are investing even more today so that we can ensure that we can deliver a consistent level of advice to even all of our clients as we go forward. What an advisor does today is they'll do an annual plan at some time in that relationship, and so roughly 40-plus percent of our clients have a full comprehensive plan, and then there are a lesser percentage of that that do that on an ongoing annual basis.","So what we're looking to do is increase the number of clients and the consistency of that financial planning methodology being applied, and we think that's a great opportunity. So we're investing a bit more in our capabilities to digitally enable all that advice with online goal tracking and ensuring that, in an interactive way, our clients can deliver that seamlessly to more of their clients, because it does take a bit more work and engagement. And so this is one of the things I'm really excited about as we move into 2019 and I think it could be a big opportunity for us.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","So just to kind of put some context into that opportunity, like if we were to think back kind of a couple of years ago, like where would that number be in terms of clients with comprehensive financial planning?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so our annual increase in the planning activities is more in probably the high single digits a year increase. So we're looking to see if we can get that even upstated a bit more. But it's consistent with our overall productivity. We do have a good penetration compared to anyone in the industry in that regard, but it's one that I think is still an opportunity for us based on our value proposition.","Humphrey Hung Fai Lee - Dowling & Partners Securities LLC","Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Morning. Just a few Long Term Care questions, Walter, when you think about capital allocation and you think about potential risk transfer for Long Term Care, do you think you'd be able to fund that with current excess capital or would you likely have to slow or stop the buyback?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. I do not have to use excess because I believe we are adequately covered. And certainly, as I indicated, we feel comfortable with where we are at that position. So I have no assumption on using excess capital at all.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","No, my question is for potential risk transfer, not for the current maintaining the book. Do you think...","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So if you're referring to the CNO and doing risk transfers through that sort of method, obviously, again, different discount elements are used, but that would be one of the evaluation elements, but we certainly have the capacity if that was something we wanted to pursue. But the answer is, again, we would have to evaluate the facts and circumstances associated with any of those transactions.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","But we don't foresee even in a risk transfer that it would affect our buyback capability on any quarter basis.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","No. That would be a consideration that we would certainly evaluate and we don't feel that's an implication.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Got it. That's helpful. And then in terms of the morbidity experience that you are seeing, can you give a little more color for what's going on below the surface or is it frequency? Is it claim durations? Is it severity? A little more color there would be helpful.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, that's fine. It's, again, as we talked about, this is a meticulous process that we use looking at it on a consistent basis. So it's all of the above as they move through their issue age to attained age. So it's a combination of all of it. And so this is actually progressing exactly what we thought, but it's all those components together. There's no one factor that stands out. It's a combination.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then, just on the morbidity, the fact that you're not including morbidity improvement in your reserves but you're actually seeing adverse morbidity trends, is this informing you that your baseline morbidity assumptions are too aggressive? Is that something you're going to have to revisit or you still feel comfortable with those?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","I guess the short answer, we feel comfortable and this is actually the process that we follow. We don't anticipate improvement, but we evaluate the actual experience and we feel very comfortable this is the way we derived our best estimate with that knowledge.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then my final question, just given what's going on with Genworth and your reinsurance on Long Term Care with them, I understand that if Genworth does go bankrupt, you've commented that you have enhanced asset protection. But what if Genworth needs to bolster its reserves backing the Long Term Care reinsurance contract? I'm assuming that's where there would be a potential shortfall for you in the event of a Genworth bankruptcy. Am I thinking about that correctly, or is there any other offset to think about?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","I guess the short answer is no, I don't think you are thinking about it correctly because we are comfortable with their reserves and we understand it. We work well with them. And so we don't think that is in a major exposure.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","I mean, Walter, my one reaction to that is the company is selling themselves and saying this is their best option, which to me they're signaling very clearly to the market that there is an overall very big reserve deficiency. So just based on what their actions, I think they're implying to the market that there is a very big deficiency there. Is your block different than the rest? I'm just a little confused on how to interpret that.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Well, again, you're making a lot of assumptions on that basis. I do look at certainly they are sitting on surplus. And certainly we work with them. They do all our claims handling. They do our claims administration. We certainly work with their actuary. So we feel comfortable that with the process that we have in place with them that that should not be a major issue.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. I'll go away from Long Term Care. Can you speak about your expectations for G&A growth in Advice & Wealth Management? And I think last quarter you had indicated that for the full year we should expect a range of G&A growth versus 2017 of about 4% to 6%. If I've got the numbers right, you're running maybe a touch above 7% through the first nine months. Should we be thinking about that 4% to 6% range as still a good way to think about the full year or should we think about being maybe above that range?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","I think, listen, these are difficult areas, especially when you talk about splitting the difference between 1%, but we think it's totally consistent. We've had good volume growth. And a lot of those expenses are tied to that volume and certainly we are investing. So I think it is totally consistent with the outcome that we believe it will be. It may go up a little; it may go down. But we certainly feel that range is good, whether it's 6%, 7%. The deviations factors are pretty small when you get to that. But the ability to drive our margins and really drive and having good growth, that's the factor.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, Jim, I've got a bigger picture question for you. As you look out over the next couple of years, what are your strategic priorities? And I ask this, Jim, because a good part of the narrative on your company and on your stock has really been about potential structural opportunities with a few of your businesses, already earlier in the Q&A some discussion about Long Term Care, potential risk transfer. You've talked about the Auto and Home business and the improvement needed there to maybe pursue something, maybe something that can be done in combination with your Annuities business as we think about companies like Apollo and Athene that have openly talked about a willingness to do multiple product line kinds of transactions.","So with the continued discount in your stock valuation, I know it's early today, but your stock is underperforming again, is there any increased sense of urgency to pursue any of these kinds of paths?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes. So, first of all, thank you for the question because I think it's a very important one as we think through it. As we have highlighted to you a number of years ago and I tried to mention that in my opening comments, what we continue to do is be very much focused on the strategic growth of our business and generate really good returns for shareholders.","I mean, we have a 32% ROE, one of the highest in the industry, with all amortization, all costs included in it. Others look at EBITDA and everything else. So from our perspective, we're doing exactly what we told you we would do a number of years ago and we've executed quite well on it.","Our growth has been consistent. Growth of our business is really in the forte as the Advice & Wealth Management. It's almost 50% of the total business earnings right now and continues to grow nicely. We have a nice complement with the Asset Management that we manage assets for advice, as well as the same thing with the Insurance and Annuities. We have a good complement with the insurance annuities that are solutions against our retail client base, no additional acquisition costs, per se. We've got the client relationship.","And we reduced, as I promised we would do, reduced the I&A business and the balance sheet requirements tremendously over the years. It's less than 30% of our total earnings. The balance sheet is quite well risk managed and it generates a reasonably good return with cash generated.","So we actually did what we said we would do, and we'll continue to do. Now, with that, to your point, we'll always evaluate strategically opportunities. We have very good discussions with our board to see what would generate longer term shareholder value, not a quarterly basis, but longer term. And we'll make those informed decisions as those opportunities kind of rise or that we think there's a structure that makes sense for us for risk transfer.","So, definitely, we'll evaluate that as we continue to move forward. But, clearly, I would say I think sometimes we overlook what we're generating overall, the type of earnings. I mean, AWM, just as an example, excellent quarter. I know models are there for a certain reason, but consistently strong performance. And the business itself is generating great cash flow that we're returning to you and investing.","We have the opportunities for inorganic growth. And, yes, we will look at some adjustment of risk transfer in some of the businesses you'd mentioned, if it makes sense from a shareholder perspective. And we do evaluate that. We both bring people in to evaluate and we do, do it internally. So it's exactly what we do. It's a good question and I can understand why you're asking it. And if an opportunity comes along that makes sense strategically for us longer term, we will evaluate it.","John Nadel - UBS Securities LLC","Jim, I totally appreciate the response. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you. Deposit betas have been a big (49:41-49:49). Any pressure to share more of the benefit...","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We can't hear you. Could you...","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Sorry. Is that better?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yes, thank you.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Much better.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Thanks. I just had a question on sort of your deposit betas because that's been a big theme for banks and realizing your deposit balance was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter, but just are you seeing any pressure to share more of the benefit from higher rates with clients, and do you have an estimate for how much of the benefit from additional rate hikes you expect to drop to the bottom line going forward?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We continually evaluate that. We have extensive reviews of competitive elements, and we have not seen any particular pressure at this stage. We're still evaluating it. So we do anticipate maybe in the future, more will be shared. But \u2013 as we indicated, but right now, we are not seeing that.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. And then, you mentioned the plans to launch a Federal Savings Bank next year. Can you just provide an update on your thinking about the revenue opportunity there and potential bottom line impact, both near and intermediate term?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Sure. Yes. Our intentions are to certainly start the bank next year, as Jim has indicated. We've indicated when we exited the bank several years ago, at that point, we were earning around $60 million pre-tax. Our best estimates now, again, for internal sources to serve our clients in a very prudent way, that we could get up to in five years in the range of $100 million pre-tax.","Erik James Bass - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a follow-up on asset management M&A from the earlier question. I guess in recent years, you've been primarily focused on adding pretty small bolt-on deals that give you new capabilities. Is that still your focus, or would you contemplate something that would be more financially motivated that had cost savings opportunities but was less strategic when it came to new capabilities?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","You're correct. We've been looking at more of bolt-on strategically in product areas that we're not playing in, and we will continue to do that. We think that will be appropriate for us to continue to build out rather than organically build some areas where we don't have the expertise.","But no, we would entertain an appropriate larger deal. As we said, we're putting in the capabilities so that we can put more assets onto the platform more efficiently. We've been able to execute those larger deals, like Columbia, and get real good efficiencies. We've globalized now Threadneedle, so even there gives us an opportunity as we think about adding international capabilities more easily.","So yes, we would entertain that. Of course, it always looks at what the seller's looking for and we want to make sure that it's appropriate for us, what the seller's requiring versus just the idea that we can do an acquisition.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Understood. And then, just on debt capacity, I mean, how do you evaluate how much debt capacity you have? Because I think if you look at your balance sheet like a life insurance company, your debt-to-capital ratio is not particularly low, but if you look at it more like a fee-based company and debt-to-EBITDA, it would look like you have a fair amount of capacity.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We do have a fair amount of capacity. And, obviously, from that standpoint, this is reviewed with the agencies once a year. But you're correct. You can look at it both from the insurance standpoint and each agency has their own, but we do have a fair amount of debt capacity.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Klauber from William Blair. Please go ahead.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. This year and last year, you're doing a great job of growing earnings per share, obviously plus 20%. It's a very good growth rate. What about next year? I mean, if the asset growth slows down or flattens, what additional levers can you pull to get earnings growth or EPS growth at least in the low to mid-teens?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So I think we have a few levers, as again, if the markets slow down on a more consistent that we believe is going to go to go into a slower environment, we've been very able over the past, as we've reflected to you, to adjust our expense base appropriately, slow down investments, slow down some of the things that we just execute on an ongoing basis, like our advertising and various things such as that. So there's those levers we pull.","We actually can accelerate our reengineering, which gets to some more structural and other things that we've been able to execute as well and we can ramp that up. Right now, we wanted to be a little more in the investment mode because we had spent a bit amount of time on the regulation and compliance over the last few years, so we've reenergized the machine there. But we could definitely make adjustments and still keep those investments going.","So that's part of the lever. We also have a very good balance sheet right now. And we have a good excess capital that could be utilized as well if the price of the stock even goes lower on a more appropriate basis. And we could do some acquisitions as prices drop. So there's a few different levers that we would look to apply.","Adam Klauber - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, finally. All right. So a couple of quick questions, brokerage sweep fees, you came in at 173 basis points this quarter versus 157 last quarter and 111 last year. Where do you think a good normalized number could settle in?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","That strictly depends on where the Fed goes, right? Again, they've talked about doing two or three more. So certainly I think the trajectory is up, but I can't tell you how high, Andrew.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, I would just say, Andrew, as we continue to see rates go up, we will be passing more onto the client. We look at that very competitively, as Walter has said, because they started so low, the increases that you usually see off of a base that usually was there, would have been greater share in. But because you're sort of recovering from what that low point is, it hasn't been shared as much. But I see as those rates continue to rise now, getting into the little higher 2% to 3% range here, that you'll start to see a greater amount to share in.","So we'll pick up some, but I don't think we'll pick up to the extent that we picked up previously.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then, in the Auto and Home area, you mentioned favorable reserve development. Could you elaborate a little bit on maybe how much potentially there is in favorable reserve development?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, listen, I can't get into the exact number. What I can say is we've looked at this and certainly looked at our prior year and looked at the redundancies there, they have built. And we're seeing actually very favorable trends across both the Auto and Home aspects of it. So we're feeling very comfortable that the rates that we have set up and certainly looking at the frequency and severity trends that are coming in. Some are longer tail. Some are shorter tail. We have built reserves. Now we have to assess when to say they are a redundancy. But we are in a very good position at this stage.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got it. And then lastly, the consolidated tax rate, it looks like it's trending to about 16% this year. Where do you think it could go next year?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","I think it's, again, as we talked about this when this first came out, that we would be between 17% and 19%, so again, it's based on that, but that range is probably a good range. And again, might tend to the lower end of it. But certainly I would say I would keep the 17% to 19% until we refine it and then we will try to give some view of it.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And what's keeping it lower right now, Walter?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","We basically had discrete adjustments which came in from that basis. As we tell you, these are a part of the way we operate the business. You get it wherever it's discussed, settlements of different things or estimates. They come in. They're part of the effective tax rate, and that's what happened. We picked up a large one in third quarter.","Andrew Kligerman - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. 17% to 19%. Thanks a lot. Have a great day.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Starting with Long Term Care, Walter, I think to Tom's question earlier, you had said you'd be able to do a reinsurance solution without any excess capital, if I'm understanding your response correctly. So I guess what's the hold up? If it doesn't cost you any additional capital, the sensitivities here don't look that significant, so why not pursue something? I can't image there'd be a big overhang on your stock.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Let me clarify. What I'm saying is, listen, I can tell you we watched, certainly saw the CNO, and certainly discount rates there. What we're saying is obviously you're going to evaluate from the standpoint they'll evaluate the book. They'll look at the discount rates. We will assess then the improvement that you can see. So we have the capacity because, again, depends on what it takes to make the deal correct.","We believe right now we are appropriate so, therefore, the issue is, at some point depending on when we make the deal, it could have some impact and we don't know. But we have the capacity. That's all I was saying. So I'm sorry. I didn't mean to \u2013 if that was the interpretation.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, Suneet, I think to just complement Walter, and clarification, it would not affect our ability to buy back. Would it use some of the excess capital? Yes, depending on what the discount is in this marketplace for this time as people are perceiving what that risk is. We feel very good about the risk we have in the book and how we're reserved for it. Doesn't mean that if you executed a deal today, there wouldn't be a discount based on other factors that are out there.","You would have think about long-term interest rates, as an example. If they continue to rise, that's a benefit. If you factor in rate increases above our very conservative, that's a benefit. On the other side, do you factor in certain risk, as people say, of the unknown? So those are the things that we take into account.","We also look at the sort of complement of who we're doing that with to make sure strategically it makes sense for us. So those things, it's more of at a point in time rather than the idea that over time the book has a certain level of value. But, yes, even if there was that discount factor applied, we can afford it out of some of the excess capital without an issue that it would affect our buyback, as Walter continued to say, as an example and still leave us a good level of what we would call conservative nature of our balance sheet.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, the only thing I would add, just to make clear, because obviously we understand the asset earning rates. We understand discount rates. You can't understand why. The discount rate would be applied on an acquisition or an acquiring of the book. That's why it's a variable. I'm sorry if that was a misunderstanding. Hopefully, that clarified it.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, it does. And I can follow-up. Just slide 22 I thought was really interesting where you show the policy count and how much it's come down. I guess over what period is that? How many years? And then, as we think about, say, over the next five years, where does that policy count number end up going? I would imagine it comes down at a faster clip, just given the age of the block, but any just sensitivity around that?","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","I can't give you a sensitivity, but I can till this is \u2013 clearly, that will happen and certainly I can't just give you the precision of the numbers of what's going to happen. That's obviously detailed actuarial, but it will happen. And then, the question, obviously, they factored that into, as we've said, our estimates here.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","One other thing just, and I think you're all asking very good questions. So we're not opposed to a risk transfer. We will evaluate it depending on what the opportunity and the interest that's out there in the marketplace. We're also, as we said, even for some of the other business lines you mentioned, we'll always evaluate if there's a good opportunity that strategically makes sense for the business and for Ameriprise. So there's not the idea that we would not. We just want to make sure that it's in the long-term interest and strategically it's good for our clients. It's good for everyone involved. And that's the way we would look at it.","But if there's a risk transfer on this particular piece of the business, appropriate with appropriate party that would buy it, we would be open to have a good discussion.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, last one just on the overall environment, I think there was a question on this earlier, but just to clarify. If revenues are flat in 2019, do you think you have enough leverage on the expense side to reduce expenses or are these investments that you're making of the type where it's really hard to pull back now that you've started them?","James M. Cracchiolo - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so I guess it's more of a timing. If you recollect, as we went into a previous down market or a period where things soften up, the revenue comes about a little quicker than the expense. So in a quarterly basis, you've got a lag effect, but it's more of making a decision of whether that continues and then what you adjust going forward.","So I would just say over a reasonable period, we're able to adjust, but in a one quarter period or a two quarter period, you're going to have a timing lag where the revenue hits you quick because you're managing assets and your expense base, you have to make adjustments and slow down. You can't just say all the expense goes away that period. I know you know that. But I'm saying it's more of a timing issue and more of what your length of view is on that slowdown.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","So, Suneet, as a reference point...","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I was asking about 2019. I get your comment about the quarter. I was actually asking more about 2019.","Walter S. Berman - Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Yeah, so the answer is, listen, our expense base is quite large. And, as you're aware, but there's a very large portion of variable in there that is for dealed different sort of growth initiatives, where different is that we have flexibility to certainly do and, as Jim said, depends on when it happens in the year. But if assuming coming into 2019 we certainly had the capacity, I'll just remind you, doesn't mean history will repeat. Right after 2008, we actually took out a substantial amount, which we demonstrated to everybody that we had that capacity, without impacting customers. We basically as relates to growth initiatives, we reengineered it and it was a reasonable amount, so we really do have capacity to do it.","Cannot say it will negate everything, but we certainly have capacity.","Suneet Kamath - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right.

Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials available on our website.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, our 2014 annual report to shareholders and our 2014 10-K report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I will turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us for our earnings call. This morning, I\u2019ll provide my perspective on the business and Walter will discuss our financials.","Ameriprise, like the industry, was impacted by a more volatile market environment during second half of 2015. Overall, our fourth quarter results were solid. We are executing our strategy and have work to continue to do in certain areas that I\u2019ll discuss.","For the quarter, operating net revenues and operating earnings were largely flat with operating EPS up 7%. And for the full year, operating net revenues were up 1%, operating earnings grew 3% and operating EPS increased 9%. In terms of operating return on equity, Ameriprise continues to deliver at a differentiated level. We generated a new record return of 24.3% up a 130 basis points, which is one of the best in the industry.","Ameriprise continues to demonstrate strength in our ability to return capital to shareholders, returning another $569 million in the quarter. In fact, 2015 represented the fifth consecutive year, we return more than 100% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while investing for growth and maintaining our capital strength and flexibility.","Very clearly our financial foundation remains in excellent shape. In total, assets under management and administration were $777 billion as solid Ameriprise retail client flows were dampened by asset management outflows, market depreciation and an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.","Let\u2019s move to the business results in the quarter. In Advice & Wealth Management we have a strong business and I feel good about our ability to continue to help advisors build productive practices. The strength of our Advice value proposition is even more attractive in this environment. Ameriprise is well positioned to help clients and prospects in every stage of their lives and to address the full spectrum of their needs across both market cycles and their lifetimes.","We\u2019re helping advisors uptake the extension of our successful Confident Retirement approach that we launched last quarter for those who are still building their wealth. Wealth Builders, as we call them, represent more than half of our target market, consumers with $500,000 to $5 million in investable assets and they value a financial planning relationship. So this is a real opportunity for us going forward as we introduce it to our entire field force over the coming months.","We continue to invest significantly in our brand and marketing programs that help our advisors spend more time with their clients and grow their practices. Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign tells our story by illustrating the everyday movements of brilliance that they can realize by working with the right advisor in the right firm.","The campaign is doing well and outperforming competitive norms with all of our key audiences, consumers, clients and advisors. We\u2019re complementing our broadcast activity with digital channels like social media and online ads to expand the Ameriprise message and increase engagement with our brand.","Our advisors are taking advantage of Be Brilliant in their local communities in online to gain new clients and assets. Overall, client assets remain strong at $447 billion. We also had solid flows into fee-based investment advisory accounts and cash positions, increased to more than $23 billion. Clients are naturally taken a more conservative position, which is a typical pattern in this environment. But regard to our advisors, Ameriprise\u2019s value proposition and culture is attractive in the industry. It was another strong quarter for recruiting as more advisors are recognized in the strength of the Ameriprise value proposition. 82 new experienced advisors moved their practices to Ameriprise.","For the year, nearly 350 advisors joined Ameriprise in both the franchise and the employee channels. And so far, the pipeline for this year looks strong. Advisor practices are more productive because of the combination of excellent retention of our most productive advisors, very strong recruiting results and our investments in growth. The advisor productivity, a metric that we consistently grow, increased 4% year-over-year to $514,000 on a 12-month basis. We\u2019re well positioned in the marketplace in generating good profitability. In this environment, we\u2019re working closely with our advisors to handle the effects of market volatility with clients.","As clients pullback, it\u2019s important to keep them focused and engaged on their goals. People need to plan for their future and that doesn\u2019t change based on market conditions. As we look ahead, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s pending fiduciary rule will add additional requirements that will have implications for our industry as well as Ameriprise. We\u2019re hearing the DOL will be issuing the new regulation in the coming months.","With that in mind, we\u2019re very much focused on putting together our plans and resources to effectively meet the DOL\u2019s requirements, but we need to understand what the final rule will be and how it will impact our clients. We have the resources, compliance infrastructure and capabilities to respond to the DOL\u2019s objectives. And we believe that our value proposition, satisfying client needs for the long-term, has been, and will continue to be very appropriate.","Let\u2019s move to Annuities and Protection. I\u2019ll focus more on the underlying business and Walter will cover the financials. In terms of annuities, we continue to see solid sales of our variable annuities with and without living benefits in our channel. While we are in the outflows, it reflects our close third-party book and we remain focused on serving our clients. Within fixed annuities we continue to have a level of outflows given the book is in runoff as we have not been adding to it, given the current rate environment.","Our focus remains on working with advisors to help clients understand the importance of guaranteed income in a well diversified plan. It\u2019s integrated within our Confident Retirement framework and I feel good about how we\u2019re managing the business, developing and enhancing our competitive products and features while managing risk.","Within Protection, Life & Health, we closed the year with a nice increase in sales driven by UL products. And while Life claims were higher than a year ago, we recognize there will be fluctuations quarter-to-quarter and these movements are within our planned ranges. We have a good book and we\u2019re working with our advisors to serve clients protection needs. The environment does create growth challenges for these longer-term products, but at the same time, it reinforces the importance of protecting what matters most to clients.","In Auto & Home, we were disappointed with the financial results in the quarter. As you saw, we did increase reserves this quarter for higher claims experience in some of the older business. New business is performing in line with our expectations. Walter will explain that in more detail.","We continue to make a number of enhancements to improve the financial performs and risk characteristics of the business. We brought in significant resources and leadership to continue to enhance our pricing, underwriting and claims management. We feel that we are making the progress necessary, but we recognize it will take time for the benefits to work through book and be fully realized. Importantly, we continue to maintain our strong client satisfaction of affinity relationships in Auto & Home.","In asset management we\u2019re generating solid financial results and executing our strategy focused on gaining market share and profitable flows. With $472 billion in assets under management, we have an at-scale business with a diversified base of assets and earnings and we are focused on serving more individual and institutional clients in key markets globally.","For the quarter, operating earnings were $193 million, as revenues were largely flat and earnings were down a bit year-over-year from the timing of a few expense items and investments in the business, including supporting our new Columbia Threadneedle Investments brand in our key regions of the U.S., UK, Europe and Asia. Investment performance remains quite strong. I\u2019d highlight U.S. and European equities, asset allocation and tax exempt fixed income as particular strengths.","Our investment teams in the U.S., London and Singapore are demonstrating the importance of active management, both in terms of capital appreciation as well as preservation, given the volatility we\u2019re experiencing. On the product front, in Europe we\u2019re seeing good sales in our UK and European equity products. Here in the U.S. we\u2019ve had good traction with sales in large cap equity products as well as in our strategic income fund. And within the solution space our carrier [ph] (0:10:14) strategy continues to gain interest.","From an overall flows perspective, we had about $700 million of net outflows in the quarter with reinvested dividends. This did include a higher level of outflows at U.S. Trust. However, underlying flow trends are improving and I\u2019ll take you through it.","Let\u2019s start with institutional. Total outflows were driven by about $6 billion in net outflows of former parent assets, largely driven by outflows of low fee, fixed income, common trust funds in IMA\u2019s at U.S. Trust given the changes they have made. We mentioned this last quarter and expect continued IMA outflows of several billion dollars at U.S. Trust in the first half of 2016. In addition we and others in the industry continue to experience outflows from a large client who redeemed from strong performing strategies to address liquidity concerns. That was approximately $1.4 billion in the quarter, and we expect at least $1 billion of additional outflow in the first quarter. These two components, low-fee, former parent assets in a single large client, muted continue progress in third-party institutional flows. We have strong client and consultant relationships, a solid list of one not funded mandates and a good pipeline, which we expect will drive flows this year.","Let\u2019s now move to retail. In the U.S. we\u2019re seeing positive trends from the work the team has done to focus our sales strategy. However, this was muted from a flows perspective given continued outflows in the Acorn Fund. The fund short-term performance has improved from the changes we\u2019ve made, including adding an experienced lead PM, who came onboard at year end. We expect outflows will continue to near-term as the team reestablishes the funds longer-term track record.","In addition, in the quarter we made the decision to end the subadvisory relationship with Marsico Capital Management, given the strength of our global investment capabilities. This resulted in a few hundred million of outflows in the fourth quarter. We plan to ask shareholders to support our plans to merge certain funds in 2016. In addition, we expect outflows of about $700 million in Marsico managed institutional SMA\u2019s in the first quarter. Based upon the previous servicing relationship with them, these outflows will have no financial impact.","Overall, we\u2019ve been able to grow gross sales and market share in the larger broker dealer and independent channel in the past year at a time when gross sales declined for the industry. This bodes well as industry sales may pick up down the line. We recognize we need to do more to increase both gross and net sales in U.S. retail, but I feel good about the business, the team in place and our strategy. We\u2019re seeing early results.","With regard to European retail, we continue to build on our strong presence in the UK and serve more clients in key markets on the continent. At $1.4 billion in the quarter, European retail flows bounced back strongly from a tough third quarter. The market environment so far this year is clearly challenging, but we\u2019re focused on what we can control. We\u2019re generating strong performance for clients. We have a good product line and distribution. I feel good about the team in place, the moves we are making and the traction we have in key initiatives and asset management.","Overall, the company is performing well and our core businesses are strong. Ameriprise delivered solid earnings in a more difficult environment. Higher market volatility and declines have clearly shaped the start of 2016. We\u2019ve managed through difficult market cycles before and we\u2019re very much focused on executing our strategy, connecting with clients and advisors and driving results.","Ameriprise has the ability and long-term perspective to continue to invest as we navigate the environment, capture our opportunities and generate shareholder value. We have a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders and intent to continue to return to shareholders as we have as well as maintain our excellent financial foundation. We\u2019re focused on keeping the company strong as we look for further growth opportunities.","With that I\u2019d like to hand things over to Walter to review the numbers.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. I\u2019d like to build on what Jim shared with you, as we review the financial results. As context, markets were volatile and on a downward trend in the second half of 2015, which impacted revenues for our growth businesses. However, the results we delivered in the quarter were strong. The one exception is Auto & Home business where we were disappointed with the results, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail when I review the segments.","We remained opportunistic in repurchasing our stock at an elevated level in the quarter given the pull back in the valuation and still believe our stock is undervalued. Our capacity to buyback stock remains strong given our balance sheet fundamentals and the business mix generates strong free cash. We are committed to maintaining a differentiated level of capital return.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. Macro conditions impact revenue in a few ways. We had limited equity appreciation which impacted asset under management. Volatility also suppress client activity and contributed to asset management outflows. Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses and foreign exchange translation impacted asset levels and earnings.","These impacts were felt across all financial services companies and we are not unique in this regard. As you can see total revenue growth was not at the level we had seen in the past. All the markets and lower interest rates which decreased AUM and client activity, slowed. This muted the impact of areas where we successfully built the wealth management business through increased wrap flows, growth in insurance and annuity sales and building cash sweep levels as clients wait for a less volatile environment to make investment decisions.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 5. Ameriprise delivered solid growth in EPS and return on equity, demonstrating the multiple leverage we have to manage the business and variety of market environments. Specifically, we managed G&A expenses, investing for growth in targeted areas but remaining disciplined. This combined with solid tax planning and share repurchase, supported good 7% EPS growth. The operating effective tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter, which is lower than we had anticipated driven by the level of dividends received deduction coming in harder than we expected.","Turning to segment performance, starting with AWM on Slide 6. The Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform well, delivering solid financial results. Operating net revenue was $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 1% from last year. Our revenue growth slowed due to the impact of market levels of volatility and didn\u2019t experience the typical lift we have seen from markets. Wrap net flows were quite good at $2.1 billion, despite the deterioration in the markets and flat client activity levels.","Total expenses increased 2% year-over-year, driven by higher distribution expense. G&A expenses in the quarter were flat year-over-year and also flat for the full year 2015 versus full year 2014. On a sequential basis, we had a normal uptick in G&A related to elevated advertising spend and other timing related items in the quarter. This resulted in earnings of $210 million and a strong margin of 16.6%. Margin for the full year was up to 17.1% from 16.5% in the prior year. Results were achieved with little benefit of increasing short interest rates.","We had $23.5 billion of brokerage cash balances. We anticipate a more material benefit in the first quarter from this fed rate hike, with a majority of the first 25 basis point increase flowing to the bottom line. Asset management continues to provide a solid contribution to our revenue and earnings, as you\u2019ll see on Slide 7. Operating net revenue is essentially flat at $833 million, reflecting marginal growth in equity markets and the cumulative impact of net outflows, partially offset by strong CLO benefits and the performance fees in the quarter.","Expenses were up due to elevated performance fee compensation, as well as the timing of certain project related cost. We remain committed to delivering strong profitability by tightly managing expenses. Pretax operating earnings were $193 million, down 3% from last year. Again, this reflects the impact of marks and outflows, partially offset by elevated performance fees.","Turning to annuities on Slide 8, the segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pretax earnings increased $6 million from a year ago to $129 million. We are maintaining good profitability in this book. Fixed annuity pretax earnings declined to $23 million due to elevated lapses as the block runs off as it comes out of the surrender charge period. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales and as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down.","Turning to the protection segment on the next slide. Pretax operating earnings were $35 million in the quarter.","Let\u2019s focus on Life & Health first. Pretax operating earnings benefited from $28 million from an assumption change related to our waiver reserve. Underlying earnings were pressured by elevated life and long-term care claims which were at the higher end of our expectations, as well as continued low interest rates in the mix-shift from VUL to iUL.","Moving to Auto & Home, we were disappointed with the results in the quarter. We built reserves by $57 million, primarily in the auto book from the 2014 and prior accident years. Driving this was elevated frequency and severity experience for auto injury claims, which is in line with the trends the industry has experienced. Additionally, we did not see the level of impact in improving the outcome of 2014 and prior accident year existing claims as much as we\u2019d previously expected.","We\u2019ve been focused on operational improvements this year, including our pricing to risk. We have begun rate actions on almost 95% of the Auto base and approximately 80% of the Home, which will take time to be seen in the financial results. These actions have been effective in slowing sales across product lines and performance for 2015 accident year is in line for our expectations. While results in the quarter did not meet our expectations, we are aggressively pursuing additional business improvements, anticipate better profitability in 2016.","Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital is approximately $2.5 billion with an RBC ratio of approximately 640%. Our hedging program has been quite effective and the investment portfolio remains strong and I will get into our energy exposure momentarily.","We continue to return over a 100% of operating earnings to shareholders with $569 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. For the year, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders, which was a 125% of operating.","Looking into 2016, we plan to return 90% to 100% of earnings to shareholders as a baseline. But we will be optimistic based on valuation. There has been a lot of interest in the energy sector given our oil prices. So I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to give you more detail on our portfolio. As you\u2019ll see on Slide 11, we have approximately $3.3 billion of energy sector exposure. The duration is short on these energy holdings with over 35% maturing in less than three years. We feel quite comfortable with our holdings for the following reasons.","We have a consistent rigorous research process behind our investment decisions. As we analyze investment opportunities, we consider low commodity prices when we analyze, stress test and purchase energy company volumes. Our analysis focuses on key variable such as a company\u2019s core structure, balance sheet health, flexibility of CapEx budget, asset coverage, and our assessment of management quality and behaviors.","Approximately $1.2 billion of our energy exposure is to pipelines, which are essentially the infrastructure to move oil, oil products and natural gas from the producer to the end users. The vast majority of our exposure is with a handful of the largest U.S. pipeline operators. These pipeline operators are highly regulated and receive most of their revenues from contracts where the customers pay a reservation charge regardless of the quantity and price of product being moved. In many cases, these pipeline assets originate at the wellhead, making this pipeline infrastructure essential to the producers.","Additionally, contract terms with producers and customers are generally multi-year in duration. The rest of our energy exposure focuses on large diversified North American-based companies. While we anticipate that some investment grade holdings maybe downgraded to high-yield by the rating industries. We do believe that these companies have the financial flexibility to weather this extreme pricing environment. We have already seen these management teams taking aggressive actions that we would expect of them.","Reducing their cost structures, cutting capital expenditures related to future production growth, reducing or eliminating dividends, undertaking asset sales and even issuing equity, all with an eye towards living within cash flow as these distressed commodity prices continue. So far we have only two downgrades from investment grade to high-yield in the energy space.","The last thing I\u2019ll mention is that the team we have in place today is the same team that managed our portfolio well during the global financial crisis. In fact, approximately 30% of our overall energy exposure was purchased in 2008 and 2009 when commodity and bond prices were last near these levels.","Overall, I feel very good about our financial performance in the quarter and in the year. We delivered solid earnings growth in the face of challenging market conditions. 2016 is off to a difficult start with continued market deterioration and volatility, which will pressure results if it persists. However, we have managed through challenging environments in the past and we have the levers to do so this year.","We have an excellent track record returning capital to shareholders in a meaningful way and will continue to do so opportunistically.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hey, thanks good morning. First question is can you give us a rough sense of the fee rate differential between the former parent related outflow that you\u2019ve referenced at the low fee and new sales at this point?","Walter Berman","If you\u2019re looking for the differential from the \u2013 the differential that we had on from a basis point on fee that\u2019s what you\u2019re talking about?","Ryan Krueger","Yeah, or even distressed roughly\u2026","Walter Berman","Okay roughly approximately again for the inflows and outflows again looking at that as we talk about the low base point it was about nine point differential between the inflows were about nine points higher than the outflows. And obviously the U.S. Trust element was substantially lower than \u2013 at the lower end of flow basis points revenue.","Ryan Krueger","Okay, got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then secondly have you seen any improvement in the M&A environment given lower property valuation in the asset management sector?","Jim Cracchiolo","I would say that there seems to be a bit more activity going on I think the stuff that was out there a little over the course of this year was still at a bit more elevated price but I would probably see if we continue in this environment that things would probably either come forth more or be in a better valuation basis.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And then just last quickly. Do you have a tax rate expectation for 2016?","Walter Berman","Yes. Right now we \u2013 it should in the range of 24% to 26%.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Great, thank you.","Operator","We have question from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. So I realize, we ended the year with a pretty challenging environment with deteriorating and volatile markets, but it seems like this is continuing this year. Can you give us any sense of how the first month of the year is looking for you?","Jim Cracchiolo","What I would probably say is, with the increase volatility at the beginning of the year we\u2019ll probably going to see client activity slow a bit, as people sort of get to a better perspective of where the markets are balancing out to put more money to work. I think, as you saw in the fourth quarter even though we had good client inflows, we did build cash balances, usually what you find is, you begin the year those cash balances will go to work a lot quicker in the first quarter. We\u2019re probably seeing and being held more now until the volatility sort of calms down, there\u2019s a little more direction to the markets.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then, if we turn to the Auto & Home business. I understand it was a little disappointing on year end as well. Do you still expect it to be profitable in 2016 as you had indicated earlier?","Walter Berman","Certainly from the standpoint, the action we\u2019ve taken in and certainly looking at the 2014, we \u2013 our expectations are that it should, but it\u2019s going to be at the real low-end of that profitability.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And I guess, I am surprised a little bit to see the continued \u2013 the continued prior-year reserve developments and now I guess going back to 2014 as well. I haven\u2019t really seen that coming from other auto players in the industry. And I\u2019m just curious what is it that, that really makes this business so difficult to get the reserves right for, particularly in Ameriprise\u2019s case?","Walter Berman","Well, okay. Let me try to answer it. Again, I can only take you through what we see in the industry statistics and other things like. But when you\u2019re looking as long date as you look at BI under-insured and fiscal damage, what you\u2019re seeing there is, we had claims on the books looking at this and this is typical I think for the industry and as I go through their aging cycle, the environment has become a lot more litigious and I think that\u2019s not just exclusively for us, I think that is an overall situation. And the \u2013 basically assessing as we looked it, we added the staff and certainly started looking at the claims performance and aspects, it realized and this was more and more our case reserves were we need to be bolstered as it relates to the 2014 and prior. And again if you look at up to 2014 you are looking at probably more severity and in 2014 combination of severity and frequency.","So we therefore how do we increase our case reserves to do that we are now believe certainly assessing the situation that we have \u2013 we\u2019re more confident that these reserves will be adequate and certainly that the amount of staff. But I think, the reason why I don\u2019t see some of it even though \u2013 again we talk about claims on liability have deteriorated I think there are other firms probably have high reserve capabilities basically or whether that situation and we did not as we were building.","Last year when we built reserves we would built in more \u2013 we went into 2014 we were caught that what we reserving in that year as we indicated was \u2013 when we assessed it at the end of day it was not adequate and that\u2019s were the majority of that money went. We\u2019ve seen for every deterioration like I said in BI and UAM and UM.","Yaron Kinar","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We have a question from Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I just had a couple questions about Advice & Wealth Management expenses. First, how much of your G&A expenses variable cost? So if you do see revenue pressure from market conditions, how should we think about the impact on margins?","Walter Berman","Again, as you look the \u2013 as a rough rule of thumb, again, it\u2019s three category fixed \u2013 semi-variable and variable, I would say variable in that case would be about its third and again from that standpoint and certainly we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past our ability to approximately assessed the situation see what expenditures provide this sort of return and we do so, we have flexibility.","Erik Bass","Got it. And can you help us think about the level of expenses you may need to incurred to comply with the DOL rules and as this something you maybe able to offset to reengineering or should we expect some net impact in 2016 once kind of the final rules are out?","Walter Berman","No right now we are assessing obviously from the standpoint the rules have not been distributed but certainly we realized that if we reread it \u2013 depending on, there will be development expense and there will be some on going operational expense. We hope to then certainly we\u2019ve been in a plan for mode, at this stage trying to be proactive. But again, not having the full elements of that is difficult to put a number on. But it will \u2013 we will then look to what reengineering and basically repositioning we would have to do. And I think that is something as this comes out, we\u2019ll be more direct about it. And again, it\u2019s something that we are focusing on and be part of the development, I don\u2019t know if Jim wants\u2026","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. I think what I would say right now is we do \u2013 we have mobilized our resources. We\u2019re looking at all aspects from the compliance to the technology, to training necessary for the advisor force. And we will go into the deployment of that as soon as we know exactly what the rule looks like. We\u2019re doing some work already to prep for that and get a various activities under way that we think based on some of the directions that we are in the previous proposal, and that\u2019s already in the functional requirements and stuff from a tech perspective.","Depending on how significant that is and what the changes we think we do have the capabilities to accommodate that or adjust for it. There will be impacts and expense from it, we will offset some of that based on what we will tighten the range, and for some other things we might have underway as this takes a priority. So there will be some offset there.","Having said that, I couldn\u2019t tell you, in the short-term depending on how aggressive the timetable for implementation is, what we would have to do to heavy up on some of the resourcing necessary, but as I said I think Ameriprise will be one of the companies that would have the ability to deal with this more effectively. We do have the resource capability and can move things around to try to accommodate that. And we will set up so that in the end hopefully we will be a place that would be a better able to serve.","Erik Bass","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Nadel from Piper Jaffray.","John Nadel","Good morning, everybody. First question is, related to Advice & Wealth Management, I\u2019m curious, Jim, market volatility and maybe client activity slowing certainly make some sense. And it\u2019s sort of a continuation from what we saw in the third quarter. I\u2019m just curious whether you\u2019re seeing, or you believe you\u2019re seeing, any impact just yet in the results from the proposal \u2013 from the DOL proposal or are advisors already starting to adjust?","Jim Cracchiolo","No. I would say as advisors are as curious as you all are, to what exactly this will mean et cetera. And we\u2019re starting to give them a little better sense and communication on that. What I would just say is I think what you\u2019re seeing more near-term is more of the volatility picked up in the market. And you have some \u2013 in our case, we run a lot of assets in the Management fee-based business and so you have that depreciation at the end of the third quarter. But as you saw, we still got $2 billion into our outflows, our cash balances increased by a few billion.","So I think at the end of the day, activities still going on. I think people are just like you and I probably looking and saying is there another leg down, what is it? What\u2019s the level of volatility? I think on the other side, we are not seeing wholesale changes to client activity or people pulling money or anything like that, but I think people are more stayed in tune. There\u2019s still money going to work and some people are using this as an opportunity. But I think at the end of day, I think the increased volatility always gives people a little pause.","John Nadel","And then related to that Jim, most of \u2013 I think at this point most of your competitors who have some sort of an advice base business have really tried to quantify at least provide some sensitivity around where they might expect to see some of the impacts from the DOL proposal. Assuming it goes through as it\u2019s currently written in it and it seems more, more likely that there won\u2019t be any significant changes to it. I\u2019m just wondering now \u2013 many months to evaluate the proposal whether you can help us with some sensitivities on where you might see some impacts on your revenues and margins?","Jim Cracchiolo","What I would say is this \u2013 I think one of the things people have identified is the idea that if they\u2019re unable to sell rates et cetera or some of the type of broker transactions into the qualified accounts and what would that do to revenue. I would just say over the course of this year based on changes in regulations and other things and where the market was, our advisors pulled back from that. So I think that pullback from that\u2019s going to be less significant because it was already occurred in on numbers in 2015 in a large way, because you know there are a level of changes happening there already.","I think in regard to the business overall it really depends on where the DOL comes out with their best interest contract exemption. And if they truly are giving you the ability to do commission-based business within that and to satisfy your obligations there, that\u2019s one method. If they\u2019re saying, no, we don\u2019t like that and we want to move more to fee-based. Yes, we can accommodate that as well. We\u2019re trying to figure out which way that \u2013 as far as the actual final rule. You would imagine that there\u2019s going to be some increase in compliance and cost disclosure and various things like that, but over time, we will get everything adjusted for it.","It\u2019s hard to really say, we probably see some adjustments that would happen in the idea of the commission type business for these accounts. We do see that \u2013 a lot of our annuity business. I know that was one of the things that people mentioned, but a lot of our annuity business today very, very little almost none of it is done without the extra debt benefits or living guarantees or something that. Again, the administration has said that\u2019s still important. So we are still under the impression that under the best interest contract you can still actually do those things as long as you satisfy the requirements of the value provided and what that is and how you disclose it, et cetera.","So that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying it\u2019s kind of hard to give you an adjustment. But we have all the what if\u2019s depending on where we go, what we\u2019re planning on doing is as soon as we get that information, we\u2019ll come out in a more informed way and let you know what that is. We already know that there are a number of offsets that we can do by adjusting things, including what fees we charge and don\u2019t charge and where we do it. On the other side of it, it\u2019s hard to tell exactly what is permissible at this point. I hope that \u2013 I wish \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to get ahead of my skis on this.","John Nadel","No, I understand. And if I can just ask one more question on the asset management side. Just curious whether you could help us with what the underlying either the fee rate or the operating margin, what that looked like in the segment in the quarter if you adjusted out the performance fees in the CLO again?","Jim Cracchiolo","Okay. Yes, on that basis it would be pretty similar to what you\u2019ve seen before in the 53% range.","John Nadel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays.","Jay Gelb","Thanks and good morning. On the capital management perspective, I know you\u2019re sticking with your baseline of around 100% return of capital in terms of dividends and buybacks, it is 125% last year, given the drop in the share price, which I think is largely due to macro conditions. Is there a hard stop in terms of what percentage of annual earnings the company would return to shareholders buybacks and dividends?","Jim Cracchiolo","I don\u2019t believe we have a hard stop, we certainly evaluated and look to see our assessment of the shares on the value in the environment and we certainly understand the fundamentals of the business. So we have the capacity and capability. So there is no hard stop on it, but as we\u2019ve seen in different years we moved to 120% 125%.","So we will assess that based upon the circumstances of the \u2013 how we feel about the environment and obviously the excess position that we have. But we do believe the shares are undervalued right now and opportunistically we will certainly assess that and what like we did in the last quarter and certainly with the price being down, certainly you have more bang for your buck with the money being spent.","Jay Gelb","Okay. My next question is on Advice & Wealth. The margin in the fourth quarter did not increase for the first time for any quarter, I think over three years. I\u2019m just wondering what that means on an ongoing basis? Do you feel in this environment especially given what\u2019s happened in the first quarter with equity markets that there\u2019s any chance of margin improving versus the 17.1% in 2015.","Jim Cracchiolo","What I would say is this, if you look at the fourth quarter, actually the fourth quarter margin is pretty good. I mean our overall revenue stayed, it didn\u2019t go down or anything like that. But we had an impact because the lower markets at the end of the third quarter and as our wrap fee business builds at the beginning of that quarter \u2013 through the quarter. You sure of that it would be impacted because assets are depreciated by \u2013 it was 8% or 10% whatever it was from the beginning at the end of the third quarter. So did have some impact in the revenue based on the billings for low \u2013 from the depreciation that occurred.","The transaction activity was pretty much consistent with previous quarters it didn\u2019t necessarily go down in the fourth quarter. We usually see a little more activity that happening at the end of the year, the way our expenses sort of a crew particularly as we do our advertising because that\u2019s really a fall campaign as an example advertising expenses picked up in the quarter but that\u2019s consistent with the prior year and the year before that et cetera.","So expenses always go up a little in the quarter. On a full-year basis, we\u2019re still only relatively flat in G&A and year-over-year in G&A is consistent because of the quarterly accruals. So I would just say what happens is you always have that little extra expense coming in the fourth quarter because our advertising campaign, there was an extra payroll week et cetera, pay period and things like that, but we didn\u2019t increase expenses at all. And what happened was we didn\u2019t get the lift of revenue needed from all the wrap balances coming in previous quarters, because the market depreciated. So that\u2019s why the margin compressed.","Now going forward, I think if you\u2019d say, the markets up 10% from where we were in the equity, it\u2019s going to impact our fees, I mean we run a very large fee-based business. So I would say margins were compressive, the markets don\u2019t bounce back only because that\u2019s going to take a chunk out of your revenue. Now we\u2019ll adjust and think about expenses, but again you can only adjust expenses going out not necessary for what\u2019s there today.","Jay Gelb","Yes, that makes sense. Jim, for the overall company\u2026","Jim Cracchiolo","On the other side, interest maybe a little more of a benefit, because the short rate was up 25 basis points. So that will help us in the first quarter. I don\u2019t know the actual numbers one versus the other depends on where the markets are.","Jay Gelb","Right. Jim, for the overall company in 2016 included there\u2019s a benefit on EPS from the share buyback, but directionally would it be pretty reasonable to expect kind of a flat EPS in 2016 given pressures especially from equity markets?","Jim Cracchiolo","I haven\u2019t done the calculations in my head yet, because I\u2019m trying to figure out the markets but I let Walter to go over that.","Walter Berman","I think, listen the markets as Jim said, are certainly effect us. And the thing that we then have to assess is the impact it has on the client behavioral aspects and then the actions that we think are prudent to sustained growth and everything\u2019s in that and how you adjusted. So there\u2019s a lot of elements there but it certainly a challenging\u2026","Jim Cracchiolo","About buyback and the EPS\u2026","Walter Berman","But the buyback, again, you will have an impact on it, but again is it going to be able to negate, I can\u2019t say at that stage as we assess the \u2013 those other variables.","Jay Gelb","All right. Thank you for the insight.","Operator","We have a question from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet Kamath","Hi, good morning. Just I wanted to go back to Auto & Home for a second. Is there anything structural about that business, whether the distribution relationship you have with Costco or anything like that that would preclude your ability to either exit it or use reinsurance to free capital?","Walter Berman","From the standpoint of exiting free capital, there is no restrictions from that standpoint. And the other thing I would say, Suneet, the basic business fundamentals of this, and certainly looking at it \u2013 we\u2019ve looked at it, and we\u2019ve had outside consultants look at it, the basic fundamentals is quite solid. But in the contractual elements, I think we can certainly manage the balance sheet.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, but Suneet, I mean, we do run a direct affinity business, and our partnerships are very critical to that business. And so very important is this is why our business is something we want to get back to a really good state. And we want to then ensure that we\u2019re continuing to deliver. And we are and have been, and that really has reinforced the idea of our growth over the last number of years. Now with that as I said, the most appropriate for us, for a shareholders, from a relationship, from a partnership and the longevity of the business is to get this back to a good strong state. And then that gives us a lot more ability to think of and how to continue to force the good partnerships or good arrangements for the future.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. But I guess we\u2019re looking at a difficult 2015, very low profitability in 2016. It doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s anything structural that would prevent you from exiting. We\u2019ve run the math that suggests if you free capital from it, it would be more EPS accretive than turning it around. And that was when the stock price was, I think, I don\u2019t know, $105 and now we\u2019re looking at $20 lower than that. So why is that math wrong?","Walter Berman","I can\u2019t \u2013 our math and when we look at it, it is \u2013 we \u2013 as Jim has said the business, we believe is fundamentally a sound business. We believe it\u2019s in the best interest from the shareholder perspective to take the approach that we are. And so I know certainly it\u2019s taking this reserve increase certainly is impactful. We do believe the structural elements moving forward for us are good as we talked about them. And we do \u2013 we have a view that from a shareholder basis, fixing it and assessing is the best approach.","You know it takes time to get these price increases, these price to risk elements adjusted through, and we certainly focus on the infrastructure, the investment we\u2019ve made in people and capabilities will pay dividends for us. And relationships are unique and very valuable and certainly provide the capability to have good returns forward. And we certainly are trying to fix \u2013 we think we have addressed the old, now we are moving forward and putting in place, but it does take time to get there. And we did miss on the basis of how much impact we could have with the 2014 prior. That\u2019s our view of it.","Jim Cracchiolo","And Suneet, we do evaluate we\u2019re not looking and we do evaluate all various options and ability. I would just tell you that based on everything would including other people looking et cetera that this is the way to create the best shareholder value and to maintain the strength of that business for the future for whatever it may come than what we\u2019re doing right now. So I know looking at it from just a mechanic and what you think, but I would probably say being a bit more in understanding it. Now that\u2019s where we come out and we will get this back to where it\u2019s in good shape and in some way creating a future shareholder value of greater means.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. I guess we will revisit that. Then in terms of the excess capital and the buyback, maybe to follow up on Jay Gelb\u2019s question, it just seems to me that you have \u2013 there\u2019s $2.5 billion of excess capital. It\u2019s a pretty sizable component of your total equity. Market doesn\u2019t seem to giving you any credit for that excess capital. So I know you want to be opportunistic but can you flush out a little bit more, just maybe the pace of buyback just so we get a sense of how aggressive you\u2019re thinking about being?","Walter Berman","Again, I think we\u2019ve been \u2013 as we look to 2015 certainly looked at the latter half of 2015, we certainly accelerated the base and certainly from the dollar standpoint and certainly in the number of shares, as the elements there. So we do believe \u2013 as we assess that sort of positioning is the right one to continue with. But we look at it each quarter and assess the impact.","So I think it\u2019s a good gauge maybe \u2013 from our standpoint being optimistic about it that what we did in the latter half of the year is something that is a barometer to start that we would continue with where the price is. And but again, we get into assessing the excess, the environment, we feel very comfortable about that. So I think it\u2019s a pretty good barometer if you use the latter half of the year.","Suneet Kamath","All right. So filled in 425 for quarter and maybe there\u2019s some opportunistic upside to that?","Walter Berman","It seems like that\u2019s latter half of the year.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We have our question from Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse.","Tom Gallagher","Good morning. So first just a follow-up on that last question, can you talk about priorities right now? Obviously you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019ve upsized the buyback a little bit in the latter half of the year. But I know you\u2019ve also discussed contemplating M&A. Can you talk about, just given where your stock is, whether M&A opportunities are still on the table? Or is your money to better put to work just through buybacks right now? That\u2019s my first question.","Jim Cracchiolo","No. M&A is definitely on the table and if we see things that come along that are appropriate for us, we have the means to do it. I think having the capital position, we do have gives us the flexibility. We won\u2019t have to go out and leverage ourselves to do something bigger. We wouldn\u2019t have to go raise equity in a difficult market, which doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. And over time, we also can return back in a more, what I would call stronger way, so that you always have something there in addition to whether you\u2019re in a weak market requirement to buy back more. So that\u2019s the way we thought about it.","I mean, I remember before the financial crisis a number of investors asked us to, and analyst why aren\u2019t we returning more? Why don\u2019t we go out in the risk curve? Why don\u2019t we get more higher-yielding instruments et cetera, et cetera? And I think they thanked me afterward in a sense that we kept the company on a consistent path, we did appropriately having the flexibility in the means to navigate and we did have the opportunity than to do a bigger deal even though we had to do, because it was a little bigger deal because the environment was still unsettled. We actually just did some equity at the same time.","So I would just say Ameriprise is very well situated. And if this market gets even more difficult, I think we\u2019re actually one of the stronger players to actually be able to capitalize on it. If it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll be able to continue to buy back our stock at good numbers and still be able to keep the company strong not knowing what the next step for the turn of the environment or an M&A comes along. So I actually think were situated well and this is actually kind of a good environment for Ameriprise in that sense.","Tom Gallagher","Got you. And, Walter, just a question on Advice & Wealth margin. So, and I realize you may not have the precise answer this time but I just want to know if you can answer this directionally. A little better than 16.5% margins in Advice & Wealth in 4Q was lower than where it\u2019s been trending lately. But if I consider the benefit you\u2019re going to get from higher short-term rates, plus the seasonal expense reduction that you typically get from 4Q to 1Q, and then I consider the offset of the weaker revenues, assuming we don\u2019t change a lot from current market levels, would you still expect margins to be lower than the 4Q level? Or I should just ask it this way, would you expect margins to come in below the level of 4Q or can you give us a sense directionally?","Walter Berman","Directionally, certainly as Jim has indicated, the market reduction and the deterioration impacts it, but again you\u2019re talking about margin. So the question is really getting to base profitability and then of course remember revenues going to be moving and also profitability and the actions we then take. I think the elements \u2013 the moving parts of the market both interest and with equity certainly compounds a little, but then the actions we will be taking as we look at that in the interest lift.","Underlying direction of the business is solid, so I think and then \u2013 but the question is client behavior, so it is a difficult question. The fundamentals are there, but we do get impacted by these variables that we just can\u2019t control. That\u2019s the non-controllable side then we get to the action that we take to manage the business. So margins are tough one because you got moving \u2013 a lot of moving parts on it, but profitability certainly will be impacted by the drop in the equity marks offset by the interest lift. And then it\u2019s a matter of how it affects the client activity both from the level and then the shifting, right.","So that\u2019s why it\u2019s a tough one, really is. But the fundamentals where we\u2019re going is solid certainly from that standpoint. As Jim has said, we\u2019re attracting advisors, we\u2019re certainly feel comfortable about the fundamentals of business. And so there\u2019s no change from that standpoint.","Tom Gallagher","Got you.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, please. I\u2019m sorry\u2026","Tom Gallagher","Just one last follow-up, if I could, on the asset management business. The spike in the U.S. Trust net outflows, can you comment a bit about the pool of assets that remain that you believe are at risk, the level of outflows that you expect going forward? I presume we are going to keep getting leakage. But this one was obviously kind of a jumbo redemption quarter on that end. But can you give a little color in terms of where you see that trending?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So let me just say a few things on that, and I know that was a bit of a sizable number. And as you saw it, it came out of the institutional section. So this is very, very low-fee type of assets. We were doing the business, it was part of an in-house operation et cetera that we had as part of Columbia, we were supporting the U.S. Trust business. And it\u2019s unfortunate that they are taking it back in-house actually to manage it and it\u2019s all fixed income assets.","Having said that, even though we don\u2019t like to lose it, it\u2019s a very different on a fee basis than the business that we are riding and continue to do. I think, so it will be another few billion we understand, we don\u2019t know exactly. I mean, we\u2019re not sitting here and saying, we taking these accounts and different clients et cetera, but we can say, it could be another few billion.","Having said that, I will be very clear, our stronger business with U.S. Trust is a funds business, and an equity products and all those various things, and those continue on. It would be nice if I was able to just \u2013 not just report flows, as the flown number in total, but again, this is part of when you do deal that has a proprietary business and you\u2019ve taken it over. You are going to have some of those things. We still have our Zurich and we still have a good account, good relationship, good overall fee basis.","So what I would say in looking through this, and I\u2019ll just give you some numbers. And as you know the fourth quarter wasn\u2019t a great quarter for the industry and outflows because of what\u2019s happening. But I would say if you take out the U.S. Trust particularly around this, and the normal Zurich that was $6.6 billion of our outflow, okay. And even though we don\u2019t like that per se, it was the lower fee end of the spectrum there in that regard. If you then look at all of retail, retail would\u2019ve only been out $1.6 billion. This is before reinvested dividends, and all of that was the Acorn Fund.","So if we can continue to improve that performance et cetera in this study, we\u2019re actually moved to almost a net neutral on our retail. And we\u2019re making some good progress in growing in the core retail channels and Europe is continues to be good for us. Then you look at institutional, and here again, you take out the U.S. Trust, which was buried in there and at the end of the day, what you really have is on net $1 billion out. And that\u2019s in a tough market where institutions aren\u2019t necessarily funding at this point in time. And that $1 billion funding, 1\/4 of it was one client, and that client has taken a lot more out of the industry.","So as I\u2019m looking at this and it\u2019s hard to see based on you\u2019re seeing the total number. We\u2019re actually are making some underlying progress. The industry in total last year in active funds have been out $200 billion of numbers. And so we\u2019re starting to gain traction in the areas that are important for us, that are higher fee, more consistent where our good investment product is et cetera. But it is a tough environment.","So the U.S. Trust, listen, we love that relationship et cetera. But they\u2019re going to make the adjustments as they need to. And right now, some of this lower fee stuff is going away. But we still have a very good relationship with very good product in there, with some of the stronger activity and the types of areas we want it. And Zurich will be Zurich, but it\u2019s a great ongoing account for us. But it\u2019s going to be an outflow because part of that book is pretty closed.","So I don\u2019t know how to describe it any different for you, what I\u2019m trying to say and more importantly is, we\u2019re focused on those things that we would really grow. We got a good diversified business. And as the environment continues, where money gets put back to work I think will be in even better stead than we were going into 2015, that we are coming out of 2015.","Tom Gallagher","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our last question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric Berg","Thanks so much for working in here at the end. Jim, my questions really involve asking you to build on some of your earlier responses. First, with respect to the margin in the brokerage business and the Advice & Wealth Management. I thought, I heard you say that activity levels, while depressed from where they were at their peak, were roughly in line \u2013 did not change much from the activity levels in the September quarter. So my question is, is activity levels were in fact unchanged, if expenses were well controlled and if the stock market \u2013 I\u2019m looking at the average level of the S&P and I believe I have it right, when I say that it was actually up modestly compared to the average in 2014 fourth quarter \u2013 if the stock \u2013 if you got a little bit of a lift from the stock market, good expense control and stable client activity, why did that combination not lead to a further improvement in profit margins?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, Eric I think what it is, is what we\u2019ve said is if you look at the numbers in the fourth quarter, I mean revenue quarter-to-quarter was actually relatively the same little slightly up.","Eric Berg","Yes.","Jim Cracchiolo","There are two things one is, the revenue would have been higher, if at the end of the third quarter the markets that didn\u2019t pullback. You remember the markets went into 1,800 in August, September. And so what happened is you have all your wrap assets under management that you bill fees starting in October, beginning of October through the quarter. And so, some of those fees being billed were at lower absolute production because the fee level was based on the assets level and that just climb back towards the quarter to the end of the quarter. So you don\u2019t just build at the end of the quarter. So that\u2019s was really what took out some of the production that happens on the asset side of the equation, right? And so that\u2019s part.","The second part of it very clearly is and we\u2019ve had it in the fourth quarter is we do have some other G&A expense even though we managed the G&A expense flat over the year, when we put our advertising campaigns, we usually go on the air at the end of September with the bulk of that being October and November beginning of December. And so, we accrue for that expense when we are actually on the air and that\u2019s millions of dollars to run that campaign, which is not in the third and second quarter. Now over the course of the year, since we didn\u2019t increase our advertising year-over-year, it\u2019s the same fourth quarter to fourth quarter, if you look at the expenses and the supplemental you\u2019ll see that expenses did not go up and for the full year were pretty flat on G&A.","Walter Berman","Eric, it\u2019s Walter. So let me just \u2013 one point because he was talking about rates and certainly if you look at and I can understand from your perspective \u2013 that looking at the S&P and looking you would see it\u2019s up marginally, but what we do is run a weighted index related to the assets that we hold. And if you actually look at that on both on average and on ending its down. So it\u2019s not just the S&P again, we actually do the earning rate assets that we have and it\u2019s down. So that is what Jim was explaining, that is certainly \u2013 it impacts the fee base.","Eric Berg","And, Jim, if I could wrap up just by asking about the \u2013 further about the fiduciary matter, are you saying that there will be \u2013 should I take away from your comment that there will be an impact on revenue but that the impact will be muted by the fact that there is already been a pullback in some activity?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, Eric. What I \u2013 and so let me clarify if I wasn\u2019t clear. Okay.","Eric Berg","Thank you.","Jim Cracchiolo","What I said is \u2013 I think when some people have come out publicly earlier in 2015, and said oh, it will only be X or it is X because of REITs et cetera and this is the percentage over the business I do in that, what I said is a lot of that business actually reduced tremendously for us in 2015.","And so I don\u2019t have the exact number may be Alicia has it, but I think we did not do a lot of production and REITs and it wasn\u2019t necessarily in that production we did a lot in the qualified area. But she can give you the numbers on it, so what I said is, they were identifying a little more of that if that went away. We say looking and reading the DOL\u2019s proposal before all the commentary, there are number of things that are going to be affected.","The question is, they also said that they would allow for certain business to be done under a best interest exemption standard that you would apply for and you would actually adhere to and you would disclose on et cetera. Depending on what they finalized, there will depend on whether you can continue to do a lot of the business you\u2019re currently doing today under greater disclosure in a contract and et cetera, et cetera or that, that would have to be addressed to more of a fee-based type of basis in which case you would have to figure out with those clients whether it\u2019s appropriate to move.","So I can\u2019t give you what the \u2013 what that would look like yet until I know it. What I\u2019m saying is there are different ways that we think that we can manage and leave the business through if those exemptions are there and if you were able to execute appropriately against them and if not, there are some alternatives. Part of the activity would be do you serve some of the smaller accounts against smaller accounts are a little more costly. So part of that is you\u2019ve got to look at your business model appropriately in that regard.","So I don\u2019t have a perfect answer to that\u2019s all I said is it will have an effect on the industry, it will increase some cost the question is what do you do over time and can you offset some of that. And on the revenue side again, I think there are some alternatives but I don\u2019t know until the final rule and if it as the final rules as you can to certain business so certain business have to be done at a certain rate.

My name is Sylvia and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on Slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insights into the Company's operations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2017 Annual Report to shareholders and our 2017 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide 3, you will see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter. As you are aware, the year-over-year comparison of results was impacted by the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in the prior year as well as manual version related impact and unlocking in both years. As such, we have provided our adjusted operating results excluding these items.","Management believes this enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations, and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes from our call today will focus on operating financial results, adjusted for the tax act unlocking and mean reversion related impacts.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Hello and thanks for joining our earnings call. This morning, we will discuss our fourth-quarter results and I'll update you on the business and our priorities in a much more dynamic operating environment. Really markets were quite volatile in the quarter, particularly in December in the U.S. with significant declines across asset classes and while that's come back a bit when managing the business in light of this uncertain backdrop. Overall for the year, we continued our track record of delivering excellent results for the Company and generated good profitability and returns. And we also continue to invest the long-term value creation and business growth.","In Wealth Management, we delivered strong and Ameriprise client flows and advisor productivity. As we've demonstrated in prior cycles, a volatile environment reinforces the importance of the personal advice, investment perspective and solutions that we offer. Our Asset Management business was more directly affected by the market declines and hiking volatility. That said, our impacts were in line with the industry in terms of asset declines and accelerated outflows. And in variable annuities, the market environment resulted in a non-cash impact that Walter will recover in more detail.","Our assets under management and administration was down 8% to $823 billion, reflecting the 14% sequential market decline, which was mitigated by continued strength in Ameriprise client net inflows. In terms of adjusted operating results and excluding the items we highlighted, revenues remained steady at $3.2 billion, earnings increased 12% to $544 million, earnings per diluted share were up 21% to $3.80. Return on equity excluding AOCI and unlocking was a strong 37.8%.","During the quarter and the year, we continue to invest in growth initiatives that will help to sustain the business to the future. In addition to growth investments based on earnings and capital position and with our strong cash flow, we accelerated our share repurchases, given the market decline and our discounted share price. For the year, we committed more than $2 billion to shareholders by increasing our dividend and repurchasing 11 million shares. This reduced our shares outstanding by 7%, and represents a truly differentiated level of capital return. And we continue to maintain $1.5 billion in excess capital.","We also continue to shift our earnings mix to less capital-intensive business lines, something we've done consistently over the years, and this generated significant free cash flow. Looking at the last four years, as we've grown our earnings with increased to percentage of contributions from Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management from 66% in 2015 to 74% in 2018. Looking ahead, we see additional opportunity to take this number even further.","With regard to our financial advisory business, Ameriprise client assets held strong at $539 billion, down just 4% even with the volatility and steep market declines. A key growth platform for Ameriprise is our fee-based investment advisory wrap business. It's one of the largest investor running the industry at 251 billion at the end of the fourth quarter.","Net inflows remain robust at $4.5 billion. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter where we've had wrap net inflows above $4 billion. Sequentially, wrap flows declined a bit as clients took a more defensive posture and move more into cash, and we're earning competitive returns on our $28 billion of brokerage cash balances which were up 6% in all time high.","As a diversified financial services firm, the combination of the breadth of our products suite and financial planning expertise helps us retain assets. We continue to bring in clients and we're helping them rebalanced their assets based on changing market dynamics. With good client flows, increase client activity and traction from our investments, we continue to grow our advisor productivity nicely.","On a trailing 12-month basis, it's up 9% to $620,000. This builds on many years of strong productivity gains, and we continue to earn high client and advisor satisfaction. Recruiting is an important complement to retaining our top people. Experience productive advisors are consistently attractive to Ameriprise because of our excellent support, reputation and track record of investing to help advisors to grow. In the quarter, 93 advisors joined the firm and for 2018 overall, we brought on 335 new experience advisors.","We're also investing to convert our national trust bank to a federal savings bank. Things are going well and we expect to hear from regulators this quarter. With a clear focus on our clients and growth, Ameriprise and our value proposition are directly aligned with the significant wealth management opportunity in U.S. Consumer research affirms that the mass affluent and affluent want to work in a personal advice-based relationship with a trusted advisor. In fact, trust remains most important aspect of working with a financial advisor.","Ameriprise is both the long-standing leader in advice and we ranked number one in trust across the investment industry by attempting with various focused on advice and delivering what our clients and consumers want. Across the firm, we're making additional investments to continue delivering an excellent client experience and help advisors growth productivity. This includes enhancing our digital and financial planning capabilities as well as upgrading to an advanced CRM system later this year to enable our advisors to work and even more goal-based and integrated way with their clients.","As we've discussed last quarter, we've been testing these enhanced capabilities in the field and are pleased with the initial results. Advisors have reported clients are more engaged and confident when advisors are having goal-based conversations and using these new capabilities. So we feel there is a compelling opportunity to expand this across the entire client base.","In addition, we continue to invest in the Ameriprise brand, which is strong in the marketplace with awareness there, our highest levels. We introduce the next chapter of our Be Brilliant platform earlier this month with new ads that highlight the personalized differentiated experience we delivered declines to help them achieve their goals. Overall in Advice & Wealth Management would generate excellent results double digit earnings growth and strong margins of both 23% in the quarter.","With regard to protection annuities, the books are performing well in this rate environment. Sales over the course of the year held up with some slowing in the fourth quarter. Variable annuity sales were up 6% to $4.5 billion for the year, right in line with the consistent 4 billion to 5 billion sales range, we have seen historically. We continue to generate an appropriate level of sales and returns in these businesses.","Let's move to Asset Management. The fourth quarter was a tough market environment with substantial industry wide outflows across asset classes, styles and geographies as you've seen with other asset managers who have already reported. In the U.S., it was the most difficult quarter for long-term mutual fund flows in the industry dating back to 2007. Investors move to de-risk given significant market declines in December, year-end tax selling and higher volatility.","And in Europe, key indices were down sharply in October spiking higher outflows across Europe. How did that affect us in the fourth quarter? Like others, we felt that pressure in assets under management declines which included net outflows of $4.7 billion, but reinvested dividends. In the U.S. our rate of mutual fund outflows was in line with the industry. And in Europe, we suffer the level of outflows consistent with our peers. In past market disruptions, European investors tend to react quickly to market dynamics whether that's positively or negatively.","So far in January with improved markets, we're seeing better mutual funds flow rates in the U.S. and Europe, and we hope that will continue. From a revenue standpoint in the quarter, the decline reflected a drop in assets under management as well as the unwinding of a couple of our CLOs and higher performance fees last year. To gain flows we are working to deliver relevant quality solutions and service to our retail and institutional clients, and consistent competitive investment performance.","Our one-year investment performance was impacted by unusual, but not unheard of price dislocation that took place in the fourth quarter. In the few occasions where this has previously occurred, those securities with positive ratings from our proprietary research subsequently performed well on average, which is what we're already seeing for January. This impacted our three year numbers as well, but we expect they will improve in 2019 at the dropping of a similar underperformance in our U.S. portfolios that occurred in the first quarter of 2016.","We are also sharply focused on maintaining our excellent expense discipline and will continue to be thoughtful moving forward given the current climate. In the quarter, expenses and asset management were down nicely. We also had to absorb additional Brexit related cost due to the transfer of EU client assets from our OEIC funds into Lux domiciled C-cap products, which we are in the process of completing.","As we look forward, we were focused on gaining traction where we see growth opportunities. This includes our efforts to enhance and further introduce our data driven distribution work in the U.S. that will help drive improvement in gross sales and market share at many of our top intermediary firms. We're building on our strength in the UK and continue to expand in Europe with a focus on Germany, Italy and Spain, now that we've established a more comprehensive C-cap lineup of funds.","And we want to continue to grow Columbia Threadneedle of brand awareness and consideration. Given the scope of our capabilities, we see opportunity to capture market share in our core markets. Overall in Asset Management, it was a tough quarter, but the industry and for us we're managing headwinds as part of the Ameriprise and competing for share in a very competitive marketplace.","In closing, we delivered a good quarter in a volatile market environment completing what was a good year for Ameriprise. We have a consistent record of delivering long-term value, investing for growth and returning capital to shareholders at attractive levels. We continue to transform the business and focus on areas of opportunity that would generate a strong return with wealth management driving our growth.","At the same time, we will focus on continuing to tightly control expenses in 2019. As we look at the year ahead, I'm confident in our ability to serve clients well and navigate a very fluid environment. Walter?","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Turning to Page 5, Ameriprise delivered strong results in 2018. We continue to make significant progress in delivering our long-term shareholder objectives, as demonstrated by 4% growth in revenue, strong 27% growth in EPS, and 38% return on equity.","Let me take you through the details beginning on Slide 6. Overall, Ameriprise delivered 4% revenue growth for the year despite been flat in the fourth quarter from market dislocation. Through the first three quarters of 2018, revenue growth was 6%. Advice & Wealth Management absorb the pressure from the substantial drop in markets through continued good client flows and higher earnings on cash balances. Asset management and annuities were more impacted, which is what we would expect in this environment.","Let's turn to our earnings on Slide 7. Full year earnings increased 20%. With the challenging revenue environment, we remain keenly focused on expense management. Expenses continue to be well managed across the perm with G&A down 5% in the fourth quarter and flat for the full year. This remains a critical area of focus and the key lever as we navigate environment in 2019. The effective tax rate came in as expected at 17.3%. And I'd like to take a moment to remind you of a few dynamics that will impact the results in the first quarter.","First, there are only 90-fee days in the first quarter which impact Advice & Wealth Management, Asset Management and Annuities. Second, we have some seasonality in our expenses that we have discussed in the past related to payroll taxes. This impacts all business segments with the largest impacts in the Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management area. Last, in the fourth quarter, we absorb the significant percentage of market decline impact. As the current market levels sustain, a portion of the carryover impact will be mitigated.","Next on Slide 8. You will see excellent EPS growth of 21% in the quarter and 27% for the full year. In total, adjusted operating EPS was $3.80 for the quarter and $14.94 for the full year. You will buy Advice & Wealth Management, which now makes up about half of our pretax adjusted operating earnings.","In 2018, we continued our track record a differentiated capital return with 2.1 billion return through buybacks and dividends including a 50% increase in share repurchases in the fourth quarter buying back 3.6 million shares given the particularly attractive value. Lastly, we are maintaining excellent balance sheet fundamentals with 1.5 billion of excess capital and excellent liquidity.","Let's turn to Slide 9. For the year, Advice & Wealth Management represented nearly half of the Company's pretax adjusted operating earnings, demonstrating a significant upward trend from 44% in 2017 and 40% in 2016. We have diversified sources of free cash flow from our businesses with Advice & Wealth Management driving much of our growth complemented by Asset Management, Annuities and Protection.","Our fee-based businesses of Wealth Management and Asset Management now make-up nearly three quarters of our earnings. Our distribution of earnings continues to diversify with AWM and Asset Management generating approximately 65% of our free cash flow in the near term. We are seeing strong growth trends in advice wealth management, which you can see on Slide 10.","Total client assets were pressured by equity market declines, down 4% to 539 billion despite very strong client net inflows throughout 2018, including in the fourth quarter. Through the first three quarters of 2018, our client assets benefited from a combination of solid flows and market appreciation, with our clients assets reaching 588 billion at the end of the third quarter. Finances were negatively impacted from the 14% drop in equity markets point-to-point in the fourth quarter, a portion of this impact would be offset by the improvement so far this year.","Brokerage cash balances grew to 27.7 billion in the fourth quarter. In the first part of the year when markets were less volatile, we saw clients putting money to work and cash balances declining. Given the volatile environment in the fourth quarter, clients reverse course and kept additional cash, as we expected. It is important to note that retained assets on our platform by meeting clients' needs in our all environments.","We are benefiting from short rates getting back to more normal historical levels, while we have retained a high percentage of the rise and short rates to date, we have recently increase the client crediting rate based on market changes. We are closely monitoring crediting rates to remain competitive with peers. Finally, organic advisor productivity also continues to improve reaching 620,000 on a trailing 12 months basis for the quarter. This level has grown steadily throughout the year.","Let's turn to Slide 11. Advice & Wealth Management is delivering consistent strong financial performance overtime that is underpinned by sustainable business fundamentals that I just discuss. Overall AWM had been delivering a substantial 22% earnings growth trend through September. The market dislocation the fourth quarter reduce the trend, but AWM still delivered 30% growth for the quarter, and an excellent 19% growth rate for the full-year.","Trends were consistent for revenues. We had been on the growth trajectory of 12% through September, driven by wrap net inflows and higher transactional activity levels, as well as the benefit of higher short-term rates on cash sweep balances. Fourth quarter market declines reduced fees and slowed the growth rate to 5% for the quarter, resulting in a full year revenue growth of 10%.","Markets have come back in January, which should help. Expenses were very well controlled with G&A up only 2% for the quarter compared to full year increase of 6%. We are diligently managing G&A while investing to improve the client experience and ease of doing business. We are making investments where we see the best payback and margins reached a record 23.3% in the quarter and 22.4% for the full year.","Let's turn to asset management on Page 12. With financial performance was clearly impacted by substantial industry headwinds, positive earnings trends from asset management were disrupted by the market dislocation in the fourth quarter, earnings down 27% year-over-year and 22% sequentially to 153 million.","Let me explain the year-over-year change first. Of the 57 million decline, approximately 40% was related to the 28 million benefit from performance fees and CLO unwinds in the year-ago compared to just 5 million in this quarter, and the business absorbed 8 million of additional expenses associated with the development and implementation of our Brexit strategy.","The remainder of the decline was primarily due to outflows. On a sequential basis earnings declined to 44 million of which approximately 35% was related to lower performance fees and the one-time expenses associated with Brexit, normalizing for these two items earnings were down 16%, primarily from markets.","Revenues of 706 million also reflecting the impact of markets and lower performance fees, the fee rate in the quarter decline to just under 52 basis points, demonstrating the fee pressure the industry is facing. Expenses continue to be prudently managed by generating operating efficiencies and reengineering, which is funding growth investments, and higher regulatory course in Europe.","Excluding the one-time Brexit expenses in the quarter, and the lower performance fee compensation, G&A expenses were down 6%, demonstrating our commitment to expense discipline, and the challenging revenue environment. We anticipated adjusting our ongoing expense base in light of the markets, while ensuring we continue to invest for future growth. In addition, given the factors I just described, we delivered a 35% margin in the quarter.","Let's turn to annuities on Slide 13. In the quarter, variable annuities earnings are 115 million, which is essentially flat to last year after excluding mean reversion related impacts. In the quarter there was a 68 million unfavorable mean reversion related impact from the 14% drop in equity markets point-to-point.","Based on the outside impact and volatilities from market declines, we are evaluating changing our definition of adjusted operating earnings to exclude mean reversion related impacts consistent with others in the industry. Variable annuities continue to be in outflow though at a slower pace than last year.","Variable annuity sales slowed a bit from the market volatility in the quarter, but remain up 6% for the full year, which is above the industry. And nearly 30% of our VA sales are in products without living benefit riders. It should be noted that are net amount of risk was 1.7% of the account value with living benefits and 1.6% of account value with death benefits.","This was up sequentially due to the change in the markets, but we believe this remains at best-in-class levels. Fixed annuities pretax adjusted operating earnings declined to 4 million, reflecting the continued impact of lapses and interest rates, as well as lower mortality for income annuity policyholder.","Turning to protection on Slide 14. Life and Health pretax adjusted operating earnings were 67 million reflecting lower portfolio, yields and claims in line with expectations. In the Auto and Home business pretax adjusted operating earnings were 15 million excluding net cat losses. Gross cat losses were 62 million primarily from California wildfires. Net cat losses growing 12 million, reflecting substantial benefit from our reinsurance program.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 15. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital is approximately 1.5 billion with an estimate RBC ratio of approximately 500%. Our hedging program has been quite effective with weighted managed hedge effectiveness at 98% in the quarter. The investment portfolio remains strong and diversified, and free cash flow generation remains excellent.","We've returned 2.1 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in 2018. As we enter 2019, we are still targeting to return 90% to 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, as a baseline, but we will adjust that as we assess market conditions in our evaluation.","In closing, Ameriprise delivered another strong year of financial results and organic growth. With strong client flows and productivity gains in Advice & Wealth Management, we are focused on expense management and have the ability to adjust our expense base this year based on the revenue environment.","Finally, our balance sheet is strong and our business model generates significant free cash flow that will sustain a differentiated return.","Now, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","AWM client activity appeared to hold up reasonably well considering in the tough market backdrop. Can you give some more perspective on what you saw and then how you are seeing customers behave far in the New Year?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, so what we saw in the fourth quarter was a continuation of good engagement between the advisor and the client, and very clearly what we're focused on doing is helping the client sort of navigate this as sort of a bullet rather than an idea that they need to change what they're planning for. So, we try to keep them on target, on focus of what their longer-term goals are, knowing that the markets will be about a volatile, but we also try to work with them very clearly on their asset allocations rebalancing and diversifications that they have, and so that's what we continue to see.","As you saw, there was a bit more pickup of cash in the quarter not necessarily from people selling out per say, but from new cash coming in that's been hold on the sidelines a bit. And as we went through the first quarter, we continue to see that engagement rebalancing occurring, et cetera, which we think is a healthy and good, but we are very much focused on keeping them focused on what their ultimate goals are rather than just the market, the volatility, that's currently here.","Ryan Krueger","And then within the Asset Management, you've talked about a 35% to 39% margin in the past. You were at 35% in the quarter. Do you feel like you can maintain at least the low end of that range given the tough backdrop?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, we did experience in the quarter as you saw, the markets depreciated a lot on, and of course as that occurs, your fee revenue particularly from your equity product goes down a bit more as it had occurred. We also experienced some increase even though we've actually reduced expenses a lot.","Our margins in Europe went down, mainly because of what we had to do in transferring the assets for Brexit and the number of the expenses that we had to fund there. So, yes, were still focused on maintaining those margin levels to a combination of things that we're working on, but it would be at the lower end of those ranges at this point in time, as we have start to see hopefully some markets recover a bit.","Operator","Our following question comes from Humphrey Lee. Your line is now open.","Humphrey Lee","Regarding the brokerage cash in AWM, I think in your prepared remarks you talked about, you have passed along some of the economics to your clients. I was just wondering, can you talk a little more about the competitive pressure that you are seeing from your competitors and then some of the actions that you're looking to take given there is definitely a greater competition for deposits nowadays in the market?","Walter Berman","Yes, this is Walter. We monitor this as we indicated on a weekly basis. Our whole group of peers to ensure that we stay competitive along the different segments of the dollar amounts of the sweep accounts. And we have passed on certainly some of that as we saw from the September one, but we are remaining competitive. And candidly, we're actually seeing, right now, there is a less competitive pressure in the areas of focus, but we'll continue to monitor it and certainly as appropriate pass that on.","Humphrey Lee","So, you've talked about raising the crediting rates in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about, how much did you raise your crediting rate?","Walter Berman","We've raised it at the upper end of it, that's where we saw a little gap, and it was -- I don't have the exact numbers, but it was only certainly in a couple basis points that basically passed on to allow us to be in that alignment with our peers.","Humphrey Lee","And then regarding the application of converting your trust bank to your federal savings bank. So in your remarks you talk about you should hear back from the regulators this quarter. Then I guess what would be the next step? And once you get the approval, how soon can you be operational?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, right now, again, we are tracking and we've indicated that in the couple weeks that we hope to have the approvals from both regulators the OCC and the fed. And once that occurs, assuming that occurs, we hopefully would be operational in the beginning of the first quarter or the end of -- beginning of the second quarter or the end of first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous.","Erik Bass","This is valuations for asset managers continued to come down, how does that factor into your strategic view of business? I guess, are you more inclined to look for growth in other areas and continued to shift the mix away from traditional asset management? Do you see a disconnect whether maybe opportunities to acquire assets or platforms at attractive prices?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, we are -- as you see, we actually think if you look at our make-up of 50% now is coming roughly from our Advice & Wealth Management business, which I think would have a differentiated PE from asset managers, that I think it should be factored more into our value. And as you heard from my opening comments, we're putting a lot of focus on the continued growth there and investments to continue to grow the client base, grow the advisor productivity, add more advisors, and even look at other opportunities to enhance our channel mix there by growing our central sites, our ACC, IPO which is working with community banks et cetera. So, we have an emphasis there regarding where we're putting a lot of our focus.","And then and we go to Asset Management as we said, we've done -- we picked up a few other things were launching some other alternatives infrastructure funds and other things within the Asset Management. So what we're trying to do in the asset management is more of refine against the core areas that we see good opportunity, good growth that we can achieve good margins, expand in certain sections like in the international arena as well, and really right size that for what we're seeing in the marketplace regarding the sales and the activities. And we will try to complement that where necessary and appropriate for areas of opportunity that we can get good returns in the future. So, that's the way were looking at it today.","Erik Bass","And then this quarter the level of corporate expense looked unusually low. How should we think about the run rate going forward for the corporate loss?","Walter Berman","We're -- again, again, I don't want interpret because every time I do, I am wrong, but somewhere in the 65 million to 70 million range, it is something that we've talked about.","Erik Bass","And that is with or without long-term care?","Jim Cracchiolo","Long-term care is available, but for this particular -- I would include, it's included. It's only been several million dollars.","Operator","Our following question comes from Jeff Smith from William Blair.","Jeff Smith","One of the things I noticed in Wealth Management that investment income was up 43% on a quarter. I think it was up more than 30% on the year. What's driving that high growth?","Jim Cracchiolo","I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? I'm sorry.","Jeff Smith","Yes, the investment income piece in the Wealth Management segment, it was up around 43% in the quarter and more than 30% on the year. Why is growth so high there?","Jim Cracchiolo","That's from our surge. Surge hasn't been growing, our search on product.","Jeff Smith","And then just looking at the pretax margin wealth management come from just looking over two years 18% to 22%, but G&A expenses were -- are up a lot by 20% over that time period. So, it seemed that starts to level out again there is some upside there. Do you have a long-term goal and where you think that margin can get to, I mean, as 25% reasonable over the longer term?","Walter Berman","It depends on life services. As you notice, so we are enjoying exceptionally strong and continually growing margins. It is slowing and obviously it depends on markets. We do generate a lot of productivities and certainly the interest rates improve that. So, certainly, we do see opportunity to increase. I can't get to exactly because we're dealing with so many variables on where we will get to 25, but certainly we have room to continue to grow that.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, I would say and some of the things that you heard me speak about during the year and even here in the fourth quarter is that, we're continuing to make investments in technology, we are continuing to help on our advisors to be able to go deeper against their client activities with greater levels of engagement for the digital tools, the capabilities, the planning tools that we're putting in there, customer relationship management system as well as how they're marketing themselves in their own communities.","So, we're really positive about the effects that, that could continue to have to help drive their productivity. We do manage expenses while the increases that you're seeing were mainly due to the type of the investments that we think will get some good paybacks on, as we continue to look to the future. The only other investment we're making beyond what I've mentioned to you that Walter and I've discussed is really the banking business, but we think the banking business will generate a very good margin that could be complementary like some of the other houses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Just wanted to start with the G&A expense. You've mentioned expense just went up a couple of times. So, can you just give us the sense of what your plan is for 2019 in terms of G&A?","Walter Berman","Well, Suneet as you know, we've been quite disciplined and certainly appropriate in managing the business therefore managing the G&A expenses to ensure that we're being and quite effective, and but still investing for growth and appropriately and interestingly. So that is the plan, but we certainly continue -- will plan on continue to prudently manage those expenses and certainly evaluate the situation and have the flexibility, again to make adjustments where appropriate, but again looking at the market, there we feel will just continue to evaluate.","Suneet Kamath","And should we be thinking about sort of flat G&A like we had this year or are the investments going to pull at, pull that higher?","Walter Berman","Well, we have again, as Jim just mentioned the bank and other things of that and all of the growth investments. So, it would bar on that basis it is certainly we continue -- we're going to focus on trying to maintain the expense levels with those investments and other growth investments in this lower range dealing with the revenue situation.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, Suneet. So, we're going to control expenses across the firm. At the same time, we're not going to stop the investments that we'd think it makes sense like the bank, et cetera. So they may add some incremental, but we look to manage all of the other expenses tightly along those lines, but those investments that were making should give us some good paybacks like the bank. So that's the way we look at it, and we have maintained our level of flexibility as we've seen in the past.","Suneet Kamath","And then switching to the Auto and Home and I think you talked about year-end 2018 being sort of a time when you reassess that business given the progress that you've made. So, I was just hoping you could give us an update on how you are thinking about it going forward?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yet, so we're we are underway in our reviews there and so we will be working through that as we go through the first quarter here and so we will be getting back to you in the future.","Operator","Our following question comes from Kenneth Lee from RBC Capital Markets.","Kenneth Lee","Wondering if you could provide a little bit more color around the advisory fee revenue within Advice & Wealth Management. And this is a separate from the financial planning and transaction fees. Just wondering why the trends still resilient? I think there's only a slight decline sequentially versus a much steeper decline in the advisory assets in the fourth quarter. What's driving that our resiliency?","Walter Berman","Again, it's the average from our standpoint, unlike some of our peers. We set rates on average basis, so you're getting not the full impact. So some people said, got the benefit or setting on October 1st. And candidly, we did have strong inflows while they are less than you know they drove off a little, but we have strong inflows. And so, it's tracked to going to our expectations considering the change in the market and the average.","Kenneth Lee","And then just a little bit of a follow-up on what you mentioned in the prepared remarks on expansion to Germany, Italy, France. Wondering what potential time frames you're thinking about and potential milestones before we see some contribution from that expansion?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, so, we have already laid the groundwork and really what we were needed to complete really as you would imagine because of Brexit and because of the way clients could be affected, we had to wait till we set-up our full align of C-cap funds and convert our clients in Europe from where they were situated in our OEIC funds in the UK over to our Lux domiciled funds. And that transition, we did the bulk of it in the fourth quarter. So, it actually showered sales of that because we couldn\u2019t do it as we are transferring client assets, et cetera.","And it was completed actually last weekend, which we feel very good about that will situate us well in a sense that would not cause any harmful effects to our European clients as the Brexit transaction or whatever occurs there in agreement in the future. So, now, we'll be able to start to ramp up our activities to drive some more sales activities and add our resources there to grow activities more in those countries.","Operator","Our following question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alex Blostein","Couple of questions. So, first just on client cash balances, so obviously, a really nice ramp in the quarter not surprising given the volatility. Can you give us an update on where cash balances stand today? We've seen from others obviously talk about some of that going back into the markets, so just curious where you guys shake out there? And then, Walter, just want to make sure I understand, the -- In Q4, it looks like you guys retained about 80% of the higher rates. Is the implication for Q1 that the number will be little lower as you kind of play it a little catch up? Or you still expect to retain roughly 80% of the December hike?","Walter Berman","As it relates to the hike, as I indicated, we are adjusting to our rates and we feel we're evaluating now. So, we don\u2019t feel we have to go to catch up. We'll continue to evaluate as the changing environment is, but it looks like right now, there is not a tremendous peer pressure on adjusting rates and were competitive within competitive ranges.","Jim Cracchiolo","And regarding the current cash balances, I don\u2019t have the latest numbers here, I would probably say that they've probably come down a bit, but they are still maintaining but on higher than they were prior to the fourth quarter. So, I think that will gradually seatback in as you saw. We still had good inflows in the fourth quarter into our wrap business, but some of that did maintain in cash. So as the client rebalanced, I think you'll see to your point as money go back in. It might actually go a little into equities, but also some fixed income now that they feel the rates are more stabilized.","Alex Blostein","And then just in terms of the growth in the AWM segment, so obviously, you guys talk about the growth in the fee base business, the wrap accounts. Anyway to help us think about that, the net new asset growth in the franchise as a whole? And granted, if we can sort of back into it based on the market performance of client assets that you disclosed, but anyway you can kind of help frame where is the total organic growth that's from a net new asset perspective for the segment as a whole and, where you see that going over the next year or two given your strong comments around the pipeline from the recruiting perspective?","Walter Berman","It's typical for us, it's -- but we do see continues growth in our client assets as we look at the productivity, the new programs were running, and the ability to actually drive those activities with our advisor base and certainly bring in a new advice, but mostly because of the way we are driving our productivity, and again, it's going to be dependent and it has some influence on behavior points based on markets, right but we are seeing good strong client growth.","Alex Blostein","So net new assets, I just put the firm as a whole are still positive not just throughout the count?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, they were positive and nicely in the fourth quarter and throughout the '18, and we still are looking for them to continue in a positive trend as we are in '19 and that's where we're really focused our advisor retention on growing their net flows, but more importantly, engaging their client so that they can deepen those relationships with them.","Alex Blostein","Last one for me if I can just sneak in one more in. We've seen in the Company appears both public and private talk about taking on research payment on to the P&L entirely, not just for mid two clients, but doing it globally. What you guys stand I guess on that front? And do you expect that to impact sort of your G&A outlook for 2019? And I guess that would hit the asset management segment.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, so we -- as you are aware and you mentioned, we did take that up fully in '18 because we do have a large UK European operation relative to our size in the asset management business, and that was absorbed. Having said that that did increase the expenses there that we had to figure out how to offset, and luckily based on what we were doing in our global transformation and technology and integration. We were able to really offset that rather than and it's the same bringing that further to the bottom line because of it.","Having said that in the U.S. we are monitoring that, looking at that closely, I know one competitor came out and said they are looking to possibly do that. But again, this is a very large industry here. And when that occurs, it does fundamentally change what research -- the cost of research, how research is charged, et cetera, as it has occurred in Europe. So, I think it's more than just a player saying it. There is a number of other things across our industry that has to occur for that to be something I think gets moved forward.","Operator","Our following question comes from Andrew Kligerman from Credit Suisse.","Andrew Kligerman","First question, Walter, you talked about maintaining flexibility in general and admin, and of course advice and wealth it was only up about 2%, asset management was down 6%. I guess what I'd like to get the sense of it is -- I mean can you consistently have these general and the admin expenses lag operating revenues? I mean, can you consistently do that that maybe that would be a good?","Walter Berman","Okay, so let me try to just answer it if that works. Within our -- since we've gone public, we have a focus program on reengineering. We are constantly evaluating and improving our processes and certainly getting payback for our expenses, and gearing that towards the asset business grows this is embedded into the way we operate, Andrew. So from that standpoint, yes, I do believe looking at all of the elements of investing in the business the business is usual, the streamlining of those fences, we have a effective track record of us working as with the businesses to drive that effectively and leverage our overall activity. So I feel comfortable that we -- that will continue.","Andrew Kligerman","And then just a few quick data points. One on the sweeps, can you -- where do you that going from 195 basis points up from 173 basis points in the sequential quarter? Two, Jim, you mentioned that some of your one year numbers got hit pretty hard. I noticed in international equity and taxable fixed income in particular, how have they done in the past months? And then lastly your reinsurance costs in Auto and Home, are they up materially since the reinsurers paid out to $50 million?","Jim Cracchiolo","So, in regard to investment performance, as I mentioned, as we looked at the various equity markets, when you have some major dislocation, yes, we get hit with it and it does cause a material blip so to speak in those numbers for the period of the year. As I said, we think that will work through as we go through the next number of quarters January looks good already. The three year numbers we think will bounce back because the first quarter '16 happen the same way based on the volatility, that quarter will bounce off even though the new quarter came on, and so our numbers should bounce back in that regard.","European was a little more in the sense of also we got hit based on the dislocations that you saw in October timeframe and some of the adjustments and that we think will also work through because we feel good about the investments we have there and you know, I think that is something that again. I know the investment teams are very much focused on we feel pretty good about how each of those portfolios are constructed and the quality including fixed income the quality of the credits, etcetera. So that something that they're going to be focused on making sure that, that gets back to the improvements and then maintaining the levels that they need.","Walter Berman","Okay, Andrew, as it relates to the spread. I assume you're referring to the rate that we've already got and then have seeing that's going to evolve sequentially, okay.","Andrew Kligerman","Yes.","Walter Berman","As I indicated, it's a process that we evaluate. Certainly, the competitiveness of our pricing versus peers and we have not seen basically changes taking place, but we are certainly prepared and but right now we just got engage with -- where it goes and meet -- and certainly be a competitive. On the reinsurance for us, I guess from our standpoint, we were quite effective as you saw in the quarter. Growth 62 million 12 net, and we will be continuing those programs into 2019. And again, we are constantly improving our product and certainly maintaining our insurance effectiveness.","Andrew Kligerman","But has the cost gone up sharply in the reinsurance because of the payout?","Walter Berman","It\u2019s a combination I think of course it have gone-up somewhat enable to adjusted terms but we still feel an effective mitigation.","Andrew Kligerman","So maybe a double-digit ups or not?","Walter Berman","No, I don\u2019t have the exact. I know it's not double-digit it was good negotiations, and I think we feel there's been a change, but it is still a very effective program.","Operator","Our following question comes from John Barnett from Sandler O'Neil.","John Barnett","The combined ratio meaningfully improved for full year in protection. Are you considering actions that could unlock value and free up capital committed that business. And then my second question, how much rate are you currently taking and pushing across the different products in protection after several years of cat losses?","Walter Berman","Okay. So you're talking on from the standpoint on the rate I guess.","John Barnett","Yes for Auto and then Home.","Walter Berman","On Auto and Home, we have had as Jim has said, we started from several years ago to take a very effective underwriting and evaluation of our pricing, and certainly using big data to drive that to a more effectiveness to certainly from the clients standpoint and our standpoint. So, we feel quite comfortable with the programs that we are taking and making changes to the product suite that we feel is appropriate and to give us the sort of paybacks that will appropriate. The second question I am sorry. Was there another question?","John Barnett","Yes, there was. It's meaningfully improved. Are you considering actions that would unlock value for that business and free up capital to be reallocated to something else?","Walter Berman","I think right now we are committed it gets certainly we have the right capital ratio so we are certainly committed to the product. And certainly, when the time is appropriate, as we're indicating, we're getting improvements. We will evaluate reducing capital appropriately and staying within the record of the agency and regulatory framework.","Jim Cracchiolo","So, you were watching the reviews, as I said that will complete as we go through the first quarter.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Nadel from UBS.","John Nadel","I have a couple. Just wanted to follow up on a discussion earlier in the Q&A about the margin potential for Advice & wealth management, the opportunity for further expansion overtime. If we just made a baseline assumption that equity markets were reasonable, and we layered in the benefit of the banking operations over the next two years. Isn\u2019t it, I mean, isn\u2019t it very likely and very reasonable that we should expect the margin to continue to improve from current levels? Or are there investments Jim that you think you need to make over the next couple years to find the fresh to spread margin expansion?","Jim Cracchiolo","No. Consistent with your way you phrase the first question the answer would be, yes. We think they would.","John Nadel","You think margins expand.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes.","John Nadel","Secondly, I just wanted to get into a -- maybe I'll be a little bit more direct on the question around Auto and Home. That setting aside the catastrophe losses and obviously the reinsurance program was very effective. But underlying, I agree with John's comments earlier underlying margins are improving very nicely. Jim, you've made it pretty clear that this business is not necessarily a core business on a go forward at least that's might take. Are we at the point yet where you can take action?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, as I said we're going to our strategic review here and we will be complete of that as we go through the first quarter. So, why don\u2019t we just stay tune, okay?","John Nadel","And then lastly this is maybe a little bit more direct question Jim. Are you satisfied with the leadership and the quality of that management of the asset management business at this point? I man I recognized that the entire industry is pressured, but the industry is essentially come back to Columbia Threadneedle in terms of overall performance, it hasn't been the other way around. Are you confident in the team you've got in place to be able to manage against this more difficult environment?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes, so, we -- over the last number of periods, we've actually added some really good talent to the global asset management group. Were making some really good changes both from how we look at the marketplace, how do we attack it from a distribution perspective, the areas of opportunity that we should focus our energy and resources. We've made a lot of changes and investments appropriate in the technology. We had to deal similar to others in the industry with a lot of particular regulatory changes, particularly across Europe and the UK that we've been managing very well.","So again, it's not that we can't continue to improve. I agree a 100%, but we are working diligent against it. And I will continue to look at what are the right resources and talent necessary for us to do that. We will and have extracted very good shareholder return from this business. I know the flow picture doesn't look that great, but we have transformed from where we were proprietary sharp to a global provider and generate a very strong shareholder returns over the years in doing so.","I do believe the industry has gotten extra hit and we are part of that as you've seen, but I do believe we have enough capability and ability to transform. The other thing that we have going for us very clearly is our expertise and how we reengineer and integrate pretty well. So, I think that's going to be of a great benefit going forward. As you see, people we are starting to feel the pain a bit more. So, we are very focused and I appreciate your question and I continue to look to ensure that we can continue to generate value here.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia A. Charity - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's second quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we will be happy to take your questions.","Slide two of the earnings presentation materials available on our website includes the discussion of forward-looking statements, specifically that during the call you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company's operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today's materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management's expectations about future events and operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today's date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today's earnings release, our 2015 Annual Report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K Report, and the first quarter 2016 10-Q Report. We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","Turning to slide three, you see our GAAP financial results for the second quarter. Below that, you see our operating results, which management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations, and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The comments that management make on the call today will focus on operating financial results.","And with that, I will turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for our second-quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on the business. Walter will discuss the financials, and then we'll answer your questions. Domestic equity markets improved in the quarter; however, internationally, markets remained quite weak year-over-year. Volatility spiked in June, which was reflected in slower client activity. Post Brexit, the British pound weakened significantly and created a difficult foreign exchange translation. Our internally-weighted equity index, which aligns to our domestic and international assets under management characteristics, was down 5% on average year-over-year.","We ended the quarter with $777 billion in assets under management and administration, which was down a bit year-over-year. And as you're well aware, the low interest rate environment remains a persistent headwind. These are external factors that we can't control.","That said, we're focused on what we can control: serving our clients, executing our strategy, managing expenses well as we invest in the business, and navigating these market movements. So, how did this translate into our performance?","Overall, Ameriprise delivered solid second-quarter results. On an operating basis, net revenues reflected a tougher market environment and were down 4% to $2.9 billion. Earnings per diluted share were also down 4% to $2.23, but that include certain items in the quarter that we highlighted, and our return on equity, excluding AOCI, remained very strong at 23.9%. This is up 40 basis points from a year ago. Both our financial foundation and ability to consistently generate good free cash flow remain strong, and we increased the number of shares we repurchased year-over-year to 4.7 million shares. In total, we returned about 150% of earnings to shareholders, the second consecutive quarter where we returned at that level.","Let's move to our business results. In Advice & Wealth Management, our Advice value proposition is strong and we continue to generate good earnings with very good margin. Our advisors and teams are working closely with clients to help them understand the current environment and, importantly, to ensure they remain focused on achieving their long-term goals.","Naturally (4:32), the market volatility and general unease in the quarter continued to affect investor behavior. With this volatility, we increased our market commentary and communications for the field to help equip our advisors to have meaningful conversations with their clients. As you expect, clients are cautious and our overall transaction activity remain muted.","In the quarter, we continue to grow our client base, and in terms of retail clients' assets under management, assets grew to an all-time high in the quarter to $462 billion. We continue to have solid flows into fee-based investment advisory, another $2.3 billion in the quarter, where we have one of the largest platforms in the industry. However, given market volatility, brokerage cash balances continued to rise, up 17% from a year ago to more than $23 billion, which can be redeployed in the future.","I'm feeling good about the strength of our field force. Our advisors take pride in and appreciate the Ameriprise value proposition and strong culture. That's also very attractive to advisors in the industry. We continue to have terrific advisor satisfaction. I spent time with many of our top advisors at our National Conference in May, and they're feeling very good about the value, the support and the growth opportunity they have here.","Our Be Brilliant advertising campaign is on the airwaves and being positively received both on TV as well as online. Ameriprise brand awareness has also remained quite strong. Though industry recruiting slowed, this was one of the best quarters for recruiting for Ameriprise. Another 98 experienced advisors with good productivity joined Ameriprise and our pipeline for the rest of the year looks good. Overall, given market pressures, advisors maintained good productivity with operating net revenue per advisor at $507,000 on a 12-month basis.","From the metrics perspective, we're delivering good profitability with margins increasing to a strong 17.7% in the quarter. We remain well-positioned in the marketplace to take advantage of the growth opportunity as conditions settle.","Clearly, the Department of Labor fiduciary rule remains a top priority for us. As I've discussed with you, I believe Ameriprise is well-positioned to handle the changes required. We have the experience, capabilities, compliance, infrastructure, and dedicated teams to ensure we comply with the new rule. As we and others in the industry noted, this is a highly-complex rule that requires a thoughtful rigorous approach.","Of course, we'll also be factoring in the Department's additional guidance, which they indicated will be coming in the near future. Since the rule's introduction, we've been working closely with our advisors and field leaders to help them understand the requirements and the adjustments we're making to implement them effectively. We're conducting a comprehensive ongoing series of webcasts, workshops and local training sessions to help them prepare to operate in compliance with the rule.","We will continue to deliver the high level of support throughout this transition, which is consistent with our commitment to help our advisors grow their practices. The advisors have been very appreciative of the level of support we're providing. Given what we know, we feel comfortable that we can effectively navigate through it, and we'll keep you apprised as we move forward.","Let's move to Annuities and Protection. The Annuities and Life and Health insurance businesses are performing as we would expect in a low interest rate environment. With regard to Annuities, earnings were in line, given rates and the equity market pressure on account balances. On the variable side, account balances declined slightly to $75 billion and sales slowed year-over-year, which was similar to recent industry trends. A year ago, we had higher sales from new living benefit riders that were well received by our clients and advisors.","Keep in mind, our variable annuity sales and flows reflect both our current block of business and closed legacy blocks. On the fixed side, the book is performing as expected in this low interest rate environment. In Life and Health, overall business results are within our expectations, including our claims experience. Sales slowed a bit in the quarter, consistent with transactional activity.","We continue to focus on the asset accumulation portion of the business, primarily in VUL and UL, and providing a high-level advisor training service and support. With regard to Auto & Home, consistent with the P&C industry, we experienced a high level of cat losses in the quarter, primarily driven by wind and hailstorms in southern and central regions of the country. In Auto & Home, we're making more strategic and impactful changes in our business lines to tighten up areas where we had higher loss levels. This is in addition to the pricing underwriting claims and organizational changes we're making. And we're seeing improvements that will translate into improved financial results in the coming quarters.","In Asset Management, we're executing a focused strategy for long-term growth. Clearly, the market environment was challenging in the quarter, with both the average equity market declines, high volatility in June, and the pound dropping to the lowest point against the U.S. dollar in more than 30 years. In this environment, assets under management declined to $460 billion, and we also had one-time expenses which we previously noted that impacted earnings in the quarter.","Underlying expenses have remained well controlled as we work to preserve margins in the current environment. In terms of investment performance, we continue to generate good long-term performance track records across many asset classes and styles, and this performance looks relatively strong against industry peers.","Regarding the UK referendum, I'm pleased with how we're implementing our initial plans to manage the post-UK referendum period effectively, and providing support and perspective to our clients and investors. The transition will take time and we have been reinforcing with clients that there is no immediate decisions investors need to make. As you would expect, we are monitoring decisions in Britain and the EU, as we and the industry determine next steps. We have a strong and important business in the UK, Europe, and we're committed to serving the needs of all of our investors and feel comfortable with our ability to do so going forward. We also have operations in Luxembourg, and already have established a fund range that we sell in Europe and we will continue to build upon.","Now, let's move to flows. In the quarter, we experienced $4.7 billion in outflows. About half were driven by lower fee former parent-related flows that we discussed with you. Of the remainder, several of the institutional fundings we expected in second quarter were delayed due to Brexit. While we should see them come through in the second half of the year, the timing aspect resulted in $2.6 billion in institutional net outflows in the third quarter, with approximately $2 billion of very low fee short-duration fixed-income mandates.","Overall, our institutional pipeline remained strong. Global retail flows were modestly positive and included invested dividends. In the U.S., we continue to focus on improving market share. And while industry gross sales in the active space were down, our flows improved a bit. And in UK and European retail, we saw outflows leading up to the vote as investors were cautious, and this turned more negative after the vote. Based on our initial read of flows in the third quarter, this pressure appears to be subsiding.","I like to point out a number of developments in the quarter in the U.S. We announced the acquisition of Emerging Global Advisors, a smart beta provider, focused on emerging markets; and we've also launched three new equity income smart beta ETFs. Smart beta is a long-term opportunity for us. It's a natural complement to our traditional active business as we take the necessary steps to advance the business. In addition, shareholder-supported fund mergers that further strengthen our U.S. product line, and we also launched a new advisor website for Columbia Threadneedle, enhancing the online experience.","So overall, I feel good about how we're managing a tough and uncertain market environment. The actions we're taking to drive long-term growth are the right ones. We're managing the business prudently to preserve profitability, while investing in initiatives to compete in our key regions.","As I look at the company overall, Ameriprise is a strong company in a good position with significant opportunity for growth when conditions settle. We're focused on what we can control and delivering a strong client experience. We have the financial stability and capital to navigate the headwinds, to continue to invest for growth, and return to shareholders at a very attractive level. And I'd add that very few financial services companies are generating this level of return on equity and returning to shareholders as strongly as Ameriprise.","With that, I'll turn it over to Walter to discuss the numbers for the quarter in more detail.","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Jim. Ameriprise continues to navigate the macro conditions well, delivering solid financial results in the quarter. Given the revenue challenges related to the macro environment, we are selectively investing for growth, while managing expenses tightly. We believe our stock continues to be undervalued. The valuation combined with our strong balance sheet and free cash flow generation allowed us to be opportunistic in the quarter in our share repurchase.","Let's turn to consolidated results beginning on slide six. Macro conditions impacted revenue in a few ways. Our weighted equity index, our proxy for equity market movements on AUM, declined 5% on average year-over-year, but was up 6% on average, sequentially. This affected average AUM and fees, which are collected based on average daily assets. The dislocation over the past few quarters has muted client activity and contributed to Asset Management outflows.","Low interest rates remained a headwind for our insurance and annuity businesses. And the pound fell at the end of the quarter, following the UK referendum to leave the European Union, so the foreign exchange translation impacted ending asset levels. With that as a backdrop, you can see how this macro-environment impacted operating net revenue, which were down 4% year-over-year.","Lower average equity markets reduced revenue by approximately $50 million and also suppressed client transactional activity. On a sequential basis, we saw revenues improve in the quarter, up 2%, reflecting improvement in the market index.","Let's turn to slide seven. Ameriprise delivered good underlying business performance and EPS in a challenging revenue environment, demonstrating our ability to navigate through business cycles. We are tightly managing expenses, while making the right investments to adjust to regulatory and geopolitical changes and support future growth. We're seeing the results of our targeted re-engineering initiatives, which we expect to be realized more in the second half of the year. Pre-tax earnings declined, substantially driven by market dislocation; however, EPS was only down 4%, reflecting effective tax planning and our significant share repurchase program.","Our business model generated significant free cash flow, and our valuation provided a good opportunity to repurchase shares at a discounted level. In the quarter, we delivered a strong 23.9% return on equity.","Let's turn to segment performance. Starting on slide eight; first, the Advice & Wealth Management business continues to perform very well, delivering solid results in the face of the challenging environment. Jim spoke about the strong leading indicators we're seeing in this business, excellent EAR recruiting, strong advisor and client retention and record client asset levels.","Financial results are also good in this context. While operating net revenue was down about 2% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter, it was driven by lower average equity markets and slower transactional activity. These dynamics impacted PTI as well, but PTI was also benefited from our discipline expense management.","It should be noted that earnings in this segment improved sequentially due to better equity markets and transactional activity levels, which drove revenue up 4% and earnings up 8%. Operating margin in the quarter was strong at 17.7%, up 40 basis points from last year and up 60 basis points sequentially. Outside of significant market disruption, we expect future margin expansion to continue over time.","Let's turn to slide nine on Asset Management. Clearly, we faced external headwinds in the quarter. The average WEI was down 5% year-over-year, which impacted both revenue and pre-tax operating earnings. Operating net revenue was down 11% to $739 million, with approximately a quarter of the decline related to markets. The other primary driver of revenue decline was the cumulative impact of net flows.","Pre-tax operating earnings were down 25% to $148 million, which was impacted by markets, outflows as well as the preannounced resolution of a legal matter. I'd like to note that foreign exchange translation impact from Brexit was minimal in the quarter. We're prudently managing expenses with overall expenses down 7% and G&A down 5%. Looking ahead, we see an opportunity to improve margins as we move to more normalized markets.","Turning to Annuities on slide 10, the segment is performing in line with our expectations. Variable annuity pre-tax operating earnings was $118 million, down slightly from $120 million a year ago. This business was also impacted by market dislocation in the terms of the direct impact on account values and lower asset earning rates. The underlying business is solid and the risks are well-managed. Fixed annuity pre-tax operating earnings declined to $28 million due to elevated lapses over the past year as the block has been running off.","The earnings in the quarter were a bit better than anticipated due to higher mortality experience among income annuity contract holders. Given the current interest rate environment, there are limited new sales and, as a result, this book is expected to gradually run off and earnings will trend down during the year.","Turning to the Protection segment on slide 11, pre-tax operating earnings were $37 million in the quarter. Let's focus on Life and Health first. Pre-tax operating earnings were down from last year, largely due to an $18 million long-term care reserve release in the prior period. Also, long-term care claims were elevated in the current year, but remained within expected ranges. Auto & Home had an operating loss in the quarter due to preannounced cat losses of $37 million. The combined ratio was 118% in the quarter, which included 14% from cat losses.","Underlying results reflect the booking of accident year 2016 incurred losses at a level consistent with the end of 2015. Management has taken action to enhance underwriting, pricing and claims practices, which are driving improvement in frequency and severity trends in both short- and long-tailed coverages. As these business trends continue to emerge, we anticipate that they will begin to be reflected in the financial results.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on slide 12. As we have told you before, Ameriprise maintains a strong balance sheet that we would use opportunistically. We have approximately $2 billion of excess capital and our estimated RBC ratio remains above 500%.","Our hedging program continues to work well, and the investment portfolio is diversified. We returned approximately 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, again, this quarter, well above our baseline of 90% to 100% of earnings. We repurchased 4.7 million shares in the quarter, up significantly from a year ago.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. So given the UK referendum, hopefully, you can provide some more color on the various plans you're executing, especially around your Luxembourg operations to continue to distribute your funds throughout the EU and the amount of AUM, which was potentially impacted there?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Nigel, we already have operation formally set up out of Luxembourg. We already have a reasonable portion of our fund lineup on the CCAP format that is distributed throughout Europe. So, what we're going to do, we have a process already in place for what we've established so far, that we'll just build out that line to be a full complement to the line that we offer in the OEICs, and that's already going to be underway. So, we'll have plenty of time and ability, depending on what the final outcome is of the referendum and the decisions made between the UK and the EU, for our clients to move into the new format, if that's the most appropriate for them as they move forward. And so, we've done it before. We actually have that in operation already, so it's not something that we have to newly establish.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And then second question on Asset Management adjusted margins. We've had a couple quarters now where it's declined on a core basis into the mid-30%s. Is that the new normal, or is the high-30%s, which I think was the previous guidance, still an achievable goal?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's Walter. The range that we have, 35% to 40%, is still in effect. Obviously, this quarter hit the 35%, but certainly we see the 35% to 40% is the range that we think is appropriate.","Nigel P. Dally - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning and thank you. Wanted to follow up on Nigel's question regarding the OEICs, and maybe you could give a little color on what percentage of your AUM in Europe \u2013 or retail AUM in Europe comes from that platform today?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we probably have about 25%, that would be the non-UK. But of that already, we have almost 60% already in the non-UK, the CCAP format. So, it's really the difference. So, we're probably talking about $5 billion, that's more in \u2013 that could be moved to the CCAP, if that's what was necessary.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, turning to the Advice & Wealth Management segment, we've seen, I think, one or two management teams already talk about stopping the sale of Class A mutual fund shares through advisors and not allowing the receipt of the 12b-1 fees in wrap (25:29) business. Is that something that you're considering as well? And then maybe you could also give us a little bit of color as to what percentage of revenues come from those fees?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we are moving to \u2013 as we highlighted previously, we're moving to institutional share classes; where there aren't any, it will be a load wave of A Class. But in that regard, we'll have that orchestrated as we move to a complete new account structure, and those share classes are more introduced across the industry. Now that will take place, probably we're looking at, towards the first part of next year. And so, that would eliminate some of the 12b-1s that are currently collected. Most of \u2013 as we do, we pass on those 12b-1s to the advisors. The advisors will be now adjusting their business model appropriately so, to look at their services rendered and other things. And so, that's a decision we've made and we're moving towards that, and we're helping our advisors through that transition over the course of the year.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And do you envision \u2013 or what do you envision that impact to be on Ameriprise's earnings?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, on our revenue \u2013 of course, the revenue will be adjusted for the 12b-1s going away. We only get a haircut on that. Most of that's passed to the advisors, similar to our distribution arrangements, particularly in our franchise channel. And so with that, there will be an impact to earnings, but we are focused very much on offsetting that through other adjustments that we're making in our business model, as well as on a cost basis. And so, we think that will have a minimal impact as we phase through (27:19) this by other changes we have to make, just as we're asking our advisors to review their business model as well, for adjustments that they may be looking to make.","Yaron J. Kinar - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Hi. I just had, first, a follow-up. On the 12b-1 fees, are you only going to eliminate the receipt of 12b-1 fees in the advisory platform, or across the entire platform as well?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, when you say across the entire platform, we will be eliminating them across both qualified and non-qualified, so across the complete of the advisory-type platforms. In regard to brokerage, brokerage is a little different. 12b-1s are still able to be collected there. We're looking at what is the appropriate share class and appropriate distribution arrangements there, and that we'll make a decision on that subsequent. But we feel that that can still operate appropriately under the exemptions of the BIC.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then, I guess, somewhat related question on revenue sharing payments and platform fees. Do you see any changes necessary regarding the new DOL rule on that aspect of the business?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","What we see right now is that you're still very appropriately allowed to get cost reimbursements for the services rendered. We'll, of course, make some adjustments and tighten some various things. Having said that, we think that the bulk of what we do, and how the service is provided, and the reimbursement we get, will be able to be continued.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last clarification, as a follow up, is the $5 billion number, you referenced the amount of non, I guess \u2013 or EU investors that are invested in UCITS types of products that could potentially have to move to CCAP (29:23). Was that the number you were referring to?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. And with that, again, there's nothing that's come out formally that says they do have to move at this point in the time. If they do, we'll have the like product set up in just the CCAP format. And there are ways that we're reviewing right now for that transfer to be made appropriately from a client perspective, if necessary.","Ryan Krueger - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Good morning. So, I guess, first, just a follow up on the discussion around potential changes you guys could still make on the Advice & Wealth Management platform to kind of offset some of the revenue pressures. One of the areas we've been hearing a little more about is just what the brokerage firms charge just for access and essentially the platform fees, given the size of your platform with, obviously, a lot of financial advisors and a lot of assets. Can you talk about two things? I guess; A, your plans to rationalize any shelf space, kind of what it means for the number of products you're offering there? And two, what you are contemplating in terms of charging the manufacturers to be on your platform?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, what we're doing, of course, and we do this on an ongoing basis, is we review various products and services offered on our platform. We make sure that there is a level of appropriate due diligence around them, in the offering as well as with that, the appropriate lineups for our advisors so that they have a full opportunity to review all the appropriate investments for their clients. We'll go through that review as we are now, consistent with any changes necessary required by the Department in that \u2013 under the exemption, et cetera.","So we might tighten a range a little bit. We might tighten things more formally against the entire platform. But we don't see a radical shift at this point in time for what we're offering, because we already put those products and services through a level of due diligence appropriate. We may look to things and ensure that they're more equalized than any other offerings and some of the services rendered and the commission structure on them. That's what we're reviewing right now.","As far as the platform fees, again, we will look to make sure that that is very consistent and within tight ranges appropriate so that there is no differences that would in any way influence even from an objective view in the offering. And so, those are the things that we're working on right now. But we don't see a dramatic shift for what we've been doing.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. So to paraphrase a little bit, it doesn't sound like you guys think the distributors will have much of a pricing power over the manufacturers to get their products in the platform?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, I think there is always a balance between the manufacturer and the distributor now. And I think, if anything, the distributor, at least in the our case, looks for cost reimbursement against the services that are rendered for the products offered, and that's what we're going to continue to do.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Great. And then, question just around capital management for you guys. Obviously, very consistent level of buybacks over the last couple of years. But if we think about the level of payout and if we get into an environment where the equity markets are a little bit tougher and, obviously, the interest rate dynamic is not particularly helpful, what's the appetite, I guess, to continue to maybe dip into the excess capital, $2 billion number, to maintain the level of, call it, around $450 million of buyback?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I'm not going to talk about the $450 million, but I'll talk about the ability, as you've see, we have dipped in to the excess and we've dropped it, and it's decreased, and we just had to call on some debt also. But we have the capacity to do that and certainly we'll evaluate the opportunity to best return to the shareholders as we look forward and look at the environment in which it's in. So we have the capacity, and it's just the matter of assessing what is the best way to return to shareholders as we look over the remainder of the year.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Jim, just a few follow-up DOL questions. So, from your response to Ryan's question, it sounds like you expect to be able to retain all of your marketing and support fees in terms of that revenue piece. And if that's the case, do you \u2013 just thinking about how you're transitioning and what risk that represents, and how we should think about that, is it you're going to be operating under the BIC, and that would carry some legal liability risk associated with it that would be higher instead of being a level fee fiduciary? Is that the right way to think about it?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think with \u2013 a part of our business, as we said, there's a part of the business that will be operating under the BIC, where necessary and appropriate for the sale of commission-based products, such as an annuity and certain things, including individual funds, where it wouldn't be appropriate necessarily to put them into a advisory or a wrap fee basis, particularly based on SCC (35:26) guidelines, et cetera.","So under that regard, a portion of our business is in brokerage. It is a smaller part of our business today and maybe will even be a bit smaller as this continues to go forward. But that will operate under the BIC and we will abide fully by the \u2013 under the exemption of what's required there, including for the sale of any individual product and any payments made so that there's level commissions and all those various things that are required.","In the bulk of our business, which is under investment advisory today, we will move more fully to an exemption allowed under the investment advisory, and where necessarily and appropriate, there is allowance for similar (36:12) level of cost reimbursement for certain of the services rendered that we'll continue to get. And that's the way we're reviewing and looking to implement against the various exemptions allowed.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Would you agree, though, I'm thinking about it the right way, you're thinking about the fees that you continue to make from marketing and support fees? And really the trade-off here is that \u2013 I presume there's some higher level of legal liability risks associated with using the BIC versus level fee fiduciary. Is that a fair way to think about it? Or would you disagree with that?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Under the BIC exemption, okay, there is allowance for cost reimbursement for certain services rendered that are not necessarily \u2013 they are permissible and we will ensure that we meet those requirements so that we would be able to appropriately offer various products and get reimbursement for the services rendered.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then just shifting to \u2013 I just want to better understand, as you eliminate 12b-1 fees and move to institutional share classes, what that means exactly? So that would be for all of your wrap accounts this would be occurring? Or maybe a better way to put it is, can you dimension what percent of your wrap accounts have 12b-1 fees, where you would be moving clients to the institutional share classes?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we will be moving to institutional classes where they're offered for all of our accounts. And as I said, we'll move to a no-load A share \u2013 waived A share, where we \u2013 a load-waived A share, where we wouldn't have an institutional account available for the client at this point in time. In that regard, it will be across all of our advisory businesses and that will occur over the course of the beginning of next year. And with that, that to me \u2013 I'm not sure what your question is fully.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Well, just thinking about, is this going to happen, this move to institutional share classes this new structure.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Is this happening to all of your wrap accounts or is this just some fraction of (38:52)?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, some of our wrap accounts are already on some and as we introduced the new classification on some of our wrap over the last year have moved to institution, and that's what we're moving all as we convert our account structures and we get larger groups of offerings. Because not all offerings are out there on the institutional share class today. So as that occurs and we move our account structure, which we're hard at work at, we'll go into a one broad account structure that will occur by the beginning part of next year.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","And if I think about that kind of large movement, beyond the elimination of 12b-1 fees, will that also reduce fees overall? Like, just the movement in the retail institution...","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, 12b-1 fees will go away from revenue, at the end of the day. But advisors will be looking at their various accounts and services rendered and other services that they can offer the various clients, when necessary, if they need to. And from our perspective, our haircut from that will go away. And we're making adjustments in our business model so that we can offset that or remedy that in certain circumstances.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks. And then, one last one, if I could. Walter, I know you mentioned you see opportunity to improve margins in Asset Management. But if we look at asset earning rates, they've been coming down for the last few quarters. Just broadly, based on what's happening with DOL, there's clearly a movement afoot here to move certainly qualified investors into lower fee type structures. Do you really think this is a trend that's going to reverse or stabilize in terms of asset earning rates that have been declining here?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, our fee rates have been consistent and looking \u2013 and certainly with the \u2013 in the first quarter when you saw the drop, where you could not adjust your expense base, based on revenue. So we actually do see the 35% to 40% as reasonable ranges, and we've not seen the behavioral pattern that you're talking about take shape yet. So, the business model has the capacity to generate the 35% to 40%.","Thomas Gallagher - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Doug R. Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. I had two questions. First, just a clarification on the Asset Management segment on some of the flow data. You cited a couple billion of outflows from, you characterized, a former parent company relationship, and that's happened on and off over the past couple quarters. So, how big is sort of the potential for outflows from that particular category, or is that sort of pipeline, as it were, almost empty?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, what we had experienced a bit more was some greater level \u2013 we always mention that there will be a normal outflow from our arrangements with Zurich and U.S. Trust over time, just as Zurich is a closed book, we constantly get a level of outflows. Having said that, the book has been relatively stable, with reinvestments and other things, and appreciation, where we still manage roughly equivalent levels of assets over time, but we always have to book that outflow as it comes true, and it always looks like a negative.","In U.S. Trust, as an example, there is always a level of that, just because there is \u2013 as new sales come into U.S. Trust, or as their level of sales may have gone down. When we purchased it, it was a larger base of their assets, and so there is always a little difference between a level of redemption and a level of new sales, and we expected that. And that's normally what occurred.","What occurred over the last number of quarters was that U.S. Trust decided to take some of their separate account fixed-income business back in-house. And in that regard, we suffered a little higher level of outflows from some of the dedicated activities we did for them. That looks like it now has slowed through the end of the second quarter, and we think that will go back to a more normalized number. But those are the reasons that we had some oversized flows that we experienced there.","Doug R. Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And my second question, more of a conceptual question. How was, I guess, the feedback or the questions you're getting, or the conversations you're having with your advisory force, regarding variable annuities? I know that they've been in the spotlight in terms of the DOL rule. I know there has been some uncertainty around how they can sell them, or is there sort of still a willingness to sell these to an extent? Is there more of a replacement where more of them will say, no, I don't want to do this, I'm just going to put them into a wrap account? Just if you could just describe, conceptually, the conversations you're having with your advisors about that?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I think, first of all, there is probably \u2013 may be a little difference in the way we look at the sale of the annuity and what we do today versus, in broad terms, the industry. So, we look at the annuity as part of a broader solution set against our overall account and retirement plan for the client. And they're really sold as a solution for a piece of their activities. And we really have educated, and we work with our advisors, to understand where they would provide the essential income as a piece of that income drawdown plan. So, that's the way we've done business for a while. And as you can see, our business has been very stable in the amount of sales that we've done consistently, because they're not sold as just a product out there, but as part of the broader solution.","Now with that, every sale of our annuity goes through a pre-approval process and an upfront review compliance, et cetera, to ensure that it is fit and appropriate for that client. And so, that process that we already have in place will be the same process that will be in place as we move forward. There's always a few things and tweaks that we'll make sure are complemented there, based on any other additional sort of thought process necessary. But we believe that the extent of the process we have in the place already goes through that level of due diligence and review, and where it is appropriate, in a qualified account. That's what we review today in a very rigorous way. So, we don't see a fundamental change in the way we do business regarding the sale of that product.","Now, could there be adjustment in some of the activity there? The answer is always yes. But that's something we'll see over time, where necessary. But we don't see a fundamental change driven by a change in the fundamental process that we have in place, or review that we currently do. In addition, there may be some move to more of a level load over time, rather than an upfront commission. But again, that will depend on what circumstances, or how the advisor thinks about it. But we're not planning for a fundamental shift in our annuity business.","Doug R. Mewhirter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful. That's all my questions.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Eric, your line is now open. And we'll move on to our last question. And our last question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please go ahead.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with Advice & Wealth Management, and just get a sense on client activity. It looks like the distribution fees in that segment have been running kind of $550 million a quarter for the past couple of years and we've had a step-down here for the past few quarters. So just want to get a sense based on the feedback you're getting from your advisors. Are we at kind of a new run rate here in terms of activity, or do you think we can kind of get back to that mid-$550 million \u2013 mid-$500 million level, especially as these EARs start to vintage in?","Walter S. Berman - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think, as you saw in these first two quarters, there has been, especially in the first quarter, the impact to the markets and certainly the dislocation associated with \u2013 on long-dated. So, it is our expectation that as we work our way through \u2013 I can't exactly say where it's going to go back, but we certainly don't see this as a permanent trend and we're working through EARs, as you indicated. We are bringing on board, they are vintaging, and certainly the productivity within the legacy advisors. So, it's going to be a combination as we work through it, Suneet.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, just related to EARs, the 98 I think that you added in the quarter was maybe the strongest we've seen since back to 2012. So, just a question, do you think this is the early signs of Wealth Management consolidation post DOL? And then relatedly, once the DOL standard goes live, I guess, next year, are you envisioning or expecting any changes to your ability to recruit advisors, particularly as we think about things like transitional compensation?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Suneet, as we look at the business today and what we're doing to both support our advisors, but also have a strong business model to actually help them serve both the retirement and non-retirement market, particularly to our target market of the $500,000 to $5 million, we're working very closely with what is the level of support our advisors need, the training; what is the level of, what we would call, activities necessary for them to truly serve these people more fully. And we feel like we have a very strong business model in place that can respond to whether it's about the regulatory, but also the consumer dynamics that the consumer is interested in.","And the more we speak to the consumer and do research, whether (49:41) with millennials or not, they're asking and want more personal advice. They like working in an engaged world and using the digital, et cetera, and we have some of that better digital capabilities and we've been recognized out, and we're continuing to invest in it, and that includes digital advice. But they want more than something called robo, and they want more something than a computer model. And so, we do feel that we have the ability with our planning model to actually serve this universe. And therefore, we think we continue to be attractive to advisors, particularly based on a combination of that and our culture here built around how the advisor needs to serve the client and how we, as Ameriprise, also interact and connect to help the advisor serve the client.","So, I think there will be some people evaluating going through the DOL. I think our pipeline has been good, because we're actually working day to day with our advisors to help them handle this and we have the compliance and the infrastructure necessary. And I think people will evaluate that over time, particularly if they're independent, or if they feel like the advice model would work for them a little better as they go forward. So, I can't predict what that will ideally look like, but I think we're able to serve them. As far as transition comp, et cetera, we're looking at all of those various things. But again, we feel like the way we have set that up and what we can do or even adjust for it will be done in a way that we think can satisfy some of those requirements.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just one last one, if I could, just on the Asset Management business. Given the focus on margins and some of the pressures that we're seeing in fees across the industry, just wondering if there has been any change to your appetite for M&A, particularly given maybe the scale requirement for that business have gone up given some of these macro pressures? Just wanted to get some thoughts there.","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we continue to feel that, number one, we have globalized our business now and we're continuing to invest to even make that more efficient by having a seamless and consistent way of operating through our front and middle office. We're doing that in how we're sharing research and other things. So, we're continuing to complement what we do and make adjustments, as Walter said, so that we can get both effectiveness and efficiency on a global scale. But with that, we are still very open to look at complementary acquisitions as this world continues to change and if consolidation continues to occur. And I think we have the wherewithal to do that. I think we've shown that we can do that successfully and that we look for other activities or companies that would fit in with what we're trying to orchestrate and find that as an opportunity. So, we're very much open to that as the world continues. And as I said, we still have a very strong capital base. We're not over-leveraged. We have the ability to do that. At the same time, we have the ability to return to shareholders.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","So size \u2013 I mean, you could do a larger transaction, that would be something that would be of interest to you if it came along?","James M. Cracchiolo - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We have the ability of a range of sizes here based on our capacity, the earnings power, the balance sheet, the debt offering, et cetera, that we can do.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning and thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'll provide my perspective on our results in the business. Walter will review the numbers more fully, and then we'll take your questions.","Yesterday afternoon, we reported strong second quarter earnings. We're making significant progress across the firm and we delivered record results in our Advice & Wealth Management business.","In terms of the economic environment that we've been operating in, U.S. and European equity markets moved around quite a bit during the quarter. They rose significantly in the early part of the quarter before hitting a rough patch in June and have since come back. Investments are beginning to get back into the markets, and the economy is on more stable ground. The bond market backed up a bit increasing long-term interest rates. However, short-term interest rates remain at an all-time low.","Overall, I'm pleased with how Ameriprise is performing. We're moving forward with purpose and executing our consistent strategy.","Walter will discuss the numbers in detail, but our financial results demonstrate a strong quarter. On an operating basis, net revenues grew to $2.7 billion from significant growth in our fee-based businesses and a pickup in client and advisor activity. Our earnings were $352 million, with diluted earnings per share of $1.69. And return on equity, excluding AOCI reached a new level, increasing to 17.9%, which is an all-time high for us.","In addition, our assets under management and administration increased to $703 billion.","Maintaining an excellent financial foundation is core to how we operate the company. We continue to demonstrate the strength of our capital position and ability to generate significant free cash flow to return to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $488 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the last 4 quarters, we returned 134% of our operating earnings to shareholders. As we said, we intend to return the majority of our earnings to our shareholders, annually.","With that, let's talk about our Advice & Wealth Management performance. As I mentioned at the start, Advice & Wealth Management had excellent financial results, even after the banking last year and the pressure from low interest rates. Operating net revenues increased 13% to $1.1 billion, driven by significant retail client net inflows, more client activity and market growth.","Excluding former bank operations in 2012, operating net revenues increased 17% and operating margin increased to 14.1% due to the growth in productivity and our expense management efforts.","We also had very good client flows and asset growth. Ameriprise advisor client assets grew by 13% to $373 billion because of strong net inflows, good results in client acquisition and equity market appreciation. Client activity continued to increase and wrap net inflows were up 18% to more than $3 billion. Advisor productivity is also up nicely, with operating net revenue per advisor, excluding former bank operations, growing 17%.","Importantly, our advisor retention remains high. And in terms of experienced advisor recruiting, we saw a meaningful improvement in bringing in another 88 experienced advisors in what was generally a slower recruiting quarter for the industry. I'm pleased with both the number and the quality of advisors joining our firm. We're building on our leadership presence in the retirement space, and driving advisor efficiency through our tools and capabilities.","During the quarter, we formally launched our exclusive Confident Retirement approach, which helps clients to feel more confident about their retirement by addressing all of their needs comprehensively. Our advisors say it makes difficult conversations easier and helps to deepen relationships. We're putting a concerted effort towards implementing this program more broadly over the next 18 months. This year is about continuing to educate and engage advisors through field training and focus groups so they can utilize the Confident Retirement approach in their practices.","We're also focusing on deriving benefits from the investments we've made, including in technology. We're channeling our efforts to help advisors fully uptake all of our brokerage platform offers as well as our online tools for client-advisor engagement over the next 18 months. And we continue to enhance our tools and processes with new self-service features and enhancements that help advisors save time and make it easier to transact business.","During the quarter, some of our online capabilities including our advisor websites and social media efforts were recognized with awards from the Financial Communication Society.","Overall, it was an excellent quarter for Advice & Wealth Management across the business. With continued growth in client flows and increased productivity, as well as our ongoing focus on expense management, we're able to grow our margins and offset low interest rates.","Now let's move to Asset Management. We're beginning to gain some momentum while managing the outflows we discussed with you last quarter. Assets under management were $459 billion, up 3% compared to last year as growth in equity markets more than offset net outflows and the negative impact of foreign exchange. The growth in assets for market appreciation as well as ongoing revenue and expense re-engineering led to solid earnings in our Asset Management business even after adjusting for the Cofunds gained.","In fact, adjusted net pretax operating margin, which does not include the onetime gain, was 36.2% for the quarter compared to 33.7% a year ago and 34.6% in the sequential quarter.","In terms of investment performance, our 1-, 3- and 5-year numbers are quite good and reflect our focus on generating consistently strong performance for our clients. We had very good fixed income performance numbers and saw an improvement in domestic and international equity at Columbia.","In total, we offer more than 120 4- and 5-star rated funds.","With regard to flows, net outflows were $2.1 billion in the quarter. In retail, we showed nice improvements. Threadneedle experienced significant net inflows in the U.K. and Europe with a very robust showing in the first 2 months of the quarter.","Overall, we had about $900 million of total net outflows, as the positive gains at Threadneedle were offset by outflows at Columbia.","Columbia's outflow drivers were slightly improved from the first quarter and also reflected industry-wide pressure of retail fixed income outflows in June. When adjusting for the market dynamics, underlying Columbia retail net outflows were primarily from the areas we discussed last quarter, a former parent affiliate distribution relationship, a key sub-advisor and our actions to improve the economics of our share class in the IRA channel.","While the former parent affiliated distribution relationship represents an important client for us, we will experience ongoing net outflows as our market share normalizes over time.","For Columbia, increasing our presence on large distribution platforms and gaining wins on platforms remain the focus for retail. We're also expanding our due diligence efforts. Importantly, sales within our focus funds are good, especially those within our redefining income campaign. However, we need to increase our overall penetration.","With regard to institutional, we had about $800 million in total net outflows, but that was driven by $2 billion in outflows from the legacy insurance mandates, parent affiliated distribution and former parent influenced assets. When you adjust for these elements, the underlying traditional institutional business had a solid quarter.","As I mentioned last quarter, the pipeline of one, but not yet funded mandates have been building. We had several large U.S. equity and fixed income mandates funded in the quarter.","I should also note that our global coordination across our Asset Management businesses is one of our key long-term growth initiatives. During the quarter, existing emerging market debt and equity teams at Columbia and Threadneedle began working together. And over the next several months, we'll expand collaboration between the 2 organizations to include global asset allocation, global fixed income and global equity asset classes. We know we have more work to do in Asset Management, and we will drive hard to gain profitable net flows. We feel we have a good foundation in place that we will continue to build upon.","Let's move to Annuities and insurance. Businesses that are important to meeting clients' long-term financial needs in our Confident Retirement approach. In Annuities, we're generating good returns on our business that has an effective risk profile in hedging. The business is well positioned in cash sales of variable annuities through Ameriprise were up 20%. Sales of our managed volatility funds have continued to increase in recent months, with improved equity markets and our wholesaling efforts driving our momentum.","In May, we introduced 3 new volatility control products and 20 additional tax sufficient, variable annuities without living benefits. Overall, we're pleased with the initial sales and flows that we're seeing in these products.","With regard to fixed annuities, as we said in the past, this is a good book of business for us, but not one that we're looking to grow in a low-interest rate environment. This is consistent with our strategy to manufacture products where we feel we can get attractive risk-adjusted returns.","In Protection, the business is also performing well with good profitability. We have a diversified portfolio that is mostly comprised of variable universal life, cash value-focused universal life, disability income and some term products. We're seeing a nice pickup in sales and we're generating meaningful returns.","Sales in life insurance are up 32% from last year. Index universal life sales continue to be strong, and we'll also experience an improvement in universal life sales, a business where we are a leader.","In Auto and Home, we had a solid quarter, with steady policy growth of 10% from a year ago. We're working to deepen penetration with our affinity partners and with our own advisors and we're seeing nice progress. Client satisfaction retention of Auto and Home remains very positive.","To summarize, we had a very good quarter. All of our businesses performed well, especially Advice & Wealth Management, which is showing excellent results. In Asset Management, we're generating solid returns, but we have more work to do to gain flows at Columbia. Our insurance and Annuity businesses are performing well and complement our total offering.","Overall, we're executing our strategy, managing expenses and the headwinds from low interest rates.","As I mentioned, our return on equity reached a new level in the higher end of our targeted range, consistent with what I told you last quarter. As I look forward, we see opportunities to take it even higher and continue to grow returns over time, especially with an improved rate environment.","With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered excellent financial results this quarter, particularly in our targeted growth areas. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. These 2 segments represent over 60% of our total revenues and grew 17% on a combined basis when you normalize for exiting the bank.","In Protection and Annuities, revenue grew in line with our expectations, particularly in light of continued low interest rates.","Let's turn to earnings on Slide 4. Operating pretax earnings had similar trends to revenues. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management together represented over 60% of operating pretax earnings.","This quarter was particularly high with the Cofunds gain. And adjusting for that, it would've been 59% of operating and pretax earnings. We expect this trend line to be in the high 50% range for the balance of the year. Growth in these 2 areas was particularly strong. In Advice & Wealth Management, earnings grew 63% even with low interest rates and after adjusting for the bank exit.","Asset Management earnings increased 53%. Excluding the gains from the Cofund sale, Asset Management earnings increased 30%.","Annuities earnings growth was a solid 7%, considering the low interest rate environment. The year-over-year comparison for Protection was impacted by onetime items in both quarters, that I will discuss later.","Let's turn to EPS on Slide 5. Earnings per share were $1.69, up a robust 50%, and return on equity hit an all-time high of 17.9%. These reflect strong earnings growth in our Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses, and our ability to utilize our balance sheet to return capital to shareholders given our financial strength.","Looking ahead, we continue to see opportunity for further ROE expansion.","Moving to the segments. Results in Advice & Wealth Management were strong across the board. Business growth metrics, revenue growth and expense management, all of which drove strong earning and significant margin expansion.","Pretax earnings grew 37% in face of both $18 million of lower bank earnings and a negative impact of $15 million from lower spreads on cash sweep accounts. We expect there will continue to be earnings pressure from low short-term interest rates during the balance of the year. Business growth, coupled with strong expense management, has fueled margin growth in the segment to a higher 14.1%. This is up 250 basis points year-over-year, and if we normalize for the bank, margins would've expanded about 400 basis points.","Turning to Asset Management, we had earnings of $199 million, up from $130 million in the prior year. Earnings in the quarter included a $30 million gain from the sale of Threadneedle strategic business investment and Cofunds previously mentioned. Excluding this, earnings were up 30%.","During the quarter, we had a CDO liquidation. A portion of CDO earnings are recognized when funds are liquidated and performance fees are earned. The liquidation this quarter generated $19 million of profitability, which more than offset higher performance-related compensation expense. Adjusted operating margins improved to 36.2% from 33.7% a year ago.","Let's turn to flows in more detail on the next slide. In the quarter, we had a total of $2.1 billion of net outflows. Global retail outflows were $900 million. International retail inflows were $700 million, with strong inflows for April and May, which slowed in June when markets became more volatile. U.S. retail outflows were $1.6 billion.","For institutional, outflows were $800 million, an improvement from the last quarter. We had outflows of $2.5 billion, which included $700 million of normal outflows from legacy, insurance mandates at Threadneedle and approximately $1.3 billion of outflows in former parent influenced mandates and former parent affiliated distribution at Columbia. Some of which was low basis points. However, in the quarter, we had $1.7 billion of new mandates funded across Columbia and Threadneedle and the pipeline remained strong.","Turning to Annuities, operating pretax earnings were up 7% to $124 million in line with our expectations. Consistent for our strategy to manage the risk profile of our variable Annuity business, we are seeing good growth in attractive new business after launching several new managed volatility funds offerings.","We also continued to experience outflows from close block policies sold through outside distribution. Sales of variable annuities with managed volatility funds and products with no living benefit riders drove a 20% increase in sales during the quarter. Variable annuities operating pretax earnings were $82 million, flat compared to last year. While equity markets were higher, that benefit was offset by the distribution expense associated with VA sales growth and higher assets. The level of mean reversion was similar to the prior year. However, this year's mean reversion was due to interest rates and bond fund returns compared with last year, when the change was due to the equity markets.","In fixed annuities, operating pretax earnings increased $9 million to $42 million. Results in the current quarter included about $18 million of lower earnings from spread compression. However, the higher investment income from former bank assets transferred into this portfolio late last year offset the interest impact by $7 million. In addition, the prior year period included $17 million of onetime unfavorable adjustments.","Moving to Protection, operating pretax earnings were $98 million, down from $109 million in the prior year. The underlying Life & Health business remains quite strong. We had good sales of both variable, universal life and index universal life. In the quarter, we increased reserves for disability income insurance by $8 million. However, the loss ratio on claims levels remain well within our expectations.","Auto and Home has continued strong new policy sales growth across market segments, primarily from our affinity relationships. In the quarter, we incurred $18 million of catastrophic losses, which was $4 million higher than we anticipated, and we incrementally added to reserves as we did in the first quarter.","Let's turn to capital on the next slide. In the quarter, we returned $488 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As you can see, we have been able to consistently return more than 100% of earnings to shareholders due to our business mix shift, risk management capabilities and strong balance sheet fundamentals.","Based on current market conditions, for the rest of 2013, we anticipate that our capital actions will drive continued ROE expansion and will fully neutralize the EPS impact of exiting the bank by year end.","Overall, we are executing our strategy and it shows in our results. Our ROE reached 17.9% and we continue to return capital to shareholders. With that, we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I wanted to start with the Advice & Wealth Management business. I guess, on the past couple of calls, you've talked about the employee-advisor channel as breakeven. Just wondering if we're still breakeven with strong second quarter results. And then, kind of how long do you think it'll take you to actually start to generate a profit in that business? And if you can hit on some of the drivers there, that would be helpful.","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay, this is Jim. The employee part of the AWM business is actually profitable. It turned profitable this year, and it's starting to improve nicely. Having said that, it's not to the margins that we would like. That's consistent across the entire franchise now. But as we continue to gain productivity there and manager expenses, we think that will continue accrete to earnings and improve the margins.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, if we think about the advisors in the 2 channels, how would the productivity of the employee advisors compare to the franchisee advisors?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, today, as you would realize, because the employee channel was one that we more started from a maintaining an employee base over the last number of years rather than migrating people who are maturing over to the franchisee, we still have a number of our legacy people continuing to mature in that as we recruit experienced people into the channel. So we're seeing a nice increase in productivity as they continue to mature, as we continue to ramp up for the years coming in as they continue to get their productivity back up to what they were before they were recruited, as they transfer their books. So I would say, over the next few years, we should be pretty equal in productivity between the channels. Having said that, I think we're looking to grow both channels, and the productivity in both channels continues to go up.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. I mean, could we use a rule of thumb? Is it like half the productivity in the employee channel on average versus franchisee? Is there sort of way of dimensioning that?","James M. Cracchiolo","What we'll do is -- I would say it's -- I think it's more than half at this point in time, I don't have the numbers right in front of me. But I would continue to say that it will narrow over the next number of quarters. And so I think it's materially changed from where it used to be over the last 2 years. But I don't have the latest numbers in front of me.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly on the Advice & Wealth business. If we think about that 14.1% pretax margin, maybe compare it to the 12.9% that you did in the first quarter. I think the second quarter tends to be your seasonally high sort of transaction quarter. I guess I'm trying to figure out how much of the delta between the 2 periods is related to that seasonality versus the productivity or margin expansion that we could expect to continue even as we move to the third quarter?","Walter S. Berman","Sure, it's Walter. As you look at -- again, there's no crystal ball in this, but certainly in the third quarter, we do see a basic cyclicality that will be lower. But we anticipate that the margins, if you're getting to where we're going to be, should be in the high 13s. And so we think, certainly, the trajectory of this was going to continue and the fundamentals are going to drive it. But it will be in the high 13s.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. And then, just the last question I have is on the Asset Management business. I guess, we've talked for a while now about expanding into third-party distribution channels. And I'm just wondering, as you think about that strategy, what are the levers or the catalysts that you have to increase your penetration there? In other words, is it just about performance of the funds or are there some other competitive advantages that you bring to the table that could increase penetration in that channel?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I think as we talk about growing our third-party distribution -- and again, I'll separate the retail from the institutional. In the retail side of the business, it's really getting in front of the various distribution partners with our product. As you would imagine, they have a number of products already on their platforms. They've utilized a number of carriers. And so what we're doing is showing them what our Columbia lineup is. We had reestablished our wholesaling and the distributions as we have merged the wholesaling. And now we need to continue to make progress working with them to get into the model portfolios, through the gatekeepers and on the various platforms for the different types of products that we have. So it's not as though we don't have the products nor the performance, we do. It just takes time to build those relationships back and see our products versus the other ones that they're offering and getting our wholesaling and capabilities attached to that. So we are making good progress. As you know, it's a very competitive area, but one that is large. And we're making good headway. I think on the other side of it, we do experience some of the outflows from some of the past things that might have been on there as a sub-advisor or for a portfolio to where the managers have retired or changed, and that had affected on the net basis some of those activities. So we see the ability to grow the distribution through our third parties, as we continue to get more firmly on the ground and ramp up our efforts. Institutional, it was the same thing. I mean, we got put on hold, as you know. But now that pipeline is building, we're getting in front of many of the consultants and their clients and we are winning engagements there. And so we feel pretty good about our ability to do that. Now in the institutional space, we have broadened our lineup, and we will continue to broaden our lineup as we're actually developing some of our other products in certain categories. So in that case, it's more expending some of our product lines as we hit full fruition with the number of years et cetera with some of the merged platforms. So I feel like we will make good progress, however, it doesn't come as quickly as we'd all like.","Operator","The next question is from Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First, I guess, I realized there maybe some sensitivity becomes U.S. Trust is a client. At the firm, but can you provide any detail on just the amount of U.S. Trust assets that are managed by Columbia? And then it would be helpful if you could kind of gauge how far along is U.S. Trust in the process of shifting to an open architecture platform. And any estimate you have in terms of the size of additional potential outflows related to this transition and how long it may continue.","James M. Cracchiolo","Look, we don't comment on any client or the assets we have for any particular client. What I would say is this, U.S. Trust has their open architecture. They do have lineups of different products. And as they continue to shift based on market cycle. So what we've been somewhat affected by as well is their shift from more of the fixed income where we had some good capability and good product that we had more of their clients in some of our fixed income and our tax exempt, et cetera to more of an equity bias. And as you would imagine, as you do, do a shift, particularly as we've merged our own platforms, and we have to get into their cycle as anybody else does as they evaluate different products or different sectors that they want to invest in. So as we do that, we might lose a bit more share for the areas that we had some large buckets in. And even though we may gain some share from some of the newer areas, it may not be as high as it once was. And so listen, we think that will continue simply because we did have a good installed base when this was all part of Bank of America or when U.S. Trust actually had some of these products. So as an example, they had a reasonable amount of money with, like, some of the sub-advisors, they had it with the VNR [ph], et cetera that was originally, one of their PMs. So I think as things continue to evolve, we will experience a level of outflows there. Not that we don't win a reasonable amount of business or have a good relationship and manage a good bucket of assets, it's just things do change. It's similar to what we did in our system years ago.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, can you comment just on the level of margin on U.S. Trust assets relative to the margin on new sales that you're getting? Comparing the outflows vis\u2013\u00e0\u2013vis the inflows.","James M. Cracchiolo","What I would say there is that we have a good relationship with U.S. Trust, of course. Each distribution and each activity is a little different, so I would say on average, new retail flows would be at a higher fee basis than what we -- but again, it's in different buckets, including with U.S. Trust, some as institutional, some as retail, some is within SMAs, some is within mutual funds. So each one of those are a bit different, but I would say, on average, the new retail would be at a higher fee basis.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I wanted to follow up on the capital return story. You guys continue to stand out, again, as one of the best probably capital return stories in the financial space. But I guess, some of that was attributable to sort of a catch-up from the bank going away. But I'm wondering once we kind of get through that, why shouldn't we expect well over 100% payout going forward. It feels like it should be sustainable given the mix shift, but I just want to make sure I understand the dynamic.","James M. Cracchiolo","No, it very much is, as we look at the foreseeable future, based on our excess capital, as well as our earnings and the free cash flow that we could return more than 100%, and we may very well do so. Having said that, we don't want to sit here today and just say we will continue to return more than 100% going out. I think we've set a nice base level for you to say we'll return the majority. But I think as what we've shown you, even before the bank, we were returning over 100%. And as Walter said previously, we're not looking to store a lot of excess capital unless we have good use for it in some opportunities, which as we've been doing, we will return the capital to shareholders. We think that's appropriate. So as you saw, we didn't slow that in the third quarter, I mean the second quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","[indiscernible] Another quick follow-up, I guess, on the Asset Management business. The institutional business, I guess, was a little bit better in Columbia this quarter, and I know things can be fairly lumpy, but maybe you can give us maybe a little more granularity on where the kind of pipeline stand today versus where they were a quarter ago. And then maybe the mix of those pipelines. So what kind of, I guess, strategies you guys had seen most traction on the institutional front?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. So our pipeline for institutional actually continues to look quite strong. We also have won a number of mandates that still are unfunded, just like we had in the first quarter, that funded in the second quarter. We won some nice mandates in the second quarter. They're unfunded and hopefully they'll fund in the third quarter. We continue to have a good pipeline as we look out today and that pipeline has grown. Having said that, as we look to the third quarter, we may get some lumpiness for some other ex-parent activity legacy things around pensions, et cetera in the Columbia business. We'll get the usual from the Zurich. So I think we'll find that as second quarter, as we showed you, we had a nice pick-up in the third-party. However, when you look at the absolute flow, that was offset a bit by some of the legacy parent stuff, which would be at lower basis point. So we might experience some of that. We can't always optically know exactly when the timing is, but we know there's some of that, that will come out. We think it will come out in the third quarter.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, just the last one for me. I want to get an update on the interest rate sensitivity, given the move in the market we've seen recently. I guess, both to the expectation on the short end of the curve moving perhaps sooner as well as on the long end of the curve.","Walter S. Berman","Well, on the short answer as we talked about -- again, we're not projecting, but I'll just reiterate, as it relates to the sweep accounts, a good rule of thumb on that, if it goes up 100 basis points, we should retain about 85% of that. And that could contribute close to 300 basis points on margins if it happens for the full year. So that is, again, that is certainly we're sitting on a very large amount of cash in sweep accounts, so that's very beneficial. On the long end of the curve, what really is going to happen here, again, a gradual increase here will certainly be beneficial from both the standpoint of our assets earning rates as we certainly had a duration where about 20% is coming through each year that we are reinvesting. So that would be beneficial on that standpoint. We then will have to evaluate now as we do the repricing on the 5-year fixed annuities that we talked about previously, where we're going to set those rates and obviously that will be a factor into it. So it will be beneficial as, again, as long as it's a slow, gradual increase, it will be beneficial to us on that basis. And then of course, it's beneficial from the standpoint on our hedging programs and the costs embedded within that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jay Gelb form Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to touch base on the overall return on equity profile. It looks like the company is clearly going to be in the high-teens range on return on equity for this year and that's up from around 16% in 2012. And I'm just wondering if there's anything that you could see that would prevent Ameriprise from continuing to put up a couple hundred basis points of return on equity improvement over the next few years.","Walter S. Berman","This is Walter. Obviously, no. In the main in most situations, we should be able to generate. You can always have a 2008 event, so I don't want to preclude. But no, barring that sort of dramatic situation, the business model is generating the sort of free cash flow that allows us to do that, and we're working on reducing our requirements and certainly as we shift the business, that is certainly extremely beneficial as allowing us to take the increase return on equity.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So between the combination of the good, strong earnings power, the buybacks that could absorb 100% or more of net income and then lower capital requirements on the business, that those would be the drivers?","Walter S. Berman","Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few questions for me. The first one, just to come back to the situation at Columbia and comparing it to Threadneedle, what's going on there? So I understand the Zurich outflows that are expected are very low basis point mandates. So there's clearly not much loss of revenues if you look at -- follow the trail of assets, meaning there's still a positive revenue trend even though there's potentially net outflows here. But on the U.S. side with Columbia, can you help us think about the order of magnitude on -- because you've already laid out that they are the affiliated former parent assets that you expect to flow out, but are these anywhere close to the Zurich fees? Are those much higher? Because I heard your comment, Jim, that you -- that the new mandates are higher, but I just want to get a sense for how much higher. Are we talking about the assets that are flowing out are 40 basis points and the new mandates are 50 basis points? Can you help flush that out a little bit?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay, I think -- let me separate just the 2, because some of the outflows are also related as we just said over the last few periods that weren't necessarily just ex-parents, so they're ex-parent in a sense, but for instance, we have a sub-advisory relationship. Outside of that, we've made some changes in our RIA pricing that we think, economically, will be beneficial even with the outflows. And those are beyond sort of the ex-parent sort of stuff. But the sub-advisor was a separate sort of arrangement that we did assume when we did the deal. With the ex-parent stuff, the institutional would be at lower basis points. So that would be, actually, in some cases lower than the Zurich. In some of the cases, like on the retail side that would be in funds, would be higher than would be the Zurich because that's a balance of institutional and retail. And when we separate the 2, that will be higher. But what I'm saying on a like-to-like basis, for retail or institutional, the inflows that we're receiving through third parties and growing new distribution is at a higher rate overall and a reasonable higher rate. So from that basis, now, when you look at it to Threadneedle, it took us a little while for Threadneedle to really ramp up that third-party because -- but when we first acquired them, a lot of the mix was the Zurich that we had to diversify. But the amount of the bucket is large even though the fees were low. With Columbia, we have a combination of what we acquired from Columbia that was their proprietary and what they did with their channels. There was a part that was third-party, and then we combined that with what we have, which was significantly in the U.S. Ameriprise, which is sustaining. So I would say that there is a better balance here than we did when we acquired Threadneedle. And so we will overcome that hurdle, but we will experience continued outflows as that base of Columbia that came from Bank of America diversifies.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got it.","James M. Cracchiolo","Is that helpful?","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, that is. So the lost revenues on the outflows, we're going to be seeing, your point is that it's somewhat similar to the dynamic that's going on with Threadneedle, but probably less of a spread, if I think about the basis points on new mandates versus the business you're losing, is that a fair way to put it?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, for the stuff that will come out over time. For the stuff that has already come out, the basis points we lost wasn't as significant because a lot of that was in the institutional pension, Balboa, things like that. So that was even a lower basis point than the Zurich is on average. But on the stuff that will continue, let's say, as an on-going through retail would be a bit higher basis points than Zurich, but again, the mandates we're winning and retail would be higher than that.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. The next question I had is, Jim, just given how well you guys are executing in Advice & Wealth right now, any thoughts on more aggressively investing into this business, whether it's M&A, a much bigger ramp-up of hiring new advisors, any thoughts on that?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, we continue to invest nicely into the AWM business, as I said, and you've seen over the last number of years, our technology, our branding, some of our online capabilities, in mobile. We're coming out with our Confident Retirement approach, we've added some extra resources to help our advisors train up on the tools and capabilities to integrate their practices, particularly to engage clients with the online and activities around how people want to do business in a more 360 dimension today. So we continue to do that. Regarding recruitment, very clearly, we have still a good pipeline. We're out there. We've actually expanded our reach over the last year or 2. As you know, the industry has slowed a bit in there, and you can see others in the first and second quarter, but we feel like we have a good pipeline and that has come back. And we'll continue to reach out there for recruitment and additions. We do buy some individual smaller practices and other things that we add. Having said that, we don't look to go out and just buy independents at this point because we like sort of our model, and we -- anybody who we feel and is interested in joining our model as a franchisee or as our employee with our value proposition, we would definitely be interested in. But we're not just out there trying to roll up firms to grow advisor accounts.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question I had just on a numbers question for Walter. So Page 38 of the supplement, disclosed items, the $21 million earnings drag from, I guess, what you guys are labeling compensation items. Can you just give a bit more granularity on what exactly this is from, which segments this is showing up in? And whether or not all or some of this is going to go away by next quarter?","Walter S. Berman","Well, okay. It spreads across all the segments, and, including corporate, because obviously there's an element there. So it deals with, first and foremost, a very high-class problem we have on compensation as it relates to retention for advisors, formation or block. We actually have a higher retention factor relating to that, and we are recognizing that now, obviously, as we're getting closer to the periods. So there's really a big, big, big plus for us. So that will continue towards as we go towards the end of the year. But -- and then obviously, that would end. The performance as your doing it, is it relates to really assessing both on our programs and it goes across, certainly, our asset management approach goes [indiscernible] as we evaluate where that level is. And we now have assessed that and we've taken it up, which then taking it up in the second quarter, takes it up obviously, for the prior quarter. And now going forward, that should stay at the level again, we will reassess as we try and get our accruals as accurate as possible as we think the end performance would be there. So I think it follows a normal pattern that we've done sometime and -- so it's across the board and it's certainly on that basis, it deals with that. The other thing that we have and it's not on -- as it relates -- Page 21, it relates to severance, and, which we, from time to time we reflect the severance, and the severance is reflected in the corporate segment.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Walter, how much -- it sounds like there's some kind of tail on this $21 million, meaning it doesn't go to 0 next quarter. Can you just frame that out? How much of this $21 million would you expect to recur?","Walter S. Berman","Let me -- we're doing, obviously, in the second quarter, we're booking up for the first quarter in some of the -- and in the area that I mentioned. And again, it will continue to book at that level as you look up to increase, but you won't get the same, because you're not catching up for the first quarter. But it will -- we will certainly continue to book at a higher level. And then you have to take apart the various components that relates to severance. Severance, again, I can't tell you whether we will be booking through. And then we will book through a portion of the elements as relates to the [indiscernible] block.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and it gets smaller?","Walter S. Berman","It should, certainly, the level in the second quarter, the third and fourth, it should be -- again, if it's constant, if we don't change, it should small.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So it should go down from $21 million, fallen 1\/2 or 1\/3?","Walter S. Berman","Well, Tom, here we go. It will go down.","Operator","The next question comes from Eric Berg from RBC Capital Markets.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Jim, I was hoping we could return to the earlier discussion you had with another question or about U.S. Trust. Are you essentially saying, I just want to get a sharper point around your answer? Are you essentially saying that: one, U.S. Trust is going to a more open architecture approach having relied heavily on Columbia; and two, that there had been a mismatch that is evolving between your strength and strongest performance and their focus? Help me -- maybe we can go over that again, please?","James M. Cracchiolo","No, what I'm saying is, first of all, U.S. Trust always had their diversified business. And so what I'd mentioned to you is, as an example, there are certain portfolios in U.S. Trust like the VNR [ph]. The gentleman who ran that was actually one of the PMs originally that was part of the U.S. Trust business. So as you would imagine assets build in those type of portfolios over the long term, there's a good association, their systems familiar with it. So when he retired, we experienced greater outflow, right? Because that's a lot of where those assets were originally. So you have those things that are normal in any distribution system. In regard to what I've mentioned here is, we at Columbia used to work very closely with U.S. Trust on -- in their tax exempt categories, in their SMAs and various things to craft individual client portfolios, et cetera. So when they rotate out of certain classes like that, it's just like any other provider that may have been strong and fixed income in a certain distribution channel. You're going to experience a bit more outflows when you rotate out because of that type of penetration. And so that's part of what we're experienced. And then part is, when Columbia was there, they had a certain lineup of funds. And in those lineups, that's what was sold within the distribution, just like again on any platform. When we merged the 2 platforms, and now we have a larger lineup of funds, we got to get some of those new funds in as they look at their own lineup of other carriers that they had. And so if their installed base had a lot more of the Columbia funds originally for the reasons I've mentioned, and then you're adding new types of business and your other funds you're trying to add are newer, just as they have to try to get on and compete against the next person, you're not going to win as much business as you once had, but your redemptions will be higher because your base of assets is higher with that distributor. And that's exactly what's happened. That's why we said over time, it would sort of normalize or equalize. And again, we have a good relationship, it was a -- always a part of what they did for many, many years. So it does take a little time for that rebalancing.","Eric N. Berg - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Second question. It's interesting to me that it feels like and it seems like the retail picture at Threadneedle has been materially better than that at Columbia. Would that be your perception, too? And if so, why this contrast? When you think of these 2 money managers and their mutual -- retail mutual fund businesses. If it is in fact the case that in general Columbia has been in an outflow mode, Threadneedle in inflow mode, why the difference?","James M. Cracchiolo","So Eric, very clearly, let me take Threadneedle first, okay? Threadneedle, for many years had excellent performance. But at the beginning, just having excellent product and performance didn't get them to win business in the U.K. because again, in the past, they worked more closely with Zurich, and they focused on Zurich as a part of their proprietary house for that business. So when we purchased Threadneedle, we worked with Threadneedle to really diversify, invest appropriately so that we took more time and effort. But it took years for us to get onto those platforms and channels in the U.K. I mean, last year, I'll give you an example, even with some of the larger players there, we actually, for a few quarters, actually became the #1 seller in the U.K. because we had good performance. But we've been there, and we took the time to build those relationships and positioning. And we had great product that was what was in demand there. And that's what we're doing right now with Threadneedle in Europe. So again, 2 years ago, we weren't really selling much in Europe. We're trying to build that. Now, we're starting to sell in Europe after it took us the time to build. And so that's what's happening at Threadneedle. Columbia has good product and good performance. Having said that, a number of years ago, Columbia didn't have that performance, and they were dealing with a lot of their own things and the roll up of those firms from Fleet and Bank of America and Nations and all that and going through their changes. But they also had big focus on when they merged into U.S. Trust business and the Asset Management business with the Fleet business, with the Bank of America business, there was roll up with Nations. So over time, those things have to settle, they actually want 1 brand called Columbia. And so it wasn't as though they were firmly established for a long period of time. And so when we acquired them, they were on their way. But when we acquired them, that disrupted a little bit, too, right? It put things on hold, we had to merge funds, there's a number of changes that occur. So that's exactly what's happening. So I actually see this as still a terrific opportunity, but it does take more time than we once think about because it wasn't as though Columbia was all settled and established for a long period of time prior. It was a roll up of things that they did a good job putting together to become Columbia. And over time, the team there actually developed good performance. And if you go back, their track record years ago probably wasn't as strong as it is today. And that continues to build to give us the consistency with a wider platform of product. So that's exactly what's occurring, Eric. And again, sometimes we look at it, but there's been a lot of change in the industry, a lot of flow issues because of markets, and now fixed incomes backing up a little bit. So it takes a little time.","Operator","The last question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Question on Asset Management on the, I guess, at least on the GAAP-based operating margin. If we exclude the couple of onetime items, the onetime gains that you guys called out this quarter, I think it calculates out to about 19.5%, 19.6% margin. How should we think about the drivers of the improvement in that margin as we look forward? I mean, is this really -- the margin improvement is really about a turn in flows? Are there other factors, aside from just market performance that might contribute to the expansion of the margin there?","Walter S. Berman","Obviously it's a flow, and as you would get to that, certainly, it's the mix of business as we look through. You're using the GAAP approach and obviously, if you use the adjusted approach, which tends to normalize it, you would get that. It clearly it's reengineering and other elements as we improve margins that will continue to drive that. So there is -- it is getting -- if it's a very leveraged business, and as you make the contributes to it and the mix shift between the businesses, equity markets and fixed and other things of that nature. Those are all the key drivers. I mean that's, obviously again, another focus of the firm, and I think it's consistent with what we've said in the past.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, and then, if just sort of drill down and look at the management fee rate this quarter, I mean, notwithstanding the fact that flows shifted, equities as a percentage of AUM was definitely up. And the fee rate expanded pretty nicely on the quarter-over-quarter basis. I mean, is that really what we should be looking for? Is overall equities as a percentage of AUM moving higher and to the extent that, that happens that fee rates just naturally moves higher? I mean, I guess, this sort of goes part and parcel with Tom's question earlier about fee rate of assets coming off versus the fee rate of assets coming on.","Walter S. Berman","Well, I think it's very consistent, and your observation is correct. As Ted talked about it at the FCM [ph], it certainly as equity markets take on greater proportions, that would be the beneficial factor as it relates to our margins. And certainly -- but again, that is certainly a key driver, Jim, I don't know...","James M. Cracchiolo","As Walter also said, it's the mix, or you just said that as some of the outflows have occurred in the lower margin business or lower fee-based business, not necessarily margin, that's exactly what you'll start to see transfer. Now again, I think it's a little lumpy, and it's not a perfect science every quarter because you have a number of those different variables or key levers happening, but that's exactly what you said.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I guess that's what I'm trying to get at is not -- I'm trying to sort to see whether -- prevent getting ahead of ourselves, and how much this fee rate can move higher.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, don't let you get ahead of yourself there.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The last thing I wanted to just ask is, there's a lot of moving parts, there's U.S. Trust, you have some issues at Marsico, you've got the RIA, the adjustments that you made. As we look forward, I know you guys sort of quote fund flows, including reinvested dividends, but if we look at it x reinvested dividends where, clearly, there's a seasonal factor to that, how do we -- do you have real -- do have any visibility on how we should expect, especially Columbia retail net flows to trends here, if we exclude reinvested dividends?","James M. Cracchiolo","I wish I had a crystal ball, I don't. The only thing I can say is this on a few of the leverage, one is we made the change with the RIA. People knew it was coming the first quarter. The change actually went in at the end of the March. You would always experience a little more adjustment after that occurs, which we did in the second quarter from the first. I don't know if that will continue or slow down, et cetera. We think it, hopefully, will slow down. Regarding Marsico as an example, very good partner, over time built a good business, their performance has come back. They're settled, et cetera. Having said that, some of those things are lumpy based on how people evaluate them in their portfolio. So we think we'll experience a little of that again, but hopefully their performance and activities will come back there. And again, on the U.S. Trust, as I would say, is there is going to be a continuation and normalization there, but we're working hard to get more inflows. I actually have seen the sales pickup nicely. And then what happened in June for everybody with the pullback in the bond market affected a lot of people's sales and activities. So listen, I don't have a crystal ball. The only thing I can tell you is we're working hard. We're looking at all the various levers to grow the business. And sometimes, you hit some more quickly, better at certain spots, but I think we have opportunity and we just got to work at it. And hopefully, we'll get that to go in the right direction. And that's what we're pushing for.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And one last real quick one if I can sneak it in, there's been some outflows, pretty consistently out of the alternatives asset classes. Maybe you can just give us an update on where things stand, I know accrue performance fees back late in the fourth quarter or in the fourth quarter, but where this performance stand?","Walter S. Berman","Right now, I think performance is improved, again, with the flows coming off, it will not be a major factor.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Please note that this conference is being record.","I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, our Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","On Slide 2 of the earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, you will see discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, that during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliation of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials.","Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting Management\u2019s expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in today\u2019s earnings release, our 2015 annual report to shareholders, our 2015 10-K report, and the first and second quarter of 2016 10-Q reports. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","Turning to Slide 3 and 4, you see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the fourth quarter and the full year respectively. Below that, you see our operating results, which Management believes enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. The comments that Management makes on our call today will focus on operating financial results.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Good morning and thank you for joining today\u2019s earnings call. I\u2019ll provide my perspective on the business, and Walter will focus on the numbers, and we will be happy to take your questions. Let\u2019s get started.","I feel good about Ameriprise and our position. We had a strong quarter capping off a solid year. Across the firm we remain as focused as ever on serving our clients and advisors while we execute our strategy for growth and long-term value creation. We\u2019re gaining good traction in Advice & Wealth Management and sustaining competitive results across the firm. Meanwhile, the operating environment has been challenging with continued low interest rates and lingering geopolitical unease, although equity markets have rallied post-election and we had a small lift in interest rates at year end. Ameriprise navigated the environment well and we make good progress across the business which I\u2019ll review.","Our focus was on executing our strategy while continuing to prepare the business and our advisors to comply with the Department of Labor rule. At the same time Ameriprise delivered solid earnings and very good overall return. We managed the expenses well as we continue to invest in the business to deliver an even more compelling experience for our clients and advisors. As we begin 2017, equity markets are off to a good start and we may also see further improvements in interest rates.","In terms of our financial results for the quarter operating net revenues were solid, given headwinds from low rates and foreign exchange. We saw particularly strong revenue growth in AWM. Clearly this is a growth engine for the company and now represents close to 45% of Ameriprise\u2019s total revenue.","Operating earnings per diluted share was strong up 11%. We have significant scale, assets under management and administration grew to $787 billion despite an $18 billion negative foreign exchange compare in asset management, which muted strong growth in AWM where we had very good client flows, and our retail client assets ended the year at a record high.","In 2016 we continued our track record for delivering a differentiated level of capital return and excellent expense management while handling regulatory change, maintaining our growth investments and a healthy excess capital position. In fact, we returned over 150% of operating earnings to shareholders through dividends and share purchases for the year. That included another increase to Ameriprise\u2019s quarterly dividend early in 2016 and our 11th increase over the past 10 years, and the repurchase of a total of $1.7 billion of shares.","With good business results and significant capital return, operating return on equity was very strong at 24.6% at the end of the year excluding the non-cash impact of unlocking or 22.2% including unlocking. Very few financial services companies are generating this level of ROE in capital return. We\u2019ve consistently grown these measures at a meaningful rate.","Let\u2019s move to the businesses. Advice & Wealth Management is strong and growing. Ameriprise is one of the largest providers in the industry and we\u2019re well situated with our leadership and financial advice. We\u2019ve navigated a tougher environment well and ended the year with good client flows and nice increase in margins. During the quarter we continue to grow fee-based assets as well as expand pre-tax operating margins in AWM, which were up considerably to 19.3% for the quarter. And if you look at the trend throughout the year, margins grew 100 basis points to 18.1% for the full year.","Total client assets increased to a record $479 billion, reflecting continued strength in our investment advisory business, which remains one of the largest in the industry. With regard to our advisors the Ameriprise value proposition and culture is attractive. Our advisors force is strong and they continue to grow productivity with operating total net revenue for financial advisor are $518,000 on a trailing 12-month basis, and it was another good quarter for recruiting with 77 high quality advisors joining the firm. We also had a record year for bringing in larger size practices. We\u2019re starting 2017 with a solid pipeline and expect the recruiting landscape to continue to be fruitful for Ameriprise.","The strength of the Ameriprise brand and our reputation is another important differentiator. We had excellent results in 2016. I would Be Brilliant campaign drove the highest brand awareness we\u2019ve ever experienced and it continues to resonate very well with mass affluent and affluent investors, and we\u2019re back on the air with new ads for our Be Brilliant advertising. We also continue to invest in our digital experience on ameriprise.com and the Ameriprise app to provide clients with increase capabilities and security and an even better experience.","And building on our strong reputation, Ameriprise continued to earn important industry recognition in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re ranked number one in the investment industry in Temkin Group\u2019s 2016 Net Promoter Score Benchmark Study. In addition, in the Hearts and Wallets 2016 Wants and Pricing survey, Ameriprise is a top performer in customer ratings based on unbiased and puts my interests first in the investment firm category. We\u2019re proud to earn this type of recognition. It confirms even more that the core elements of our advice value proposition and the way we do business, positively influences client satisfaction and loyalty which is important to a long-term growth.","As it relates to the DOL rule, clearly the situation is evolving with the new administration. We along with the industry are closely monitoring developments. We\u2019re remaining flexible. If the rule is delayed, we will adjust accordingly. However, there are a few changes that we\u2019re making that are aligned with where the industry is going in our advisory platform when moving from 12b-1 fees to advisory shares for example. As we\u2019ve communicated, any new rule of this significance and complexity needs to be carefully considered, and most importantly, preserve choice for the millions of retirement savers impacted.","Our focus remains on ensuring our clients and advisors have access to a broader suite of solutions to help meet client needs, grow and protect their assets and achieve their goals. As we move forward Advice & Wealth Management is situated well. We\u2019re focusing on serving clients needs, growing the business and handling any regulatory adjustments as necessary.","Let\u2019s move to Annuities and Protection. We continue to serve our clients longer-term financial security needs through Annuities and Protection offerings. These are solid books that we are managing well. The theme for these businesses is manage growth over time and the performing as expected given persistently low rates in industry trends. In Annuities, VA account balances were up slightly year-over-year from market appreciation. Like others in the industry, our VA sales were down in the quarter and the year, but from what was seen on numbers fared better than the industry given our financial planning focus. The fixed annuity business is performing as we expected in this rate environment. We continue to see good results from the advisor workshops we\u2019ve held throughout the year and high use of the capabilities we have in place.","In life insurance, our overall sales were down consistent with the industry. VUL and UL account balances were up 3% given markets, and our life insurance in force remained stable at $196 billion. Overall, claims experience remained within expected ranges. At Ameriprise we continue to focus on being a strong, stable provider that stands behind our clients as we help our advisors improve their productivity and grow. Overall, we\u2019re focused on building on our progress in 2017. We\u2019ve built these books over many decades and feel good about the returns we can generate. And with signs of the 10-year interest rate coming back that would situate us even better as we proceed in 2017.","In Auto & Home, our changes are taking hold and we\u2019re seeing improved results. As we\u2019ve discussed we\u2019ve put a good team in place in a number of the product pricing, underwriting and other changes that we\u2019ve implemented are beginning to show up in the numbers. Improvements we\u2019ve made include increased rates and pricing sophistication, more data driven and disciplined underwriting, enhanced segmentation, product changes to mitigate property cat risk and an improved claims management. And we\u2019re seeing improvement in the last development trends and starting to reflect that in our financial results and reserving levels as favorable frequency and severity trends work through the book.","Let\u2019s move to Asset Management. As I look back at the quarter, we\u2019ve experienced headwinds similar to other active global players. As always we\u2019re working to deliver the outcomes of our clients expect while generating solid earnings. We\u2019ve been in front of clients during this volatile period and providing our global perspective. Regarding assets under management, we were impacted by an $18 billion unfavorable foreign currency translation on non-U.S. dollar assets.","Excluding the currency move, assets under management were essentially flat year-over-year as outflows were offset by equity market appreciation. We\u2019ve focused on further developing our product lines, providing value added services to our distribution partners and earning greater share. We\u2019re managing expenses well and delivered a competitive adjusted net operating margin of 36.5%. In addition, we\u2019re investing in our middle and back office operations and executing a multi-year plan to establish an efficient and effective global platform.","For the quarter excluding former parent flows, we have global retail net inflows of about $500 million that included reinvest in dividends. In the U.S. we\u2019re experiencing a bit of a pickup from redemptions in the fourth quarter, as we saw course the industry. However, over the course of the year we\u2019ve been able to grow share on many of our key intermediary platforms. We are very focused on working with partners to achieve their key strategic growth themes.","In the UK and European wholesale, we like others in the industry were impacted by the risk of trades that occurred due to the Brexit vote in advance of the U.S. election and the time referendum. The overall political environment had soften wholesale markets, but we are seeing signs that this is settling down. In terms of institutional, our win rate remains strong and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunities in a number of equity, credit, and solutions multi asset strategies.","However, we did experience a delay in mandates fundings that led to about $700 million out in the quarter, excluding low fee form of parent assets. That\u2019s said, our won-not-funded list of mandates is the largest it\u2019s been with wins in both domestic and international that should fund in the first half of the year. We have a number of initiatives on the way to complement our core business that we expect will gain traction. These include in solutions, especially our multi asset, tax efficient and adaptive risk products that are already receiving good interest. In addition, we\u2019re looking to build on our capabilities and managed accounts, strategic beta and responsible investing.","Our long-term investment performance remains strong. However, we did see slippage in one-year versus benchmarks in equity funds with a core or growth bias as traditional value sectors outperformed shortly after the U.S. election. Our average performance with close to medium versus peers, performance should improve as a strong post-election surge. We saw some of that already in January.","With regard to our overall fixed income and risk allocation products, they performed quite well for the year. Importantly across the house for both equity and fixed income, our three- and five-year numbers are strong. We also maintained our ratings with 112 four- and five-star Morningstar funds. As we look forward, we have established ourselves as a global player during a period of intense change for the industry. We\u2019re managing the level of change well and preserving profitability. Overall, we have a competitive business and we continue to position ourselves as a client centric firm.","In closing, I feel good about how the company is situated. We\u2019re executing our strategy and investing for growth as we manage the change facing our industry. We\u2019re focused on delivering our advice value proposition, while handling the regulatory change environment. We have a solid business and we\u2019re delivering good earnings, cash flow and shareholder return and we continue to manage expenses tightly. As we look forward with our client focused, business strength, our capital profile, and return as well as our operational risk management, Ameriprise is positioned well.","Now, Walter will cover the financials and I\u2019ll be back to take your questions.","Walter Berman","Good Morning. Ameriprise delivered a very strong quarter with operating EPS of $2.73, and a return on equity above our targeted range at almost 25% excluding unlocking. Advice & Wealth Management continues to be our primary growth driver with improved wrap net inflows, strong experience advisor recruiting, and excellent margin expansion. Asset Management provided a strong contribution to profitability and sustained very competitive margins through tight expense management during the period of outflows.","Annuities and life and health insurance underlying earnings remain within expectations in light of the low rate environment. Auto & Home was profitable in the quarter, reflecting the enhancements we\u2019ve made to pricing and operations. Finally, our balance sheet remains strong, enabling us to return over 150% of operating earnings to shareholders in 2016. Excluding unlocking, we returned over 135%.","Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7. Ameriprise delivered EPS of $2.73, up a 11% from the prior year. Advice & Wealth Management delivered 21% growth in earnings and Auto & Home had a substantial turnaround in results. G&A expenses remain well managed. We continue to invest in targeted growth areas and overall remained disciplined. G&A declined 4% even with elevated corporate segment expenses including a $11 million of DOL project costs and $12 million in severance costs.","As Jim said, we are monitoring and evolving situation as it relates to the DOL. A substantial number of projects were well underway in anticipation of the April deadline. So this level of DOL expense will continue in quarter one. Beyond that, the level of expense will be fluid until there is more clarity. We returned the substantial amount to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase with $523 million returned in the quarter and $2.2 billion for the full year. And ROE reached 24.6% for the year, excluding AOCI and unlocking.","Let\u2019s turn to segment performance. Starting on Slide 8, the Advice & Wealth Management businesses continues to perform very well, delivering strong business metrics and financial results. We are seeing strong leading indicators for this business, excellent recruiting, strong advisor retention, and client acquisition, all contributing to record client asset levels and positioning our platform for future growth.","Operating net revenue was up 4% from last year to $1.3 billion in the quarter, from solid wrap net inflows, higher earnings on brokerage cash, and asset-based fees. We saw a portion of the impact from the December rate increase and expect additional lift in 2017.","We\u2019re tightly managing G&A expenses, down 5% from last year. We\u2019re making target investments for growth while controlling the overall expense base. Finally we delivered an excellent operating margin a quarter at 19.3%. In 2016 our margin was 18.1%, an increase of 100 basis points versus 2015.","Asset Management continues to generate good profitability as you can see on Slide 9. Assets under management were $454 billion and included $18 billion impact from foreign exchange. Adjusting for the impact of foreign exchange, AUM was essentially unchanged from a year ago, as market depreciation largely offset the impact of net outflows on AUM.","Operating net revenues decreased 9% to $761 million, reflecting lower performance fees than the prior year and foreign exchange changes. We continue to live on our goal of maintaining competitive margins in the business by tightly managing expenses. This is demonstrated by an 11% decrease in G&A expenses, a portion on which related to foreign exchange translation and lower performance fee compensation. Excluding those items G&A was still down 6%.","Pre-tax operating earnings were $169 million, unchanged compared to a year ago if you exclude elevated performance fees in the prior year. We continued to deliver margins in the 35% to 39% target range for both the quarter and the year.","Turning to annuities on Slide 10, the segment is performing in line with our expectations, giving the market environment, with pre-tax operating earnings of $127 million down $25 million from last year. This decline reflects the ongoing impact from unlocking assumption changes and continued low interest rates. As a reminder, last quarter we updated policyholder behavior assumptions to reflect current experience as part of the annual unlocking process. As we indicated last quarter we expected an ongoing impact of variable annuity earnings relating to those changes of approximately $40 million per year, primarily from an increase in the growth rate of the living benefit reserve.","Results in the quarter included $11 million from this change. Our assumptions will be revisited again in the third quarter as part of the 2017 unlocking Additionally, variable annuity net outflows were elevated in 2016 reflecting the industry decline in VA sales as well as higher lapses, those still within actuary expectations. In fixed annuities we are continuing to see account values decline, given minimal sales in this rate environment.","Turning to the Protection segment on Slide 11, pre-tax operating earnings were $59 million in the quarter. Auto & Home has had a significant turnaround and delivered an operating profit in the quarter, which included a benefit from lower reserves that was partially offset by a true up of our prior period cat losses.","As we previously told you, the actions we have taken to improve our pricing, underwriting and claims practices are taking hold, and positive trends have emerged in the last couple of quarters. We will continue to monitor performance in the book to determine if further reserve actions are appropriate. We are seeing Auto & Home premium trends in the right direction, reflecting the price increases we are making, which more than offset the decline in policy count related to underwriting change.","The life and health business delivered solid results. There were some large unusual items in both the current and prior year. Last year we disclosed a favorable $28 million waiver of premium adjustment for life insurance. And the current quarter included two unfavorable items totaling $10 million that are not expected to reoccur. Overall, claims experience was in line with expectations.","Let\u2019s turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. Our balance sheet fundamentals remain strong. Our excess capital is approximately $2 billion with an estimated RBC ratio of approximately 500%. Our hedging program has been quite effective with weighted managed hedged effectiveness at 99% in a quarter. And the investment portfolio remains strong and diversified with net unrealized gain position of $1.2 billion.","We returned $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in 2016, which was over a 150% of operating earnings, or over a 135% excluding unlocking. As we enter 2017 we are still targeting to return 90% to 100% of operating earnings to shareholders as a baseline, but we will adjust that as we assess market conditions and our valuation.","And with that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from Citi.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with advice and wealth, just as we think about trending this over the course of 2017. In that 19% margin in the fourth quarter was there anything sort of that we need to think about as being particularly favorable in the quarter or was that a pretty clean result?","Walter Berman","It\u2019s Walter. You should look at it as a pretty clean result.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then as we think about that shift that you talked about from 12b-1 to advisory, what sort of impact is that going to have on the margin? I think the earnings are probably going to be fairly stable and maybe revenue is lower. So I would think that would improve the margin, but just any color on that.","Walter Berman","Yes, it will improve the margin. But again there\u2019s fundamentals that are going to substantially increase the margin also. So, yes, there will be some lift because of the revenue adjustment as it comes through, but again, we don\u2019t know exactly how much is being repriced right now which would offset that \u2013 from a margin standpoint. But clearly there we see the margin improving even beside that.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just on Asset Management, I think Jim you had mentioned that I think what you call the funded pipeline and institutional is the largest ever. Can you give us a sense of how big that pipeline is?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, it is the biggest ever that we\u2019ve had. We don\u2019t really put out numbers at this point, but I would probably say it continued to sort of build \u2013 we were \u2013 the extra delays that we experienced in the fourth quarter we\u2019re hoping it will carry over and we\u2019re still getting some more wins that we expect in the first quarter. So I would probably just say on a relative basis it\u2019s the highest we\u2019ve ever had.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just a last one from me. Back in December, Jim, you talked about at a conference the earnings mix of the company over time and I think the slide said 75% plus from the cumulation businesses near-term, which I\u2019m assuming is two or three years. Did that contemplate any acquisitions or divestitures or is that kind of what you think you can do organically?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, that was organically. That was \u2013 it did not contemplate acquisitions or divestitures.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Dally from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks, good morning. Had a question about the DOL. I know a lot of what you\u2019re doing would remain unchanged, but how would your strategy change at all if it was delayed and would there be any earnings impact from a delay?","Jim Cracchiolo","So as I mentioned before there are certain things we\u2019re continuing with like the move away from 12b-1s and advisory shares, putting that in place, institutional share classes et cetera that we\u2019re going to continue down that road. But if there was a delay and the administration is reevaluating, we\u2019ll participate in that, but what that would mean is that part of the activities relating to the big exemption and the activity changes there would probably be put on hold across the industry for revision or review further. So we would probably hold on that activity level and what we would do there until there is some clarity about what would be appropriate or what the industry will move towards with new regulation.","Nigel Dally","Okay. Then just on recruiting, you also spoke to recruiting strengths in a certain pipeline, but the number of advisors shrunk down a little. So I guess provide a color as to what was driving that.","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So there are two things. One is we continued to sort of wean out a lower produces in our employee channel and so in that regard we\u2019re bringing in higher productive advisors. And so as people are hitting thresholds, are not hitting thresholds, they\u2019re starting to reevaluate whether they should be in the channel there. The second thing is we experienced a little higher turnover in our franchisee with some of their assistance as they continue to make adjustments based upon the environment and the regulation and what they needed to do there for their own areas.","So we don\u2019t see anything significant in a sense of a pickup. We had some additional retirees where they transferred their book internal to our succession planning before the new regulations have come out, but nothing out of normal and it was more in the lower producer end, if anything.","Nigel Dally","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Mewhirter from SunTrust.","Nancy Rosenberg","Hi, good morning. This is actually Nancy Rosenberg on for Doug Mewhirter. Thank you for taking my question. In Asset Management your mutual fund outflow seem to be high aside from FX and conditions in the European market. Is there anything else driving those outflows and then are you seeing those trends moderate into the first quarter?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So we did experience two things. We did experience a bit of a slowdown and some increase redemptions out of our UK activities, Europe in particular due to the Brexit. But after the Brexit, some of the election and some of the unknown, I think you\u2019ve seen across Europe there\u2019s been a bit of a pullback, whereas the U.S. has actually seen more of an inflow. We\u2019re starting to see that stabilize as we move into the New Year which is good.","In the U.S. we saw some additional pickup in redemptions. I think that the industry also experienced more in the latter part of November, December. It was actually doing pretty well in October. So there was some adjustment there. We\u2019re hoping that again that starts to stabilize to come back in the New Year. So we\u2019re seeing some stabilization there as well. But those are the things that we saw a bit of a pickup that was probably more than we expected.","Nancy Rosenberg","Okay. And then in Advice & Wealth Management, you touched on this earlier. But is your lower distribution and G&A expense, is that mainly a function of turnover or are you also seeing like benefits from new policies from the fiduciary rule?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, what we\u2019ve been doing is we do modulate the amount of expense that we have within \u2013 across the company as you saw our G&A is down. We\u2019ve tightened up on our expenses. We\u2019re trying to get greater level of productivity from the activities that we have on the way. We have invested well in our technology and enablement. That is also giving us some good benefits.","So that\u2019s what we\u2019ve continued to sort of focus on knowing that the environment was a bit softer last year with both the markets on average were down, as well as just the idea that the increased regulation might have had some effect on activity. So, but we\u2019re seeing \u2013 manage and continue to manage expenses quite well so that we can use that as an offset to any pressure on the revenue side.","Nancy Rosenberg","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s all I have for now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks. Good morning. I want to follow-up on Suneet\u2019s question on the AWM margin. I guess Walter, is the takeaway from your comment that you think the fourth quarter margin is sustainable as we move into 2017 that\u2019s kind of a starting point before any impacts of potential short-term rate increases?","Walter Berman","So the issue is our average rate for the year was 18.1% and you get seasonality as it comes through, but we do see that will be depreciating in obviously within that they will get some benefit from the interest rate. But we do see a base level of increase.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. So think about the full year margin as a starting point with upside from there.","Walter Berman","Yes. Absolutely.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. And then just on the tax rate. Can you give us a rough sense of what you\u2019d expect in 2017 at this point?","Walter Berman","Yes. Again, looking at in, looking at the mix of business and everything and assuming obviously no benefit being derived, but based on what people are saying from the stack discussion going on in Washington, I would think 24% to 25% is probably a range, but it\u2019s fluid, but it\u2019s based upon the mix we\u2019ve seen in the business, I mean, it\u2019s a good number, good range.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Gallagher from Evercore ISI.","Thomas Gallagher","Good morning. First just a bigger picture question on Advice & Wealth Management. Jim or Walter, if you just look at some high level statistics your AWM revenue yield or higher than peers, by a considerable margin depending on which peers you\u2019re looking at. So certainly one of the better cases on your company is that your fee levels are quite high, over time they\u2019re going to have to come down meaningfully.","Now I think there are some pretty significant differences in your business versus those peers. But can you address that broad question and is there a movement for you as you\u2019re growing assets now to move that down or are there pretty significant differences? How would you address that issue?","Jim Cracchiolo","So I would say is that I think there are differences particularly we have a very strong fee-based business around our financial planning and advice that renders a lot of services to the clients on this full life planning, full retirement, everything from a state to children\u2019s education et cetera, so all of that is part of our fee-based model that is a great value to our clients. In addition to that when you look at, when you say the fees on an average client basis et cetera based on assets et cetera, it\u2019s very much in line based on asset levels et cetera, when you look at a competitive frame.","So of course fee rates for people who have a significant amount of wealth will be always lower than the people who might be in the mass affluent account based on size and effort for their services rendered. So there are differences there as well. So it\u2019s hard for me to do a compare on a just an absolute basis as you got to look at some. But the financial planning basic foundation and the services rendered there is part of our fee basis.","I would tell you that we generate very strong value in client, I mean, our net grows like I said was right at the top, and all of our ratings for client satisfaction for the services rendered. In fact the more we do the financial planning even though there\u2019s a fee for it the more the clients are satisfied. So we feel very comfortable with that as we continue to move forward and we\u2019d like more of our advisors to actually embrace that model more fully across their client base.","Thomas Gallagher","So, Jim, you don\u2019t see anything structurally that you need to change whether it\u2019s in terms of your typical structure moving far more aggressively into passives or just broader changes to level of fees based on your offerings, you don\u2019t see any real need to change in lieu of where things are going in the environment?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, the big change is removing the 12b-1s as there are more institutional share classes and where there aren\u2019t going to start to rebate. But moving that is a reduction in fee to the client for the cause as well as you move into institutional share classes across our range. The second thing very clearly there is as we look at our business model as anyone else, there is always the move to more fee-based. Our advisors are already factoring in their model portfolios and what they do passive ETFs. Having said that, it\u2019s not as still active doesn\u2019t make sense as a component of that based on a combination of factors including volatility and risk management and diversity of assets against the market conditions.","So we\u2019re helping our advisors to actually build more full fledged portfolios taking into account the combination of factors so that they can manage against the needs and the goals of the client, not just against the benchmark and we think that\u2019s very critical for the long-term achievement of what the client needs to do with less risk","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. And then finally, you\u2019ve previously said the change from 12b-1 to advisory shares shouldn\u2019t have any meaningful impact to your bottom line, because most of that was a pass through to the advisor. Now I assume you\u2019re closer along since it\u2019s now being \u2013 it has been implemented. Is that still the case or is that has that changed at all?","Jim Cracchiolo","No. I mean, we\u2019ve always had when we said we always have a piece of what the 12b-1s that we would get based on the grid, and whereas having said that we also said that we would work to offset that through a combination of expense management and other arrangements and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. So if you just took it as a direct, would there be a piece hit to it? The answer is yes. But as we said we are working to offset that as you\u2019ve seen that we\u2019ve been continuing to do in combination of expenses as well as ensuring that for services rendered and what our advisers start to actually do in certain cases, different than what they did in the past.","So it will have that effect, but we\u2019re looking to offset that, and we think we have things on the way that would help that along. Just like our advisors we\u2019ll make adjustments in their practices as they look at what they need to do. As I said, they\u2019ve tightened up their expenses as well in some instances.","Thomas Gallagher","That\u2019s helpful. So the margin benefit, I assume some of the significant expense improvement you saw in the margin this quarter, some of that\u2019s going to come \u2013 be given back in 1Q as you transition or is that \u2013?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So that\u2019s why we don\u2019t look at the 12b-1 just as a margin adjustment, because we would have gotten a cut at that will probably looking at it as a piece anyway. But what we\u2019re doing is what we just saw in the fourth quarter based on the expenses that we tightened and now we want that to roll in.","So last year we had a full year margin of 18.1%. You can look at the various quarters based on your activity and expenses that pickup in certain times. But we\u2019re looking for that to increase from 18.1% on an annual basis and that would also help to offset anything that would be the reduction in the 12b-1 from a revenue perspective to translate in so that\u2019s why we also said the 2019 is what we\u2019re shooting for as we go forward and continuing to roll on a full year basis.","Thomas Gallagher","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erik Bass from Autonomous.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. I had a question about the recent FCA review of the Asset Management business in the UK. And what you see as the potential implications for Threadneedle if there\u2019s any impact you would expect on sales or margins?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. As you\u2019re aware the FCA has published an interim Asset Management Market study which they\u2019re inviting comment. The focus is on regulated funds and delivering value for the investor. We\u2019re currently engaging with the FCA through a series of industry roundtables as well as the industry bodies on how that recommendations and the markets study can best be taken forward. So I mean it just recently come out. We\u2019re looking at that across and within the industry and we\u2019ll be working to get back with the FCA and give our comments and understand what they might want to move forward with. So it\u2019s a little early yet to talk about it.","Erik Bass","Okay. And then maybe a follow-up to think sort of what Tom was asking. Can you just discuss the average wrap account fees and if there\u2019s been sort of any changes in those over time and do you anticipate any pressure on wrap fees as the discount brokers continue to both reduce commissions and index fund costs?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. I think there\u2019s been a lot of talk when you look at it against the industry of just a wrap of an ETF or no support from an advisor and you just have a separate portfolio that\u2019s all automated. And so the real value of what the advisor brings is much more than just putting together a simple allocation of ETFs, and then let the client fend for themselves. So the read real key around the advice value proposition is the advice that\u2019s tangential to that; how to help a client with their behavior, how do you help them make decisions against their various goals and when to adjust, when to add, when to take out, what\u2019s tax beneficial, what\u2019s not and how to manage that volatility through cycle.","So I do believe as with anything it\u2019s always a competitive frame and there will always be adjustments, but at the end of the day as I said I think would Ameriprise and our advisors we continue to actually move more upmarket, we continue to gain greater client flows based on the type of client that we\u2019re continuing to bring in based on advisor value proposition.","So we\u2019re looking at is there will always be some adjustments when necessary based on services rendered or price in the market. But the value added of the advisor, I think is still very important and very critical and our advisors know when they are \u2013 with their clients what is the price and the value that they\u2019re offering for the services rendered. But also I would say we\u2019re going to continue to focus on continuing to move a bit more upmarket so that the asset levels go up in which case prices may on a fee basis on a relative go down, but it will be offset by volume.","Erik Bass","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The following question comes from Humphrey Lee from Dowling & Partners.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the brokerage cash balances in AWM it continues to build, I think the $26 billion plus is probably a record high. Just thinking about what the high short-term rate and kind of what you are doing in terms of enhancing productivity at the advisors channel. How should we think about the deployment of those cash balances in terms of the engagement between your advisors and clients and how should we think about the client activities going forward?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yes. So as we looked at last year, we saw in the beginning part of the year a more of a slowdown in activity. If you remember, the markets were very volatile, they fell a lot, there were a lot of unknowns, then you have Brexit et cetera. And so what we started to see as you saw in the fourth quarter some of our flows in back into wrap business started to pickup again and we continue to see that now as we move into the New Year.","So we\u2019ve brought in assets, the cash balances built, the advisors didn\u2019t put as much to work, they started to do that again in the fourth quarter. And if we continue to see \u2013 there\u2019s always events and changes, but as we continue to see move forward particularly if there\u2019s some delay in regulation as well, but the market conditions have improved, interest rates are starting to pick up a little bit, economic activity is more positive.","So I actually believe that some of those assets will go to work as we move in through 2017. And the good thing is that we \u2013 they have the cash on hand to do it and we\u2019re bringing in flows. So that\u2019s the positive. And also as Walter mentioned, there is a pickup of interest rates that have just happened at the end \u2013 latter part of December and it looks like a few more rate increases coming that would also get money to work.","Humphrey Lee","Just I guess, more of a generic question regarding to the cash balances. Is there any seasonality based on kind of what you\u2019re suggesting as money putting to work and money into the fourth quarter and maybe a little bit on the sideline and putting more to work in the coming year. So is there something with seasonality with respect to the cash balances?","Walter Berman","Yes. There is a small seasonality as it relates to the December build up. But it\u2019s again this is record numbers for us and but there is a small seasonality in the fourth quarter.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar","Good morning everybody. So you touched on the FCA report. Can you also maybe talk on, about the method too, of regulation in Europe and how you see that impacting your business at Threadneedle? And then what adjustments you may be making?","Walter Berman","Well, obviously we are working through it as it relates to it and from that standpoint it is certainly going to have an element of a lot more reporting, a lot more rigor and looking at again to avoid the conflicts similar to the RGR what they did. So we are working through it. We have a teams on it and we will certainly be compliant with the elements within the timeframes that prescribed.","Yaron Kinar","Do you see it as having any impact on flows or profitability?","Walter Berman","Not at this stage.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And then in Advice & Wealth Management, so productivity is up little bit this quarter. Can you remind us where you think this productivity level could move to assuming a gradual improvement in the rate environment and then kind of normalized market appreciation?","Jim Cracchiolo","So regarding the productivity as I said, I still think there\u2019s a little bit of an overhang depending on the regulatory frame that people will be working on to get compliant if that was to move forward. I think the other things that we brought about in the switch to advisory shares and the changes we\u2019re making there is working its way through. It occurred starting last year, but we\u2019re making the changes as we go into the first quarter.","And so the real question then is whether the rule moves forward for full implementation starting in April, in which case, we\u2019ll have activity and training in all activities as we continue to move forward. If that is put on delay then that would actually help with the idea that advisors can be back focused on their book in growing their book. So that\u2019s what we would probably say at this juncture.","Yaron Kinar","Okay. And maybe a little bit differently, in terms of the pivoting from the lower productivity advisors into higher productivity advisors and the hiring of more experienced advisors, where would you say we\u2019re at \u2013 what stage in the game are we at today?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, we are continuing to bring in now higher producing advisors based on our recruiting. So the GVC is going up where the total of their productivity is going up that we are recruiting in. Now for the people we\u2019ve recruited in and the new people we\u2019re bringing, that continues to ramp up. And you could probably start to see that even more in our P1 channel or employee channel as that continues to go through fruition.","So we\u2019re continuing to see that as something that will be part of the equation going forward. And again, it\u2019s sort of a gradual quarter-by-quarter with what people we bring in; they ramp up, et cetera, but the pipeline for our recruits still look very good. We\u2019re even bringing in a lot more million dollar practices that was highest we\u2019ve ever did in 2016 based on our value proposition. So we want to continue along that focus into 2017.","Yaron Kinar","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from John Nadel from Credit Suisse.","John Nadel","Good morning. Thanks for getting me in. So I guess I have a couple of quick ones for you. So if we think about the full year 2016 margin for Advice & Wealth Management at 18%. How big is the differential at this point between the margin produced by your franchisee channel and your employee channel?","Walter Berman","Okay. As we\u2019ve indicated, we are \u2013 the employee channel is building as you get the advisors and they vintage through, so that is actually improving, but that is lower than the franchise channel. But that gap has really narrowed from that standpoint as when we started this journey. So I would say they are certainly moved into the mid-teens and the franchise channel is closer to the high-teens.","John Nadel","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Walter. Thank you. And then a couple of years ago at your Investor Day you showed us a hypothetical impact from a 200 basis points rise in the fed funds and that would \u2013 all else equal that would drive about a 4 point increase in the pre-tax margin in Advice & Wealth Management. If I think back on that though I think the level of brokerage cash balances was about half than of what it is today. Does that make a significant difference in how we should think about that?","Walter Berman","Well, I don\u2019t \u2013 I have to go back and reference, but it clearly I think we were probably in the mid-teens back then depending on what year and certainly it has grown. As we assess it, as we talked about it, there is \u2013 looking at the environment, we believe for the first 100 basis points we\u2019re going to \u2013 as we talked about, 80% range will fall to us, and then as you progress up you would start to stream that depending on competitive situation.","So I\u2019d have to go back to the \u2013 from that standpoint, but environment\u2019s different, certainly we\u2019ve grown, you\u2019re going to get the volume, and then it\u2019s a matter of getting the rate mix shift. And so I think the math that we told you for sure on the first 100 that we should get the 80, and then we have to go from there and look at the competitive elements as we assess it today.","John Nadel","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then the last question I have for you is really more of \u2013 it\u2019s a bit of a hypothetical as well. So it\u2019s no secret that you guys were at the late stages of looking at a relatively sizable Asset Management transaction that went in a different direction. But I\u2019m curious, if you did a transaction that was going to cost somewhere between $3 billion and $4 billion, would you need to issue equity as part of that transaction financing?","Walter Berman","Hypothetically speaking it was not our intention to issue equity. We really do believe we have the capacity to not do that.","John Nadel","And so maybe another way of thinking about it is how long do you anticipate the buyback would need to be either turned off or curtailed? Would it be a matter of a year or less than a year?","Walter Berman","Okay. So that, again, we look at returning to shareholders in a different way, but clearly as we looked at your hypothetical, we certainly feel we\u2019re oppressing, then we have to gauge the circumstances, the buyback, the simulation looking at the agencies and everything, but certainly the capacity is there and we generate a lot of cash. And so it\u2019s transitioning the upper elements, but again, let me go back to your original premise. It was not intended in something of that nature that equity would be the element that we would use, so it would be more from dead or internal cash.","John Nadel","Terrific. Thank you so much.","Operator","We have no further questions at this time. Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Lauren and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Alicia Charity. Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be pleased to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials available on our website.","Some statements that we make on the call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and operating plans and performance.

We take no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo ","Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. I\u2019ll start with my thoughts on the business Walter will review the numbers in detail and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","It was another strong quarter for Ameriprise, continuing the trend we set in the first half of the year. Our operating results were very strong with net revenue growth at 8%, excluding unlocking. Operating earnings and EPS growth were each over 20%. Assets under management and administration increased 8%, $797 billion reflecting strong advisory client flows as well as market appreciation. Our capital and financial position is excellent and we continue to generate significant free cash flow to return to shareholders.","During the quarter, we returned $442 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Year-to-date through to the quarter end, we have returned $1.4 billion to shareholders which is 112% of year-to-date operating earnings. We\u2019re on our way to four consecutive years of returning over 100% of our operating earnings to shareholders. With our earnings growth and capital return, we again delivered record operating return on equity excluding AOCI of 22.1%, up 270 basis points from a year ago.","Let\u2019s move to the business and Advice & Wealth Management where we had another excellent quarter. Operating net revenues grew 13% to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth and assets from client flows and equity market appreciation. As I mentioned, we\u2019re seeing good levels of activity. Total client assets increased 11% to $434 billion with continued strong inflows of $3.8 billion into our investment advisory programs. The combination of strong flows, asset growth, and productivity, as well as ongoing expense management led to a 35% increase in operating PTI and pre-tax operating margin up significantly to 16.9%. ","Our priority is to bring in new clients and assets to Ameriprise and to deepen relationships so we can continue to increase retail client flows. In September, we were back on the air with a new commercial from our Real Questions, Real Answers advertising campaign featuring our confident retirement approach. A recent study showed that more than two-thirds of affluent consumers do not have a formal financial plan to reach their long-term goals. We know that confident retirement not only tests well with the mass affluent, but also with affluent consumers, those with over $1 million in investable assets. In fact, we think there is a greater opportunity for us to serve more of the affluent consumer base.","I recently attended a conference with our private wealth advisors and they\u2019re motivated to grow further in affluent market using the capabilities we offer that resonate well with these consumers. Overall, our advisor force is strong and our retention as well as satisfaction rates remain very high. In terms of recruiting experienced advisors, we brought in another 81 in the quarter. The productivity of the advisors we\u2019re attracting continues to grow and our recruiting pipeline so far in the fourth quarter looks quite good.","In terms of bringing in new clients and assets and AWM, we\u2019re pleased with our confident retirement approaches engaging our existing clients, as well as prospects. Our advisors are finding it really helps to simplify the conversation so people better understand what they need to do to plan for a secure retirement and how Ameriprise can help.","Our advisors, who are using it with their clients in the target age range, have had meaningful increase in net flows. We\u2019re also investing in and helping our advisors take advantage of our technology, marketing, and social media capabilities to increase their productivity, gain new clients, and deepen current relationships. We\u2019re helping advisor offices operate more efficiently. Our paperless office tools like e-forms and electronic check scanning reduce expenses for advisors and the company, as well as the complexity and time needed to manage client documents.","We also have a new online tool for document creation and management making it easier for advisors and their teams to work and collaborate wherever they may be. And in terms of engaging clients, we\u2019re also seeing success with our Total View, our account aggregation tool as a way to help deepen relationships.","Our advisors are also increasingly using our award-winning social media to expand their digital presence and acquire clients. Our social media capabilities can help advisors build a credible, robust online presence to encourage shared connections with prospective clients.","During the quarter, we received results from a client relationship study and satisfaction with both our advisors and with Ameriprise has increased 3 points to 92%, an all-time high. In addition, 93% of our clients said they\u2019re likely to continue working with Ameriprise, also up 3%.","As a result of our efforts and the actions we\u2019ve focused on to drive growth, advisory productivity, a metric we\u2019ve consistently grown continues to increase. Compared to a year ago, it\u2019s up double-digits to $483,000 on a trailing 12 month basis. Overall, it was another terrific quarter for Advice & Wealth Management.","Now let\u2019s move to Asset Management, where we\u2019re delivering good financial performance but we have more work to do from a flows perspective. Our assets under management grew to $505 billion, up 5% from a year ago mainly driven by positive equity markets as well as growth in our International business. We had a strong quarter from an earnings perspective.","Operating net revenues were up 8% and we\u2019re managing expenses as we invest in the business. Pre-tax operating earnings were up 21% to $208 million and our adjusted pre-tax operating margin was a competitive 41.3%.","In terms of the business and our flows in the quarter, overall we experienced net outflows of about $4 billion. Nearly half of that came from ex-parent affiliated distribution including Zurich and Balboa. The remainder was due to domestic outflows and DCIO, RIA and sub-advisory.","However, we\u2019re seeing some stabilization in these flows. We\u2019ve also experienced net outflows from weaker European retail flows. As well, we were affected by PM moves earlier in the year. We believe that the impact of the PM change is largely behind us and there is good performance coming from the team.","This was somewhat offset by strong third party institutional flows of about $1 billion where winning key mandates from clients in North America, Europe, and Asia. The Institutional business is on track and I feel very good about our capabilities and global growth opportunity.","We\u2019ve also added Joe Kringdon, an industry veteran as Head of U.S. Intermediary reporting to Ted. We\u2019re refocusing our efforts on key client relationships where we can drive flows in the future and expect to gain traction over time. ","In addition to our focus on gaining share in traditional products, we\u2019re building our capabilities in global products and in multi-asset solutions for both our Retail and Institutional channels. We\u2019re investing expanding in areas like adaptive risk parity, liquid alternatives, Asian equity and bonds, and global products.","And we think that over time we can gain good traction that would further add to our flows and complement our core business as we build our track record and awareness of these products and our capabilities.","Overall, we have good talent, a growing product line and expanding distribution footprint. We\u2019re executing our plan and beginning to gain traction in key growth areas but there is more to do.","Let\u2019s move to annuities and protection, which help us deepen relationships with our clients across life stages and are important to our confident retiming approach. Adjusting for unlocking, we\u2019re generating good returns in our Annuities business with lower risk and volatility as we continue to grow at the moderate pace we want.","In Variable Annuities, client account balances grew 5% due to market appreciation and we had good sales in our channel at about $1.2 billion. As we work with clients to help ensure their retirement lifestyle through tax management and protection, we\u2019re selling more variable annuities without living benefits. This complements sales with living benefits as a way for clients to cover essential living expenses. ","In fact, sales of the variable annuities, without living benefits, increased to nearly 30% of total variable annuity sales in the quarter.","In Fixed Annuities, underlying results are up from our re-pricing of the book and improved spread income. As we stated, our focus remains on the overall profitability of the book as we\u2019re not currently adding to it.","Overall, with folks still making it easier for clients and advisors to understand the benefits that annuities can provide in terms of reliable retirement income.","With regard to Protection, excluding unlocking, pre-tax operating earnings were up 10%. In Life Insurance, earnings were impacted by higher health claims although it was within our expected ranges. VUL\/UL sales picked up a bit year-over-year with our RiverSource TrioSource product. VUL\/UL ending account balances were up 6% largely from the markets. TrioSource is an interesting UL product that combines a tax qualified long-term care rider that fits well with our financial planning approach.","In Auto & Home, earnings improved and we\u2019re seeing steady growth in policies, up 11% from a year ago. We\u2019re seeing improved levels of loss ratios. We have initiatives underway to enhance our modeling and pricing capabilities that we believe will get us back to a stronger position over the next number of quarters. ","Ameriprise Auto & Home is rated one of the best for client satisfaction in the second quarter. And to complement that, we were recently ranked number two in California by a leading consumer publication that measured consumer satisfaction based on price, distribution, and policy offerings. We consistently earn high accolades for our offering.","To summarize, we had a strong third quarter with solid revenue growth, strong operating earnings growth, and operating ROE north of 22%. I feel good about our current position. Our diversified business provides great benefits for clients, advisors, and our shareholders.","We continue to grow the business consistent with our plan, expanding our fee based earnings, complemented by the stability and diversification of our spread business. At quarter end, about 64% of our pre-tax operating earnings, excluding unlocking, were driven by our low capital, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management businesses.","Like everyone, we\u2019re paying close attention to global markets and providing our advisors with resources and thoughtful insights to use with clients understanding that while they\u2019re focused on planning for the long term goals, the current markets are top of mind.","Our strong business results, excellent financial foundation, and ability to generate significant free cash flow provides the ability to continue to return to shareholders as we have in the past.","With that, I'll pass the call to Walter, for a review of the numbers.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered another quarter of excellent financial results. So let\u2019s start with operating and net revenue growth on Page 3.","In total, operating net revenues grew 8% due to strong market appreciation and wrap flows, partially offset by net outflows in Asset Management. It should be noted that net investment income has been challenged by the low interest rate environment but the other revenue lines are up almost 10% from last year.","Total assets under management and administration increased 8% to nearly $800 billion at the end of the quarter. Solid revenue growth, combined with continued expense discipline, resulted in a record AWM and Asset Management margin of 16.9% and 41.3% respectively.","Together, Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management operating earnings grew 27% and accounted for 68% of earnings. Excluding DAC unlocking, those segments account for 64% of the earnings, up from 59% last year demonstrating our continued business mix shift.","Let's turn to EPS and return on equity on slide four. Operating return on equity continues to increase reaching another all-time high of 22.1% and in the upper end of our targeted range of 19% to 23%. Operating earnings per share also reached a new record level of $2.10. Excluding unlocking in both periods, EPS was up 28% to $2.24. This is the result of solid business growth and fundamentals across all segments as well as continued capital redeployment.","I\u2019ll turn to slide five to take you through the details on Advice & Wealth Management. We continued to deliver excellent business metrics and financial results in Advice & Wealth Management with 13% top line growth. Pre-tax operating earnings were up 35% to $205 million due to strong client flows, asset levels, and market appreciation.","As we have discussed previously, we are seeing continued improvement in the earnings and margins in both the employee and franchise channels. In total, margins reached a new record high of 16.9%, up 270 basis points. The spread earned on the $19 billion of brokerage cash was 19 basis points for this quarter. So there remains substantial upside potential for an increase in short term rates going forward. Overall, the business continues to deliver consistent good results demonstrating the strength of our business model.","We continue to invest for future growth, building on our brand and adding capabilities to support our clients and advisors. Turning to Asset Management on slide six, revenues increased 8% to $839 million primarily from growth in assets under management from strong markets and performance fees at Threadneedle. And we remain focused on tightly managing expenses.","We continue to deliver solid financial performance with earnings growth of 21% and our margin exceeding 40%. Investment performance remains solid with 121 four and five star rated funds and we saw improvement across many styles at Columbia.","Let\u2019s turn to flows on slide seven. In the quarter, we experienced 4.1 billion of net outflows. We had net outflows of 3.5 billion in retail across Columbia and Threadneedle. We had outflows in several areas we had discussed in the past, namely former parent affiliated distribution.","In addition, we continue to face some challenges in Retail at Columbia particularly in the DCIO channel. We had Retail net outflows of $1 billion at Threadneedle due to industry weakness in Europe and from a portfolio manager change on the U.S. equities team from earlier this year.","U.S. equity performance remains solid and the level of outflows has declined. Institutional net outflows of $500 million were driven by strong $1.1 billion of third party net inflows at Columbia which were more than offset by several former parent related areas at both Columbia and Threadneedle. The third party institutional pipeline remains solid looking over the next couple of quarters.","Turning to annuities on slide eight, pre-tax operating earnings were $128 million, down from $205 million last year due to unlocking and re-reversion. Excluding those items in both periods, pre-tax operating earnings were up 18%.Variable annuity pre-tax operating earnings grew 12% from a year ago to 119 million excluding unlocking and re-reversion. This was driven by higher fees from improved equity markets.","The inflows [ph] block is solid with account values up $5% to $76 billion. Our net amount at risk as a percent of account value is less than 1% in total for living benefits and death benefits.","We continue to write new business with a very attractive risk profile offering products with living benefit guarantees using our managed volatility funds and products without living benefits that provide tax advantage accumulation for our clients. In fact, 28% of our new sales in the quarter were without living benefits.","Fixed annuity pre-tax operating earnings increased 42% to $37 million excluding unlocking. This reflects the re-pricing of the majority of our five-year guaranteed block. Fixed annuity account values declined 8% to $12.4 billion with lapse rates in line with our expectations.","Turning to Protection on slide nine, pre-tax operating earnings were up 10% to $87 million excluding unlocking. Our Life & Health businesses were impacted by the continued low interest rate environment. Health claims were in line with expectation but at the higher end of the range. Auto & Home earnings continue to improve this quarter. Our prior accident years are performing well and we have had no additional adverse loss development.","Let\u2019s turn to capital on Slide 10, our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $2.5 billion of excess capital. Based upon our risk management assessment, we reduced our contingent capital for market dislocation from $500 million to $250 million which contributed to the increase in excess capital. We continue to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders with $442 million distributed through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. Our significant return on capital is an important driver of our ROE expansion reaching 22.1%.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please, go ahead.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","","I just wanted to start with the Asset Management earnings for the quarter, I guess $208 million. If I look back over the past four quarters and take out the disclosed items that you typically give us, seems the range has been $178 million to $194 million, so 3Q 2014 was quite a bit above that range. My first question was there anything either seasonal or unusual that drove the upside in 3Q versus what we've seen the past couple of quarters? ","","Walter Berman ","Suneet, its Walter. The two things, we had performance fees and also the market gave us a lift and those are the two items that drove both the earnings up and the margin going up 40.","","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Can you quantify the performance fees?","Walter Berman","It\u2019s around $9 million.","","Suneet Kamath - UBS","And that's not -- that's not a quarterly thing that happens? That's just a third quarter event?","Walter Berman","No. That actually happens throughout the quarters. And as we -- but that does happen throughout the quarters.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay. So we could see that again in 4Q, performance from Israel.","Walter Berman","Absolutely.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Moving to Advice & Wealth Management, at your investor day, you gave us some good information about some of the margins by channel. Could give us an update in terms of where you sit today? ","Walter Berman","","As we indicated on the employee channel, that is certainly heading into the high single digits, and that is improving, as we talked about. And certainly on our franchise channel is performing in the high teens.","","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Okay. And then on the recruited advisors of 81, has there been any change? My understanding is over the past several quarters it\u2019s been about 50-50 between which channels the EARs go into. Is that about where you continue to be?","Walter Berman","That\u2019s approximately right. Yes.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Then my last question and I'll re-queue, is just on the earnings mix. So 64% from Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management, if you exclude the unlocks, that seems to be coming in higher than at least where I thought it would be at this stage in the story. Where do you see that going over the next couple years in terms of the earnings contribution from A&WM and Asset Management?","Walter Berman","As Jim has indicated and we indicated, certainly we see that it could hit 70%. We see it going up. And we talked about 70%, and certainly again into that range. So, and it is tracking. We\u2019re doing well in the two areas.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","","Okay. It just seems to me that we could push above 70%, particularly if short-term interest rates start to give you some help.","Walter Berman","One could, yes.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","All right. I\u2019ll re-queue. Thanks.","","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Katz from Citi. Please, go ahead.","","Bill Katz - Citi ","","Thank you very much. Good morning. I appreciate you taking the questions. Just staying on the Asset Management business for a moment. Your adjusted margin was over 40%. I think it's a bit higher, you called out some performance fees, but I assume there's some comp against that. So, when you look on a go-forward basis, just given some of the new product development that you have coming down the pike, how are you thinking about margin opportunity from here? ","James Cracchiolo","The margin opportunity, as we said, we were in the ranges of the upper 30s, and I think that again is a market driven and other things, and certainly as the products take on, you get mix shifts also coming between fixed and equity so there\u2019s a lot of moving parts to it. But certainly staying in the upper teens and 40 range is certainly something that is possible. Again, it\u2019s subjects to market, so if the mix shift as it relates to where it's fixed or its equity.","Bill Katz - Citi ","In terms of the flow dynamics, I'm sort of curious. A lot of volatility through the end of the third quarter and into October. Any sort of update on real time trends of what's happening? Then the broader question would be, [you listed offers here at] sort of five or six initiatives maybe even more than that. When do you think that you could start to see some unit growth filtering into net flows from those initiatives?","James Cracchiolo","Well, what we see, this is Jim. What we see right now is we still have a good strong pipeline and institutional business. We\u2019ve been expanding some of our mandates on a more global basis, and winning business there. We are building new products and capabilities, both our global as well as our asset allocation, risk parody, et cetera. And we see flows starting to come in, in that type of area. Probably as we go into the 2015 and the quarters in 2015 that that would hopefully start to add to our flow picture as those products come more online and we build up the sales channel for it. The retail, we see some improvements. Retail sales slowed a bit in the third quarter because of Europe. I think you'll find that across the industry. It\u2019s more of a slowing on the sales, but that has bounced back in the past as things settled. So we\u2019re expecting hopefully that over the next number of months to continue to turn around again. And if we look at the U.S. side of it, we think there is a large opportunity for us to get really focused. We have a new leadership. We are really looking at our various channels and our products right now. So hopefully we\u2019ll gain some traction. We see some traction being gained, but unfortunately we had some additional outflows that we experienced in the third quarter from some of the DCIO et cetera that we think is starting to stem.","","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Great. Hey, Jim, Walter, good morning, guys. The first question I'm going to have is around the AWM business, one of the larger independent players in the space has been facing some challenges more recently with respect to compliance and regulation-related issues. I was just wondering whether or not when you look at your financial advisor pipeline you starting to potentially gain more traction? Partially due to these sort of dislocations in the industry seeing how you guys have been somehow more immune from some of these compliance issues.","Walter Berman","We have a very good compliance model in place, good technology, good supervision. We have very good expertise, particularly in some of these alternative products that we offer. So we feel very comfortable about that from a compliance and regulatory perspective. We are seeing a good pipeline of people both coming from independence as well as from the warehouses into our channel. One of the things that we sort of focus on is making sure that we do a very good compliant business, but we also are very focused from our client perspective. One of the keys that we really look for is high client satisfaction. As we mentioned, we just completed our annual study there, and our client satisfaction is quite strong, both for the advisor and the firm. And that\u2019s some of the things that we really focus on. And when we put the tools, the capabilities, the programs we have in place and the advice type of model. So that\u2019s what we're looking to continue to attract here for new people joining us.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And since you mentioned, just curious if you guys would be willing to tell what -- when look at the OEM revenues, how much are non-traded REITs, have been contributing so far this year?","Walter Berman","I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head, but I think it\u2019s actually a bit lower than it has been in the past based on just the market situation for some of those products, less on the compliant end for us. That hasn\u2019t been an issue. It\u2019s just more on the type of product in this market environment.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs ","Got it. Thanks. Second question for Walter. Clearly G&A has been really well controlled both in AWM and Asset Management. Maybe taking a step back, kind of bigger picture, if you could talk a little bit about how should we think about the growth in the G&A expense in both of these segments from here into 2015?","James Cracchiolo","Again, we it\u2019s one of the focuses is, Alex, of the way we manage the business both to invest in the business and reengineer, and that continually is being done. So we do look at that as something that we manage and contain relative to the opportunity and relative to our revenue growth. So you should see it being controlled going forward as we look into 2015.","","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs ","Got it. Good to know. Then the last one for me, I noticed the amount of excess capital increased due to some of the reasons you guys discussed in the press release. Sort of additional $500 million relative to where you were last quarter. At the same time and not that anybody's complaining, but the amount in dollar terms of your kind of total buybacks and dividends has gone down over the last few quarters relative to what you were doing in 2013. So I guess when you kind of put these two things together, how should we think about deployment of that extra $500 million that showed up in your excess capital?","","Walter Berman","Okay. Obviously we continue to evaluate the situation. But we certainly are committed to returning to our shareholders. And right now we\u2019re close to 110%. It is lower than it has been. As Jim said and we\u2019ve said, we will certainly manage it as we see the stock price, as we see the situation and being optimistic about it. But you see the trend line increasing as we indicated going forward, as what they that. So it will be something that, again we will continue to evaluate, but certainly it should be on a good trend line.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from a follow-up from Suneet Kamath from UBS. Please, go ahead.","","Suneet Kamath - UBS ","Thanks for the second question. Just to clarify on the performance fees at Threadneedle, the $9 million, Walter, that you cited, was that a revenue number or a pretax earnings number?","Walter Berman","That was pre-tax.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Pretax earnings, okay. Then I guess on the annuity business, particularly the variable annuity business. I guess if I look at your capital allocation, it's only about $564 million or about 0.7% of account value. That just seems like a very low capital allocation versus what I'm used to seeing from other companies. And I know your mix of business might be different from other companies. But I guess I'm just trying to understand how you get comfortable with only allocating that much capital to the business? That certainly has tail risk as we've seen in recent periods.","James Cracchiolo","This has been consistent as we\u2019ve evaluated our strategy of offering product, and certainly the way we hedge the product, and certainly as we\u2019ve gone into a more macro hedging. It has been something that has been. I would say the cornerstone of how we approach this business, which does distinguish us, I believe, from others. So we have evaluated the situation using the approach that I told you, multiple stress, looking at it. But you have to take a look at the product construct that we have, both the historic, and then just switching to the managed file, now more nonliving benefits and certainly the stability of the network and solution sector and the hedging that we\u2019ve deployed again. So we actually do feel very comfortable in evaluating and we\u2019re taking down from 500 to 250 looking at the situations. And we\u2019ve been very consistent. I do feel very comfortable with it.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Pretax earnings, okay. Then I guess on the annuity business, particularly the variable annuity business.

I do feel very comfortable with it.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Got it. And then I guess of the improvement in excess capital from I guess roughly $2 billion to $2.5 billion. So clearly $250 million of the $500 million is your decision to take down the contingent. But the remaining $250 million, whatever the number is, is that really just market movements between hedges and variable annuity liabilities that could reverse? Particularly if interest rates rise over the next couple quarters?","James Cracchiolo","Yes, that\u2019s part of it. And I would say the other part is a small portion of the debt that we just issued, went into that too. Because again, as we talked about, we are planning on certainly taking advantage of the rate situation and to use that for future maturities, but it is that and a small piece of it is the debt.","Suneet Kamath - UBS","Right. So if rates move up by the time we get to 4Q that would have a negative impact on the $2.5 billion of excess? ","James Cracchiolo","","It will have somewhat of a negative, but again, looking at our hedging strategy, looking at the other elements within it, it is certainly manageable within that. And so when we look at it, and I\u2019ll candid, taking it down from 500 to 250, we\u2019ve looked over -- nobody can predict everything, but we looked up for multiple periods to ensure that we\u2019d be able to feel comfortable about that.","","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Balyasny. Please go ahead.","Mike Zaremski - Balyasny","Hi, thanks. It's Mike Zaremski from Balyasny. Two quick questions. In auto and home, you mentioned catastrophe levels were similar to last year's levels. On an absolute basis, are those levels above or below plan for Q3? And also just curious, the equity volatility that we've seen in October, does that have any kind of meaningful impact on activity levels or anything in AWM or Asset Management outside of obvious equity markets sensitivity to earnings?","James Cracchiolo","Yeah. On the Auto & Home, it was within ranges, a couple of main dials, but it was pretty close with what it would be.","Walter Berman","Just on the impact from the equity markets, we have not seen any material change in regard to the retail business at AWM or in regard to asset management in general. What we did see and did talk about was a little more of the European slowdown from the volatility or the concerns that were in Europe and so that we have seen as a little bit of an effect, particularly on the retail flows in Europe."," ","Suneet Kamath - UBS ","Thank you.","","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from a follow up from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the follow-up, guys. Just a quick one for you. When you look at short-term funds or the balances you disclosed on the AWM slide, $23 billion of which the $19 billion is in the brokerage sweep. I guess my question is where's the remaining $4 billion? And as we think about the sensitivity to higher interest rates for this business, do we -- do you guys usually talk about the $19 billion or the whole $23 billion? Maybe help square that away. I don't know if it's in money market funds where you get the few dollars back or something of that nature.","Walter Berman","It\u2019s Walter, Alex. It\u2019s in certificates. Short term certificates and it so it will have an impact as the markets go up and in given us better spreads. But again, it\u2019s in the calculation. It will not be as rapid as certainly a big sweep accounts, but certainly we'll get benefit from it.","Alex Blostein - Goldman Sachs ","How does the sensitivity work in that $4 billion?","Walter Berman","You mean sensitivity, obviously they\u2019re in three months, six months, nine months maturity depending on where they in the cycle and depending on where the rates go, that's where we will pick it up. It's less reactive than sweep.","Alexander Blostein","Got it, but the magnitude overall, you would say is somewhat similar?","Walter Berman","Most of it's in the sweep, really.","Alexander Blostein","No? Okay. All right.","Walter Berman","It's more [indiscernible].","Alexander Blostein","All right. Thank you.","Walter Berman","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Thank you.

My name is John, and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.","And I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. Alicia Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, operator, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s first quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","Turning to our earnings presentation materials that are available on our website, on slide 2, you will see a discussion of forward-looking statements. Specifically, during the call, you will hear reference to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP numbers to their respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials. Some statements that we make on this call may be forward-looking, reflecting management\u2019s expectations about future events and overall operating plans and performance. These forward-looking statements speak only as of today\u2019s date and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. A sample list of factors and risks that could cause actual results to be materially different from forward-looking statements can be found in our fourth quarter 2018 earnings release, our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders and our 2018 10-K report. We make no obligation to update publicly or revise these forward-looking statements.","On Slide 3, you\u2019ll see our GAAP financial results at the top of the page for the first quarter. As you are aware we changed our definition of adjusted operating results beginning in the first quarter, which now excludes meaner version related impact. Management believes this enhances the understanding of our business by reflecting the underlying performance of our core operations and facilitates a more meaningful trend analysis. Many of the comments that management makes on the call today will focus on operating financial results.","Additionally, we announced in April that we have signed a definitive agreement with American Family Insurance to sell our Auto and Home operations. This transaction is expected to occur later this year, however, effective immediately we have moved our Auto and Home business out of the retention segment into our corporate and other segment. All prior periods have been restated for both of these changes.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","Jim Cracchiolo","Thank you, Alicia, and good morning, everyone. As I believe many of you are aware, we had an active and successful quarter. We took some critical steps to focus on our core business strategies further optimize our capital reduce, our risk profile and increase capital flexibility. And I will come back to this in more detail.","But first, I'll take you through our quarterly results. In terms of the operating environment clearly the impact of the market dislocation from the fourth quarter carried over to beginning of 2019. The decline in consumer sentiment combined with lower markets affected client activity in the U.S. and Europe. And this impacted our average assets and associated fees in the first quarter.","So how did this translate to our financial performance, but it was quite solid. In terms of our adjusted operating results, revenues were flat normalizing for taxes and a one-time payment a year ago, EPS was up 8%. And return on equity excluding AOCI, was up 790 basis points from a year ago to more than 36%. Assets under management and administration was steady compared to the year ago, even though our average weighted equity index was down 3%.","Let's talk about wealth management, which is the growth driver of Ameriprise and continues to be a great story for us. We did well in the quarter and delivered 11% growth in earnings in AWM with margin increasing to 22.5% and even though the quarter got off to a tougher start, client flows were strong. Total client assets increased another 6% year-over-year with more than $4 billion of net inflows moving into wrap. This is an important growth platform for us in one of the largest in the industry.","Client acquisition, overall fees and client activity were muted to start the year. But gradually improve during the quarter and are coming back to more normalized run rates. And even with the lag, advisor productivity remains strong up 6%.","Regarding recruiting, we had a terrific recruiting quarter both in quantity and quality with the average productivity of recruits reaching a new high. And our pipeline for the second quarter also looks good, experienced advisors are attracted to our client advice value proposition and appreciate the investments we're making and what this means for this future growth potential at Ameriprise.","Our AWM segment now generates half of the earnings of the company and contributes even more to the total firm. The investments we're making in the way we work with clients also results in excellent client satisfaction. We earned 4.9 out of five stars consistently since we rolled out our online survey. And that's translating into top industry recognition for us.","Last week, complementing our other recognition, we learned that Ameriprise earned Hudson Wallace top performer recognition in three important categories; unbiased and puts my interest first; explains things in understandable terms; and understands me and shares my values. These are very important attributes to be known for and they help set us apart as a leader in advice.","However, we're not resting on our laurels. We are investing in our end-to-end client experienced to take it to the last level of engagement and to help advisors grow productivity. Let me touch on a few of the key areas.","First, we continue to invest in our digital capabilities with digitally enabling our gold-based advised capabilities to make it even easier for advisors to fully engage clients and deliver the value and service they are seeking. We've just begun to roll out this training in the field and are pleased with the initial results.","Already we are receiving advisor updates and client stories and they're very positive. Many clients feel more engaged and confident, and have shared that these are some of the best conversations they've had with their advisors and beginning to move more money and assets to Ameriprise.","Second, we are implementing a new customer relationship management platform and we are on track to deliver it this year. Third, we are further developing our investment advisory platform to provide a streamlined and customized experience for clients and advisors to help in the management of their investments. And fourth, we're investing to expand our banking solutions, and I will share an update on our bank investment in the moment.","Given these growth investments, you saw we had higher expenses in the quarter, while we're making these investments we will continue to reengineer and reduces expenses so that the incremental expenses are very manageable. We're dedicated to delivering a comprehensive best-in-class Ameriprise client experience more fully and more consumers will seek it. As a leading wealth manager, we're building an even stronger position. And we feel very good about the significant opportunity before us.","Now I'll move to our insurance, annuities and Asset Management businesses. In INA, we are providing good value and generating free cash flow with strong books supported by accident risk management. These solutions complement our third-party offerings and help address clients retirement income protection needs. And they are part of a high-quality experience were known for.","With regards to the quarter, sales were slower in January, but they started to come back nicely and we're getting back to a more normal run rate. And Asset Management commits are clearly a tough environment, and there are real industry pressures for all active managers which we are also feeling.","However, our Asset Management business is part of our larger enterprise and supported by the strength of the Ameriprise, rather than a standalone active manager. We're investing in the business we're making trade-offs to manage expense levels.","Our margin and Asset Management is competitive what was clearly pressured in the quarter and you are seeing this with others. In terms of assets under management, we ended the quarter with $459 billion which was down from a year ago but up 7% sequentially.","After a tougher fourth quarter last year, short-term equity investment performance improved in the United States in many of our strategies. And longer-term performance also remains quite good. In addition, short and long-term taxable and fixed income performance continues to be strong.","In EMEA, our short-term performance in U.K. equities weakened, however, European equities bounced back lastly. And long-term equity and fixed income track records continue to be good. Moving to our flow picture, there remained a net outflow and the team is very focused on gaining traction and we have some improvement when compared to fourth quarter last year.","Here are the key themes of the first quarter when compared to a year ago. Home apparent outflows were better year-over-year. Global institutional outflows were higher due to clients' asset allocation calls and some performance challenges and a slowdown in mandate fundings.","However, recently in the areas where we had some strategies underperforming, we saw improvement. In U.S. retail we remain in net outflows, but are beginning to benefit from investments in data analytics and our segmentation strategy. We did improve in the broker deal in independent channel. We were positive in five of our top seven fronts. Equity fund flows improved somewhat from the fourth quarter, that we still experience outflows.","And fixed income flows were essentially flat as we didn't get as much of a boost as the industry and ultra-short and short duration products where we are not a big player in this tight margin asset class. In the U.K. and European retail, the ongoing uncertainty about Brexit and slower economic backdrop in Europe created flow challenges. With regard to Brexit in particular the team has been supporting clients and taking actions to prepare the business.","During the quarter, we completed a transfer of EU client assets from our OEIC funds into Lux-domiciled CCAP products. While this pressure sales and increased expenses it will be beneficial to getting close on the continent going forward. Quarter-after-quarter, we've been very proactive in expense management, while we invest for the long-term including in our data capabilities, operating platform solutions and expanding in Europe.","As I said at the beginning of the year, we recognize the ongoing challenges we and the industry face. And we'll continue to make the changes necessary to compete. Now, when I opened, I indicated some additional strategic actions we're taking to drive future growth and value creation.","First, as many of you have acknowledged Ameriprise has a strong record of returning capital at a differentiated level and we are adding it to it again. In the quarter, Ameriprise returned $482 million through share repurchases and dividends, which is consistent what we've been returning. We also announced a new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization and yesterday we declared another increase to our quarterly dividend another 8% which will bring our capital return even higher. In fact this is our 12th increase over the past 10 years something we are very proud of.","Second, as many of you know we've always focused on enhancing our capital flexibility and risk profile and that was punctuated at quarter-end with the culmination of our strategic review of Ameriprise Auto and Home and decision to sell the business. We have four priorities as we executed the deal; continue to deliver outstanding service to policyholders; find the right firm to help Auto and Home grow; provide the potential for a great future for our team there; and earn an appropriate return.","I am very confident that we found the right partner in American Family Insurance. They plan to grow and expand on what we have built. We are pleased with this outcome and as we do in all transactions, we will work to ensure a seamless transition over the next few quarters. The sale of Auto and Home will generate $950 million of net proceeds when we close the deal later this year. Third, in addition to the Auto and Home sale, we announced our first fixed annuity reinsurance transaction. We have reinsured our 20% of our block, which freed up about $200 million in capital for us.","Importantly, it positions us to explore additional transactions for the approximately $1 billion of capital that backs our remaining block. Fourth, last week we gained final approval from the Fed to convert our national trust bank into a federal savings bank allowing us to further expand our product suite. We plan to launch the bank in the latter part of the quarter. This is a long-term growth opportunity for Ameriprise. And I feel good about the future contributions it will bring.","As you can tell, we made significant progress in the quarter executing some important strategic actions. We are freeing up capital further enhancing our risk profile and capital flexibility. I know you may have questions about our plans to deploy the additional capital that we are freeing that will grow to about $2 billion when Auto and Home sale closes later this year. On that front, you can expect us to continue to build on our long-standing record of managing our capital just as well as we have for many years.","We'll evaluate a number of alternatives such as invest in our bank, looking at other opportunities to add to our wealth management business we'll continue to look at adding capabilities for Asset Management and further de-risking our longtail businesses. Finally, we will look to further increase our return of capital to shareholders. In that regard, we plan to increase our share repurchase rate in 2019. As you can see, we're in a very strong position. We are serving client needs, building on our advice value proposition while generating strong returns.","Now I'll turn things over to Walter.","Walter Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise achieved another solid quarter of financial results, while proactively executing several strategies that will optimize our capital and risk profile, positioning the company to drive continue shareholder value creation.","On a normalized basis, EPS grew 8%, and I will go into the details on the next page. Financial results were led by Advice Wealth Management, which delivered 11% earnings growth and continued strong metric trends in the face of market headwinds and volatility as we entered the year. Our other businesses are generating good, stable financial results that were in line with our expectations.","Let me take you through the details beginning on slide 6. In total, adjusted operating EPS was $3.75, up 2%, which understates the underlying financial performance in the quarter. To understand the underlying results, you must consider both our previously disclosed one-time vendor settlement last year as well as the tax rate.","The tax rate in the quarter was 17.3%, higher than last year, and above our expectations of 16% for the full year, primarily due to share-based accounting changes and timing. Normalizing for these items, EPS was up 8% and better reflects growth in the quarter. Revenue growth reflected continued strong net inflows offset by lower average markets, Asset Management outflows and slower transactional activity early in the quarter.","Expenses continued to be well managed across the firm with G&A up only 2%. We are continuing to make important growth investments in Advice & Wealth Management while executing on our expense reengineering objectives across the business. And we returned over 90% of earnings to shareholders through buyback and dividends, a continuation of our track record of differentiated return.","Lastly, we have increased excess capital to $1.8 billion while achieving a 36% return on equity, up 790 basis points. We have seen strong growth trends in Advice & Wealth Management, which you can see on Slide 7. Total client assets were up 6% year-over-year, demonstrating a nice recovery after the pullback in the fourth quarter, and continued strong $4.3 billion of inflows into rep accounts.","Brokerage cash balances up $25.3 billion are consistent with last year. On a sequential basis, we saw balances come down in line with historic patterns. We are benefiting from short rates getting back to more normal historic levels, and we are on 212 basis points, up from 132 basis points a year ago. Based on recent Fed announcements, we do not anticipate additional rate increases this year, and remain committed to being competitive in our client rates.","Finally, advisor productivity also continues to improve, reaching $628,000 on a trailing 12-months basis in the face of market and activity headwinds. We continue to see strong productivity gains and are seeing good payback from our investments as well as from the strength of the experienced advisor recruits that we've been bringing in. The 90 experienced advisors we brought in the first quarter, has record productivity which will support continued productivity growth over time.","Let's turn to financials on slide 8. Advice & Wealth Management is continuing to deliver consistent strong financial performance over time. I thought it would be helpful to provide a detailed description of revenue this quarter because there are a number of dynamics at play.","First, management and financial advice fees grew 4%. Unlike previous quarters with good ramp inflows have been supplemented by market depreciation. This quarter, the benefit from good inflows was partially offset by the impact of lower average markets. So the growth rate lagged a bit. However, as we exited the quarter, markets have recovered up 13% point-to-point and ramp flows improved in February and March after a slower January. And as a result, we expect improved growth in management fees as we move through 2019.","Next, distribution fees were up only marginally. We had meaningful benefits from the spread earned on broker suite balances. However, market sentiment following the fourth quarter disruption, resulted in lower client activity levels early in the quarter. This improved throughout the quarter and April activity levels have returned to good historic levels. So again, we would expect improved growth in distribution fees in 2019.","Lastly, net investment income is up 43% from both the higher certificate asset earning rate and higher balances. Overall, both markets and activity levels have recovered well and that this should lead to more robust revenue growth going forward. General and administrative expenses were up 6% for the quarter. But we believe they continue to be well managed.","As Jim discussed, we are making substantial investments for future growth in this business and the level and timing of those expenses was more heavily weighted in the beginning of the year. We remain committed to effectively expense discipline and we will continue to execute on our reengineering initiatives that will benefit the remainder of the year. Finally, pretax operating earnings were up 11% and margins were strong at 22.5%.","Let's turn to Asset Management on page nine, where financial performance was clearly impacted by substantial headwinds, including average equity markets down 3% and unfavorable foreign exchange translation. Additionally, the cumulative impact of net flows hurt results as did a previously disclosed prior year one-time item. This resulted in a decline in revenues of 11% and a decline of PTI of 25%.","G&A expenses were down 4%, demonstrating our continued commitment to expense discipline. However, a significant portion of our expense base is fixed. So it will be difficult to adjust quickly to this challenging revenue environment. Margins in the quarter decreased to 34% and given the challenging revenue environment, we do expect margins to remain pressured.","Let's turn to annuities and protection on slide 10. In the quarter, variable annuities earnings were $150 million, up 5% from last year. Variable annuities continue to be in outflows though at a slower pace than last year. Variable annuities sales slowed similar to the overall slowdown we saw in client activity. It should be noted that our net amount at risk declined to 0.8% of our account value with living benefits and 0.2% of account value with debt benefits from improvement in markets.","Fixed annuity pretax adjusted operating earnings declined $3 million, reflecting the continued impact of lapses in interest rates. The previously announced reinsurance transaction had a small impact on fixed annuity results, but it is earnings neutral across the firm for the year.","Importantly, the transactions generate $200 million of excess capital and established the platform for future reinsurance transactions. The remaining block of fixed annuities is backed by about $1 billion of capital. In Life and Health, earnings were within expectations of $74 million, up 14% from last year. Claims remain within expected ranges, though favorable relative to the prior year period.","Let's move to the balance sheet on slide 11. Our balance sheet fundamental remain strong. Our access capital increased to $1.8 billion which benefited from the fixed annuity reinsurance transaction and incremental debt from our recent issuance. Our hedge program has been quite effective, with weighted manage hedged effectiveness at 97% in the quarter. The investment portfolio has high credit quality and is well diversified, and free cash flow generation remains excellent.","We returned nearly $500 million of capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase in the quarter. And we recently announced a new share repurchase authorization and an 8% dividend increase. Continued capital return, will be supported by both our free cash flow as well as the execution of capital optimization strategies.","Let's turn to slide 12. As Jim discussed, we have announced the variety of proactive actions this year to optimize our capital structure and risk profile. Over the past several years, we have spoken with you about the initiatives underway to improve the underlying performance of our Auto and Home business and we saw the intended results.","We completed a strategic review which resulted in our decision to sell the business. When this transaction closes later this year, cash proceeds will be $950 million, a majority of which will be added to our access capital position. As I mentioned, the reinsurance of a portion of our fixed annuity block, freed up a substantial capital without an earnings impact to the firm. And the framework is now in place to execute additional reinsurance transactions as appropriate.","And we issued $500 million of senior notes, part of which is being used to pre-fund an upcoming maturity and reposition our debt ladder. In aggregate, these actions will enable us to increase the level of capital that we will return to shareholders this year by accelerating our share repurchase.","We plan to return approximately 110% of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders through buyback and dividends. And we will fund the anticipated bank capital requirement.","We're completing our review of our capital structure and evaluating potential uses of access capital. In summary, Ameriprise is well situated to drive continued growth in advice and wealth management command continues to generate substantial shareholder value.","With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ryan Krueger. Please go ahead.","Ryan Krueger","Hi, thanks, good morning. My First question was on capital management. I appreciate the guidance for 2019. It looks like after that you still have a fairly substantial amount of access capital. So I guess as we move past 2019 into 2020, would you anticipate a still being in position to continue returning similar levels of capital in 2020 as well? Or are you contemplating I guess other potential uses for the access capital outside of share repurchases? ","Jim Cracchiolo","Well as I just said, we will be looking at another level of opportunities. So number one is yes, we still think, we can strongly return capital and will to shareholders. We will also look at opportunities to further grow and invest in our wealth management business.","Maybe there are some add-on capabilities that might be nice to continue to growth there that we'll be looking at it as well as we've said, looking at continuing to improve our overall capital structure. And therefore that in itself we think will create some additional shareholder value that will either return or from a perspective invest for growth.","Ryan Krueger","Thanks. And then just a quick one on the tax rate of 16% for this year is there anything unusual about that? Or is that a decent level to assume over the intermediate term as well? ","Walter Berman","No it's actually -- it's totally in line with really the earnings that we will have and with the tax rate and the items that we normally have as basically adjustments through it. It's totally in line with last year and this year.","Ryan Krueger","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Blostein. Please go ahead.","Alex Blostein","Great. Good morning everybody. Hey guys, I was wondering if you could comment on the pace and the process of the build down of the bank from here? So clearly you got the approval assuming you can move some deposits fairly quickly. So maybe walk us through what that will require in terms of both expenses and initial capital utilization and kind of how you expect the bank growth to start kind of ramp up from here?","Walter Berman","Okay, so this is Walter, let me start with that Alex. Once we have approval and then we will target our operationalizing the bank before the end of the quarter. We will be transferring about $2 billion, $2.5 billion worth of sweep accounts that we will go into. And those will be invested. And that would be the primary focus.","And then next activity would be our credit card transfer over. And then will be a series of other products that we will be working on. But that's where the focus is going to be. As we anticipate for the year, the bank will be accretive from an earnings standpoint. And we will start incurring expenses obviously from an operating standpoint starting -- we started now and obviously ramped up during the year. But we will be a positive accretion from an earnings point standpoint.","Alex Blostein","Got it. I guess on that point, so I guess when we look at the G&A growth and expenses for AWM, it sounded like it's a little bit heavier on the investment side at the beginning of the year, so maybe just give us an update what you guys expect G&A costs to be and advice and wealth for the year kind of on a year-over-year growth perspective as again contemplating the bank and what that will take?","Jim Cracchiolo","As we indicated, there are a substantial level and timing of investments in the first quarter as we look towards the year. we're in a range probably in the 4% range on excluding the bank as I meant, but the bank will be accretive and also let me just say if I got to answer the one part of your question we're putting initially $200 million into the bank as capitalization.","Alex Blostein","Got it great color.","Jim Cracchiolo","Regarding the expenses but the investments per se in Advice and Wealth, we're actually managing expenses really well and we'll continue actually we probably reduce some expenses and so as regards we move through the next few quarters. But we are investing heavily ramping up and bringing over good recruits that as you know there is always the first year expenses from that and we have very good pipeline et cetera.","And for the things I mentioned previously, we are making some really good investments investing in our advisors, investing in the ability for them to actually grow even more their productivity. So that expense incremental we think will give us a very good paybacks in that regard client assets, client productivity and results in the fee revenue. So that's the way I would look at it I wouldn't look at it as an increase in G&A in a sense of overhead expense. I look at it as investments for growth.","And on a relative basis where we are reducing expenses as an offset that incremental that Walter mentioned around -- roughly around 4% or so excluding the bank I think is it should be thought about that way. Otherwise, I think it would be relatively flat. And the bank the expense incremental will be offset by the revenue as we ramp up the bank, but again with -- starting this midyear and then that will get into a much better run rate next year.","Alex Blostein","Great and also if I could just sneak in one more. When you guys talk about the opportunities to deploy the access capital which obviously is going to go by the end of the year and it sounds like there's going to be opportunities to further rationalize the 680 portfolio, which again will probably drive some incremental product relief. Where does the rationalization long dated risk, whether it's long term care or may be even some of the ABA businesses on your priority list. Is that sort of part of the framework for the near term? Or is that something that will likely to happen kind of overtime?","Walter Berman","Okay, it's Walter. Let me take a shot at that. Obviously, we feel very comfortable with the exposure profile that you mentioned in those areas, but we are continuing to evaluating options as they come up. And if they do we will then certainly assess and is that in the best interest to shareholders deploy it that way.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Suneet Kamath. Please go ahead.","Suneet Kamath","Thanks. First a comment just on the optimization that's clearly good to see. You guys posted the leverage that have. But on that point, are there things that you're looking at in terms of further optimization beyond the fixed annuity business?","Jim Cracchiolo","The answer is yes. You know thanks Suneet, you know we are very thoughtful, but we are always looking out in planning. And we evaluate the business in a way that says what will be good for us to continue to grow in the areas of opportunity.","What can we leverage appropriately, but also what will generate a good return in cash flow and manage a really good business on behalf of our clients. So yes, we have and I mentioned a range of them just before, but that's clearly some of the things that will be talking about with my board as we go through our planning process, but more importantly, that we are focused on even here in the near term. ","Walter Berman","Okay. And then just shifting gears to Asset Management. I mean, you talked about industry pressures dropping the margin there and some of the challenges that you face, but given our the view -- if we take the view that those pressures are not going to subside any time soon. Is it time to start thinking about something more strategic in terms of that business either building scale or pursuing another strategy to rationalize costs or something along those lines just given these pressures seems to be in front of us for some time?","Jim Cracchiolo","Right. So we approached this twofold very clearly as you know. We look to continue to make changes in the business of areas that we can really garner some good activity inflows and fees. That does mean that we adjust and have to prone certain areas, which we've been doing. But very clearly, we're making some of the core changes in core focus on areas of opportunity. I think this market has been a bit more pressured, the volatility has been high, Brexit and other things have been unfortunate impacting many companies doing business there.","But that's the first and very clear focus we have right now, but at the same time, we are thinking out and looking out strategically. The industry is changing. There continues to be a combination or level of consolidation out there. And there may be some good opportunities with some of the assets, some of the knowledge we have of what we've been able to do in the past to meet up and look at other capabilities with other firms that are having the same challenges.","So it's one of the things. I think, we're very open to any but we very clearly focus on what the client needs. What's good for overall for our people, the culture we have as well as the shareholders, but as you know Suneet just like we\u2019re very thoughtful and have been we'll continue to look and explore opportunities.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. And then just lastly on the recruiting in AWM. I think both Jim and Walter referenced the productivity being higher for the new recruits, so if we think about the base at that $628,000 revenue per advisor. Can you give us a sense of where the new recruits are coming in? I know it's higher, but just any quantification of that?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yeah. So I would say the average recruits we're bringing in now probably come out on average to roughly where we are in the numbers that were mentioning, but what we're finding is we're starting to really get now more and more larger teams. And so it's been gradually continuing to move up.","Of course, there's always a transfer in the periods of them bringing over their book, etcetera. But how I would say is we have a very good class of people coming in. And we feel like we're actually hitting stride right now in really how Ameriprise can really appeal to people in the industry. And people who really can continue to grow their productivity. So we feel very good about it.","Suneet Kamath","Okay. Thanks Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Nigel Dally. Please go ahead.","Nigel Dally","Great. Thanks. First question is just an Asset Management margins. You had been targeting in the mid to high 30s this quarter gets below that range. Given your comments that you expect the environment to remain challenging, what should we expect for the margins going forward any guidance there would be helpful.","Walter Berman","Yes, as you look at -- going forward certainly with the market improving where it ended the quarter and with as I mentioned our reengineering initiatives, I do see over the balance of the year that certainly we could get back into the range we talked about previously. But it's not without its challenges, but we have certainly the place the reengineering aspects of it and certainly with the market where it doesn\u2019t stays that way, we -- it should improve when we exited a quarter at 33.","Nigel Dally","Okay. And then second on the Annuities, good to see the Global Atlantic transaction, any reason you couldn't free up the remaining capitals supporting the remainder with the blocks this year? Or is it something different with respect to the nature of what's remaining relative to what you reinsured last quarter?","Walter Berman","No, it's actually -- we chose -- we basically reinsured the third-party channel account value. We looked at and we have the capability from an operational standpoint, we're just looking at it the environment and all the things as we said this will be -- we will continue on that path.","Nigel Dally","Okay, very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from John Barnidge, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead.","John Barnidge","Thanks. I know you mentioned the framework is in place for future insurance transactions for fixed annuities, but would you consider risk transfer for the variable annuity block at all?","Walter Berman","As Jim said we will evaluate and certainly look at what is in the best interest of the shareholders. Again, those have different nuances attached to it, but the answer is we will evaluate for sure.","John Barnidge","Okay and then my follow-up now that we have the first year of tax returns post-reform in the books, can you talk about how you saw activity change from 1Q to 2018 to 1Q 2019 and maybe what you're seeing so far this quarter? From products that demand generally sees a boost from refunds?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, I mean I think when you look at client activity, we haven't seen a material -- I mean I think there has been a bit more -- some investments in tax exempts et cetera has gone through if you're looking at the retail client, are looking at the corporate?","Walter Berman","No, I think -- it's Walter. As we -- I think [Indiscernible] you have to look at -- we saw our activity level. Our activity -- because I think you are driving at the activity level, we've seen because people are not getting the refunds is that where you are going?","John Barnidge","Yes.","Walter Berman","Yes. So, what we started seeing in January as we said, the activity levels are were lower and then in February and March, they really came back up. As we are not seeing that impact at all from people getting lower tax refunds or anticipation of lower tax refunds. That does not manifest itself yet if at all.","John Barnidge","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from John Nadel, UBS. Please go ahead.","John Nadel","Good morning. A couple of real quick ones. Just a clarification on slide 12. When you say return capital at 110% of earnings and to fund the bank in 2019. I guess I just wanted to clarify is the bank part of that 110% or is the 110% isolated to just buy backs and common dividends?","Walter Berman","Just buybacks and common dividends.","John Nadel","All right, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the tax rate I guess your original outlook for 2019; Walter was 17% to 19% and now we're looking at 16%. So, my question is how should we be thinking about that tax rate beyond 2019? I understand your earnings mix will continue to shift. I'm just wondering if we should be thinking about more about that 17% to 19% range beyond 2019? Or is there a reason why we stay below that range on a go-forward basis? ","Walter Berman","John, it is incorrect I think we actually didn't give guidance for 2019. This the first time we actually mentioning it. I'll go back and check. But the 16% is totally consistent with what we told it would be. And that is like I said it's a line with what 2018 was. I can't really -- you're right it's going to change based on mixed earnings and things like that as you go because you had more to the margin of 21%. But the answer is I think this is a pretty comfortable range. ","John Nadel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then if I could -- just on long-term care, I guess, can you tell us -- are you willing to tell us whether you've actually had any formal discussions or due diligence with any counterparties at this point on a the possible risk transfer? Is that something that just hasn't really taken place in any formal way?","And then if I could also add to that as the Genworth nationwide deal has now been extended. I think it's actually the ninth time they've extended. And it appears no closer to gaining the remaining regulatory approvals. I'm just wondering have you had any discussions with the Genworth around providing more details as to the protections you have in place around your reinsurance agreement with them? ","Walter Berman","Okay so -- let me answer the question this way is. We are approachable all the time for people to explore the opportunity to certainly enter a reinsurance arrangement with us. There's nothing we have seen but we keep an open mind about it based on the way that we feel our exposure is as it relates to our book of business, it's nothing has really risen to the top of the stage to really get us into really considering, but as Jim said we will always look for options and that's what we do.","As it relates to the ninth time, the tenth time -- as it relates to Genworth we are not -- I'll say my way we're indifferent. I'll be candid from that standpoint. We repeatedly keep on referring to the fact that we have arrangement with them that it really does protect us and we feel extremely comfortable whether the sales is there or the sales not there. And that is something that we feel is something that is really without any doubt in our minds we feel we have the protection. ","John Nadel","And I appreciate that Walter, I -- you guys have the detail, right? I think investors particularly in the event that this deal -- the Genworth Ocean wide deal actually does not gain approvals or is disapproved. I guess, I'm just wondering whether those details will be something that you can provide externally to your investor base to give them the same level of confidence that you guys have internally? ","Jim Cracchiolo","Right, so this is Jim. Let me just take a minute to tell you why we don't think so and importantly why the point of view that has been expressed that -- in solvency if it ever occurred would look could mean billions of exposure to us is not only highly theoretical it's wrong.","As previously disclosed in 2016 RiverSource negotiated substantial enhancements to its reinsurance credit protections under its reinsurance arrangement with Gleck. These were intended among other things to protect RiverSource against erosion and Gleck's financial position.","Due to confidentiality obligations, we are not at liberty to disclose the extent or nature of such credit protections, but we hope to provide some additional color that's helpful as to why we continue to believe that our net counterparty credit exposure to Glick is very different from the gross exposure and is well within our overall risk tolerance. A few points to consider, Glick is domiciled in Delaware.","So any insolvency proceedings will be located there, and governed by Delaware laws. Delaware laws and courts have a long tradition of respecting commercial and financial affairs and the contract sophisticated people enter into corporate law trust in insurance. Similar credit protections to these types we have with Glick have been tested and ensured insolvency's proceedings in Delaware, and they have been respected by the authorities.","The same holds true elsewhere in the United States. We believe that these protections will be respected even in the unlikely event that Glick what to eventually become subject to insolvency proceedings in Delaware. While we know no credit productions are perfect. we believe the correct way to think about our counterparty credit exposure to Glick is not the full amount of grainy gross liability that Glick reinsurers, but rather than net exposure to Glick after taking into account our credit protections, which would be significantly smaller exposure, if it were to exist.","John Nadel","I appreciate that response. Thanks Jim.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Kligerman. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered so just maybe some follow-ups on previous. The de-risking of long tail business is clearly, Jim when you mentioned that was the LTC. It sounds to me that there is no sense of urgency to enter into any arrangement. Is that the right read?","Jim Cracchiolo","No, what I would say and my read just based on what I've \u2013 and Walter said is this. We feel good about what we have for our own business and what we manage just like we have in place for our reinsurance. We feel that we take appropriate reserves. We look at the experience. We constantly evaluate. We have again taking rate we have got approval for rates that are going into effect.","We are adjusting even some of the alternatives that clients have as they move forward. So with that, don't get me wrong, there can always be some exposure in the future, right, we know things will change, the world evolves. There could be change in some clients, but our book is very aged. Our people have been there for long time. We have very strong claim experience.","And so as we continue to make these things, remember this is a book that we closed in 2002. The age is much higher than average. And our experience levels are very strong. And knowledge of what we have. So we're not saying that couldn't be some exposures going forward, but on a relative basis based on the strength of our position our cash flows our capital and what necessarily even could change in the near future, next few years that's five years, 10 years this is immaterial to our ability to handle it. But I know, people are putting this undo sort of risk out there as an umbrella on us, but it's not going to have an effect that people think in any stretch in imagination.","Even, if you said, it was hypothetically a few hundred million dollars, we can easily take that against our access capital position would not even a beat at this point. So the point of reference is, if there is a reasonable transaction even if it's at a discount with a good party and I think people are getting more sophisticated in understanding the differences, I think the transaction could occur. Okay? One of the big variables is interest rates. The long-term rates have come down a little more. If they went back to where they were, it'll be more appetizing.","So let me be very clear. We're not opposed to anything like that. We're evaluating. You saw we just started the reinsurance. We told you, it would take a little time for us to get where we wanted in the Auto and Home. Listen, I think we\u2019re credible what we say and what we\u2019ll do. We'll make very formed decisions, and we\u2019ll evaluate to continue to invest and grow the business.","What I would take away from this today is that we\u2019re really excited about the opportunities we have in Ameriprise and Wealth Management business and a generation of cash across the company. Even with our Asset Management and INA business, INA is really good solid books. And if there are opportunities for someone to get certain based on the structures they have, but keep the real good benefits and the growth and us really growing the opportunity with our clients and working on a good products, we are open to it.","And the same thing with long-term care. But we're going to manage it really well. We're going to make sure that we get appropriate return and cover our risks. And to the extent that there are those little blips that pop up, we're well easily able to cover them. So that's the way I would think about it, but no, we're not opposed to any transaction on LTC, and we think that people are getting more sophisticated in understanding the differences, and maybe there'll be a potential for us in the near future. And we're looking at it. So people are starting to call and we are starting to talk.","Andrew Kligerman","Great. Yeah. And it is kind of a shame because you\u2019ve got so many great businesses and trends going on that talking so much time about this is, just it doesn't make a lot of sense. But with that said, it sounds like you're not going to do anything that would harm your balance sheet given your feeling about the LTC block and the stability of it.","Shifting over to two items, one the crediting rate on your sweep fees and Advice & Wealth Management, I think I saw that it came up by 7 basis points in March. Looking out into the second quarter, are the yields pretty stable right now? And do you think -- Walter you mentioned you might need to stay competitive. Is there any impetus to raise crediting rates any further?","Walter Berman","No, what you saw is -- we're constantly evaluating our competitive positioning and we believe we are competitive now. And we will constantly review, but I don\u2019t see anything that would be changing going forward. But if it does, we will adjust it.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. And then just lastly on the tax rate, it says in the press release the 16% range. I think that means for the year. So can we assume that given that you had 17.3% in the first quarter that it might trend a little bit under 16% for the balance of the three quarters?","Walter Berman","Yes.","Andrew Kligerman","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Erik Bass. Please go ahead.","Erik Bass","Hi. Thank you. How are you thinking about the best options for growing the Advice & Wealth business going forward? Are there meaningful organic investments of capital that could accelerate growth? Or to pursue M&A, what type of transactions would be of interest?","Jim Cracchiolo","So what I mentioned before that we are taking the opportunity to make really good investments and enhancing all of our digital capabilities, our advice capabilities, our client engagement systems. We feel good about that. We are actually picking up our pace in recruitment out in the industry as well. I feel good about that.","And it gives us opportunities. And I do believe there may be some opportunities for us as I mentioned and in the use of capital to look at some good potential additional add-ons to our wealth management business from an M&A perspective.","It's a bit early for me to get into that right now, but at some things that we're going to spend a bit more time exploring. And we think that may be a good use of our capital moving forward.","Erik Bass","Got it. On that note, it will be similar to some of transactions you have done recently were sort of keen lift outs or acquisitions were small, independent firms or could it be something bigger than that as well?","Jim Cracchiolo","I would say it could be both. I -- listen there are different opportunities in the wealth management space right now that we're thinking about or looking at. So, I don't want to go further than that, but just say listen.","This is an area that is our core. We know it well. We understand it we do believe we can bring a lot to it. So, it's one of the things that we want to spend a little bit more energy on.","Erik Bass","Got it. And lastly big picture, it sounds like your focus is really to continue to shift enterprise more towards a distribution company and away from product manufacturing? Would this just be organically growing AWM at a faster rate? Or could you also see exiting more of your manufacturing businesses?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, what I would say is this, as you just saw based on our mix and growth, our distribution business the AWM is over 50% now of our earnings. We still have very good businesses. Our INA business, however, are solutions to the clients and they are very complementary.","So, the real good cash flow. We get the solid nature of the books is because the part of where my client assets go for products that we manufacture in addition to what we distribute externally. So, I think that's how I think of it.","Same thing with the Asset Management business, Columbia manages a good reasonable amount of assets both for our retail clients, also as part of our books for our INA business and it's very complementary. And if you go back, many, many years we started as a manufacturer with distribution as a cost center.","When I came in, I converted the distribution to the profit center, and wanted to round out my solutions group. I exited third-party in the INA, because of what was happening in the industry. In the Asset Management, I figured I would complement that by buying some companies to give me more of that third-party distribution as a compliment. I think, we have accomplished that so, to a good regard. And having said that, I still value the solutions part and what we do here.","But as I would probably say the growth driver of the coming right now based on industry pressures et cetera, is in our distribution channel. But we will continue to be a quality provider in the other areas. And they will generate some good returns for us.","Erik Bass","Great. Thank you. I appreciate the comments.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeff Smith. Please go ahead.","Jeff Smith","Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Quick question on management fees in wealth management up 4% in the quarter but looking at that as a percentage of assets or of average rep assets. I mean it was down a fair amount to 1.32%. Can you maybe speak to that and give us a sense of where you see that going over the next year or two?","Jim Cracchiolo","Well, I think in the first quarter just as we saw in the fourth quarter, you had depreciated assets from the level of where you started in December. And so offloads have been consistently strong fourth quarter, first quarter and they are even getting back to even higher levels as we exited the first quarter.","But I think when you look at the fee level you had equity markets down significantly at the end of the year, just making its way back through the quarter. And so when you run a very large portfolio like that with a reasonable portion being in equity or a portion of that 50%, 60% that's where you're going to get that fee compression.","But to Walters point what he explained would be as we are exiting this quarter with the markets backup, you should probably see it come back to the full level of the type of fee that we had. But the good inflows over the course of the entire last year will complement that as we move forward.","Jeff Smith","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question will be from Humphrey Lee. Please go ahead.","Humphrey Lee","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just a question related to rep flows at AWM. So you've talked about, January was a little bit weaker, muted start and picked back up in February and March. I guess, how much was the impact was January was to the quarter? And do you feel if the kind of going forward to see a more normal activities, do you feel like you could go back to roughly $5 million range of quarter in terms of rep net flows?","Walter Berman","Yeah, so in January it was substantially down. And basically by March it was back at the levels -- at the historic levels. And we are again I can't give you an exact number, but certainly we are seeing a pattern that we feel comfortable with as we that -- as the client activities started to coming back. So we feel very good about that trend line and that's continuing in April to a degree.","Humphrey Lee","Okay. So basically fourth quarter and first quarter was an anomaly then we should kind of looking back to be at the rest of the quarters in recent history?","Walter Berman","Yeah, that's what certainly the pattern is saying. And especially as you start March you just watched January down and just progressed it's way right back up in March and it exited. And we're seeing that continuing.","Humphrey Lee","Got it. And then in Asset Management, you mentioned that the EMEA flows were weaker but then you have some of the distribution build out that should hopefully improve the flows activities a little bit better towards the balance of the year. Can you talk about the build-out of the distribution in Continental Europe, and then your expectation for how these channels would be the coming quarters?","Jim Cracchiolo","Yeah, so this is Jim. What I would say is first of all in the first quarter, we completed our transfer of our OIC assets into C caps sort out of Luxembourg range that we have established last year. So even part of the expense that we have, and the P&L was based on completing that shifting the assets, offsetting some of the expense for our clients et cetera.","Now when we've done that, we now have a range of the product, the good range of the product and we are adding resources in some of the markets like Italy and Spain and Germany, ramping up with some manpower distribution et cetera marketing to start to sell more formally in Europe. We also sold, but we almost sold out of sort of the idea that we are distributing oics and we don't have necessarily all the resources fully on the ground. So we are ramping that up.","Now I would just say activity in Europe and Brexit, if you look at the number of European firms out of the U.K. in Asset Management, you'll find that activity is pretty weak and redemptions were there. But if that starts to get back as people start to see clarity around Brexit or the idea that the European economy is not slowing, I think you'll see a rebound in that activity and then with what we're doing to expand in Europe hopefully that will even give us a greater level of upside down the road.","I don't think that's going to happen immediately because of the situation across Europe and the U.K. right now, but it\u2019s one of the areas where we have always gone in good flows, we have good product and one where we do believe that there is a benefit as that starts to settle down on the continent and in U.K.","Humphrey Lee","Appreciate the color.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode.  Later we will conduct a question and answer session.  Please note that this conference is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to Ms. Alicia Charity.  ","Alicia A. Charity ","Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s first quarter earnings call.  With me on the call today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer.  Following their remarks we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.

We undertake no obligation to update publically or to revise these forward-looking statements.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo ","Thank you for joining us for our first quarter earnings discussion.  Let\u2019s begin with my overview of the business performance in the quarter and then Walter will discuss our financial results in more detail.  Afterwards, we\u2019ll take your questions.  ","As we look at the quarter the business is performing well.  Fee based business growth is offsetting interest rate pressure and we continue to differentiate Ameriprise with our ability to return capital to shareholders.  The fundamentals of our business are good.  Client assets and retail flows are strong and we\u2019re helping our clients manage through an unsettled economic environment.  ","While our clients are reentering the market a bit more in recent months, they remain cautious and continue to prioritize capital preservation.  The markets while improved still present challenges.  US and European average equity markets were only up slightly compared to a year ago and the low interest rate effects on the industry were evident in our results as well.  On an operating basis for the quarter, net revenues were up 1% to $2.5 billion, EPS increased 9% to $1.45, and return on equity excluding AOCI rose to 16% from 14.9% a year ago.","Our balance sheet and capital remain among the strongest in the industry.  With our capital position we have the flexibility to both invest for business growth and return significant capital to shareholders.  During the quarter we returned 109% of our operating earnings to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividends.  We continue to buy back our shares at a healthy pace with 5.4 million shares purchased in the quarter for $300 million.  ","Meanwhile, we\u2019ve been increasingly focused on raising our dividend as a portion of capital returned.  As part of our plan, we declared another quarterly dividend increase yesterday boosting our quarterly dividend 25%.  Over the past 12 months, we have announced three quarterly dividend increases which in total nearly doubled our dividend in a short period of time.  Our dividend growth now brings our implied dividend yield to approximately 2.6% which puts us in very good company.  In fact, in terms of total capital returned to shareholders, we are a leader among the S&P 500 financials.","In 2011, we were in the top quintal of the S&P financial companies for return of capital.  We returned almost three times the capital of the average company.  I feel very good about our capital position and our strategy to increase total shareholder return.  We\u2019re generating strong free cash flow to reinvest in the business and return to shareholders.  We intend to return the majority of our earnings to shareholders annually and increase the mix between dividends and repurchases gradually as we maintain our capital strength and flexibility to navigate periods of economic and market stress.","Now, let\u2019s review our business segment performance.  First advice and wealth management; we\u2019ve consistently invested in our advisory business transforming it into a powerful growth platform.  We\u2019ve expanded both the earnings power and the profitability of the business by serving more mass affluent and affluent clients and growing advisor productivity.  Through our targeted growth investments, we\u2019ve set a nice springboard for our advisory business.  ","Our national television advertising presence continues and we were recently recognized with a David Ogilvy Award for excellence in advertising research.  This year, we\u2019ll complete our new brokerage platform implementation, a significant technology project that we began over a year ago.  As we proceed through the next two quarters, we expect to convert more than 6,000 advisors to the new platform with the related technology expenses wrapping up later this year.","We\u2019re also having very good success recruiting experienced advisors with attractive books of business.  Advisors are increasingly attracted to the value we offer and the values we stand for.  During the quarter, 117 experienced advisors joined Ameriprise which was one of our strongest recruiting quarters yet.  Combined with the excellent stability and satisfaction of our legacy advisors, our advisor force is growing. ","These initiatives are translating into solid business metrics.  We\u2019re growing our core client base.  [Inaudible] net inflows were the strongest since before the financial crisis and retail client assets increased nicely to $334 billion at the end of the quarter.  We\u2019re always focused on driving advisor productivity growth.  We finished last year at a record high and we\u2019re not stopping there.  At the end of the first quarter, advisor productivity is measured by operating net revenue per advisor was up 5% sequentially.  ","In terms of segment financial results, our fee based business growth offset the very real impact of low interest rates.  As we reach year end, our brokerage investments will be behind us which will provide some margin relief.   While I remain optimistic about the economic recovery, we\u2019re still operating in a fragile environment and limited by very low rates that will remain with us for quite some time.  However, when rates eventually rise, our advisory business will realize even greater earnings power.","Now, I\u2019ll move on to asset management.  Two years ago next week, we acquired Columbia Management and began a large scale integration.  Today, the integration is essentially complete.  We have outstanding talent and excellent business and global growth opportunities putting us in an attractive position going forward.","We ended the quarter with $463 billion in assets under management and offer broad and high performing product lines.  Our teams at Columbia and Thread Needle continue to produce good investment performance including strong fixed income performance and improved domestic and international equity results.  In fact, five Columbia mutual funds recently received Lipper Fund Awards as top performers in their respective categories.  ","In terms of flows in the quarter, we experienced $4.6 billion in net outflows that included $2.3 billion of Bank America 401K assets that we previously discussed.  We also experienced outflows in funds sub advised by third party and from planned retirement of one of our fund managers.  We have great confidence in the new team at the helm.  Adjusted for these components, Columbia\u2019s underlying retail funds would have been in net inflows.  ","Looking forward we expect additional outflows in the second quarter from Bank America\u2019s 401K plan and the New York 529 plan.  Walter will walk you through these pieces.  Remember, when we acquired Columbia we knew it would take time for the combined businesses to settle down and reestablish a new baseline.  I feel we\u2019re nearing that point.  It\u2019s important for you to see the underlying trends and why I\u2019m confident about our asset management growth prospects for many reasons.  ","Our wholesaling and client service teams are gaining traction.  Our investment performance is strong reflected in our more than 110 four and five star Morningstar funds across Columbia and Threadneedle.  Columbia is generating retail net inflows in fixed income as well as net inflows in our focus funds and we\u2019re picking up momentum at US Trust and in many of our key intermediary platforms.  ","Threadneedle is building good momentum with retail sales recovering nicely.  Our institutional win rate for finals remains very good and we continue to add to a strong new business pipeline.  Finally, Columbia and Threadneedle are operating collaboratively to capture global growth opportunities.  When you look at our asset management business the key message is this, we\u2019re getting over the hump, the business is nearing its new baseline from which we can build in the future.  ","Now, I\u2019ll move on to annuities and insurance.  The annuities business had a good quarter and continues to perform in line with our expectations both in terms of its financials and risk controls.  We offer our annuity products as income solutions not commodities.  They are critical retirement products and since we focus ourselves through our advisors, we know our clients better.  The business is generating good returns and we\u2019re able to grow the business prudently.  ","In terms of metrics, variable annuity net inflows in the Ameriprise channel were $333 million down slightly from a year ago considering we increased rider fees to better balance the economics of the product and we announced a new variable annuity with living benefits which utilizes a managed volatility fund.  ","With regard to fixed annuities, we remain in net outflows because of the rate environment.  In protection we have good books of business that generate solid earnings and provide steady contributions to our diversified business.  Our life and health products are instrumental in fulfilling the comprehensive needs of our clients.  We have strong underwriting and have built a stable book with $191 billion in life insurance in force.  ","The industry has faced a difficult operating environment over the past several years, however, we\u2019re starting to see a pickup in new business driven by our new universal life insurance product.  In the auto and home business we go to market as a low cost provider to the mass affluent.  While the auto and home business experienced significant weather related claims last year, the business results have returned to more normal levels.  We\u2019re generating solid growth and profits in the quarter and our policy counts were up a steady 7%.  ","I feel good about the risk characteristics and the returns in our insurance and annuity businesses.  Overall, Ameriprise continues to be in a strong position and we\u2019re making good consistent progress in executing our strategy and helping people gain confidence in their financial future.  The economy in the United States is slowly recovering and while investors have started to return to the market, they remain cautious as they try to achieve decent returns in this low growth environment.","The continued low interest rate environment creates challenges and the regulatory environment is evolving.  At Ameriprise we\u2019re very conscious about the operating environment and its effect on our revenues and we rely on our expense discipline to offset revenue pressure.  We remain focused on realizing the benefits of our reengineering program to fund growth investments and help contribute to the bottom line. ","As I shared in my opening, Ameriprise is performing well.  Our business remains strong and diversified.  We will continue to invest appropriately to capture future growth opportunities.  We\u2019re delivering good returns while generating significant free cash flow and we\u2019re differentiating the company with our strong client focus, capital strength, flexibility, and ability to return capital to shareholders.  ","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Walter.","Walter S. Berman ","I wanted to start by providing some context for our results in the quarter.  While markets improved on a sequential basis, on a year-over-year basis we did not get much lift from the equity markets as the S&P was up only 3% on average.  The weighted equity index which is weighted to our products was up just 1% and is more reflective of the impact of markets on our results.  We also continue to experience significant headwinds from a rate perspective.  ","You can see on page four how this impacted results on a year-over-year basis.  Operating net revenues were up slightly while operating EPS was up 9% in the quarter reflecting the impact of prior year share repurchases.  Underlying business fundamentals were strong.  As Jim outlined, we are seeing good traction on the business metrics that should translate into future business growth.","Our operating results in the first quarter reflected the impact of a low rate operating environment and a higher operating effective tax rate as well as continued investments for growth initiatives and strong execution of our capital management programs.  As we told you in Q3 we were anticipating lower pre-tax earnings of $55 million from the impact of low interest rates in 2012.  Based on this number, which could increase, we realized more than 60% in the first quarter.","We had modest operating growth reflecting the continued headwinds from low interest rates in both advice and wealth management and in annuities.  Total operating expense growth was 1% as higher expenses from growth initiatives in brand, technology, and experience advisor recruiting were offset by lower expenses in variable annuities from [inaudible] reversion and model enhancements.  Overall, expenses remained well controlled.","Let\u2019s go to the next slide.  Operating earnings and EPS increased by 9% and 11% respectfully in the quarter.  This sequential improvement was due to equity market improvement, limited incremental interest rate impact, and lower expenses.  We also began realizing initial benefits from our reengineering initiatives.  Turning to operating return on equity, we also had good progression, up 110 basis points to 16% versus a year ago.  ","We achieved this through a combination of earnings growth as well as capital redeployment.  Our balance sheet remains strong due to our continued focus on enterprise risk management.  Our investment portfolio is high quality with only $6 million of impairments in the quarter.  As we have said, we have no holdings of sovereign debt in financially troubled European countries.","We ended the quarter with over $2 billion of excess capital.  Our RBC ratio is approximately 525% and our hedge program remains effective.  We continue to return capital to shareholders at a strong pace as you can see on Slide Seven.  We paid out 109% of earnings to shareholders this quarter through a combination of share repurchase and dividends.  As Jim indicated, in 2011 we were in the top 20% of the S&P 500 financials in total return of capital to shareholders.  This is from our strong excess capital and free cash flow generation.","Based on this strong position, we announced yesterday our decision to increase the quarterly dividend by 25%.  Over the past 12 months we have announced three dividend increases which represent a 94% increase on a cumulative basis.  Going forward, we plan to return the majority of our earnings to shareholders gradually increasing the mix between dividends and repurchases.","Turning to segment results, advice and wealth management demonstrated good progress in key business metrics.  We had the strongest quarter for wrap net inflows since the financial crisis.  We recruited more experienced advisors than we have since 2009 and we continued to have strong advisor retention and productivity.  However, we continue to face headwinds from the interest rate environment which impacted year-over-year earnings by $11 million.  ","We\u2019re continuing to make investments that position us for strong growth in the future, building our brand and the experience advisors, and transitioning our advisors to a new brokerage platform.  As we look to the end of the year, the brokerage platform expenses will begin to taper off and you will also start to see the benefit of our expense reengineering efforts.  However, in the current quarter, this elevated level of expense combined with headwinds of a low interest rate environment pressured earnings and margins.","We are comfortable that we are making the right investments for the longer term.  Margins improved sequentially and if markets remain at current levels we will be able to drive gradual margin improvement.  Margin expansion results from improvement in revenues from increased asset levels which should benefit from our successful experience advisor recruiting.  Expense controls and reengineering will also improve margins.","Turning to asset management, here we are feeling the impact from outflows we experienced last year.  This is particularly evident in the retail channel at Columbia where AUM is down 2% from last year.  This is driving 4% lower operating revenues and is pressuring earnings and margins.  On a sequential basis, earnings improved in line with higher markets if you exclude the CDO gain from the fourth quarter.  We\u2019re encouraged by early indicators.  Retail flows have improved which I will detail shortly.  Importantly, expenses remain well controlled.  Performance, a lean indicator of future flows, remains strong and improved this quarter across both equity and fixed income style funds at both Columbia and Threadneedle.  ","Turning to flows, we are seeing a number of dynamics impacting results.  Former parent outflows are within expectation with a total of approximately $2.3 billion this quarter in retail and $300 million in institutional.  Like the industry, we\u2019re seeing strong inflows for fixed income and facing headwinds in equity funds.  This trend is compounded by a concentration of equity funds that are sub advised where we have seen outflows over the past few quarter due to weak performance.  ","The remaining Columbia retail assets have inflows of $200 million even after over $900 million of outflows related to the retirement of a portfolio manager.  While this plan did result in a few large clients moving their assets.  Institutional flows at Columbia were challenging.  While we are seeing some inflows from our growing pipeline in the third party channel, we had large outflows in portfolios that we sub advise and $500 million due to the portfolio manager retirement I previously mentioned.","At Threadneedle, retail flows were strong though we did see some pullback in the first quarter that leads us to believe that retail flows may not be as strong in the second quarter.  In institutional we saw $800 million of outflows primarily from Zurich which is consistent with our prior periods.  ","I wanted to provide an update on the former parent related end of our outflows at Columbia that were discussed in February when we told you that we anticipated about $9 billion of outflows in 2012 with the specific timing a bit unclear.  In the first quarter we had $2.4 billion of former parent outflows.  In the second quarter we expect an additional $5 billion of outflows at Columbia from the about $9 billion we previously identified. ","In Q2 we expect $2.2 billion of former parent 401K outflows, $500 million of outflows from [Balboa], as well as the previously announced loss of the New York 529 program.  While we completed the Zurich owned asset retender last year, Zurich\u2019s pension assets which we currently manage are being retendered and we\u2019re participating in this process.  We may seek some outflows as they seek to diversify managers.","Turning to annuities, we had good earnings growth driven by variable annuities offset by the expected decline in fixed annuities.  Variable annuity operating earnings increased 34% to $133 million pre-tax and included $30 million of benefits from new reversion and model enhancements over last year offset by $8 million in impact from interest on fixed accounts.  We will be introducing a new variable annuity product in May and initial feedback from advisors indicate that it is being well received. ","For fixed annuities, operating earnings declined 23% year-over-year to $56 million reflecting the anticipated decline in spreads as well as the gradually shrinking block of business.  On a sequential basis, earnings were flat adjusting for an unfavorable EIA adjustment of $8 million in the fourth quarter.  ","Turning to protection, life and health operating earnings declined year-over-year primarily from long term care claims and lower investment income from the dividends paid to the parent.  Auto and home fundamentals and profitability are back to historical levels.  We are growing auto and home business with 7% policy growth and we are seeing good traction with our Infinity partners.  ","In closing, we delivered solid financial results in the quarter and we are continuing to see improvement in our business fundamentals.  Our investment in growth initiatives and reengineering should drive benefits throughout the year.  Our balance sheet is strong and we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. ","With that, we will open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","A couple of question on asset management; back in November I think the pre-tax margin was targeted at about 23% but then earlier in the year of 2012 you dialed it down to about 20% to 21% and what we saw this quarter was 18.4% so are you still confident we could see 20% to 21% by the end of the year?  And, maybe just a little color around that?","Walter S. Berman ","I think we are expecting that we\u2019ll be in that range.  We do see that some of the reengineering that we were talking about before will start taking hold and also we\u2019ll start getting some revenue margin improvement as we progress through the year.  So we do see that as achievable, yes.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","","Then just as I looked at assets under management, it was $344 billion up sequentially versus the last quarter about 5.5% which is a nice move and the revenue line at $711 million was up about 1% and I think maybe last quarter you had a CDO gain of about $11 million so that would have been an extra 1% this quarter.  But, do you think you\u2019ll get the pickup in revenue commensurate with those AUM as we move into the second quarter?","Walter S. Berman ","Yes, I think we will and there\u2019s a couple of things as you look through it.  Obviously, there\u2019s been a shift to more fixed income which has certainly affected that and we\u2019re beginning to see hopefully that trend line moving back which will give us higher yield.  Also, as you mentioned the CDO gain certainly on a sequential basis, it increased the management fee basis points.  Also, we had some losses on our alternatives which is certainly a high profit aspect, that performance is improving and we\u2019ll see that hopefully start improving there.  And, we are reengineering not just on the expense, looking at the revenue line too so we think the prospects are good there.","Andrew Kligerman \u2013 UBS","Then just lastly, on a consolidated basis sequentially expenses general and admin were about $775 million barely up from the fourth quarter.  You talked about a lot of different moving parts but it sounds like you could even keep expenses pretty flattish during the year and maybe even get down after you stop investing in brokerage IT at the end of the year.  Is that the right way to look at it?","Walter S. Berman ","We\u2019re certainly controlling the expenses as we\u2019ve indicated and certainly as we look at the circumstances we\u2019re cognoscente of the margins so we are managing the expenses and we have, as Jim said, put in place a reengineering effort.  We always have one but we certainly have accelerated some of that which will start taking a hold.  I\u2019m not going to give you a number we\u2019re going to be flat and up because that will change as we said what we allow goes to the bottom line or not depending on the circumstances, but certainly we\u2019re very focused on the G&A line.","Operator","","Your next question comes from John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the margin and I guess more specifically on the fee rate and I know Walter in response to Andrew\u2019s question you were just talking a little bit about the fixed income versus equities maybe some positive impact moving forward from some improvement at the alternative or the hedge funds but the fee rate, if I look at management fees in asset management, that came down a lot from what was a more recent trend, maybe three or four basis points lower than we\u2019ve seen and that\u2019s a pretty meaningful driver.  I mean, should we expect that that bounces right back up to the trended levels that we saw last year or is there some reason we should expect that that remains somewhat pressured?","Walter S. Berman ","Well, there\u2019s a couple of things happening.  First, as we merge funds, as we indicated we would have revenue denigration from that of one or two basis points and that has occurred and that was what was in our discussion.  So that\u2019s what you see taking place because it worked its way through.  As Andrew mentioned we had the CDO gains, certainly looking at the fourth quarter which certainly distorted the revenue mix and margin in the fourth quarter and that was fairly substantial.  That was also a disclosed item.  And, we had a fee day shift between the first quarter last year and this year there\u2019s a differential of one day each.  ","Now, as it relates to it, we do see that it should start improving as I explained because we do believe that we will hopefully start seeing that mix of equities portion going up and starting to get a better return on that and the alternative is performing better and the reengineering I do believe will start giving us benefits as we get towards the latter part of 2012.  So I think it\u2019s not going to immediately bounce but certainly I think we\u2019re on a good trend line.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","Then just maybe shifting to advice and wealth management, you know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts, you\u2019ve got the timing of some of the expense coming off from the brokerage platform and implementation, you\u2019ve got some higher cost obviously with some better experienced advisor recruiting.  I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if we could revisit the 12% margin target for advice coming in just shy of 10% this quarter, is that 12% margin target for 2012 and I believe it was a full year target, is that something that you still view as achievable and  how do we get there?","Walter S. Berman ","Yes, you\u2019re correct it was a full year target and as you saw we increased nicely sequentially.  I do believe as we look at the trajectory of the expenses as Jim indicated, we certainly were in the midst of our advertising launch and we will still continue to advertise, we\u2019ll obviously gage that.  The brokerage platform will trail off in the fourth quarter as I indicated on that investment side and it is a good thing on the EAR we are certainly attracting, as my comments and Jims about high quality EAR and also the number so that does get an initial expense.  Hopefully, that will continue actually, I think that will be a good thing.","But I do believe, with the combination of events that we see and starting to get benefits from the EARs coming in that the 12% is definitely achievable.  It\u2019s not a walk in the part but it certainly is achievable.","John Nadel \u2013 Sterne Agee","And to the extent that there\u2019s a shortfall there versus that 12% it sounds like maybe the experienced advisor recruiting is going better than you expected and I\u2019d have to imagine from a sort of decision making, longer term decision making perspective, you\u2019d take that trade off right?  You\u2019d take those higher expenses this year and maybe modest margin shortfall to grow your experienced advisor counts?","Walter S. Berman ","I agree with you, it\u2019s a high class problem.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just one more follow up on expenses.  Walter, I appreciate your comments on reengineering and a couple of moving pieces there, but if you look at the G&A up sequentially is the $750 this quarter, do you think this is kind of a high watermark and from here the G&A line should at least stay flat or at least trend a little down or is there room still I guess for that number to go up as you guys implement different initiatives?","Walter S. Berman ","We have the capability to manage the number and as I\u2019ve indicated we have instituted programs and you will see that reengineering build.  The question then is what we do with it as we look at the market and the opportunities so I don\u2019t want to forecast on a particular number, but certainly with the elements we said we\u2019re driving through, the launch of the advertising program, the brokerage platform, and the EAR expense, those are elements that we\u2019re concentrating on but we are managing the other aspects of it but we will then gage how much we will potentially allow some of that to flow through the bottom line then or be invested.  But, we\u2019ll have to gage the situation but certainly we have the ability to manage the expenses within the ranges that you\u2019re talking about.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Shifting gears a little bit on the capital management, obviously very strong returns here again and Jim to your point, you guys raised the dividend a number of times in the last year so considering your comments with the majority of earnings still being paid out on a quarterly basis, do you think another dividend is possible?  Not to get overly greedy here, but towards the end of the year and how you balance that versus the buybacks?","James M. Cracchiolo ","We\u2019ll we clearly are looking to return to shareholders.  We feel we are in a very good situation to do that based on the mix of businesses and the free cash that we\u2019re generating and as we saw last year, we know that dividends have become a more important vehicle for our investors at this point in time so we want to continue to gage that.  Of course, we\u2019re looking at what may come in the future with tax rates and other things, so we don\u2019t want to get too far out on the curve, but as you saw we\u2019re very open to continue.","What we\u2019ve tried to do since we became a public company was increase our dividend every year and there\u2019s only one year we missed on that which was right at the heat of the financial crisis.  But, we didn\u2019t cut our dividend we maintained everything and as you saw we came back quickly with buybacks.  But, we think dividends are an important part of the return back formula and will be possibly even more important so we will keep an eye towards that to continue to look for potential increases but we\u2019ll also evaluate what\u2019s appropriate for what investors may be interested in.","Alexander Blostein \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Than just one last one for me on flows, could you guys comment on the AUM I guess and the value under structured fund where you had a senior PM retire how much of AUM you think is potentially still at risk or if you could kind of look at the client dial with the new team do you think the majority of those outflows are behind us, or you could see a little more trickle in to the second quarter?","James M. Cracchiolo ","I think you all understand that it\u2019s always hard to predict.  The gentleman retiring, Dave Williams, was a long term PM as part of the US Trust business originally when Bank America acquired it so he had a very good following.  I think his fund, even over the long haul had excellent performance.  It did suffer over the last two years a bit based on his investment style and that\u2019s coming back and came back towards the latter part of the year.  But, having said that, sometimes assets flow when the PM changes.  ","We have an excellent PM and team that was part taking over for Dave, a Guy Pope.  We feel very good about his ability to continue the longer term performance that Dave did have there over the long term.  But having said that, sometimes those are lumpy.  As an example, in the first quarter we had a big out in one of the sub advised, $500,000 because of that change.  So I can\u2019t predict what may continue in the second quarter.","Having said that, we have a good team there, a good manager, people recognize Guy Pope\u2019s performance, etc., so we\u2019re hoping that will improve and sustain the business but there may be a few other lumpiness based on model changes.  But that was one of the things that impacted us in the first quarter.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions)  Your next question comes from Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Could you update us on your view on M&A potential including The Hartford has its broker\/dealer operation on the block?  Just whether you have general or specific comments?","James M. Cracchiolo ","Well, I think in general in M&A we thought at the latter part of last year there may be some properties coming out that we might have some interest in.  Having said that, as we reviewed through those various properties, etc., it was less for what we thought as we move forward was appropriate for us.  I think there will be some things that come out, we don\u2019t think they\u2019re significant.  ","You mentioned the broker\/dealer out of Hartford.  I think that\u2019s a smaller opportunity and I can\u2019t comment on it.  I don\u2019t have the information on that at this point in time but what I would say is we\u2019ll continue to look at things that may be appropriate for us but we don\u2019t see anything large on the horizon per say that in some way would change what we\u2019ve just discussed with you as far as our strategy and return to shareholders, etc.  But, if there are some opportunities, even if smaller that fit in neatly that wouldn\u2019t jeopardize our strategy and where we\u2019re moving, we\u2019ll look at them and see if they\u2019re appropriate for us that would give us some additional value.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Our next question was on the impact from interest rates.  Walter, I believe you mentioned that at the outset of the year you were looking at a $55 million impact from lower interest rates but it seemed that you were thinking that could have upside?"," Walter S. Berman ","I think certainly the forward curve took that away and pronouncements from the Fed and there certainly does change that trajectory and as we indicated, I think I indicated something like $35 million of incremental after tax interest expense which is something like $55 pre and we actually had the majority of that hit us in the first quarter as we talked about because of the compare.  Obviously, as we go through 2012 and compare it with that changes that took place in 2011 the implication year-over-year will become less but the majority of that came through in the first quarter.  I believe right now in the short term and everything it\u2019s just going to be certainly tough going for a while with the rates staying where they are and certainly the rates on the long end certainly are not going to get much better.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","Anyway to size the impact for the full year?","Walter S. Berman ","I\u2019d say right now my guess is it\u2019s going to be higher than $55.  Not significantly higher but certainly it could be 10% to 15% higher, even 20%.","Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital","10% to 15%?","Walter S. Berman ","Higher than the $55 so say a maximum $15 million or something like that.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Market.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Market","My question involves asset management, what I\u2019m trying to reconcile is this, you had very good performance as evidenced by the large number and percentage of funds that are four and five star, performance improved markedly in the March quarter versus the December quarter, you mentioned the strength of and the size of your wholesaling team.  I guess my question is given all that why can\u2019t you control these outflows whether it\u2019s 529, the pension plan at Zurich, the retirement assets \u2013 you have a very strong person in Guy Pope is performance is indeed well known, given the strengths that you have sited and the fact that you were looking at all these things, why can\u2019t these outflows be limited if not prevented given your strengths?","James M. Cracchiolo ","I think Eric let me try and answer that in two ways so you can understand a little of why I\u2019m feeling more optimistic as we move forward based on what we created here.  As we look at the underlying flows in core fixed income funds now as well as in equity funds, we actually are gaining share.  We actually were in inflows.  We\u2019re actually in many of the large intermediaries where we are focused on picking up business.  Having said that, I think flows in general in equities are still weak, they haven\u2019t come back in full flavor so you\u2019re not going to see big appetite for big increases in that but we are gaining traction so I see that.","We\u2019re gaining traction because we have good product with good performance and now we\u2019ve reestablished our wholesaling.  Now, in the items that you mentioned, I think they\u2019re all in particular.  So first of all, we\u2019re going through a major change by acquiring Bank America\u2019s business it was a proprietary in house business and so some of the stuff you\u2019re going to lose over time is there may have been a reason that they had the business in house.  Take their 401K and pension, it was all with Columbia so you\u2019re going to have a change there.  Take American Express, when we separated we used to manage their muni bond for their traveler\u2019s checks so again we had an agreement to continue that but when that\u2019s up at one point that gets reevaluated in a similar basis.","Zurich is a perfect example, they retended and everything, they went to competitive bids and we won all of those client portfolios.  Having said that, for their own pension plan, you know, again Threadneedle managed all of that and now they\u2019re looking at whether they take pieces out.  I think those things are going to naturally come up based on a change in ownership and philosophy and other things.  So I don\u2019t see that as abnormal, you\u2019ve got to get over the hump but what I\u2019ve created with the combination of these two gives us great potential.  ","It\u2019s a great platform, I think it\u2019s very competitive with the majors out there for a lot of reasons.  529, another particular; we no longer worked with one of the providers that were actually doing the type of the client service activity with New York.  It was a decision made prior to us taking the combined unit from Columbia and that sort of played out.  Maybe we would have did things a little differently knowing that it was a more profitable business than at the time Columbia or Bank of America thought it was.","So we are making changes as we go along, we\u2019re adjusting sort of our focus on various things but with a change comes change.  Dave Williams retiring a long term PM, we know in the industry sometimes even if you put a good team that can get that performance where we need it, once a change occurs it gets reevaluated for due diligence or other reasons.  I do believe as we go through the next quarter or so we\u2019ll get over the hump of these major items that comes with a deal of this size and a merger of this size but what we have underneath I still feel good about. ","I would tell you differently if I felt differently but I think as I speak to the people and the teams, and the leaders, and the people on the ground, they feel we\u2019re gaining traction and to be very honest you can look at our performance it\u2019s good.  There\u2019s still some pockets that continue to need improvement.  We all want every fund to be where we need it to be so there\u2019s still work in some areas but overall I think we\u2019ve got a good fund line up now and it does take a little time to gain back that traction.","Nothing has changed maybe you just have to extend it a bit more because the lumpiness you hope ends sooner.  As Walter said, it is two years now in the month of May and so I think for size and scope, and going through the market volatility that we have, I think we\u2019re in really good shape.  Look at the foundation of what we created in the asset management business, I think it\u2019s tremendous compared to where we used to be.","Eric Berg \u2013 RBC Capital Market","","One quick one for Walter; Walter you indicated repeatedly in your prepared remarks that \u2013 I think you said, that the transition of the advisors to the new platform and the money being spent on that transition will be completed by the end of this year.  Could you quantify the savings that will appear as a result?","Walter S. Berman ","I prefer not because candidly it\u2019s getting into systems and everything like that but it has an impact.  It certainly will have an impact because it\u2019s a huge investment to put that sort of a platform in as you can imagine and we are incurring the expense and like I said, it will go in conversion by the third quarter and it\u2019s reasonably impactful, it really is.  I prefer not to get into specific numbers.","James M. Cracchiolo ","I think what I can add is when we talk about this implementation it\u2019s not just the technology development, that\u2019s a piece of it.  What we really have is the increased expense right now is as you\u2019re going through a conversion you\u2019re carrying two systems one is live that you just made live and the other one is the continuation of your old platform until you convert all the accounts.  So you have a duplicate operating expense there.  The second thing is you have a lot of additional servicing cost as you\u2019re going through account conversion, and getting people up, and moving all the data, and information, and the client activities.","It\u2019s a combination of three components, one is the technology development, the other one is the training and the support costs for the conversion and service delivery, and then with that you have the two operating systems that you carry.  So as we convert we have one occurring in May and one in August and then after that we can start to turn off the other system.  We could then with that bring down a lot of the training cost, etc. and unwind that and the third thing is the development starts to get a lot less.  ","You still have ongoing development but it\u2019s not as material as we\u2019re hooking up all of the various systems to get that new operating system online.  So it\u2019s a material amount per quarter in a combination of those factors that will go away.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities.  ","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Just one follow up on Eric\u2019s question, Walter so the 12% margin on advice and wealth with those expenses going away from the new platform would you be at the 12% with that going away or is there more heavy lifting that you need to do on either the revenue or the expense side?","Walter S. Berman ","It\u2019s a combination.  Obviously, we will have the majority of that expense sticking through the third quarter so it will be embedded.  When I said that we will achieve it our assumption was that that expense would be there.   So it would be a combination certainly of other expense items that we\u2019re managing because those are the expenses we\u2019re making in the business and obviously the revenue pick up so that\u2019s already embedded in the number for this year when I said we have a pretty good shot at getting to the 12%.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","So I guess my question is by 4Q when this expense goes away, a) is it going to go away completely so are we going to see sort of a cliff on the cost meaning the cost going down meaningfully and if we fast forward to that eventuality and we kind of pro forma it on this quarter\u2019s revenues, would we be close to the 12% margin level?","Walter S. Berman ","Again, as Jim said there\u2019s so many moving parts as it relates to that aspect of it and again, I\u2019ll remind you it is a major system and once the system is fully implemented we will then start the amortization aspect of it.  But certainly, there will be a differential.","James M. Cracchiolo ","I think what we\u2019re saying, let me just try to be very focused on your question, one is it does assume that revenue continues to improve as we drive greater productivity as well as improvements in our asset levels, etc. which is ongoing so we\u2019re not looking at anything what we would call radical from where we are but a continued progression as you saw in the first quarter.  Second, would be that as Walter said, we\u2019re managing other expenses and reengineering during this time frame to bring down some expenses that will offset the expense that we had in the first quarter but we will get relief as we go into the fourth quarter for some of that wind down occurring in this system.","With that in mind, that the margin if you just project it out from where we are would have to be higher in the fourth quarter than the 12%, you got 12% for the full year based on a combination of those factors occurring.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","So the fact that you\u2019re giving us this glide path suggestions margin by 4Q needs to be substantially about 12% to come up with the average of 12% for the year?","Walter S. Berman ","Yes, because the expense is embedded in for three quarters so on that basis it would have to be.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Now, just another question on that, how much of this overall program is being expensed kind of on a real time basis and how much is being capitalized?","Walter S. Berman ","There is obviously from the standpoint of the enhancements and the training, those are being expensed.  So from that standpoint there is a significant amount of this that is being in the period charge basis with again, as we implement the system and the changes related to that, that is the portion that will be pushed forward.","James M. Cracchiolo ","The development expense gets capitalized and amortized but we\u2019re carrying two operating systems that there\u2019s operating expenses period.  All the conversion costs, all the training costs, all of that is period charge.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Is there any way to quantify how much?  Is it half and half, half percent being capitalized half percent being expensed in the current period just in terms of absolute costs?","Walter S. Berman ","Again, I don\u2019t want to give you an amount because each project is different depending on the intensity so I would prefer not to give it because like I said, each project depends on how much is really for development versus how much is for implementation.  Off the top of my head, I don\u2019t have the exact numbers on that.","James M. Cracchiolo ","The amortization is a smaller part of what we\u2019re talking about this point as we move forward.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","Okay, I just wanted to be clear on that that we\u2019re not back loading a lot of it.","James M. Cracchiolo ","We\u2019re definitely not back loading.","Thomas Gallagher \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities","The last question I had is just going back to John Nadel\u2019s question about the revenue yield and how that declined even after backing out the CDO impact.  I guess, Walter when I heard you mention the fund mergers being an issue I can understand that.  Was there a big delta from 4Q to 1Q because I thought the fund mergers were mainly behind us?  If I just look at what happened from 4Q11 to 1Q2012 because the thing that stood out to me was the fact that your equity assets went up markedly and I do sort of back of the envelope calculation your equity assets went up by $20 billion or so on average from 4Q to 1Q so you would expect that your revenue yield wouldn\u2019t have declined as much.  Anyway, any light you can shed on that would be helpful.","Walter S. Berman ","Between sequential you really do have a fee day differential which is one part of it.  The gain on the CDO is really a big part, and you\u2019re getting as the mergers came through they hit their full stride basically starting in the first quarter and so I would say those are the elements.  Also, on the alternative you\u2019re getting the full impact coming through.  But it\u2019s really the two big items are the fee day that\u2019s less and the gain on the CDO and that swings most of it.","Operator","","Your next question comes from Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","I was wondering if we could talk a little bit more specifically about advertising?  If we go back a quarter, I think on the fourth quarter call you indicated at that point that you had very good visibility about the first quarter ad spend was largely determined.  So now that we\u2019re down the road I\u2019m guessing you have pretty clear visibility on the second quarter spend.  I mean, either you\u2019ve produced some new commercials and have bought time or you haven\u2019t.  Can you give us a little bit better look into what second quarter advertising spend might look like please?","James M. Cracchiolo ","As we looked it from last year, we clearly knew as we were going into the first quarter what we were thinking of spending and we bought various space that you buy sometimes in the spot market but sometimes up front to get better positioning.  So clearly, as we spoke about with you at the beginning of the end of last year, we did look at the first two quarters of what we were planning to spend and we have been consistent with that in actual spending.  So we do have our ads running now through April and some part of May. ","Now, we will go off and lighten up and just use more of some web activity in through the interim period and then we will come back with our advertising as we did last year in the September time frame through the end of the year.  Now, with that, as I look at the rest of the year I have the ability for the second half, as Walter said, to determine what I would like to spend in that regard.","Now, the positives for us and the reason we\u2019re spending or we did is because our advertising is really hitting a positive note.  It is a positive for us both with our advisor channel with clients, etc. and so we do think that we\u2019re generating value from that as a top line awareness for our advisor and client activity.  So we will review that but having said that, if we find that we\u2019re going into tough markets or we find that revenue will be squeezed tremendously we have the ability to scale back what we want to do in the media.","Having said that, we think we have a good campaign.  We\u2019re looking to continue that campaign but we\u2019ll manage the activities.  The one thing you will not see is because we do both top line advertising as well as below the line marketing and other activities, we do have ability to manage some of that activity and use different levers in a sense of what we want to put more emphasis on.  ","So you\u2019re not going to see an increase over last year as we go through the rest of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter as we launched the new campaign.  On the other side, we may want to continue that advertising if it does give us some benefits depending on market conditions as well as how we\u2019re doing in the rest of the business.","Jeffrey Schuman \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Just one follow up, can you give us just a rough sense of how the ad spend typically hits the segment?  Does a lot of it in advice and wealth management or where does it generally hit?","James M. Cracchiolo ","Our advertising right now \u2013 first of all you\u2019ve got marketing advertising and what we do at the web, etc., so everything we think is directly attributed to the AWM business we do charge to the AWM business.  There\u2019s some of the advertising that\u2019s for corporate and that goes over to the corporate area.  But, as we said, depending on what we\u2019re focused on, what we\u2019re communicating, etc., it either is explicitly tied so for instance direct [search] paid, [search] various things go directly and including national advertising, there\u2019s a good portion that goes to the AWM business.","Operator","","Your last question comes from John Hall \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities.","John Hall \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Jim, I just wanted to follow up on the dividend and capital management a little bit.  Is there a payout ratio that you\u2019re aiming for or shooting for?","James M. Cracchiolo ","We look at various things in that.  I think what we would probably say is we\u2019re more focused on looking at how much of our earnings that we\u2019re going to give back to shareholders.  As we said, we\u2019re looking to do a majority of that as we look at the next number of years, etc., right now based on our position and our capital strength, our ability to generate good strong free cash flow.  As far as the dividend we wanted to continue to sort of boost that from where we had started originally and so we feel good that we\u2019re in the two plus range and so we\u2019re going to continue to look at the growth of our dividends over time but we\u2019re not going to manage it to an exact yield rate because of the changes in the market, and the stock price and various things.","It\u2019s always hard because sometimes you\u2019re over and then you don\u2019t want to raise the dividend and sometimes you\u2019re back.  We\u2019re looking more for steady improvements and generating a reasonably good yield for the type of company that we are and in the industry or across the S&P 500 financials.  So that\u2019s more of how we\u2019re looking at it rather than a set yield rate.","John Hall \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","In response to Jay\u2019s question you sounded a little bit more conservative on the outlook for M&A and the like and I guess in that context you\u2019ve got a lot of excess capital, you\u2019ve got a lot of cash that you\u2019re holding, that represents some sort of earnings drag if the M&A environment is not as vibrant as it might be what\u2019s the need for hanging on to so much excess capital and so much cash?","James M. Cracchiolo ","Again, we don\u2019t look at it as purely a current need per say.  So if opportunities come along, I\u2019m not saying we\u2019re out of the M&A market, but what I\u2019m saying is we don\u2019t see of the things that are out there anything significant that would be a very large undertaking for us in thinking about using all of our capital versus returning and maintaining a good position depending on market volatility that\u2019s out there.  ","We\u2019re always going to look to maintain a good strong capital structure.  We hope that you as looking at us in that light based on the types of volatility that these one in 100 year events that keep on occurring every year, we want to make sure we don\u2019t have to go to the capital markets in any fashion.  But having said that, we don\u2019t want to be overly conservative which is why last year we returned $1.7 billion of capital.  So there are periods we will probably increase the return and there are periods that maybe some smaller acquisitions may come along so that\u2019s all we\u2019re saying is it\u2019s not so much I\u2019m negative on M&A, I\u2019m not.  ","We thought there might be larger ones that might be more important for us coming to light at the end of last year, we haven\u2019t seen that in this sense and so I\u2019m just giving you a signal in that regard as well.  But, we\u2019re not stopping M&A from occurring if there are good things that come along, I\u2019m just saying to you that we feel very good about our return of capital to shareholders as one of our priorities right now.","John Hall \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Just my final clean up question here has to do with the outflows that you anticipate in the second quarter, the $4.7 billion identified on Slide 11.  Do you have any sense of timing in the context of the quarter?  Is this out at the beginning of the quarter, or at the end, or roughly on average across it?","James M. Cracchiolo ","I can\u2019t tell you exactly.  I would say we were expecting this to probably come out in the May timeframe which is sort of the middle of the period.  But again, that\u2019s not a perfect science but I think based on what I was aware, sometime in the May timeframe. ","Operator","","Mr. Cracchiolo I will return the call back over to you for closing remarks.","Walter S. Berman ","I want to thank everyone for listening to us this morning and for your questions and any other thoughts you have in your conversations with Alicia and Chad.  Very clearly again, I just want to emphasize that based on a combination of factors both from a business as well as an environmental, we do feel good about our position, we feel good about the traction that we have and the improvements that we\u2019re making.  Having said that, we will experience being in the businesses that we\u2019re in some level of adjustments from quarter-to-quarter, a little lumpiness as we\u2019re getting over with the Columbia transaction hopefully going to be more behind us than in the middle of which will occur over the next quarter or so.","So yeah, we\u2019ve got another lumpy quarter to get through in flows but I would still say that we have good underlying improvements in our business.  I think we have a great foundation that we built.  I think our AWM business again, market climate isn\u2019t great for robust trading activity and large investments but you can see some of the underlying metrics are strong for us and we have a really healthy annuity and insurance business.","I do believe that we\u2019re in more of the better end of that slice of the pie for where we\u2019re participating.  I think the combination of those things gives us a very good company and gives us that appropriateness that we can return well to shareholders and so we will continue to execute against our strategy.  Quarter-to-quarter it\u2019s not perfect science of where you\u2019re going to come in but I think look at us over the last eight quarters, four quarters, look at us in total of what we\u2019ve created over the last two years and where we\u2019ve come from and I think you\u2019ll find a good consistent story even though quarter-to-quarter it won\u2019t be a perfect science.","Thank you for both your interest as well as your questions and your comments and we look forward to continuing to have the conversation with you as we go forward.","Operator","","Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Ms. Charity, you may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide insights into the company's operations.

Cracchiolo","Good morning, and thank you for joining us for today's earnings call. I'll spend my time discussing what I'm seeing in the business. Walter will talk to the numbers, and then we'll be happy to take your questions.","In terms of the quarter and 2014 overall, I feel good about Ameriprise and our position. The fourth quarter we delivered was a continuation of a strong year. We're executing our strategy well and generating good results. For the fourth quarter, operating net revenues continued to grow, up 5% with good growth in operating earnings, up 16%, and operating earnings per diluted share, up a very strong 23%. For the full year 2014, operating net revenues grew 7% with good movement in operating earnings of 14% and operating EPS, up a very strong 21%.","We also had solid growth in assets under management and administration, which increased 5% to $806 billion. This was driven by continued good advisor\/client flows and market appreciation. Our strong growth in earnings allows us to generate significant free cash, so we're able to consistently deliver differentiated shareholder return while maintaining our financial strength, all while investing in the business. In the fourth quarter, we returned $444 million to shareholders. And for the full year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, which is 109% of our operating earnings. In fact, 2014 marked 4 consecutive years that we have returned more than 100% of our operating earnings to shareholders. We expect to continue to return strongly to shareholders and have targeted a 90% to 100% range annually, and we will evaluate based on circumstances.","With strong business results and significant capital return, operating return on equity reached another high. Excluding AOCI, we ended the year at 23%, up from 19.7% at the end of 2013. Very few financial services companies are generating this level and growth of ROE and capital return. We've consistently grown these measures at a meaningful rate.","Let's move to the business, starting with Advice & Wealth Management, where we had another terrific quarter in terms of financial results in executing our strategy for continued growth and margin expansion. We had strong growth in our key measures. Revenues, earnings, client assets, inflows and advisor productivity were all up nicely. Operating net revenue increased 11% to $1.2 billion, reflecting our strong fundamentals and positive markets. We're seeing good levels of client activity. Total client assets grew 9% to $444 billion, with continued strong net inflows of over $3 billion into our investment advisory programs. Our total RAP program is one of the largest in the industry at $175 billion, growing 14% for the year. With good revenue growth, we've also increased profitability in AWM, up 33%, and we've also significantly expanded operating margin to 17% for the quarter, and we delivered this with interest rates at all-time lows.","In AWM, we continue to focus on growing the business and delivering an excellent client experience and we feel good about our ability to help our advisors build productive practices. With millions of boomers moving to retirement, we're at the heart of the opportunity with our Confident Retirement approach. You've seen it in our commercials which we just brought to market in early 2014. Confident Retirement works well for the mass affluent and it resonates well with the affluent. We think there's a terrific opportunity for us to serve even more affluent investors as we move forward.","Another opportunity that we're focused on is around accumulators. We're expanding Confident Retirement to use for clients in the accumulation stage. In addition to the affluent and to those who are closer to retirement, the Gen Xs and Ys who are building their wealth also fit within our sweet spot. We continue to invest significantly in our brand and our leading capabilities to help our advisors grow their practices and increase efficiency. As we ended the year, brand awareness reached an all-time high. In fact, we were recently awarded the Gold Midas Award in Financial Services Retirement Category for our, \"Real Questions, Real Answers,\" advertising campaign that is currently in the market. The campaign includes commercials, digital advertising, social media, and the 3-minute Confident Retirement digital experience.","With that in mind, we continue to invest significantly in our brand and the leading capabilities that help our advisors grow their practices. And we're helping our advisors to ensure they fully benefit from the investments we've made, especially in our brokerage platform, online and mobile capabilities. As we help advisors take advantage of these capabilities even more with greater uptake, our advisors can grow productively and serve more clients. Our advisors who have taken advantage of our technology platform find that it helps them save time, increase efficiency and productivity. At the company level, we're realizing operating cost efficiencies from our technology investments and upgrades made over the past several years. Because we're providing good value and service, client satisfaction with Ameriprise is at an all-time high in the 90s. And with that, Ameriprise was rated #1 in customer experience across investment firms in The 2014 Forrester Customer Experience index.","We also have strong relationships with our advisors. Our culture of support in helping them achieve good growth in their practices has led to good engagement and retention that is very high; on average, in the Mid-90s. I spent time at the start of the month with all of our field leaders, and they're feeling motivated about helping our advisors to continue to grow. The Ameriprise value proposition and culture is attractive in the industry. In terms of recruiting experienced advisors, we brought in another 73 in the quarter. The productivity of the advisors we're attracting continues to grow and our recruiting pipeline for 2015 looks good. As a result of the actions we're focused on to drive growth, advisor productivity, a metric we've consistently grown, continues to increase. Compared to a year ago, it's up 13% on a trailing 12-month basis to $496,000 per advisor.","Overall, it was another terrific quarter and year for AWM. We have deep relationships with our clients and advisors and excellent satisfaction. We're focused on continuing to drive client engagement and serve more people, especially in the affluent space. This leads to strong results. We're delivering nice growth and profitability with the ability to continue. And the business consistently delivers the results we're targeting, and we feel good about our opportunity for future growth.","Now let's move to Asset Management, where we have generated good earnings growth and continued to build our positions in the U.S., the U.K. and Europe. Net revenues were up 1% year-over-year with pretax operating earnings up a solid 6% and adjusted net pretax operating margin increased to a strong 40%. Assets under management were up slightly to $506 billion as market appreciation offset net outflows over the past year. In institutional, we're seeing good growth and making good progress in third party with $1.7 billion in net inflows in the quarter. We continue to win key mandates from clients in North America, Europe and Asia, including in certain strategies, like Contrarian Core and investment grade debt. We have a solid pipeline and we feel good about our capabilities as well as our global growth opportunity. However, some of our growth was offset by the regular outflows from Z\u00fcrich, and our ex-parent relationships. Excluding these previously disclosed items, we would have had stronger net inflows.","For the quarter, we reported retail net inflows that result to strong reinvested dividends. However, we still experienced a level of outflows in one of our large funds in the DCIO channel as well as former parent company affiliated distribution and a sub-advisor. We have seen some traction in a number of our retail channels and we know can make further progress this year. We're focused on a number of enhancements that we're making in retail distribution. As an example, we installed a new leadership team and we're revamping our wholesaling. And we're making greater use of business intelligence and our improved segmentation strategy.","At Threadneedle, we experienced retail net outflows of about $0.5 billion, largely from a single client who is a frequent asset allocator. That said, the underlying rate improved from the last quarter. The recent ECB action should be a catalyst for European investors to see opportunities in the market and would expect to benefit as investors put money to work.","You may have also seen our announcement from a few weeks ago that Columbia and Threadneedle are rebranding in the spring to Columbia Threadneedle Investments. The teams have been working together to increase the depth of our offering for the benefit of our clients and the business. Introducing our global brand is a natural next step for the business. The new global brand will represent the global capabilities, resources and reach of these 2 well-established investment firms. We're focused on expanding our distribution and global presence and continuing to add high-performing products to our mix. Together, Columbia and Threadneedle have 118 4- and 5-star Morningstar-rated funds. We delivered another good quarter of investment performance as many of our equity and fixed income funds were positioned with a quality bias, which helped as equity markets were volatile in the quarter.","In terms of product, we're looking to build off our strength in traditional products and we're investing in a number of areas, including in multi-asset solutions. We just recently launched the Columbia Adaptive Risk Allocation Fund, one of our key new products, and I'm pleased with the response it's getting in both retail and institutional channels. In fact, Jeff Knight and his team were recognized recently with an innovation award. We think that, over time, we can gain good traction that would further add to our flows and complement our core business as we build our track record and awareness of these products and capabilities. Another example is Columbia's Adaptive Alternatives Fund, which we launched yesterday. It's an innovative collaboration with Blackstone Alternative Asset Management, an example of the steps we're taking to broaden our solutions. Overall, we have good talent, an expanding distribution footprint and a growing product line. We're very focused on gaining traction in these key areas.","Let's move to Annuities and Protection, which are important to our Confident Retirement approach, helping to protect our clients' wealth and generating retirement income. We're achieving good returns in our annuity business with lower risk and volatility as we continue to grow at the moderate pace we want. In variable annuities, client account balance were up slightly to $77 billion due to market appreciation, and sales were $1.2 billion. As we work with clients to help ensure their retirement lifestyle through tax management and protection, we're selling more variable annuities without living benefits. In December, RiverSource annuities launched Income Guide, a new income monitoring program for clients with a variable annuity without a living benefit. This complements sales with living benefits is a way for clients to cover essential living expenses. In fact, sales of our variable annuities without living benefits increased to 28% of total variable annuity sales in the quarter.","In fixed annuities, underlying results were solid as the rate actions we undertook in 2014 have improved spread income. As we've stated, our focus remains on the overall profitability of the book, while the size of the book will gradually shrink given the overall sales environment. Overall, we're focused on making it easier for clients and advisors to understand the benefits that annuities can provide in terms of reliable retirement income.","In life insurance, VUL\/UL sales picked up a bit year-over-year with our RiverSource TrioSource product. VUL\/UL ending account balances were up 3% largely from the markets. TrioSource is an interesting UL product that combines a tax-qualified long-term care rider that sits well within our financial planning approach.","In Auto & Home, we're seeing steady growth. However, Auto & Home has been experiencing higher claims that resulted in us adding $60 million to reserves in the quarter. Walter will cover this area in more detail. However, I did want to mention that we've been taking action throughout 2014 and into this year in the areas that have increased our loss ratios and cost exposures, so we're working to further enhance claim processing, underwriting and pricing to improve performance. This remains a very strong business model. We're seeing steady growth in policies from our focus on affinity channels and reputation for excellent service. Our Auto & Home business was rated one of the best firms for client satisfaction in 2014.","Overall, Ameriprise had another strong quarter with good financial results adding to a strong year overall. I believe we're positioned well for the year ahead. We continue to have a very strong financial foundation that will give us the flexibility to navigate the markets ahead. We are very focused on delivering the strategy we've discussed with you. We continue to invest and generate good returns. And we've set Ameriprise apart in terms of the strength and the consistency of our results. We're focused on continuing the strong growth we've had in AWM. And we're addressing areas where we can gain traction, improve our flows and asset Management. Our ability to generate significant free cash flow enables us to continue to return to shareholders as we have and maintain our excellent financial foundation. As I mentioned at the start, we delivered record return on equity and we think we can take it even higher.","With that, I'd like to hand things over to Walter for a detailed review of the numbers.","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise delivered strong results at the aggregate level in the fourth quarter, with solid underlying performance in our Advice & Wealth Management, Asset Management, Annuities and Life and Health businesses. We had double-digit growth in earnings and EPS in the quarter. Though Auto & Home reserve increased and the significant business-driven tax benefit were largely neutralized on an EPS basis, we continued to strengthen our balance sheet fundamentals. Our investment portfolio is solid, hedging is effective and we have $2.5 billion of excess capital and strong liquidity.","Let's turn to Slide 4. Ameriprise had strong aggregate shareholder performance. Top line performance was good with operating net revenue up 5% to $3 billion. Operating net revenue without investment income was up 7%, which is very strong. Overall, operating EPS was up 23% to $2.30, and our strong earnings, free cash flow generation and capital return drove an operating return on equity of 23%, which is at the upper end of our target range. The operating effective tax rate was 20.3% in the quarter, which is lower than we had anticipated for a couple of business-driven reasons. About half of the benefit was related to the dividends received deduction being higher than expected. The other half of the benefit was state taxes being lower, which reflected a shift in the states where business activities are occurring. Going forward, we expect the higher DRD benefit and lower state taxes to continue, but the impact would be spread across the year rather than being recognized all in 1 quarter. Looking into 2015, we expect taxes to be in the 26% to 28% range, up from 25.4% in 2014.","As you can see on Slide 5, the strong financial performance we had in the fourth quarter was consistent with the excellent year in 2014. Operating net revenue grew 7% to $11.6 billion, well within our target range of 6% to 8% on average over time. Without net investment income, operating net revenue was up 9%. Operating earnings were $1.7 billion, up 14%, and operating EPS was up 21% to $8.52 for the year.","Turning to Slide 6. Our business mix shift is a direct result of the strategy we are executing. Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management represent 68% of pretax operating earnings this quarter. The mix was impacted by the Auto & Home reserve increase, but without that, AWM and asset management are still over 62% of the total. Going forward, the mix shift will continue and should reach 70% from these businesses. We continue to expand margins in Advice & Wealth Management, reaching 17% this quarter. As we bring in experienced advisors and help transfer their books, their productivity ramps up over time. This benefit combined with the improving productivity of our legacy advisor base is driving margin expansion and profitability improvement. Margins in the employee channel were approximately 10% in the quarter and were almost 19% in the franchise channel. We feel good about the improvement we're seeing across this business to drive profitability even higher. Asset management margins were a solid 40% in the quarter on an adjusted basis, up from 38.8% a year ago.","I'll get into the segment results in detail now beginning on Slide 7 with AWM. The business is performing extremely well, leading and lagging indicators as well as financials. Client assets are up 9%, as we've seen good flows in our wrap platform, new accounts acquired and market lift. Our experienced advisor recruiting is on target with 73 hires in the quarter, and productivity is at an all-time high of 496,000 for the trailing 12 months. Revenue is up 11% to $1.2 billion on strong sales and flows as well as markets. We kept G&A expenses flat year-over-year. This resulted in earnings of $212 million, up 33% and margins of 17%, up from 14.2% last year. It should be noted that we had over $20 billion of brokerage cash that was earning 20 basis points, which is still near all-time lows. Overall, the business continues to deliver consistent good results, demonstrating the strength of our business model. We continue to invest for our future growth, building on our brand and adding capabilities to support our clients and advisors.","Turning to Asset Management on Slide 8. Revenue increased 1% to $830 million, primarily from market appreciation, which was essentially offset by the cumulative impact of outflows and lower performance fees. During the first 3 quarters of 2014, we enjoyed the benefit of robust equity markets, which more than offset the cumulative impact of net outflows on revenues. In the fourth quarter, markets pulled back, especially in Europe. As a result, the lift we enjoyed from equity markets decreased and provided less of an offset to the impact of net outflows as it relates to revenue growth. In the quarter, earnings were up 6% to $198 million, which was impacted by the market pullback, lower performance fees and additional expenses for rebranding Columbia Threadneedle Investments and relocating Threadneedle to a new office space. G&A was very well-managed. This is reflected in the margins at 40%, up from 38.8% last year.","Turning to flows on the next slide. We had net inflows of $5.7 billion in the quarter, with inflows across retail, institutional and alternative. Retail inflows of $4.9 billion benefit from reinvestment dividends. However, Columbia had outflows in a number of areas we have previously discussed, namely the former parent-affiliated distribution, the RIA channel, a sub-advisor and one of our large funds in the DCIO channel. Threadneedle had retail outflows as a result of the industry-wide slowdown from geopolitical and economic concerns in Europe as well as a mandate that shifted from retail to the institutional channel. The global institutional business is performing well with $300 million of net inflows. We had outflows in the form of parent-related mandates at both Columbia and Threadneedle that partially offset the strong third-party inflows. We continue winning global mandates and have a good pipeline as we move into 2015. We have also launched a new CLO in the quarter resulting in $500 million of net inflows in alternatives.","Turning to Annuities on Slide 10. Annuities pretax operating earnings were $159 million, down 8% from last year. However, the prior year results included a significant benefit from clients moving to our managed volatility funds as well as a higher mean reversion benefit last year. Without these items, underlying annuities earnings were up 15%. Variable annuity pretax operating earnings grew 5% from a year ago to $114 million, without the benefit of clients moving to managed volatility funds and mean reversions in both periods. This was driven by higher account values. Fixed annuity pretax operating earnings increased 71% to $36 million. This reflects the repricing of our 5-year guarantee block earlier in the year, and our lapse rate was in line with expectations.","Let's turn to Protection segment on Slide 11. Protection pretax operating earnings were $30 million in the quarter, impacted by a $60 million reserve strengthening at Auto & Home. Underlying earnings are in line with prior periods and our expectations. The Life and Health business is performing well, with cash sales up 3% over the prior year and insurance in-force of $196 billion. We saw marginally higher life claims than we have in recent quarters, though still within expected ranges. Earnings were also impacted by an unfavorable DAC model correction. As a reminder, we reinsure half of our long-term care block to Genworth, and they process and pay all of our claims. We carefully monitor and evaluate the information and processes. However, based upon recent events, we have begun a more detailed, non-routine review. We feel good about our block, particularly the risk characteristics from selling it only within our channel and the pricing actions we have taken since the mid-2000s. As I mentioned, we are increasing Auto & Home reserves by $60 million this quarter, of which 96% is related to several products in our Auto book.","There are a couple of key drivers of the reserve increase: first, we had an additional frequency and severity experience on book years 2012 and prior, representing approximately 15% of the reserve increase. These are based on estimated ultimate losses but now have a higher probability of being realized as there are fewer outstanding cases and they are more vintaged; second, the remainder of the reserve increase was for 2013 and 2014 order books, which are strongly influenced by 2012 prior year's experience as well as preliminary 2013 and '14 trends. We have minimal to moderate claims experience for these accident years and patterns are still developing. The reserve analysis was complicated by changes associated with claims reengineering and unusual climate patterns this year. Earlier this year, we engaged outside consultants to review our processes. Now we are phasing in changes to our pricing-to-risk modeling, which will be rolled out fully by early 2016. Additionally, we are making modifications to underwriting, claims and operations, and we have made a variety of staffing change, including bringing in a new LFO, a new Head of Claims and new actuaries.","Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 12. Our balance sheet remained strong with approximately $2.5 billion of excess capital. Our risk-based capital ratio is estimated to be 600%, up from 450% last year due to an increase in the unrealized gains on our hedges from lower interest rates and higher volatility. We continue to return over 100% of operating earnings to shareholders, with $444 million distributed through dividends and a share repurchase in the quarter. For the year, we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, which was 109% of operating earnings. This is down from the level returned in 2013, which did include the return of capital associated with exiting bank operations. Looking into 2015, we plan to return 90% to 100% of earnings to shareholders as a baseline. With that, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Nadel from Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Maybe to start off, for you, Jim. First, obviously, you've had a lot of pressure in the Auto & Home business over the past year or more, and the results are in stark contrast to what we're seeing from most industry participants, where underwriting results really are among the best in history. So I guess, can you help us understand exactly what you're doing to correct this? Do the -- and do the results of this business alter your view on whether this business should reside as part of Ameriprise or be divested to a more traditional operator?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. Very clearly, we have experienced increase in our reserve positions based on developments that have occurred beginning probably in the 2012 period. We have grown the business tremendously over the last number of years. We have expanded in a number of areas. However, we still feel very good about the front end of the business, the affinity relationships, the ability to bring in good clients in a very cost-effective way, but we had to tighten up a number of various areas from the underwriting to more discipline around some particular areas in pricing, et cetera. So we are making those changes. We think that we have the ability to improve that position over time. But we did take the opportunity here to further increase our reserve positions based on some of those earlier trend lines. We don't have perfect information about them. Having said that, clearly, there are opportunities for us to improve. We think that we can make those improvements. We do believe it is -- it continues to be a good differentiated model. And in the future, we -- once we make those improvements and those changes, we can evaluate the business on a go-forward basis.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So if we looked out and had to -- and you had to peg when does this business generate an underwriting profit, i.e. a combined ratio under 100%, is that within your visibility next couple of years? Or do you think it takes longer?","James M. Cracchiolo","No, no. It is definitely within our visibility. And we are looking to see some improvements in 2015 and beyond. Again, it'll be gradual improvements as we make these changes and they flow in. But we really do feel that this is something that we can get back to a good level of profitability. And as I said, we'll evaluate as we go along, but we are aggressively focused on it. It's unfortunate that we have -- some of these things have blipped up, but it's something that we think we can definitely correct.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. That was really helpful. And then just overall, on capital return, the slide this year in your presentation is very similar to last year, that your baseline target of returning and 90% to 100%. And obviously, the last several years, you've done above that. Can you just talk, Jim, maybe to the factors that would influence your decision to bring that down toward the 90% to 100%? Or keep it up somewhere well above that 100% level? I mean, what are the some of the factors? I assume M&A would be -- opportunities would be part of that, share price would be part of that. But can you speak to that in a little bit more depth, please?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I think to the point you referenced, there are always a number of factors and you go into a year and not knowing exactly what all those factors are and how the environment is. So we -- and which is actually is quite good is that I think very few firms target at the beginning of the year to return 90% to 100% of their earnings.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No doubt.","James M. Cracchiolo","And so we're doing that, even not knowing exactly how the environment plays out. But as you saw in the past number of years, we've increased that over the year based upon those various circumstances. So if there aren't any real good deals that we want to execute on, we up that buyback. If the market gives us even more opportunity, depending on certain circumstances, we can increase the buyback there as well. So we sort of regulate that. We are still committed to returning strongly to shareholders. We will evaluate again a dividend increase as we always do in the first part of this year. So it's a combination of factors, but I think the positive should be that we're probably one of the highest in targeting that at the beginning of the year based on the total of the earnings, and then we regulate it from there.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Totally appreciate that. And then if I can sneak one more quick one in for Walter. If I look at the annuity segment, I generally see declining account values in both the VA and fixed annuity blocks. So in the face of that headwind, is it reasonable for us to expect any real earnings growth from this segment off of the sort of core 2014 results? I think the core number is about $590 million. It seems spreads are about as wide as we can expect, and with the headwind of lower long-term rates, I'm just wondering, without, of course, Walter, giving any specific guidance, directionally, how should we think about this segment's earnings potential?","Walter S. Berman","I think it's certainly with the headwinds that you talked about, it will be muted, especially if you look at facing the fixed annuities coming out of lapse, coming out of surrender. So you would see that we've made the adjustments on the rate, but we will see increased lapses there. And so I would say, yes, it would certainly be less robust, with the factors you referred to.","Operator","And our next question comes from Erik Bass from Citigroup.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, first on Advice & Wealth. You mentioned a 19% margin for the franchisee channel this quarter, which, I think, is higher than even you were talking about at Investor Day of last year. Do you still see additional upside to this margin excluding any benefit from higher interest rates?","Walter S. Berman","Yes. As we talked about, certainly, as we vintage on the employee channel and certainly, productivity and improve that, we do. If you look at the 2 models, certainly, from that standpoint, it would -- we see employee channel increasing, and it has doubled from last year as we look. And we have seen improvement, and I do anticipate some improvement. But again, interest rate is certainly a factor, and certainly market will influence, but we are getting good productivity improvement.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But you still see from the point that the 19% can stay at this level or move slightly higher even without rates?","Walter S. Berman","Again, yes, I do. As -- again, we're talking environmental and other things, yes. But those into consideration, yes, we are making progress.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then is there any sensitivity that you can provide for how changes in interest rate assumptions, or if we are in a low for long environment would affect your balance sheet? Know you obviously do the annual review in the third quarter, but kind of any help in terms of sensitivities to your, I guess, long-term rate assumptions would be helpful?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, I think it's from the standpoint, again, on it's not so much the long-term rate. It's going to be the grading. And so it's a start point where you are then the grading from there, which will be the implication. I think the long-term rate, again, we think are -- we're using is appropriate. But we will then have to assess, just like we will now, the start point of where the rate is. And then, what we do anticipate the long-term grading, depending on which product you're looking at. Obviously, the long-term care has a very long window. Others have less. So and -- so that would be the balance sheet impact. The other thing is the reinvestment, returning over, most of about 25% a year. So as we reinvest, that's going to have a bit of a drag on it.","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Got it. And can you just remind us what was the change you made in the third quarter of 2014?","Walter S. Berman","The change from what standpoint?","Erik James Bass - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Sorry, for the interest rate assumption that drove kind of the modest charge that you have in the third quarter?","Walter S. Berman","What we did is basically we reset it, obviously, to the June rate. And then we just basically readjusted the grading and slowed it down. We kept the long-term rate the same, but we readjusted down, which, of course, it did not hit the original target we thought that we set in 2013. So we did take that unlocking. And then we just graded it up basically more looking at, from our standpoint, the situation, which was a little slower on grading up.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Jim, a couple questions on the asset management business, and just a quick follow-up for Walt after. So when I think about the rebranding initiative between Columbia and Threadneedle and you guys will kind of try to go out and market it is one, help me understand, I guess, a little bit what kind of doors does this sort of approach open up relative to what you guys were doing before? What kind of new client pools are you targeting with that? And maybe just some sort of a tangible way to illustrate how maybe 1 plus 1 could equal 3 in that scenario, if that's the case?","James M. Cracchiolo","So we've made a number of changes over the last 1.5 years or so, really, to put together a number of capabilities between the Threadneedle business and Columbia and put together both core products that are managed by the capabilities of both to how we're even doing asset allocation on a global basis and some of the managed type of activities we're doing and the new solutions that we're launching. So very clearly, there's the underlying activities that already made some changes to what we're doing today and how we're doing it, including the ability to share research, the ability to use some of the capabilities of Threadneedle and Columbia combined to build various portfolios and global products. So the combination of the brand gives us an ability, a further ability, to market our products across borders. So today, we're already selling Columbia funds as part of Threadneedle and Threadneedle as part of Columbia. But particularly, as I think about -- as an example, I'll give you the first one, institutional. To go to market better as a combined firm makes it easier to work with global clients. It gives us the ability to talk about more of those products using our institutional sales force together. It also gives us the ability to use the combined resources for products that we're putting in the market and to talk about that in a much more appropriate way. So we do see good opportunity coming from the combination, but we did a lot of work behind the brand already, and we will do continued more work to really leverage the combined capabilities of the 2 firms. So we will launch this in the market in the spring more formally. Now the underlying for retail distribution in the U.S. or retail distribution in Threadneedle won't be as much severe -- significantly impacted. It'll start more from a global positioning, an institutional basis and then, over time, take shape and form in the retail segments.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful. And then the recent product launch you guys announced with Blackstone, internal looks pretty interesting given all the kind of chatter around retail liquid alts in the space. Help us understand, I guess, a little bit how this product will be managed and how it will be marketed to clients. And I guess, how long do you think it requires for us to see some sort of traction from an asset gathering perspective? Is that kind of like you're typical, you seed it and then you market it, and a couple years down the road, so it's going to be a few of years until we see some meaningful progress here? Or could that be done sooner?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, we do believe that there is an appetite for this type of product in the retail space today. So it's more of a convenience of a traditional mutual fund with daily liquidity and multiple share classes that will give investors access to Blackstone's Advice multi-strategy perspective that leverage in their underlying hedge fund advisers that they select. And it will combine that with alternative beta strategies and nontraditional assets, including commodities, REITs, inflation linked bonds, private equity managed by Columbia. So the combination, we think, of the types of capabilities that we're bringing to bear put into a wrapper of a retail fund with daily liquidity, we think, will have some appetite as advisors look to diversify their portfolios and get some alternative means based on the market conditions. So I think it gives them a greater access to these alternative type of strategies. It has the combination of benefits of the 2 strong firms and the diversification that they can get from alternatives. So we think it will take shape. We don't think it's something that will wait to see flows over the long period of time. We think there's an appetite there over the course of the year. And hopefully, later in the year, we'll be able to report some of the sales that we're seeing from the product.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And just a follow-up to that one, how are the economics in this product work? So what's kind of the fee split or the sub-advisory fee that goes to Blackstone?","James M. Cracchiolo","Well, I think, again, based on the combination of the fund and the makeup, there is a fee structure for the -- as part of the alternative side that will go to Blackstone, and then, there's a fee for the other part of that managed fund that we share, so that we have. And so there's a sharing, truly, of the fee structure underneath it. Of course, with the combination and being on the alternative side, there is a higher fee for that type of product than the normal mutual fund fee.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That sounds great. And then, Walter, just one for you, quick, on the -- when we think about the currency fluctuations over the course of last quarter and certainly, continued dollar strength so far in '15. When I think about Ameriprise holistically as an enterprise, from a pretax income perspective, is it fair to assume you guys are pretty currency neutral given expenses and revenues from Threadneedle, obviously, and pounds?","Walter S. Berman","Well, I would say, it's current yes [ph] because obviously, we make a profit. So we'll take a translation there, if that's what you're referring. That's with the translation. That is the majority of the exposures in -- is out of the U.K. Obviously, there are some offsets, but it is certainly -- it would impact a PTI asset.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Any sense on the sensitivity if it does? So like if the dollar strengthened [indiscernible]","Walter S. Berman","Well, the dollar strengthening is, again -- the pound is moved from -- last year, it was somewhere in the $1.60s and now it's in the $1.50s. So on that basis, it -- I think we talked about last year, it has impacts that are certainly manageable at this -- it's in the, I would say, on the translation basis, it's probably in the $10 million, $15 million range if you drop the -- when you dropped it down. Actually, on that drop, you're probably talking in, say, around $20 million.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Krueger from KBW.","Ryan Krueger - KBW LLC","First, I had a follow-up on the rebranding of Colombia and Threadneedle. I certainly understand the long-term rationale and the benefits that they could have. But in the shorter term, should we expect any meaningful costs associated with that rebranding over the next few quarters?","James M. Cracchiolo","There'll be and there were some incremental cost in the fourth quarter. There'll be some incremental cost in the first quarter this year. But we're not looking at real sizable amounts here. What we are doing is repurposing some of our current marketing and branding costs for the new brand, but there'll be some incremental as you change the various materials and signage and some other aspects of it. So it's something that we think is very manageable, but it will increase, of course, slightly based upon the rebranding. But again, as I said, we think it's the right thing to do that can be leveraged over time.","Ryan Krueger - KBW LLC","Got it. Okay. And then, on -- given the, I guess, the lower interest, lower long-term interest rate environment we're in today, do you have any updated sensitivities you can give us in terms of the earnings headwind that, that gives you in the fixed Annuity and Protection businesses?","Walter S. Berman","Sure. So let me break it out. The first one, obviously, is going to be on DAC. And when we set our DAC rates, the rates back down were in the $250 million range. Now you -- the start point is in $170 million as we look at, and we are grading up. So that's going to be one impact we are constantly monitoring and so that will have a noncash impact. When we look at locking in the third quarter or if we see this situation, we have to unlock earlier. As it relates to the long-term book with the fixed annuities, it is more on the -- we reset on the guaranteed minimum rates and so this space is just the earning rate, and the earning rates on both that and life and health would be impacted because of the duration of the situation as we turn it over. So like I said, it's about 20%, 25%. And on that basis, you're talking about 40, 50 basis points in differential as we look at it on average as you go through it. So that's the sort of activity levels they see. The numbers themselves are manageable. It's just we are defensive, and in a defensive posture there, and it will have an impact, but the impact is manageable than the number. But it...","Ryan Krueger - KBW LLC","Okay. And then last one on the tax rate. You gave the 26% to 28% tax rate guidance for 2015. As we think about the mix of your earnings shifting over time, specifically your -- seems to have a lower contribution from variable annuities in the DRD benefits that, that provides you. Would you expect your tax rate over a longer period of time to gradually rise as a result of the mix shift?","Walter S. Berman","In the current legislation, that's exactly what happens. We also are deriving the DRD benefits, as you saw. But again, the tax rate's associated with the AWM business and the asset management business don't have some of the benefits that are derived, so therefore, they're at the more marginal, the statutory rate. So yes, it will erode, but again, it's good profitability.","Operator","And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Deutsche Bank.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I want to go back to the P&C results or the Auto results, specifically. And I guess, one question I still have is, looking at PIS count growth, why are we seeing growth, which I think is above industry average, while there's still turmoil and while you're still kind of trying to clean up the claims experience and the previous legacy premiums?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay. So first of all, we did -- we do have good growth. We actually have very strong growth in the home side of it. The Auto side has slowed down a little bit. We've made some adjustments over the course. We'll probably adjust a bit more as we go through and put in some of the tighter underwriting and repricing in certain areas. But we did experience some good growth based upon the expansion on some of our channel activity in the affinity area. So it's one of the things that we're closely monitoring right now. We have slowed down a bit of that growth. We might slow it a little more in certain sections where we have experienced some of the blip-up in the exposure. But we do feel like we can continue to add good new clients based upon the relationships that we have, we just got to be -- we're just going to be a little tighter in that regard.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then going back to the Advice & Wealth Management. There was an industry publication, I think, that spoke of Ameriprise as the second largest independent broker by commissions from Alternative Investments sold. I think somebody counted about 20% the segment's total commissions earned coming from Alternative Investments. And just given some of the problems that some of your peers have faced with the high-commission product, I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk about kind of what percentage of the alternative investment commissions come from high-commission products?","Walter S. Berman","Well, right now, it is a small percentage of, obviously, our revenue and profitability. But again, it's coming from REITs, and we've talked about, from our standpoint, it's -- that we have not suffered the same situations, obviously, as certainly looking at the quality and what we bring on and our, basically, compliance processes. So with -- from that standpoint, it is important part of the solution set with our clientele and certainly go through a very elaborate due diligence process to ensure that. And like I said, the revenue contributions is under 5%, it's like 3%. So it's an important solution area and it adds value from that standpoint, and it's about the 3% range.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. And I think if you're talking about, like, the REIT area, it's only a couple percent in our total mix of business across the firm. I mean, of course, we have more alternatives that we offer from hedge funds to other types of activities, commodities, various things like that. But I think if you're referencing more of REITs, it's only a couple percent.","Yaron Kinar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And quick numbers question. I may have missed it, I apologize. On the $20 billion of brokerage cash balances, can you tell us what the current yield is on those?","James M. Cracchiolo","Around 20 basis points.","Operator","And our next question comes from Suneet Kamath from UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So Walter, in your prepared remarks on Protection, you talked about long-term care and the fact that you're conducting, I think, what you characterize as a non-routine review. Can you just go on to a little more detail in terms of what exactly you will be reviewing? Is it the reserve level? Is it gap versus stat? I mean, just any more color on that would be helpful.","Walter S. Berman","Yes. I think what we're doing right now, we're in contact with Genworth as it relates to their announcements and other things like that because they do all the claims and the administration aspect. They feed the information to us. And obviously, we do -- we're aligned on that information. We certainly are trying to do our own checks on it. But we, based on their reviews, we're cooperating with them to get really the performance aspects they've seen, both from claims and other -- to revalidate. As they looked at what they evaluated for their block, how that is applicable to ours, and so we are working with them just to get the additional information as it allows us to do the actuarial assessment.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But I guess, how should we be thinking about this in terms of a potential risk to the company? I mean, is it that you might have to boost reserves because Genworth is telling you that they're seeing more aggressive claims or utilization? Or -- I just want to get a sense of what the risk factor is.","Walter S. Berman","Okay. I understand that. Yes, we think the risk factor is actually very contained because, again, it's small overall. But the reality is we have our own checks and we've been looking at it from our standpoint. There's different characteristics of our block versus theirs. So we do believe this is a precautionary element to make sure that we are aligned. Again, they're making a major announcement that they did make some changes to their actual assumptions. We felt it was prudent to work with them to get that applicability to our block. They did not do it. And again, it's our block and their block. It's a shared block. So it is really precautionary, but we believe it's very containable, and it's not a significant amount, if any.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is that something that we're going to learn about sort of in 1Q results because that'll be after they put out their fourth quarter reserve review?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, we're obviously dependent on their time, effort and everything, but yes, we are hoping to have that within that timeframe.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then, I guess, for Jim on the retail flows at Columbia, I mean, you've mentioned that it's work in progress and there's all sorts of -- I think you used the word traction that you're gaining. It's just really hard to see from the upside how the strategy is progressing. So is there any more color that you can give us in terms of what is exactly changing there, what's different this time and why we should have some comfort that the flows can start to turn positive?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, I wouldn't think labeling it to get more comfort. I think what we have been saying and what we've actually been seeing is this: we will continue to have some of the type of outflows from some of the things that we've mentioned to you. So as an example, when we made all the pricing changes in the RIA channel, we experienced more of those outflows. That's starting to slow and turn around, and we're starting to see some pickup in the inflow side. For the ex-parent, we experienced more of that, even in retail, initially as things were changed, and now that starting to slow. It'll still be an outflow, but not as material as it was. And we think we can get some new product out there, hopefully, over time, I think, in regard to the intermediary channels, we're actually seeing some pick-up in a few of the areas as we get better penetration in some of the channels and get on some of the platforms. Having said that, I think it's been lumpy. I mean, we saw nice improvement in October and November. We thought it would actually show positive, and then December was a little rough month, I think, for the industry. From a perspective, we still experienced some additional outflows in a particular large fund that we had in the DCO channel that actually sort of masks some of the improvements for some of the other product across the other channels. So I think with the changes we continue to make with the new leadership we have in there, with how we're revamping the way we go to market with our product, with the wholesaling, with the disciplines we're putting in place, we're hoping that we can gain traction with more of our product across more of the channels in 2015. Of course, there's no guarantee. There's market environment. There's -- it is what the consumer is or the intermediary is looking based on market conditions. But we think we have enough good product. We think that we have a good wholesaling capability and platform that we're applying better. We think that we're going to bring product to the market better to talk about what that is and what the solution is and what we can provide. There are some new solutions. We're coming out, like our CARA Fund that I mentioned to you, which is a risk parity allocation fund that we think can take some space. So I think it's going to be a number of things that we can do to gain. But we're still going to experience some of the outflows from some of the ex-parent ongoing, from some of the sub-advisor, from one of the particular large funds we have that will continue to bleed a little bit until we get that fully -- more fully turned around and get some other product in the channel. So I'm not sitting here to predict quarter-by-quarter, but I do feel that we can gain some greater traction. I think Europe can come back again. I think, again, it was in strong inflows. We got hit with a loss of a PM last year, but that has stemmed the tide there. Actually, the U.K., where we lost the PM, that has actually turned around pretty quickly for us. So I think with the ECB doing what they do, that can sort of turn around people's appetite back in Europe. So we'll see. But I got more high hopes for this year, moving better in the trajectory. I can't predict, but hopefully, we'll apply more time and attention and hopefully, we'll get some better results.","Operator","And our last question comes from Tom Gallagher from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A few questions on your Advice & Wealth business. The -- so I guess, the franchisee advisor story has been a really good one. Just want to understand a little about the outlook as you see it. How is the recruiting environment right now? Are you still -- would you still expect to grow that channel over the next year or so? I noticed a little bit of a tick down there in terms of number of franchisee advisors. That's question #1. And then, I guess, the margin, Walter, I think you had said the margin in that channel for this quarter was 19%, which is obviously a pretty robust number. Can you comment a bit about when you are hiring, making the new hires of the experienced advisors, what is sort of the marginal margin you're seeing there? Is it above or below that 19% level?","James M. Cracchiolo","So let me start with the overall channel, then we'll talk to the margin. Very clearly, we feel very good about our franchise channel and the growth of the productivity of that channel. Now part of it that you're looking at when you just look at the number per se is there is a level of even consolidation going on in our own channel. As advisors hit a certain points in time, they actually don't want to be running the practice as they continue to age at a certain level. And so what they do is make arrangements with other advisors, they sell their practice and then they transition from an advisor to an assistant and then ultimately retire. And we have some of that going on in our channel across the nation that we sort of help foster and develop. So part of our attrition, or so to speak, that we report is part of that activity going on. The assets don't leave. The clients don't leave. But the number on the headcount does adjust. In addition to that, we also have assistants that advisors bring in as junior players in their practice, licensed practitioners, et cetera. And sometimes there is a higher rotation of those people, just like we do, when we bring in new people that we're training and developing in the employee channel. And so part of that turnover is also in those sort of numbers. But we feel that the productivity remains in the channel. The asset growth is good and strong, and we feel very good about that channel continuing to be a growing part of the total. In addition to that, we do have the employee channel. Again, with that same adjustments that are occurring, we have much more productivity in the channel. We're bringing in good people that have much higher productivity than the people who are leaving or left. And the pipeline, so the first part of your question that you asked, is very good. We saw it over the third and fourth quarter. We're bringing in high-quality people that are actually of higher productivities than even previous quarters. And we see that occurring both in the franchise and the employee channel. So we feel like we can continue to recruit on an ongoing basis and see quality people. Walter?","Walter S. Berman","Yes, on the second question. From the standpoint of the marginal contribution, from a PTI standpoint, for the experienced advisors in the franchise and actually in the employee channel are higher than, obviously, the 19% and our current margin employee channel. So yes, that is accreting on the -- based on the correlated expenses that we associated with that -- with bringing on experienced advisors.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And so, Walter, from just order of magnitude, so -- and Jim pointed out that the new hires in the franchisee channel are actually more productive than the average advisor. What type of margin are you seeing for those new hires, let's say, by the end of the first year? Is it -- if the average for that channel is 19%, is it 25%, is it 30%? I just want to get a sense for the grade-in of that and how -- what kind of earnings pick you get as you hire people?","James M. Cracchiolo","So Tom, let me correct that. I think we didn't say -- for instance, in the franchise channel, we're bringing in good people but we have good strong margins, very high productivity in the franchise. So the people we're bringing in aren't necessarily of even higher margin than that. I think they're consistent with the type of productivity that we have in the channel. In the employee channel, what I did say is the people we are bringing in have higher productivities and will, over time, add to that margin and will be higher than the average margin. But as Walter said, a year ago, that margin was in the low single digits. We ended last year with it being now about 10% or so. And as we add even more productive people and utilize the capacity we have in the employee channel for better productive people, that margin will continue to accrete.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. So it's really the employer channel that you're saying is higher, okay.","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. Right. And then the franchisee channel, just as we continue to bring in good client flows and good productivity and our advisor productivity increases, then that will help with the margin there because that's a very large channel. It's a very productive channel. Most of that will come from the productivity improvements continuing in that channel and the use of some of our capabilities to help them do that.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Understood. And then -- and just one last one on the Property Casualty business. Can you quantify -- based on the changes that you expect to make, can you give us a little bit of quantification what are the levels of rate you're actually submitting for to regulators in that business? So are we looking at double-digit rate? Or some -- any quantification you can give there? And would you expect that book to shrink as you implement the changes?","Walter S. Berman","Number one, if we reinstate [ph], again, depending on both -- as we do the price risk assessment and then you deal with the states that -- within theirs, that we will certainly -- we are looking then to get that ratio. As we have had -- we filed in '14, we had rate increases on Auto of close to 3%. And this is now being evaluated state-by-state. We're using the models that we're bringing up. So the rate increases are going to be a very off. So I couldn't really give you an average as it relates to, because you're getting into weighting again to everything from that standpoint. So the reality on shrinking the book, I don't think the book is going to shrink. I think we're going to more intelligently manage through the application of the sophisticated models and the other things that we do from an operational standpoint and just extract the better pricing risk return from it. So that takes time, as Jim said. It just doesn't -- it takes time to work through, both the analytics as we roll it, the filings and then the realization of it.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I would hope your rate is going to be significantly above 3% if we're thinking about '15 [indiscernible]","Walter S. Berman","I only gave you 2014. I gave you price in '14. I didn't say what was going to happen in '15.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But no, can you give us any indication? Or is it too early?","Walter S. Berman","It's too -- because they basically just started through rolling the stage now, and those will progress and they're focusing on Auto and then rolling through on Home. So I can't give you, really, the rate increases that will take place because they have to do the analytics for each one and then evaluate it on that basis, both looking at the new and then the existing block.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Alicia Charity. You may begin.","Alicia Charity","Thank you, and good morning. Welcome to Ameriprise Financial\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings call. On the call with me today are Jim Cracchiolo, Chairman and CEO; and Walter Berman, Chief Financial Officer. Following their remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.","During the call, you will hear references to various non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide insight into the company\u2019s operations. Reconciliation of the non-GAAP numbers to the respective GAAP numbers can be found in today\u2019s materials on our website.

We undertake no obligation to update publicly or to revise these forward-looking statements.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James M. Cracchiolo","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings discussion. I'll begin by giving you my perspective on the quarter and Walter will cover more of the numbers, then we'd take your questions. Let's get started.","For the quarter on an operating basis, net revenues were up 6% to $2.6 billion. Earnings were $367 million, up 19%, with earnings per share of $1.71, up 31%. And return on equity increased to 16.2%.","Equity market appreciation and increased client activity drove top line growth in the quarter, and we're managing interest-rate headwinds through reengineering initiatives and keeping expenses tight. I feel good about the underlying business fundamentals and our results overall.","There are a few moving pieces impacting earnings that we highlighted and Walter will cover it in more detail.","Results in our Advice & Wealth Management business led the way, it was a very good quarter for the business. In Asset Management, we continue to make progress growing our earnings, while in annuities and protection, the businesses are performing in line with our expectations when you adjust for the items noted. We also continue to benefit from our balance sheet strength and capital management, key points of differentiation for Ameriprise. We devoted $446 million in the quarter to share repurchases and dividends.","Now, let's review our segment performance starting with Advice & Wealth Management where we're generating strong earnings growth and good profitability. For the quarter, revenues were up 11%, reflecting both higher asset levels and a pickup in client activity. Total retail client assets of $353 billion were a new high, aided by market appreciation and very strong client net inflows.","Wrap net inflows of $2.1 billion were up more than 50% from a year ago. In each of the past 4 quarters, we generated strong wrap net inflows with $9.6 billion of total inflows for the year, which helped raise our wrap assets under management to $125 billion.","Clients also added to their cash positions, which may have reflected the uncertainty in the marketplace with the election and potential tax changes. At year end, brokerage cash balances reached $19 billion, up 20% from the third quarter. As clients gain confidence, I would expect they will reallocate a portion of these assets to other products in 2013.","In addition to strong client flows, we continue to track experienced and productive advisors to Ameriprise. In the quarter, 68 productive advisors joined the firm. In fact, the average productivity of the advisors who joined us in the quarter was about 40% higher than those who joined us in the first quarter of 2011.","In terms of total advisor productivity, operating net revenue per advisor increased by double digits from a year ago. We continue to invest in our brand in the fourth quarter. As we enter 2013, we just launched a new series of advertisements with Tommy Lee Jones that speak about Ameriprise and what consumers need to do to create a confident retirement.","The expenses of our ad campaign are consistent with last year and are up a bit sequentially from the third quarter, as we told you. We offset the fourth quarter advertising expenses by reducing expenses as part of our conversion to our new brokerage platform, and that expense improvement will continue through the first part of the year. Overall, we're managing expenses tightly and we'll continue to do so.","In fact, I should note that the results we delivered in the quarter reflected lower revenue in earnings because of our decision to discontinue our banking operations. That work is now complete. In fact, I want to inform you that we learned yesterday afternoon that we have been granted regulatory approval to transition the bank to a national trust institution.","In terms of segment profitability, pretax operating margin was strong at 11.8% compared to 9.2% a year ago. If you exclude the impact of the bank transition and the 2 months of lost earnings, segment operating margin would have been above 13% for the quarter, and that's including managing headwinds from low interest rates.","All in all, it was a very good quarter for our advisory business. We have the right strategies in place and we continue to make good progress. Now, let's move to asset management.","Total assets under management for the segment were $455 billion, up 5% with Threadneedle and market appreciation driving asset growth. Revenues were up both from a year ago and sequentially, even when excluding performance fees from all periods. We're benefiting from revenue reengineering initiatives we have put in place. We're also generating solid profitability improvement. In terms of margin, adjusted net pretax operating margin was 33.6% for the quarter compared to 31.4% a year ago. We continue to deliver strong investment performance across 1-, 3- and 5-year time frames in asset-weighted and equal-weighted categories in both equities and fixed income.","At quarter end, 51 Columbia funds were rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar and 60 funds at Threadneedle. Overall, we experienced $3.9 billion of net outflows in the quarter driven by outflows in institutional portfolios. Retail flows were essentially flat with strong flows at Threadneedle offset by outflows at Columbia.","As we start the year, we're starting to see improved flows as consumers have started to come back into the market. While it's too early to characterize the quarter, we're seeing positive initial signs. We will remain focused on continuing to generate consistent competitive investment performance.","In addition, we are bringing a very strong focus to execute against our plans to capture distribution opportunities for both retail and institutional. We're also continuing to develop new and enhanced products. Columbia and Threadneedle are collaborating to take advantage of some of the larger global opportunities we see in the marketplace.","Now, I'll move on to annuities and protection. Let's start with annuities. We had a good book of business and we continue to manage risk effectively. As you know, we introduced a new variable annuity product in the second quarter of last year and has taken a number of months for our advisors to acclimate to the new product. In the quarter, variable annuity sales started to pick up to more normal levels. Overall, variable annuities were in net outflows due to our decision to close outside distribution.","On the fixed side, we have a good block of business. That said, we're not adding to it given the current rate environment. Overall, the business is performing in line with our expectations and we continue to focus on continuing to balance client benefits with attractive risk-adjusted returns consistent with our strategy.","Now let\u2019s turn to protection, which you saw was impacted by weather-related losses. Life and health insurance earnings reflected good claims experience and lower expenses. In terms of metrics, we're seeing good pickup in cash sales with our index Universal Life product as the main driver of the growth. We also enhanced our variable Universal Life product and we're starting to see increased sales as people are becoming more confident in the equity markets.","In Auto and Home, we continue to see good growth in policies and premiums. As I mentioned, we absorbed the loss related to Superstorm Sandy and we also increased reserves related to higher auto claims severity, which is consistent with what others in the industry are experiencing. I feel good about the outlook for the business.","I'd like to close by reinforcing the benefits or our ability to generate strong free cash flow, which gives us flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to drive ROE and EPS growth.","For example, for the year, we dedicated more than $1.3 billion to share repurchases and increased our dividends paid per common share by 64%, all while maintaining our excess capital position. In total, we returned more than 130% of our operating earnings to shareholders. And we're targeting to return the majority of annual earnings and the capital we freed up from the bank to shareholders going forward.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Walter to go through the quarter in more detail. Walter?","Walter S. Berman","Thank you, Jim. Ameriprise had a solid fourth quarter with operating EPS of $1.71, up 31% versus last year. This was driven by growth in our core business and continued expense discipline. We also returned almost $450 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter, bringing our total return during the year to $1.7 billion.","I would like to provide additional context relating to some unusual items we had in the quarter which we detailed in our earnings release. Within $1.71 of operating EPS, we had several favorable items totaling $0.25, including a variable annuity living benefit liability model revision that resulted in reserve release, a settlement with a third-party service provider and a review of our deferred tax balance that reduced our tax expense relating to prior periods.","In addition to these disclosed items, we had other non-repeating items which had a net negative impact of about $0.05 at the Ameriprise level. These included higher expenses related to: an incremental year-end compensation true up; an elevated severance expenses, partially offset by lower taxes. Adjusting for those items, our normalized performance was $1.51 per share.","Turning to Slide 5. Operating net revenues were $2.6 billion, up 6% from a year ago. Led by 11% growth in Advice & Wealth Management with only 1 month of bank revenues and 5% growth in asset management.","Revenue growth from protection and annuities was in line with our expectations, as we continue to shift our earnings mix to lower capital-intense businesses.","Turning to pretax operating earnings. We also had good growth of 8% over last year in the face of the low-rate environment. As was revenues, we had excellent 43% growth in Advice & Wealth Management even with lower bank earnings, as well as good Asset Management profitability. This has driven a shift in our business mix to 50% of earnings coming from our less capital-intense businesses versus 43% from those businesses in the fourth quarter last year.","You saw elevated Auto and Home cat losses in the quarter from Sandy, which dampened otherwise good results in the protection segment. Let's move on to the segment discussions.","Advice & Wealth Management business performed well in the period and throughout 2012 as we executed on our strategy to improve productivity, add experienced advisors and invest in technology and our brand. Advisor productivity increased 11% to $103,000 from high client transaction levels, which included increased sales of direct alternative investments and client net inflows. Cash balance increased in the quarter was nearly $19 billion in brokerage cash and we are effectively positioned for rates eventually rising. We remained focused on managing expenses.","The brokerage platform conversion is winding down and we will determine how much of that will be reinvested in growth initiatives or fall to the bottom line. Pre-tax op earnings [ph] were up 43% to $119 million, as we had a very strong quarter compared to last year. We also completed our bank transition in the quarter. Ceased bank operations and received D registration approval.","We delivered a good 11.8% margin in the quarter and we estimate the margin would've been over 13% if we had not exited the bank. Turning to asset management on the next slide.","We had good earnings of $141 million, up 11% over last year. Last year's results included the favorable impact from a CDO liquidation. Revenues were up 5% from market appreciation, revenue reengineering and performance fees, which was similar to third quarter levels. Also in this, was pressure from prior-period outflows. Expenses were up 4% from the impact of market appreciation on distribution and sub advice fees, as well as performance fee-related compensation. In 2013, we will continue to focus on both revenue and expense reengineering opportunities as well as profitable net flow growth.","Importantly, investment performance of both Columbia and Threadneedle continue to be strong. Looking more closely at flows on an aggregate basis, we had $3.9 billion of outflows this quarter. Overall, we had higher institutional outflows in the quarter and retail was essentially flat on a global basis.","Strong retail inflows of over $1 billion at Threadneedle were offset by outflows at Columbia. In retail and mutual funds, we saw similar trends to others in the industry, including activity in the last part of the quarter influenced by investors' desire to lock in capital gains in advance of anticipated tax changes. We will also continue to see outflows in the third party sub advice assets and in devaluing restructuring fund.","Lastly, we were impacted by portfolio rebalancing, which contributed to both retail and institutional outflows in the quarter. Institutional outflows of $3.3 billion were largely driven by low-margin legacy insurance assets of $1.2 billion at Threadneedle and $400 million at Columbia, as well as the portfolio rebalancing and model changes I just mentioned. We are taking steps to add new products to these platforms to help us retain these assets as these trends continue.","Looking into 2013, we have a good institutional pipeline and continue to win mandates. However, I would like to mention that we expect to see about $900 million of additional outflows from Zurich in the first quarter associated with a mandate in Japan.","Turning to annuities. Pretax operating earnings were $171 million, up 4%, which was in line with our expectations. Variable annuity operating earnings were $129 million, including the $43 million favorable model adjustment I described earlier and a $14 million lower impact from mean [ph] reversion compared to a year ago.","Earnings in the quarter were also impacted by higher DAC amortization and increased SOP reserve funding related to our third quarter unlocking, which was driven by the low interest rate environment. We expect these items will continue to impact variable annuity results in 2013 until we complete our annual unlocking process in the third quarter of 2013.","In the fourth quarter of 2011, results include the favorable impact of markets' unreserved funding and model changes. As a reminder, we have taken multiple steps to derisk the variable annuity book, including exiting third-party distribution several years ago and more recently, introducing a managed volatility product.","In the quarter, we saw improving trends from our managed volatility product and we are on schedule to launch additional investment options for it in the first half of this year. In fixed annuities, operating earnings declined $4 million, which includes a $17 million impact from low interest rates and an $8 million unfavorable reserve adjustment last year.","The pressure from low interest rates will continue to impact the fixed annuity block into 2013. However, we have flexibility to reset rates on a large 5-year guarantee block, beginning at the end of 2013 and continuing to early 2014.","Operating pretax earnings in the protection segment was $93 million, down $20 million from a year ago. The strong results in our life and health business were offset by the disclosed cat losses and reserved strengthening in Auto and Home. Life and health earnings increased 8%, driven by favorable claim experience, as well as a return to a more normalized loss ratio and long-term care. In recent years, we, like the industry, experienced slower variable Universal Life sales. However, we are now gaining good traction in sales of index Universal Life and now refresh a variable Universal Life product.","Auto and Home continue to have strong policy growth, but earnings were impacted by $20 million from Sandy as well as higher reserves from our order book due to increased severity trends in the industry. Given all the moving pieces in the corporate segment, I think it will be helpful to walk through results.","As you can see on Slide 11, we had an $81 million net expense driven by year-end compensation related true ups and higher severance expenses, as well as lower investment income related to the bank transaction in the period. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact from the $15 million settlement with a third-party service provider. Capital return has been a strong point of differentiation for Ameriprise. Our business's mix shift to less capital-intense businesses, prudent risk management and capital flexibility enabled Ameriprise to consistently return capital to shareholders in a variety of interest rate and equity market environment. This lets us consistently grow EPS and return on equity in a variety of macro environments that could potentially pressure revenue growth, like sustained lower interest rates.","Looking ahead, we will continue to execute this strategy. In 2013, we expect to return approximately 100% of the earnings to shareholders. In addition to that, we will return approximately $375 million of capital that was freed up from exiting the bank.","During the fourth quarter, the holding company received $215 million from the bank transition and we expect to receive the remaining $125 million of capital that is still at the bank this quarter.","In closing, this quarter, our return on equity reached 16.2%, well within our targeted range, and we anticipate additional growth in ROE in 2013. With that, I will open up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have a question about the outlook for flows. In the first few weeks of these year, despite a big increase in retail equity fund flows for the industry, your flows, according to the industry data we track, remain negative. Yet, when I look at performance metrics, there's definitely continued improvement in there, and I know Ted spent a fair amount of time at the last Investor Day talking about some of the marketing initiatives. I was wondering if you could update us on the progress there? Because it seems like you're continuing to lose share. But I'm not sure why if your fund performance continues to improve the way it has?","James M. Cracchiolo","Okay, John, we have seen a bit of improvement in the first few weeks in sort of the net flows on some of the funds. We did experience an allocation change in one of our portfolios based on changing some various pricing that we have on one of the -- on the platforms, particularly, and we knew that would occur. Having said that, we haven't seen as strong a pickup yet in the equity flows as I think you're alluding to in the industry. Our fixed income comps has come back a bit from the fourth quarter, so we're hoping that there are some signs that this should start to pick up as our wholesalers and our institutional people have that focus. But I would say we're still a little short of what we saw as an initial pick up in the industry.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then I guess I have a more specific numbers question. And that's just whether -- I was just wondering whether you'd be willing to quantify for us what the total amount of higher compensation and severance and other sort of catch-up accruals were in the quarter? And how much of that you think we should expect to see on a go-forward basis? Because it does seem like some of that is permanent. And then also, and related to that, just what effective tax rate you're using to normalize to $1.51?","Walter S. Berman","Okay, so let me take the first part of that. Clearly, what happened and as we saw the improvement that took place in the fourth quarter, both in our performance and some of that driven by the market, we trued up. So that is really more of a concentration in the quarter as it relates to both the compensation at Columbia and compensation for the company. So on that amount, as we talked about it in my slides, you had the 2 elements which are netted down to about the $0.05, and that included the tax benefit offset by around $0.11. And the appreciable portion of that is really related to the compensation. Again, last year, or in the year prior to that, we didn't see that effect because obviously the markets were not improving in and we are pretty much spot on, on our normal accrual. But this one, we had to accrue up in the quarter.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. So Walter, is it fair to assume that maybe a couple of pennies of that $0.11 is something we ought to think about as an ongoing?","Walter S. Berman","It's spreading there. Because we know it because actually it's only [ph] above the normal that we would have, but there'll be some continuation of its spread throughout the next -- in 2013. Remember, there was certainly an appreciable amount of severances related to the actions that we took in the fourth quarter. It was above our normal.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the tax rate on the $1.51, is that in that 26% to 28% range?","Walter S. Berman","That tax rate in the $1.51 is a normalized tax rate for us. When you look at it, that was the adjustments we were trying to give you as you looked at the tax rate we had, which we reported in the 17% range and then as we normalize for the DRD and for the DTA discussion. So the tax rate you should be getting into is on a normalized basis, is in the range of around 25%, 26%.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to focus in on Jim's expense savings opportunity comments. How much of that should we be building in for 2013 on a gross basis? And then how much do you feel could fall to the bottom line? And I have a separate follow-up.","Walter S. Berman","On the expense saving, as we indicated, we have the expense saving, we have certainly evaluate opportunities with that. Right at this stage, we're assuming that some of that will fall in the bottom line. But the reality is it's there and we are planning on certainly investing for growth. But, so I can't give you the exact amounts because it really depends on the environment and how we see it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","If we were to isolate that into individual segments, where would we see most of it, potentially?","Walter S. Berman","Actually, it's concentrated -- it's throughout the company. But certainly, as we indicated, Advice and Wealth Management has a reasonable portion of that, and so does the Asset Management activity, both on the revenue range area and on their expense range area [ph], but there are other parts as it relates to the centralized services that spread throughout all of the segments.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I see, okay. And then separately on the personal lines, property cash, policy enforced growth of 9%, that's probably the highest of any of the personal lines companies we're aware of. Can you talk about what is leading you to gain that share?","Walter S. Berman","Well, I think as we have seen strong results. But certainly, in the base activity and as they certainly -- the progressive activity has been gaining. But there's been nothing unusual. It's certainly -- we've have not -- we've raised our prices. We've adjusted, as we told you so. So it's a strong performance on the part of the affinity groups and their penetration of it.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you talk about any of the particular successes you're having in affinity at this point?","Walter S. Berman","I think it's actually spreads out. I would say, certainly, as we are gaining more and more share within Progressive, that is certainly one of the elements.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm sorry, can you talk about that Progressive relationship then?","Walter S. Berman","Oh sure. That's a relationship that we entered with them to do the property side of it. It's certainly the home and rental. And that is something that is continuing to be built with them and that is achieving a good growth and profitability elements within the Auto and Home. And that was just something started last year, in homeowners and rental into 2011. Not homeowners -- it's homeowners, it's not auto, that's right. It's homeowners and rental.","Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division","For Progressive customers?","Walter S. Berman","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just to tackle the expense issue, I guess, one more time. Walter, would it be helpful, maybe, if to think about it on a consolidated basis. And let's just focus I guess on the G&A line. It feels like there are a bunch of things kind of sprinkled across different segments. But if you look at the, call it, like the 7 45 reported operating number for this quarter in G&A, if you were to isolate these one-time items, what do you think, I guess is the run rate G&A number for you guys? Assuming market's flat, activity's flat without making any other assumptions from a revenue perspective, how should we think about G&A for 2013?","Walter S. Berman","First, let me say, when you isolate out on the G&A line, we are actually -- versus last year, actually, a tad under. So we have certainly managed the expenses quite well. As we indicated, we certainly have, with the brokerage. And we have certainly, momentum coming into 2000 to -- as we reduced that expense line, and then we have to make the judgment. So you can look at that as a pretty good run rate. We'll have the normal inflationary elements that come in and certainly the investment opportunities and we see the growth. But if that's the base that you should really be coming off. And with certainly, the opportunity to reduce that a little as it relates to the brokerage. But again, we haven't made decisions where we're going to deploy.","Christopher J. Spahr - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, so sub 7 40 run rate?","Walter S. Berman","So it's 7 40 to begin out. We have inflation of the things coming in. And certainly, in different investment opportunities as it goes there. But that's a reasonable base to start with. But we have a tight focus on our expenses.","James M. Cracchiolo","Alex, what I would say is that we're going to continue to maintain a very tight expense focus. But we're continuing to invest. We will have volume increases as we grow certain businesses, adding advisors and doing such other things. We are continuing to upgrade some of our infrastructure across the company. So what I would say is we're going to maintain a tight expense focus. And depending on what happens in the year, from a revenue perspective, will depend on how we would fluctuate that. But even if things picked up, we still don't want expenses to start to grow again at an any accelerated rate. So I would say our going is to maintain sort of the levels that we have, make investments, use some of the savings like we have from the brokerage platform, et cetera, to continue to invest in certain other things like in AWM, bringing in more advisors on and doing some things like that in some of the advertising work. But I would say it's going to maintain the type of expense focus that we've had.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you, helpful. And then just another point I wanted to clarify, when you guys think about the buyback and well, I appreciating your comments on, I guess, the $375 million being the extra. And that's the capital is being kind of dividend up from bank. So is this fair to think about the quarterly pace being similar to what you've done, so kind of like $350 million-ish [ph] a quarter in buybacks? And in addition to that, we should incorporate the $375 million thinking for the full year?","Walter S. Berman","Okay, let me -- as I said, not to get into exact forecasting, but we said that we are going to target 100% -- approximately 100% of our earnings in 2013 plus the $375 million. So last year, obviously, we were way beyond that. And so I don't want to get into forecast of what our earnings are, but the issue is on that basis. I would think that the level that you saw in the quarter probably would be a reasonably good trend line.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, helpful. And when you guys talk about 100% of earnings, just to clarify, that's the buyback or the total payouts of the dividend and the buyback?","Walter S. Berman","Okay. As we relate to 100%, the 100% is really both the dividend and the buyback, and the $375 million goes on top of that.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Cool. Perfect. And then one business question for you guys. So I know Ted talked in the past about getting more presence on different distribution networks, and it's understandably, it's probably a slower-moving process. But can you give us an update on where you stand with major warehouses and how the product is being placed there? How the conversation is going with some of the gate keepers? And when we could actually see some movement on that front?","James M. Cracchiolo","We're gaining some traction in some of the intermediary platforms. There's 2 or 3 that we just got access to with the certain accounts that we think we'll fund, and there's a number of others in the pipeline. So this will take a bit more time to build, because it's a process to get reviewed and to look at those particular funds and see where they would fit in over time. But I think the team is starting to gain some traction, but this is going to be a build over the course of the year.","Operator","And our next question is from Jeff Schuman with KBW.","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow-up a bit more on the capital management. At your investor day, there was a fair amount of discussion about basically redeploying free cash flow plus the capital from the bank plus actually beginning to work off some of the $2 billion excess. And so I'm just trying to reconcile about the comments today. I guess, if you do 100% of earnings, that's a bit north of the free cash flow. Because free cash flow, I guess, is 90% of earnings. So is that a difference between 90% of earnings and 100% of earnings represent that sort of use of sort of a down payment of using excess capital? Or how are you thinking about drawing down the excess at this point?","Walter S. Berman","As I recall, we were indicating certainly, as a company, retaining on a permanent basis, the excess was not in our strategy and we would start then as we look at different opportunities, start evaluating returning it. I think we said, for 2013, specifically, we were targeting, at least at this stage, to do the 100%, end year cracked. And 90%, you get that differential on the 90% of base to free cash flow, but -- plus the $375 million, as at least our thinking as of this moment. And then we're evaluating if there's going to be anything else based upon circumstances as we look at different situations. But that, we want to give everybody at least that level that we will be going out with. So it's not really -- this is not like the start of the down payment in my opinion. It was just consistent with what we said at this FCM [ph].","Jeffrey R. Schuman - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, so you want to retain some flexibility that could be directed in a -- as you place this, as you go forward.","Walter S. Berman","That's correct.","Operator","We have our next question from Thomas Gallagher with Credit Suisse.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question on Advice & Wealth, Jim, you had mentioned a 20% cash balance build within the wrap accounts. Just curious how we should be thinking about that. Is that going to -- has that already constrained margins? Is there going to be a lag effect? And will we see some level of additional interest rate headwind from that? Any way you guys can frame how we should be thinking about that heading into '13, that's my first question.","James M. Cracchiolo","The increase we had is in our brokerage cash balances. And we had some very good client inflows over the course of the latter part of last year, overall. And you know, initially, as those inflows come in, they go into brokerage cash and then they get reallocated. We did see a bit of a pickup just from tax selling and other things at the end of the year. So my belief is that as people start to really think about where they are in the new year, that money will start to get reallocated. So a part of it was we got good client inflows, and part of it was from sort of the tax situation and the idea that people didn't know what exactly was going to happen due to the tax situation from the fiscal cliff. So I would say that we're probably thinking that, that will start to get reallocated into various portfolios as well as into certain products as we go into the new year here. So there's nothing on a drag basis. It could probably be positive as those assets are redeployed. Because as you know, the cash spread is lower now. If the cash rates go up over time, meaning on a short-term basis, that would be a big upside for us, particularly with the size of the cash balances we have. And so I think that would be more of a positive, depending on how you look at the interest rate if it stayed there, environment. If it didn't, that will go back to work and that would be positive as well.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's clear. So more of a revenue in margin tailwind when you think about relative to 4Q going forward?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. We think as clients become more confident -- I mean, the confidence, certainly, it didn't come off that way, but I think we start to see and we saw some money going back into the markets in January. So if that continues, yes, we would see this. But we did see a level of activity pick up in the fourth quarter, and I don't think that was all the due to tax selling, et cetera. People started to come back. We saw some of our variable annuities come back on stream as people got more familiar input. And even in our insurance sales and some of the equity product increased. So I think we're probably seeing a tilt towards that, and I think that cash will be utilized.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And then just a related question. Walter, any, any updated guidance for low interest rate sensitivity? Or is that, I think it was what, $50 million to $55 million? Was the drag expected for '13? Is that still intact or has that changed at all?","Walter S. Berman","It's actually changed a little on that basis. Should figure it's about in a $70 million, using that after tax, around $75 million.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","$75 million, got it. And then Walter, just on the corporate segment, I think looking at this year, we were thinking the normalized loss rate was $60 million to $65 million. Can you just comment how we should be thinking about that into '13?","Walter S. Berman","Okay. If you were looking coming off the fourth quarter, obviously, the fourth quarter had the items reflected as it relates to severance, which is in corporate. And then some of the performance compensation true up is there. So in that range, it's, I would say -- what was the number you used?","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","$60 million to $65 million?","Walter S. Berman","I would say it's a little higher than $60 million, $65 million, but not much. It's in that range, $65 million, $70 million.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And I guess lastly, the comment on the multi-year fixed annuity block that can get repriced in 2014, how big is that? And how much of an earnings pickup can that potentially represent as you look out into '14? And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, could that fully stop the bleeding at an additional low-rate earnings headwind heading into 2014? Or can you give some color on that?","James M. Cracchiolo","Sure. Okay, as you relate to, it's 2013 and '14. It starts in the tail end of '13 and '14. It will have an appreciable impact on it. It will basically, I would say, our impact would be probably cut by 70%, 80%. And that is something that, obviously, the fixed annuity block, I think is about $4 billion additional impact.","Thomas G. Gallagher - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. So you're talking about maybe getting an extra $50 million to $60 million of margin back or something along those lines? Is that about right?","Walter S. Berman","If you do the math on that, that's right. Because if you're doing the $75 million I told you and take them out, you'll leave like $15 million. So $60 million will come back, yes. That's probably right, yes. On a rate basis. Strictly on a rate -- right?","Operator","And now we have a question from John Hall with Wells Fargo Securities.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I've got 2 questions. Real quickly on the bank, I was wondering who provided the approval for the deregistration. And just -- what will the timeframe between applying for the deregistration and actually receiving it?","James M. Cracchiolo","Again, I'm not going to -- it's interesting, the OCC and the Fed, I think they work in conjunction. I can't really give you the specifics. I think it's probably -- the final came out of the Fed. But I -- we'll verify that. And the process on this one, we started in about, and I think it was in the second quarter -- second quarter we got into all the filings and everything. So...","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just some questions about capital and the excess capital. Jim, Walter, philosophically, what are your thoughts about using some of that excess capital maybe, to segue your way out of underperforming insurance businesses like long-term care?","Walter S. Berman","Listen, we certainly had, that's an opportunity if we chose to do it. The block, as we said, is not strategically part of our go-forward. We are evaluating, we are certainly increasing. But at this stage, we are constantly evaluating in discussions, but it's nothing there, really has gotten to the point where we feel we get the value for it. And it is something we could use it for, but certainly we feel that we don't have to. But we are continuing to evaluate. And certainly, as the interest rates start improving, that will change the entire situation, which we indicated. But at this stage, I think right now, it's in the best shareholder interest to continue where it is, because we've seen nothing that make sense to us.","John A. Hall - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right, fair enough. If I look at the allocated capital distribution by business line on, I guess, Page 8 in the supplement, there was some moving parts. You can see that the allocated capital on the Advice & Wealth went down, I assumed that's the bank shutting down. It went up in the corporate line, it also went down in the annuity line. I was wondering if you could just offer a rationale as to why over the course of the year, there's less allocated capital to the annuity business?","Walter S. Berman","Well, the annuity, we are basically shifting or  shifted, and basically looking out deferred tax assets. So there's a couple of adjustments. I think there was just about $100 million coming through on that line. We are, and I think as Alicia said, we are evaluating all aspects of that. As Rick [ph] says, there's a lot of moving parts. There's no strategic business change or any, it's really just adjustments coming through. And in the first quarter, we'll come out with a more comprehensive look at it, but it's directionally. There's certainly a valve, but there is nothing of any consequences related to an underlying factor that drove it other than adjustments with DTA and some of the reserves that this came through. And you are correct. In the AWM, it was clearly the bank adjustment there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Bodkins [ph] with Citigroup.","Unknown Analyst","Given your excess capital, where your debt was trading and the availability on the financing markets, have you considered options to lower your interest expense while extending maturities?","Walter S. Berman","By attempting to tender? I'm not sure what your question was.","Unknown Analyst","Just given where some of the coupons are and where the debt is trading, there's a variety of options.","Walter S. Berman","Yes, we looked at that. Okay, I got it. We looked at that. We don't feel really that's an effective use at this stage. Certainly, we have a very large debt maturity coming up in 2015 and we have a small one in 2014. We feel that certainly, the carrying course or appropriate where it is and to attempt to go in and actually go into market, it didn't make sense to us at this stage, and look at the premiums and other things associated with that. So the answer is we will -- we're evaluating capital structure, we're doing interest rate situation, but we feel pretty comfortable where we are right now. And so the short -- I guess, the answer to deploying our access against that was something evaluated and decided it didn't make sense from shareholder standpoint.","Operator","We now have a question from Suneet Kamath with UBS.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is again, on the capital. So if I look at 2012, it looks like you did $1.3 billion of share repurchase. If I look at my 2013 number for earnings and I back out the dividend and then add in the bank capital, my base case would suggest that you're going to do another $1.3 billion in buyback in '13, so basically flat year-on-year. And I just want to reconcile that with what you said in the FCM [ph], which was, given your capital position, you wanted to accelerate the pace of share repurchase in '13 versus '12.","Walter S. Berman","I think, directionally, your numbers are right. It's certainly on that basis as you did the math. I believe that we were saying, for 2013, we were giving that sort of guidance where it would be, and that we would then reserve the right to start accelerating above that. But as we talked about the for the quarter, for the year, that, that would be where you should think would be the amount of purchase going there. Because certainly in 2012, we were way beyond the 100% and we were just saying we would -- you should assume we'll go back to the original guidance we set on time we would do, which is 100%, and then we would add the $375 million on to it and then evaluate the options to really see if we would want to accelerate it. So I think -- I personally think I'm consistent with the FCM [ph], but I will certainly -- that's the way I intend it to come through.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. So we should think about the $1.3 billion, based on my math, as like the minimum that you would do. And then as we move through the year, clearly, there could be some upside to that?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes. I think, Suneet, the way Walter conveyed it, which is consistent with the way we were thinking about it at the FCM [ph] was that, over time, we do not necessarily see a need to maintain the excess position the way we are. And so we would definitely view that some of that excess position would decrease. The reason it hasn't up to this point, is because Walter and my business people have been doing a very good job of what I would call a freeing up capital within the overall structure that we have. So as an example, if we did not de-bank, we would still have the capital of the bank and probably increase capital in the bank. And then we would use the earnings and probably draw down some of the excess. So as we start this year, just like  when we started last year and we get out of things like outside annuities, et cetera, we started to free up more capital, and then we returned that as part of an excess over the earnings. So we're just starting this year in a similar vein. We'll see what happens. But I would say, over the next number of years, I would say we would probably draw it down unless we're able to even free up more capital and lower our capital requirements from either mix shift or some other things that we're able to do. So that's the way we think about it and that's why we've been able to return more than our earnings over the last few years. And if we aren't successful in actually derisking our balance sheet, et cetera, you would've probably seen a drawdown of the excess now based on the amount that we did choose to return in discussions that I have with my board.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got it. My second question is on the Advice & Wealth business. So if I go back to the last quarter's earnings call, Jim, I think you've mentioned that as it relates to the experienced advisor recruits that you'd tracked their progress based on vintages. And I was very interested in that comment, because I've been tracking your experienced advisor recruits over the past couple of years. And I guess what I'm wondering is in terms of the productivity lift that we're seeing, just from this cohort, just -- excuse me, from this experienced advisor recruit component, is it fair to say that we're only really seeing the impacts of like the 2010 class, which I think you -- where I think you added 248 of these advisors, and then the '11 and '12 classes, which were in excess of 300, really haven't quite kicked in yet? And that sort of productivity lift that's on the come, is that the right way to think about it?","James M. Cracchiolo","What you have is, for someone, let's say, added in 2012, you'll start -- they start to transfer their book over. It's not as though they take a little time to transfer the book and then they start to get active again. And so, what you see is a build for each one of those vintages. So if you go back to your point of 2010, in '13 they should be probably fully ramped up. In 2012, they were probably maybe 2\/3 ramped up. And so, you'll see that build. The people who came on 2012 would start to get ramped up in '13, but more in '14 and '15. And so that's exactly what you would see as a vintage build. Now it does vary by advisor, it varies by the type of book they have and the type of clientele. And so there's not sort of a one-size-fits-all. But I think on a vintage basis, you sort of get to a fuller run rate, a full run rate by the third year, in the third year.","Suneet L. Kamath - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So I guess that means, that as we go forward, we should start to see this come through pretty nicely because you've been ramping up the EARs since 2010?","James M. Cracchiolo","Yes, you will see that. And I would also say that even last year, at the beginning part of the year, we did have some good advisor ramp up in productivity from our EARs. I think what offset that was that there was this lower level of activity in our system, including with our change in our variable annuity product that slowed down a lot of our transaction volume. And so I think it's buried within there. But as we look at the vintages and look at the advisors that come on board, we are seeing good, nice ramp up in the productivity.","Operator","And our final question comes from John Nadel with Sterne Agee.","John M. Nadel - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was -- Suneet took the words out of my mouth in the follow-up on the capital returns, so I have no more questions.","Operator","And thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
