As we've said before, we continue to be in a period of challenges and changes. Before addressing specific issues, let me thank over 490,000 FedEx team members around the world for delivering an outstanding peak season for our customers. First, let me deal with the challenges. The quarter just ended is an anomaly because of the compressed shipping season before Christmas necessitating a significant bow wave of expenses to handle volumes that will largely fall in our third fiscal quarter. In addition, this quarter has seen significant effects on the industrial economy due to continuing trade disputes, including reductions in international air freight and tepid, at best, B2B domestic parcel and freight shipping. Despite these issues, we remain highly confident in our strategies, which we believe will begin to bear fruit by our fourth fiscal quarter, and then into FY'21 absent negative macroeconomic developments.","Now the changes, as we announced last summer, FedEx is aggressively expanding North American package services for the rapidly growing ecommerce market to include year-round seven-day delivery. In-sourcing most SmartPost volumes formally given to the Postal Service, standing up more dedicated ground large package facilities given the remarkable growth in demand for the delivery of oversized items in new unique short haul services. While these are the most visible changes, numerous other new technologies and operating processes are being deployed to ensure we can profitably deliver increasing numbers of lighter-weight residential packages. These strategies are being well-received in the marketplace with record peak package volumes, which are substantially above last year, and well over forecast with excellent service levels and high overall customer satisfaction. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we forecast FedEx Ground margins will again be in the teens.","The second area of strategic change is in FedEx Express international operations to include the completion of European ground interoperability in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '20. Also, we are taking down intercontinental capacity right after Christmas as our hopes for a restoration in trade growth, expressed last June, has simply not materialized due to the trade disputes. Given these two major initiatives as FedEx Express rolls into FY'21, we believe we will improve profitability in the segment. While we have numerous other programs underway in FedEx Freight, FedEx Logistics, and FedEx Office that are extremely important, there are two additional areas that deserve comment, our focus on yields and CapEx, which Brie, Raj, and Alan will cover in detail in their remarks.","In regard to CapEx, let me just emphasize we are deferring capital, if not essential for safety service, or replacement, or obsolescence. Longer-term, by fiscal '22 year end, the replacement of 159 A310 and MD-10 aircraft will be complete. This will lead to a significant reduction in the corporation's ongoing capital expenditures on both an absolute basis and percent of revenues from FY'23 forward.","Now, Brie, Raj, and Alan will comment. Then we'll answer your questions. Brie?","Brie Carere","Thank you, Fred. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll open with our economic outlook, then dive directly into commercial strategy and how we're delivering some incredible solutions for our customers that will position FedEx to drive increased profit. Economic growth in the U.S. slowed in calendar year '19, and we continue to see a split between solid consumer economy and a struggling manufacturing sector. Consumers are supported by a robust labor market, while manufacturers have been hampered by trade policy uncertainty and an ongoing inventory correction. The latest developments on trade are positive, but uncertainty remains.","The avoidance of tariffs on approximately $160 billion of goods scheduled for December 15th, and the reduction of tariffs on the September 1st list on $120 billion, from 15% to 7.5% is in fact good news. We look forward to continued progress and the signing of a Phase I deal in January. Further, we believe that the U.K. is now in position to manage a more predictable and orderly Brexit. Our economic outlook does not reflect any continued trade momentum beyond the two changes mentioned to the tariffs above at current.","In the eurozone, manufacturing production appears to be stabilizing at low level. Germany's industrial sector however is still in decline. Looking ahead to calendar year '20 European GDP growth rates will likely remain in line with where they are now. In Asia, China's slowdown is expected to continue to the first-half of the year, but should have some opportunity in the back-half of 2020. Total trade between the European Union and China slowed significantly in calendar year '19 as slower growth and impacts from trade tensions have weighed on trade flows. Global trade volumes contracted year-over-year again in calendar quarter three, and will show contraction for the full calendar year. We should see a return to positive growth for calendar year '20 assuming no re-escalation in trade tensions.","Now, turning to what we can control, we are laser focused on executing strategies centered on five areas, ecommerce, international profitability, market-leading revenue quality, B2B growth, and operational excellence and innovation, which Raj will cover. We are evolving our global portfolio and are already winning significant new ecommerce business. While we are excited about the future of ecommerce, we continue to have teams dedicated to the growth of our core B2B business. Also, we have found great opportunities to grow within the B2B market by leading with our innovative ecommerce portfolio, which I will come back to in a moment.","At FedEx Ground, we have the market leading ecommerce portfolio. We continue to see strong demand across all customer segments with our new seven-day service. We will increase our speed advantage during the New Year. Our Sunday rollout will speed up some lanes by one and two full transit days. This will increase our advantage significantly. And as you know, we are already faster by at least one day when compared to UPS' ground service in 25% of lanes. It is also really important to note our speed advantage in seven-day service is also very valuable for the premium B2B sectors, including healthcare and perishable shippers.","We are equally excited about our returns offerings, which are growing at double-digit rates year-over-year. With our expanded retail presence and low returns market share I am confident we will see this growth accelerate and continue for many years. Returns is a quickly growing market with 15% of ecommerce orders are returned. Returns are an attractive growth segment because it's basically a B2B move. In FY'20 we've seen significant growth of our retail locations, including Walgreens and Dollar General, as well as the volume within these locations. Year-to-date, we have expanded our presence in 1,800 Dollar General stores, reaching 14,000 staffed [haul] [ph] locations, where customers can come and retrieve their packages.","We will continue to expand in the New Year, and by peak season of next year, 90% of the U.S. population will be within five miles of a FedEx drop off and pickup location. At FedEx Express, we are enhancing the value propositions we are famous for, our premium time-definite services for commercial shippers. We are rapidly innovating to leverage technology to increase control, security, and visibility for our Express customer base. We will continue to lean into sensor-based technology to differentiate our services for healthcare, aerospace, and high-tech segments.","Turning to Freight, last quarter we discussed our FedEx Freight Direct Service, which provides freight deliveries right to or through the front door. Freight Direct currently covers 81% of the U.S. population, and is anticipated to cover 90% by this coming July. FedEx Freight Direct is a market leading value proposition, including a two-hour delivery window to your room of choice will full packaging removal delivered, of course, by our FedEx team members. We have a strong pipeline and expect some prominent retailers to begin using this service, in January. The pipeline for B2B customers for Freight Direct is also very strong as we see great opportunities to deliver to spas, dental offices, and schools.","Revenue quality is one of our five key strategies. We will continue to deliver strong market performance in this area. First, we are excited about our momentum in the small business segment. Secondly, we continue to strategically manage our portfolio of large customers. And finally, we continue to manage both annual increases and contract negotiations to ensure we are appropriately compensated for the comprehensive service we provide. As an example, we announced rate increases for large packages for Jan, this coming January. FedEx continues to experience strong demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. The rate increases reflect our commitment to continually invest in our business, while responsibly managing capacities through our network to maintain outstanding service for these larger packages.","Turning to International and our focus on improved profitability, I am confident in our growth prospects in Europe. We have seen year-over-year momentum in growth in our personal volume intra-Europe and Intercontinental to the U.S. from Europe. We have the strongest pipeline and activation for commercial that I have seen since the beginning of integration. We are creating momentum as a result of having the sales integration behind us now. Further, we are leveraging our world class U.S. domestic network to penetrate the e-commerce market from Europe to the U.S. As I mentioned on our last call, we are far less penetrated in e-commerce outside of the U.S. compared to our competitors. We have quickly pivoted to develop necessary solutions and are confident this represents a significant opportunity for both our Europe and our APAC regions.","Finally, FedEx kicked off the peak season with a stunning Cyber Monday, and a feat made possible by the best team members in the business. Raj will discuss peak in more detail. So, let me now turn the call over to him for his remarks.","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. I too would like to start by sending a sincere thank you to our more than 490,000 team members, who are working relentlessly to deliver a successful peak season for our customers. And we are off to an exceptionally strong start this compressed peak season. As data indicates, we moved 37.8 million packages on Cyber Monday. This exceeded our published projections of more than 33 million packages and represents a 17% increase over Cyber Monday last year. Additionally, December 9 and December 16, which was yesterday both were historic volume days for FedEx. Our outstanding service during peak is supported by our people and the significant investments we have made in the FedEx Ground network over the past two decades.","Now turning to Q2, I am not pleased with our financial results. And to that end, we have focus areas across the enterprise on B2B, e-commerce, international profitability, market leading revenue quality and operational excellence. In the short-term, this includes targeted actions to shore up our financial performance. We expect a reduction in intercontinental and domestic air capacity post peak and an overall reduction of costs in our express business. This action should result in the decrease of international and domestic flight hours by about 68% year-over-year in Q4.","Additionally, we are permanently retiring our fleet of 10 A310s. The reduction in flight hours would allow us to temporarily park 14 aircrafts by the end of fiscal year '20. We will also permanently retire another 29 aircraft over the next 30 months. It is imperative that while we reduce our cost to serve, we also drive higher yields to improve profitability. Capacity reductions will bring greater focus on revenue quality as we generate more compensatory volume through the network. As Brie mentioned, we're once again implementing our rate increase in January and have added further increases on accessorials and surcharges. Yields will also benefit from gains and our share of the small and medium shipper market and renewed focus on B2B shipments.","At FedEx Freight, we continue to focus on yield management, profitable growth, and aligning our cost structure to the lower volumes throughout FY'20. These efforts have enabled FedEx Freight to significantly offset the impact from softening economic condition. This is yet another example of matching capacity to demand.","FedEx Ground is experiencing cost headwinds as we undergo remarkable transformation to seven-day service. With the late Thanksgiving this year, we incurred peak ramp-up costs in Q2 with none of the revenue benefit. Additionally, due to the slowdown in industrial production and other macro economic factors, commercial traffic has not been what we expected. Our B2B business provides greater density and stronger yields than B2C, and so, we are renewing our focus on commercial traffic, which makes up a significant portion of our ground volume. However, recognizing that e-commerce is the fastest growing segment in our business, we are working to position FedEx Ground as the B2C player. We have spent years enhancing our network, and today our FedEx Ground Network is well-equipped for handling this rapidly growing market, including seven-day operations for the majority of the U.S., and the dedicated large package operations for handling the growth and heavy and bulky items moving to the ground network.","We're also increasing efficiency through technology as part of this network transformation. This includes offering technology to our service providers, which we call Dynamic Route Optimization or DRO, the system in preparing for increased residential volume associated with e-commerce growth. DRO technology provides near real time data that service providers can use to optimize route timing. Additionally, service providers may use this data to make decisions regarding their vehicle mix and workforce to accommodate the increase in both small and large packages. This new technology and data visibility allows service providers to make dynamic decisions with the most effective and productive way to run their business as well. All of this is expected to drive efficiency, while further strengthen the reliability of what residential and commercial FedEx Ground service. Looking ahead, our investments in this business ensure we are optimizing capacity and productivity in the long-term.","Now turning to Europe, we are on track to meet the May 31, 2020 target date for interoperability of the intra-European ground networks. This will lower costs as the related FedEx Express operations are optimized. In fiscal year '21, the next key milestone will be the completion of the integration of the remaining pickup and delivery operations in Europe, and during the first half of fiscal '22, we will complete the end network integration, bringing to close the physical network integration of TNT into FedEx. They're progressing towards important milestones and we have significant commercial momentum.","Our sales pipeline is strong and activation is the best it has been since you started the integration. As we grow our intra-European parcel business, it will benefit from a lower pickup and delivery cost. And looking ahead, the rationale behind the TNT acquisition remains sound, the value that we estimated at the beginning of the process remains largely achievable. As I've said before, FedEx remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth.","In the near-term, we are focused on decreasing costs and improving revenue quality. We continue to be very excited about our prospects ahead as we transform the ground company complete the TNT integration and the right size our network. Given a more stable economic environment, these measures should produce strong results for the corporation.","Now, let me turn it over to Alan Graf to provide details on our financials, Alan.","Alan Graf","Thank you very much Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by saying our second quarter results were very disappointing, and I will discuss the drivers and actions we are taking, but first, let me take a minute to provide further context around our strategy and the decisions we have made.","For many years, a fundamental component of our strategy and investment was capitalizing on the growth of global trade, which has powered economic development around the globe since World War II. As recently as 18 months ago, we were seeing accelerating returns from our differentiated international network with greater capabilities imminent as we continued with the TNT integration. While we are encouraged by and supportive of the recent trade agreement with China, it is clear that the dynamics of trade growth have changed, and we must adapt accordingly. In addition, following the passage of the tax cuts and Jobs Act in December of 2017, we reviewed our capital priorities, and accelerated intentionally the essential replacement of our oldest aircraft due to the incentives within the TCJA. These investments amidst the current environment are impacting our financial performance.","Getting back to second quarter results, weak global trade and manufacturing drove less-than-expected demand for our most profitable package and freight services across all our business segments. These conditions are especially challenging in Europe, where capacity and network reduction opportunities are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks. As we discussed, cost headwinds at FedEx Ground are largely driven by the expansion of six and seven-day delivery due to a minimum number of employees required to staff and operate the new schedule prior to the volume and revenue coming on. The loss of volume from Amazon had a larger negative impact to the second quarter than the first quarter, since the FedEx Ground contract with Amazon expire in August.","Year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter were also negatively impacted by the later timing of Thanksgiving, as Raj mentioned, and I can't emphasize enough, which resulted in the shifting of cyber week revenues into December. The headwinds and expansion of six and seven-day delivery, the loss of Amazon volume, and Cyber Week shifting to the third quarter accounted for approximately 60% on the Ground margin decline year-over-year. Higher self-insurance accruals also negatively impacted Ground margins by approximately 90 basis points. Package and freight yields across our businesses have been negatively impacted due to a mix shift of lower price services, lower weight per shipment, and increasingly competitive pricing environment.","Depreciation increased with strategic investment programs, including the modernization of FedEx Express aircraft and hubs, and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks, as well as enhanced safety and capabilities. Partially offsetting these negative factors, with benefits from a tax benefit of $133 million from the recognition of certain foreign tax loss carry-forwards, an approximately $65 million decrease in variable incentive compensation and increased revenue per shipment at FedEx rate it was doing quite well. So, FedEx Express recorded asset impairment charges of $66 million related to the permanent retirement of 10 Airbus A310-300 aircraft and 12 related engines. The company is continuing to evaluate if additional aircraft retirements are warranted.","For fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $10.25 to $11.50. Our revised guidance reflects lower than expected revenue on each transportation segment and higher than expected expenses driven by the continued mix shift to residential services. In response, we are implementing reductions to the global FedEx Express air network to better match capacity with demand. We're also further restricting, hiring, and pursuing opportunities to optimize our networks including investments in technology aimed at improving our productivity and continuing to lower our costs.","Year-over-year adjusted operating profit comparisons should improve in Q3 and Q4 well to be Q2 and as Fred said, we're optimistic about FY'21. We now expect to incur approximately $325 million of TNT integration expenses in FY'20 and $1.7 billion in total through FY'21. We expect to begin realizing synergies from the integration of FedEx Express and TNT ground networks during FY'21. And these synergies are expected to increase significantly after the completion of the air network integration in FY'22.","Improving residential package density is a key aspect of grand strategy to combat residential delivery costs challenges. We expect delivery density to improve as we further integrate the delivery of FedEx SmartPost operations into our standard ground operations in calendar year 2020. Ground's performance will also benefit as we rollout technology solutions like dynamic route optimization, and more automated small package sorters to more locations in 2020.","Our FY'20 effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment is now expected to be 23% to 26%. We continue to expect FY'20 capital spending to be approximately $5.9 billion and FY'21 capital spending is anticipated to be similar to FY'20. We are continuing to review our plan spending. And as Fred stated earlier, our capital intensity is expected to decline significantly after FY'22. As committed aircraft deliveries are substantially lower in FY'23 and beyond. Our forecast assume moderate U.S. economic growth, current fuel price expectations, and no further weakening in international economic conditions. A further ramping and anti-trade measures and\/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.","In conclusion, we are disappointed with our current results, but we're optimistic our long-term performance will benefit from an increased focus on revenue quality, reductions to the global FedEx air network to better match capacity with demand, a more competitive solution for European customers till the completion of our TNT integration, modernization of our Express aircraft fleet and hubs, better utilization of our FedEx Ground assets from the expansion to seven-day operations, improved residential density through the further integration of FedEx SmartPost into standard ground operations, and continued investments in technology across our business to automate and optimize operations, reduce costs, and enable more real-time decision making.","With that, Operator, we now can open it for the questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks, good afternoon. Excuse my voice. I just wanted to ask about the Ground segment, and specifically the 6% inflation in cost per piece and the flat revenue per piece, which I think is the biggest delta going pretty far back in history. I know there's an element of timing of the Cyber Week, but how should we think about the cadence of these metrics in Q3 and Q4, basically just trying to understand how we can get comfortable with the margin snapping back to the double-digit level by Q4? Thank you.","Raj Subramaniam","Allison, thank you for the question. Let me just start off, and then I will have Henry answer the details here, but the most important thing that happened to us here was the timing. We have as we'd -- on the calendar we incurred a lot of the cost of running up to peak in Q2 with none of the revenue benefits, as we talked about, and that, you combine that with the slowing down of the commercial segment resulted in the results for Q2. Let met turn it over to Henry to see what he has to add.","Henry Maier","Yes, hi, Allison. The thing I would add here is that most of the costs you're seeing is the timing of peak and the six and seven-day operation being set up. We began operating seven days a week on November 3rd, and it's going to take a while for the volume and revenue and the network to catch up and cover the expense, and I think I didn't hear the full part of your first question, but I think it had something to do with yields, and I think that, as Raj probably said, is due to mix.","Operator","And our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. I guess I wanted to pick up where Allison left off on the ground side, and maybe understand things a little bit better and kind of get into this cost inflation that we're seeing here. So, you outlined a couple of different items there that I think were somewhat unique to the quarter. I think about 60% of the margin degradations that you called out, from the six and seven-day, plus the timing shift, the Cyber Week, and then 90 basis points for insurance. When you think about the revenue growth of $170 million-plus your profit still fell by almost $40 million. So, how do we think about that sort of relative $200 million of incremental costs that you incurred outside of those specific items, and kind of how do we think about sort of the walk from that kind of core run rate to something that I guess looks like teens in 4Q.","Raj Subramaniam","This is Raj, again, and thank you, Chris. I think - I'm not sure what else I can add other than to say that we had a run up on costs putting this seven-day operation in place, and then getting ready for peak, we're going to - there's a significant demand for seven day. We are going to be differentiated with the competition, and then the customer demand is very high, and that's going to come on post peak, and that's going to be very helpful for us, and then, annual recovery we see in the industrial segment of the economy and driving B2B, which is a renewed focus for us, that will be very helpful. Henry?","Henry Maier","Well, I'm not sure what more I would add there. I mean we've talked about this. Most of the cost, 60% of the margin impact, as Alan pointed out, is the timing of peak this year, and by the way, it's a peak that's six days less than last year, so you have this volume that has to be handled in a much shorter timeline than it did last year, that takes more drivers, that takes more package handlers, that takes more line haul, et cetera, across the operation to get done, and then there is the bow wave of cost with the implementation of six and seven-day that wasn't in these numbers last year. Every day at FedEx Ground is now a service day and it takes a minimal number of people in order to staff these operations to provide the service.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.","Jordan Alliger","Yes, hi. Just, sorry, following up on that again, I mean I understand the timing issues and the mix shifts, et cetera. But can you maybe talk a little bit more going forward how do we avoid these sort of issues, because it seemed to me that the macro really didn't get that much worse, so this must be largely cost-related and what have you, and I just want to make sure that going forward with the stuff that you're doing, this type of event and timing event be minimized because I'd imagine, we knew about the shorter peak season, so I'm just a little confused because the hit was just so big.","Fred Smith","Well, this is Smith here. I don't know again how much more that Raj, and Henry, and Alan can say about it. Standing up to six and seven-day network was very expensive for us, and the expense for peak in general, which is always put up front, was a total drag. And we certainly anticipated some of it. But we probably underestimated the cost of standing it up. And then when we went into the peak season, as Raj also said, we had an unbelievable response. We had 37 million packages on Cyber Monday, and our plan was for 33 million. So we have said clearly that we believe by the fourth quarter Grounds margins will be back into the teens. We're not able to show you our spreadsheets, but that's our cost projections. And yes, there's no question, we spent more to put the network up than we thought, but we'd never put up a six or seven-day ground network before to a permanent thing.","So there's a little bit of a new ground for us. But no question we missed on the cost side, but it's up and operating, as Raj said. We probably never had a response in the recent past from our ground customers, like we've had. Brie can perhaps add to that on seven-day. And it's an entirely differentiated product, and it's also something that's going to substantially change the ecommerce business. In the last weekend that just finished, we delivered over 14 million packages on Saturday and Sunday. We weren't event delivering packages on the weekend a couple of years ago.","So we're pretty confident where we're going. And clearly, we didn't do the greatest job of forecasting our costs and we were hit with a couple of other things, like the insurance reserves which are, looking backward some period of time, that's basically because of the litigious society we live in and the more expense that's required to operate a transportation company in general, which is a huge issue to a small transportation company. So we've answered it three times, and we're pretty confident about the fourth quarter, and we gave you some annual stakes, but I don't know that it's productive to plough this ground anymore.","Operator","And with Stephens, we'll hear from Jack Atkins.","Jack Atkins","Good evening and thank you for the opportunity to ask a question. So I guess asking a ground question not related to the sixth and seventh day, but kind of thinking about your pricing commentary, both in the press release and in the 10-Q. You reference increasing pricing competition there which is sort of eroding pricing power, and we certainly saw it this quarter. So So, whether it's Henry or Raj or Brie, could you maybe talk about sort of what's going on there from an industry perspective, and why is pricing power eroding, given the obviously significant demand for -- every services?","Brie Carere","Yes, great question. Thank you, Jack. I think a couple things to clarify. One, as Henry mentioned, the primary yield pressure, we felt at Ground in the past quarter was really due to mix, and the pressure on our commercial business, which is obviously a very important segment to us, and that was linked directly to decrease in industrial production. When we think about revenue quality and our ability to continue to command a premium in the market, which we do in every segment that I measure, we actually get a competitive premium over the service. Number one, the seven-day value proposition is opening doors like it never has before for us. So, we really do believe that gives us great ability to negotiate.","Number two, we are managing the revenue quality and ensuring that every pricing cell contributes. So, you saw that addition what we made for large packages, but as we're managing our large customer portfolio, not all customers are equal, and we're making sure we get the B2B and the B2C bundle, and we're also making sure that when we grow with seven-day that we've got a strong mix of small business, which we have seen. I just looked at the seven-day activation report and it is very strong, customers actually switching to FedEx during peak to be ready for the seven-day launch in January, which is really something quite unprecedented.","Raj Subramaniam","And this is Raj again, the risk of being repetitive, I cannot underemphasize our focus on revenue quality. Renewed focus on B2B, gaining on small medium segment and all the things Brie just talked about this is very important for us.","Operator","Our next question today will come from a Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks afternoon, guys. So, Fred, I want to ask, we've got record low margins I think here, and I heard you talk about restricting hiring, but why are we talking about more drastic cost and headcount reductions, I know it's maybe different, but it strikes me that some of the rails are cutting headcount 10% to 15% without severance costs, do we have any opportunity to do anything like that? And then, just separately, I know you talked about Express profits improving next year; do you have any visibility on ground profits for next year?","Fred Smith","Well, I'll have to ask Alan if he is prepared to make a forecast for FY'21, but -- which I doubt, because he hadn't forecasted to me if he has, but the reality is, to your first question, the rails are not even a remotely comparable business to FedEx. It's essentially a business of maintaining tracks and automating to the extent possible you have on OR 60% it's not labor intensive, is getting less labor intensive and when you follow the precepts of Hunter Harrison and smart railroading or whatever it wasn't calling that's what is allowing the precision railroading. That's what's allowing rails to lower their costs. They are quasi-monopolies certainly in the geographic areas, and certainly the particular customer. So I don't know that rail is significant.","The second part about this business is we're in many ways book to our customers for long-term relationships, and if you walk away from customers and disadvantage them and if you break the morale of your troops by not investing in service quality that has long-term deleterious effects, that certainly has been a consideration in Europe mentioned in TNT. So, of course, we could have done some more drastic things. But I think at the end of the day that the focus on the short-term, financial results are only based on what we see for the fourth quarter in the '21, and the strategies we're exercising. We have not decided to go down that road now maybe somebody else feels differently about that, but I don't think you can keep the purple promise laying off thousands of people and I think that's one of the considerations again we had in Europe just to make sure that people over there we acquired with TNT were fairly treated. We're invested and delivering the kind of FedEx service. So it's a value judgment, no question. We could have been more draconian, I guess, in certain areas. But we're, as we've said several times, pretty optimistic about where we're headed and going into January, assuming there's no more macro economic deterioration. I might also say that I think in this country, there's a little bit of miss under estimation of what's going on in the rest of the world, the e-commerce growth, the technology sector that we had, the tax cut.","All of these things have led us to have a high increasing employment. It's led us to have reasonable GDP growth that's virtually not true anyplace else in the world. And","the industrial economy, particularly in Europe, which was hit by the ricochet bullets of the U.S. China Trade War almost went into recession this time last year, and it still hasn't recovered and Germany in particular is extreme. And I think one of the things that Raj has said and Brie had said it's extremely important here, the U.S. industrial economy, which is much more tied to international trade, and of course, the GM strike and now the MAX shut down, it's been negative for months now. And so our B2B ground volume is growing, and our -- what is it John, what's our freight volume, it's up a little bit or about flat?","John Smith","It's flat to down.","Fred Smith","Yes, and so that's the reflection of the industrial economy and in large truckload carrier, they just went bankrupt, Celadon. So it's really a tale of two, two economies. And the stock market of course is very bullish. But the industrial economy does not reflect any growth at all worldwide to speak up.","Alan Graf","So let me, let me try to give you a little bit more kind of detail on that. First of all, couple of things we didn't mention about. Our miss here in the second quarter, we got substantially less commercial volume at Ground than we had forecast, which was a big impact. High density, higher yield, heavier packages that didn't materialize. Our commercial growth is about flat. Secondly, we operate in extremely competitive labor market these days. And we've seen wage inflation in certain markets due to increased competition for personnel. That was a little higher than we anticipated. So having said that, we are at the bottom, our adjusted operating profit decline year-over-year is horrific, and it's going to improve, it's going to improve in Q3, and it's going to improve substantially in Q4 versus the prior year's adjusted operating income, it won't be the message so bad we might, we might not be back to where we were last year, but we will be a lot closer obviously than how wildly we were in the second quarter.","The other thing is, is that I think if you think about all the positive things we've said and that we're seeing, as we get into 2021, we will start lapping Amazon. We will have a lot more of the sixth and seventh day on our belt and we're going to be delivering millions of packages on Sunday for the rest of this fiscal year rolling into 2021. We will finally start getting turning the corner in Europe, with the operational synergies that we will start seeing and those will grow during the year. I've got nothing in this current range for any sort of a trade deal, because we haven't gotten one yet then we have some upside there. If that happens more, we will even have more upside into 2021. So without giving you specifics, we're at the bottom and we're going to come up off the mat and we're going to improve through the rest of this year and into the next.","Operator","Our next question today will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.","Allison Poliniak","Hi guys, just kind of going back to your commentary around Europe, obviously seeing some stabilization there, the German sentiment is starting to trend a little bit more optimistically, I guess any color on maybe potential improvement there and your ability to flex that network as you're bringing some of this aircraft or parking some aircraft now?","Raj Subramaniam","Yes, again thanks for that question. Yes, we are actually, the commercial velocity that we're seeing in Europe is quite good. As we talked about earlier it's the best we have seen since the beginning of the integration and parcel volume growth intra-Europe and in Europe is starting to starting to park up here. So, and at the same time, we are starting to kick off our integration milestones next, as I pointed out earlier, we will by end of May of this fiscal year 2020, we are expecting to be interoperable, and then proceed on to fiscal year 2021. So, we're not waiting for the full integration to get all the benefits, we are generating those as we speak. And we are seeing the volume growth come and good commercial velocity. I'm going to turn it over to Don for any comments he may have on Europe.","Don Colleran","Thanks, Raj. And thanks for the opportunity to add a little bit of color to what you've already shared. Like you and the rest of the team, I remained very confident in our strategy in Europe and what we're seeing relative to the plans we're executing. I think it would help a little bit when we talked about interoperability and integration on the Ground to kind of define what that means. So what that really is, it's our ability to flow volume between networks supported by the proper technology it allows us to do that in a very efficient way.","So what does that mean? So that allows us to link import and transit clearance processes, enables cross-source capability for our packages in a dual network, it allows us to enable inter-subcapability and it links our A hubs in our Ground networks. So what are we seeing over the short-term and what are we seeing our business right now. So as we communicated on previous calls, we remain on schedule to have Ground interoperability completed by the end of this fiscal year which is May for us and on the year side, in October of 2021, calendar 2021. We realize benefits each and every day as we complete our integration tasks. To give an example, we're set up for almost 1800 lanes in our European Theater. That's 40% of our total lanes either faster by one or two days. And our customers are responding very positive to that, Raj and Brie talked about the pipeline activity, and that's all well and good but what I measure our results are, what we're seeing in our planes and our trucks and we're seeing some nice revenue momentum in our business right now. That's really where we begin to see the synergies in the leverage in our business as we integrate the networks, and at the same time we add possible volume into it. That's where you know, the music really begins to happen. So I feel very positive about where we are, we remain on schedule. We have the European team in here. Last week, Raj and I and Brie and Jill, we spent a lot of time in Amsterdam with the team. So we're on schedule as we've communicated, we're beginning to see some of the benefits. And we'll continue to see the benefits as we transition in the back half of this fiscal year into the next fiscal year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Touching on TNT, you essentially reiterated kind of the time frame of the integration. I'm just curious and you mentioned the sales pipeline is strong, and I think it was activations were the best that they've been. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And please speak to the competitive dynamic you're facing as you're trying to re-penetrate there? Thanks.","Brie Carere","Well, I think we really answered. This is Brie speaking, I think Don and Raj and I have covered most of this. I think two things, one to Don's point commercial volume intra-Europe for parcel is growing and we're very excited about that growth that has been the strongest we have seen. The next lever we really are pulling as quickly as we can is e-commerce. From a competitive comparison within our Express business that is something that our competition is ahead of us. They have about 5% to 6% or five to six times the amount of e-commerce volume that we have inter-Europe.","So that is really blowing their results. We are moving very quickly a year-ago just to put this in context. We had nine leaves on e-commerce and I'm giving you that number to show the momentum that we have. We're now actively managing 1,000 e-commerce customers through our sales type and intra-Europe alone, we have very quickly pivoted because of the economic conditions we have to grow in e-commerce and to Don's point, the European network is ready to grow from an e-commerce perspective as we've been able to improve our value proposition and grow in Europe. So number one, for growing commercially into Europe, number two, we've got strong momentum from an e commerce in Europe that's coming now.","Raj Subramaniam","The last thing I would add to that is what's encouraging to me is the fact that this growth is happening in light of what's not a very strong macroeconomic set of circumstances. So team is out there, we believe they're taking share, they're growing our business aggressively. We're hoping as both I think Fred and Alan mentioned earlier, on a more macro level of certainty that comes along with hopefully some good news on Brexit also has this, encourage although we haven't dialed that into a plan. So I like where we sit. I like how the team is executing, right now as we go into the back half of the year.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Ben Hartford","Hi, good evening. Just interested in your perspective on AB5 and what changes if any, it may have to the way that the ground model is constructed or any potential benefits that may bring about in the market given some of these disruptions, just appreciate an update there as it relates to AB5 and some potential consequences?","Henry Maier","Hey, Ben, it's Henry Maier. AB5 legislation relates to the legal test under which an individual's employment classification should be determined under California law. Since 2011, FedEx Ground is only contracted with independent incorporated companies, not individuals, and they must classify and treat their staff as employees under applicable state and local laws. So at this time, we don't believe it impacts us. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Hey, good afternoon everyone, and happy holidays. So I guess even coming back to the analog between the rails, I guess the question does make sense from the perspective that the rails didn't earn a great return on capital for a long time, then there was a bold new way to run the business. And so I guess, along those lines when should shareholders expect that FedEx goes under like a portfolio of product review of everything offered at Express? And where's the plan to get those products earning their cost of capital in the future, because there's just a history of that not happening?","Alan Graf","This is Alan. Well, we've done that; we were asked earlier about there is some big bold move. I don't think you have any idea how big 8% reductions of flight hours is, but it's tremendously large. We're not going to grow our fleet. We're just replacing it. We're tightening it. Tighten it up, and reducing flight hours. Express's domestic margins are fine. So, it's the international that we got to keep working on, we've been dragged down by TNT. Some of it self-inflicted, some of it macro, we're handling the flight hours, I think we're doing everything that we can that we should be doing. Well, our CapEx is going to drop significantly after we get the past FY'22. As I said, those of our essential aircraft replacements, which we need, if we're flying more flight hours, then we will be retiring MD-11 faster than we anticipated, but we don't expect any growth there beyond that. I think a 6% to 7% of persona revenue in '23 and beyond will start to show a significant improvement in our ROIC and ROE. So as I look out there, again it's, I'm frustrated I'm sure. Our investors are frustrated. We're here at the bottom but we can see a way out.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good afternoon. I appreciate the question. Alan, you just mentioned that the magnitude of the cost take out from the -- I guess 8%, air network capacity reduction is pretty significant. Is there any way that you can help us think about how to translate that to cost? I think in the past you had talked about international like, is U.S. frequencies being kind of $50 million to $100 million in operating income impact for taking another frequency, I just, is there hundreds of millions of dollars of cost savings, is it $50 million, just any way you can help us think about the magnitude. Thank you.","Alan Graf","Well, getting exactly those details, because it depends on what the flight hours are and everything else, it's a significant number. And at the same time, we expect to be improving the revenue quality on it significantly, so we should get it from the top line and the bottom-line, and I'll turn it over to Don, and then -- he's been leading the planning on this, and I think it's outstanding.","Don Colleran","Thanks, Alan. I won't get into the specific on the numbers as you suggested, but what I can tell you, we've made and will continue to make significant reductions in our flight hours both in the U.S. as well as outside the U.S. As we mentioned, our businesses in the U.S. is in a pretty healthy position, but we've lost a significant customer. So, what have we done in response to that? While we were taking significant costs out of our U.S. business, inclusive of flight hours in a significant amount, labor savings, aircraft maintenance and vehicle saving. So, we're looking at it this everywhere, not only in terms of what we're doing in the flight hours, but corresponding costs that are associated with that both in the U.S. and our intercontinental business. The number that Alan has quoted, six to eight is inclusive of both, but we're looking at flight hours everywhere in ways that we can optimize our network and match lift to load.","Operator","Our next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, Operator. Hi everybody, and thank you for the time. I just want to follow-up on the flight hour's question. So, we estimate that from public data that about half your pilot will retire over the next decade, and I'm just kind of wondering, (a), the pilot hiring and your ability to attract female pilots to the company, and (b), how much of the reduction in flight hours is the result of the pilot retirements?","Fred Smith","Let me start off from this and have Don speak to. This is Smith speaking. First of all, when the economy started deteriorating a year ago in Europe, and we were hopeful for trade deals as we went on the fiscal year as we expressed to you in the June Analyst Call. We began to put constraints on pilot hiring, and we have not been hiring pilots for some time now. On an attrition basis, I believe, Don and Greg Hall, our Head of Air Operations told me that we will have a net reduction of several hundred pilots next year just due to retirement, and of course, that corresponds to the flight hour reduction. So, this is something that we've been thinking about for long time if things didn't materialize.","In terms of female pilots, FedEx had been a leader in this. This has been something that's been a project of mine for a long time, female and minority pilots we percentage-wise at one point I'm far away from the Express business, this level of details, at one time we had the highest percentage of both. I'm sure that's different now, but we work very hard, and we participate in female and minority hiring longer term. We are among the prize jobs in the aviation industry, and we do not have any problems hiring aviators today, but in the future with the military releasing, so few of them, that may be a different story, but Greg has done a great job for Don developing Grow Your Own Pilot Program. So, we put a lot of thought in this. Our pilot attrition is going down, and so we anticipated this. Raj, Don you want to say\u2026","Don Colleran","Just one thing I like to add to that. I've had the opportunity since I've been in this role to spend a lot of time with our pilots, and we have an absolutely amazing group of pilots. Without question the best in the industry. We have a best source of our pipeline, so -- because the brand is so strong, because they do such a great job for us, and they're helpful in the recruitment of pilots across the world. So, first of all, we have an amazing group of pilots that do a fantastic job for us as they have during this peak season. I mean the staff's reliability of our aircraft and what our pilots are doing is nothing short of amazing. So, the other greatest source of recruitment that we have and we have the best pilots in the industry bar none.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

Good morning and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year '13. As you can see, FedEx made significant progress on several fronts in fiscal 2013, our results improved in the fourth quarter with an operating margin of 9.6% and $1.1 billion in operating income on an adjusted basis. FedEx Ground posted another strong year and e-commerce boosted our volumes.","These positive developments in quarter four however did not fully offset sluggish economic growth and customers' preference for international economy services. However as noted, we are taking actions to better align our global networks with demand. We are confident that our business strategy is correct and we believe we are positioning FedEx for profitable long-term growth.","Before I turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy and Alan Graf for elaboration on financial results, I would like to note that FedEx is revising its practices on earnings guidance beginning this quarter. We will provide full year projections with quarterly updates. We will no longer provide quarterly earnings per share guidance.","For fiscal 2014, the company projects earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% from fiscal 2013 adjusted results. There are three primary reasons that we decided to change the format for issuing guidance.","One, volatile short-term shifts and macroeconomic trends in global markets are making quarterly earnings guidance increasingly less precise. Two, this move will allow us to focus on more productive activities and better manage our business and three it is consistent with industry peer practices. Of course, we remain committed to candor full transparency and sound corporate governance.","Now, Mike Glenn.","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred. I am going to provide a brief overview of our economic outlook as well as some commentary on package and freight yields. We continue to see modest growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2% for calendar year 2013 and 2.5% for calendar year 2014.","For industrial production, we expect growth of 2.8% in calendar 2013 and 3.5% in calendar 2014. The outlook remains highly uncertain with the euro zone in recession and policy risk still high. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.3% for calendar 2013 and 3% for calendar 2014.","Turning to yields. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields increased 2.4%. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements followed by weight per package.","In the Ground segment, yield per package increased 2.3% excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by rate and discount improvement and an increase in extra service charges.","Excluding fuel, International export Express package yield decreased 1.7% year-over-year driven by rate, discount and exchange rate. Finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight in the FedEx Freight segment increased 1.7% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount changes followed by weight per shipment.","Now, I will turn it over to Alan Graf for financial commentary.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. In FY13, Ground posted another stellar year with industry-leading margin, acquisitions in Poland, France, Brazil and Mexico, are on course to enhance profit at Express.","Freight made solid progress following its return to profit last year and we signed a new $10.5 billion, seven-year contract with the U.S. Postal Service, a testament to the quality of service and the strong relationship we have built over the past decade.","For the fourth quarter, as adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 7% to $2.13, excluding business realignment and charges to retire some aircraft and related engines at Express.","Regarding our aircraft retirements, this Friday at the Memphis airport, we will be honoring our last 727 revenue flight. As Fred mentioned, adjusted operating margin increased to 9.6% for the quarter versus adjusted 9% last year on 4% higher revenue of $11.4 billion.","Now, let's take a look at the segments. At Express, revenue grew from this year's business acquisitions and from the growth of FedEx Trade Networks in the quarter. Margins grew year-over-year, up 50 basis points to 6.6%, excluding charges due to a net benefit from fuel surcharge timing lag versus the prior year, capacity reductions and other cost reductions. Margins grew at Express despite the continued shift toward lower yielding international services.","At Ground, adjusted operating margins slightly exceeded last year's spectacular 20% in Q4. Ground's average daily volume grew 10% for the quarter with growth in both, FedEx Home Delivery and business-to-business services. Average daily volume for SmartPost soared 25%, primarily due to growth in e-commerce. I should note that Ground has gained revenue share for 54 consecutive quarters.","On the Saturday before Mother's Day, Home Delivery set a new non-peak record of 1.7 million package deliveries equivalent to a peak Saturday during the winter holiday season.","At Freight, ongoing profit improvement initiatives enabled us to maintain adjusted margins of 5.8% year-over-year, despite 3% fewer shipments. During the quarter shipment volume was impacted in part by the transition of Freight to the FedEx enterprise automation platform, as some customers encountered difficulties in the process of improving our automation and technology.","As to outlook, based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about and Fred's discussion of the changes to our guidance framework, we project earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% from FY13 adjusted results. Our outlook depends on our GDP assumptions and a stable pricing environment for fuel since fuel price volatility impacts our fuel surcharge levels and fuel expense as well as demand for our services.","In addition to continued profit improvements in the base businesses at Ground and Freight, our profit improvement programs announced in FY13 are targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.6 billion at Express by the end of FY16 from the full year FY13 adjusted operating income level.","Collectively, these initiatives are expected to increase margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness. However, the amount of benefit ultimately realized will be dependent upon future customer demand, particularly for premium international services. We expect to begin realizing a portion of the benefits from the profit improvement program gradually in FY14. However, the majority of benefits including those from our voluntary buy-out program will not occur until FY15 and FY16.","Looking at the Express outlook, revenue and earnings are expected to increase at Express in FY14. Revenue growth is expected as we reap the benefits of our FTN expansion, our international\/domestic services and our European organic growth program.","Earnings are expected to benefit from ongoing cost initiatives, capacity reductions and revenue growth. As we expect continued pressure on international yields, we are continuing to evaluate further actions within the Express network to better match costs with yield and we will eliminate another Asia to U.S. frequency in July.","The USPS agreement is extremely valuable to the company, but we will see some rate reductions starting in Q2 of FY14. We accelerated the retirement of certain aircraft and related engines due to the planned acquisition of more efficient and reliable new aircraft and projected slower economic growth than previously forecast.","The accelerated aircraft retirements will add $74 million in year-over-year depreciation expense. The aircraft that were retired at the end of FY13 were parked throughout the year and parking them provided a maintenance benefit in FY13.","The Ground outlook is good as revenues are expected to continue to grow in FY14, led by volume growth across all our major services due to continued e-commerce growth and market share gains, as well as anticipated yield growth from our yield management programs.","As a result of this anticipated volume and yield growth, we expect continued growth in Ground's operating income for FY14. We do expect capital spending at Ground to increase in FY14, and for the next several years at a very high ROIC as we expand our capacity to meet growing demand.","At Freight, modest revenue growth is expected for FY14 as demand in the LTL market remains weak and we continue to focus on our yield and shipment initiatives in our differentiated LTL services.","Freight operating income and operating margin are expected to increase modestly, driven by increases in yields and shipments as well as the continued improvements in productivity and efficiency across our integrated network, including an increased use of rail for economy shipments.","Overall, we expect earnings growth for Q1 2014 to be solid, but challenged as we expect headwinds year-over-year from fuel surcharge timing lag, one less operating day and continued pressure on international yields and freight volumes.","Also, the benefits of the voluntary buy-out program will ramp out throughout the year with the majority of those expense reductions occurring after the first quarter. Our businesses are cyclical in nature and seasonal fluctuations will affect volumes, revenues and earnings.","Other factors, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36.5% and 37% for FY14 depending on the amount and source of operating income. Our U.S. pension plans have ample funds to meet expected benefits. Retirement plan cost for FY14 will decline by nearly $200 million due to strong investment returns on planned assets and a slightly higher discount rate at our May 31 measurement day.","Our FY14 capital expenditures are expected to increase to approximately $4 billion due to increased spending on facilities and aircraft. Approximately half of the 2014 capital expenditures will be designated for growth with the other half dedicated to maintain our existing operations, most notably continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express.","We will continue to evaluate our investments in critical long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures generate high returns and are balanced with our outlook for global economic conditions.","Now, let's take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan","Yes. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the restructuring and kind of how you see the pace of that activity playing out. You indicated you expect, I think, a stronger pace of margin improvement in fiscal 2015, and then maybe a build in fiscal 2014, but are there any numbers that you can give us or kind of a range of numbers in terms of how much actual restructuring cost savings would be in that fiscal 2014. Is that $200 million or $300 million and what you think that number might build to in terms of the restructuring-driven operating income improvement in fiscal 2015. Thank you.","Alan Graf","Thanks, Tom. This is Alan. Thanks for the question. I think I will answer two or the three parts if that's okay. As we noted, we only had about 40% of the people leave on May 31, as we determined how many folks we needed to keep for a longer period of time to continue our high service levels for both, internal and external customers.","So, I don't know what everybody has in their models that is in first call, but I suspect that there were people who are expecting to see higher FY14 benefit than what I am currently looking at, which is the right thing for the company to do.","I will tell you this that we expect the ongoing savings, when we are outgoing right in FY16 to be well in excess of $600 million. The cash charges or the business realignment charges from an accounting standpoint, as we said were $560 million in 2013. The cash outflows actually are spread out as people leave.","We expect about a 21-month [payback] [ph] on this program, so we are thrilled with where we are and think we have got right in the sweet spot, but less benefit in 2014 and much greater in 2015 and 2016.","Dave Bronczek","Tom, this is Dave Bronczek. I will add to what Alan said. We talked about at the Analyst Meeting; the FY16 target of our $1.6 billion profit improvement is still on target. 75% of that accrues by FY15 and we are right on track to hit those goals.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Taylor Mulherin - Deutsche Bank","This is Taylor Mulherin on for Justin this morning. I'm hoping to get your thoughts on trans-Pacific Express capacity in the trade down going forward. It's looking like Express continues to be impacted by both, demand headwinds in the trade down to the lower yielding services, so can you talk a little bit more about your cost cutting efforts for the line-haul network in your shift toward using more third-party resources?","Dave Bronczek","Yes. This is Dave Bronczek, again. We announced last quarter that we are reducing some of our network capacity and we announced it again today for July. You saw in our numbers for the last several quarters; international economy has been growing at double-digit rates, 11% and 12%. International priority has been slightly behind growth plans that we had put forward. So, we have moved some of the traffic that's more lower yielding economy into our FTN network, pulling down our network capacity, pulling down flight hours, pulling down some fuel and overall balancing our network, and we will continue to do that going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow-up on that, Dave, talking about the FedEx Trade Network. As you continue to build that, how is your pricing negotiations going with the other third-party vendor in terms of, whether we can see some more yield improvement there as we gain a little bit more scale through that? Just if you could touch on that a little bit.","Dave Bronczek","Well, the capacity build-out is going extremely well. We are in 140 locations now in 27 countries and we continue to have great progress and great results there. We are bundling with our customers, of course, the right products and the right network, so we are actually more internally focused with our customers in how we price the products going forward, so we are actually in very good shape there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel Nicolaus.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus","Yes. Good morning, everyone. It's maybe a question for Chris. The new legislation passed in New Jersey that says truck drivers must be employees. Does the multi-work area contractor model or the ISP model you have switched to become impacted if that's signed into law and are there other states that are doing anything similar or threatening to the ground model right now?","Chris Richards","This is Chris Richards. The bill as it was passed by the legislature unfairly targets independent contractors in the transportation industry who have chosen to operate through their own small businesses.","As you know, we have only incorporated independent contractors and they all have their own employees, and this law will discourage small businesses and hamper the state's ability to maintain employment in a time where the economy is challenging employment, so we are confident that the administration in New Jersey is not going to be interested and will not want to enact a law that harms small businesses at this juncture and we are working in that direction.","Now, we fully expect that there may be some other folks who might want to follow in proposing legislation and understates, but I want to make it very clear, we are absolutely confident that these kinds of laws interfere with interstate commerce and we will aggressively challenge any situation where such a law is enacted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird","Good morning. Dave, I was wondering if you could provide any context or perspective to underlying airfreight trends. We know the diversions between IE and IP trends, but underlying airfreight trends generally in your outlook for the second half of the year, it sounds as though tech related customers are slightly more confident as it relates to the back half of the year and as it relates to Asian outbound airfreight, so wondering if you have any perspective as it relates to that.","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. Let me make a couple of comments. World air cargo traffic has shown consistent growth historically, but we have certainly seen slowing of that in the last five years. In fact, we have seen a decline in four of the last five years in overall traffic levels in the Air Cargo segment, and there are really four issues that are driving that.","One, is global GDP has been growing at a slower pace. Global trade drives air cargo and has traditionally grown faster than global GDP, but that's not been the case recently. As I mentioned, we have seen a decline in global air cargo markets, four out of the last five years and certainly higher energy prices are having an impact on that.","So, the global air cargo market has been under pressure for four out of the last five years. And, obviously, we are taking actions to manage our way through that, which Dave has pointed out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yes. Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Alan, can I ask you to comment a little bit further on some of the CapEx plans? You talked about some of the growth in Ground. Of course, we've got some good ROICs there, but I was little surprised to see it up almost 18% relative to the last fiscal year. Can you talk a little bit about the ability to sort of move that around over the course of the year? Is this a hard and fast number or maybe some insights as to why it kind of went up so much?","Alan Graf","Well, the largest increase is going to be at Ground. We have to take the next, start billing for the future and we are going to develop new properties and facilities and I will let Henry add some color to this and we have got to start investing in now, so we can be ready for what traffics we are expecting in FY16, and I think it's a good thing. These are high ROIC investments and we are happy to put it in.","There is a slight increase at Express. But, again, that's part of our fleet modernization, and particularly the 757s and 767s have good, good ROICs. So, let met turn over to Henry on the Ground aspect [because it is the] [ph] biggest increase.","Henry Maier","Yes. Thanks for the question. Majority of our capital is for capacity growth to support our growth, or for revenue equipment replacement. You know we are very disciplined about any decision we make about capital, and we are going to be very disciplined going forward.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Good morning. Yes. Maybe a question just about the pace of kind of underlying business trends within Express you guys have announced; I guess, now two trans-Pacific frequency cuts, which will at least have partial benefit in fiscal 2014, and I think you said you get some benefit of the employee separation in the second half of the year.","I guess, I am just trying to make sure I understand kind of what the pace of maybe core profitability growth or deterioration in the Express business in fiscal 2014, or as how you guys see it in fiscal 2014, just kind of given the guidance and some of the cost issues that you have mentioned, it feels like it's a little bit on the conservative side. Just curious your kind of thoughts there?","Dave Bronczek","Well, Alan said it. This is Dave Bronczek. Alan mentioned it before, our operating profits and margins are up in FY14, in part to all of the issues you mentioned and then all the other things we are working on in our five-point profit plan. Our U.S. domestic reshaping, the international profitability, our harvesting the international acquisitions we have made and so forth, so in Alan's guidance is an improvement at Express in both, profits and margins.","Alan Graf","I think as far as trends go, we are not any better than anybody else at predicting the volatility of fuel and it can have a major swing in an individual year at Express, so we are expecting that to be a headwind for Express in FY14.","If it goes the other way, then it is conservative, but it could also be a bigger headwind than what we had in our plans, so that's really the one uncontrollable factor that we are facing, but the reduced capacity will obviously lower our exposure to that some.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me make a comment here to try to put some of this in perspective. Seven or eight years ago, the FedEx Express segment was competing in a marketplace that today is worth about $40 billion. Just the Express segment, a very high priority, door-to-door sector because of the build out of FedEx Trade Networks that Dave Bronczek mentioned to you, we are now competing in an air cargo market in its entirety that's somewhere around $98 billion.","So, I think there is this implicit belief in the questioning that the growth of the economy sector for FedEx is a bad thing, and actual fact as you saw in the numbers, the economy traffic grew 11% in the quarter. The priority traffic grew 2%, so our issue was simply that we had too much of much of the priority capacity up and we needed to be more aggressive in the economy sector and that's what Dave has done.","So, I think at the end of the day that these trends are not necessarily a bad thing. We just have to make sure as Dave mentioned, that we got the right traffic in the right network. It's very similar to the Ground and Express situation. If the item can go in the Ground system, the customer is probably going to choose that as very high ROIC, very high margin situation and we think over time the same will be true in the Express segment, and I think it's important that you look at it as a segment and not just the Express business, which is the majority of the Express segment but the broader base businesses increasing at a rapid rate, again, as Dave mentioned to you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Thanks. Morning, guys. I hear that you are affirming the $1.6 billion profit improvement target, but also hearing that maybe some of the trade down issues are continuing or are worse than you thought, so I am wondering if there is anything within that $1.6 billion that is doing better than you thought to offset the trade down. Then just directionally, do you have views on when this trade down issue is going to stop or any signs of it getting better or worse?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith, again. I obviously I didn't make my point. The Economy business is up 11%, the Priority business is down, Mike Glenn mentioned to me, 1%. That's not necessarily a bad thing and it doesn't necessarily mean that Express can't make more money on the Economy business, and implicit in your question was that assumption. And I think if you go down that road, you are making an erroneous assumption.","So, it's very important that you recognize that. There is a tremendous amount of capacity in the international marketplace in these long range, twin-engine airplanes, particularly the 777. And if you are watching the Paris Air Show, there is going to be a lot more of it with A350 and the 777, 888 and 999. Our FTN capabilities allow us to participate now in both of those sectors. The priority sectors, where we can have a competitive advantage with our own equipment and the broader economy sectors. So, I had to jump in here, because it seemed to me like I didn't get my point across in my comments before.","Dave Bronczek","And, this is Dave, again. Let me add to what Fred said. On the cost side, we are actually doing very well. We actually are exceeding some of our own projections on the cost side. So Fred's point, on the international economy, the goal for us and the issue for us is to make that economy product grow more and make more money on it in the right network and that is absolutely what we are doing.","Alan Graf","This is Alan. From a strategic standpoint, you have to remember. We built the international aviation network expecting significantly higher growth in IP, and as we've mentioned to you several times now that has slowed. We still have an awful lot of IP and an awful lot of opportunity to continue to grow IP, but IE is going to grow faster for the foreseeable future and that's what we are talking about.","And, as we adjust these networks, that's not a switch. These are complicated changes. I mean it sounds easy to take down one flight, it is not. There are all kinds of changes that go through the entire network when you do that as well it takes FTN a while to build up its capacity to do that, so we are doing that during 2014 and expect to really start seeing those benefits post 2014.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. When you think about the guidance, Alan, are these that the mix of cost cutting, the 3,600 employees, was that larger than you expected to offset some of the trade downs in other areas or other buckets the same? Maybe can you kind of delve into how you are viewing the cost cutting program so far?","Fred Smith","Okay. Ken. Well, the voluntary buy-out was one piece and we had told you in October that we thought we would get $500 million or well over well over $600 million. We saw significantly higher tenured people take the package which is fine, but that also means we are going to get a lot higher returns on that. The cost trimming is beyond just that however. I mean, there's significant going on in Express, and I am going to turn it over to Dave to let him tell you what he has been doing there in terms of hours and station management et cetera.","So, I feel very comfortable about the cost piece of what we laid out for you in October, and I am very confident we are going to beat it. The issue that we have had since October is the one we have been talking about is that less than expected IP growth and we got to adjust for that and we will.","Dave Bronczek","Yes. Just on a very high level. We are in good shape on U.S. productivity. The hours are coming down; we are consolidating facilities, the flight hours, the fuel burn, the network capacity. So, across the board it actually all adds up to improving our cost structure going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Yes. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I want to follow-up on maybe some of the confusion with the trade down and even get back to Bill Greene's question on CapEx.","Alan, you talk about high hurdle rates on your capital projects, but I guess with where you see the market going it sound like an asset light model is the better way to serve that international economy product. So I think part of the disconnect here might be that we continue to put, or it looks like we are continuing to put a lot of CapEx into the Express segment, so how do we balance what your target growth rate might be for the Express segment versus putting more assets into it relative to an asset light model going forward that's need for that economy package?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me say one thing before Alan makes his comment. We are not buying any airplane capacity for growth. The airplanes that we are buying are for replacement. We are replacing the 727s, and as Alan mentioned and the last one flies Friday, with 757s, did tow the A310s, 767 start coming in September and those are very high ROIC activities with the existing volume. It's not growth at all and the 777s are replacing the MD-11s over the next 10 years and I think we have got 18 more of them on order over the 10 years, so there is no capital in airplanes. We are not putting capital in the business for growth. We are simply replacing the assets that we have.","Alan Graf","I certainly understand a concern, but we have a long-term objective as to retire all of our tri-motors. Fred said we found that twins are much more efficient, reliable and the numbers are very strong there. But, when you calculate it on ROIC, it certainly increases the denominator when you add a brand new airplane, you take out fully depreciated one. We understand that, so it's not a short-term ROIC decision, it's a longer term ROIC decision.","I would also add that just please remember that we not only retired a bunch of airplanes at the end of last year and at the end of this year, we've also accelerated retirements of a bunch of other ones that we have, so our capacity isn't going up many and in fact it may come down?","Dave Bronczek","Yes. That's right. This is Dave, again. And in that $1.6 billion number that you all saw in October, one of the five points in the five-point profit improvement of course is the fleet modernization and it's worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the bottom line for profits. And, to Alan's last point, the 76 planes that we have accelerated the depreciation in the 287 engines and so far that's continuing push to modernize our fleet to become more profitable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James.","Art Hatfield - Raymond James","Morning, everyone, and sorry to go back to the trade down issue, but as you look at that and as you manage through that, can you talk a little bit about if there are any costs and what the dollar benefits are as you take down one aircraft in services you talk about in July. And additionally as you go forward, is this kind of, whether or not this accelerates or what not, if you continue to see this trend developing, is there something that you could or would do from a more meaningful, say, restructuring standpoint similar to what you announced last fall and do something like that in the international business?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. I think, the problem we have is trying to answer questions like you just asked us. We have given you the basic overall trends. The international air cargo business is not going to go away. It's a $98 billion business.","We've given you a forecast of 7% to 13% of EPS guidance and you will just have to trust us to know how to manage the business, so it's getting down into that level of detail. It's just something we are not prepared to do.","Alan Graf","I would add from a strategic standpoint, the trade down is more forward-looking. We had flat IP growth year-over-year. The growth was all in IE. And frankly since October that surprised us a bit, and so we have to adjust for that, but we still have a strong IP business but the future growth, at least for the next couple of years is going to be much higher in IE than it's going to be in IP, so that's sort of the trade down. It's not that we are losing IP packages.","Mike Glenn","Art, this is Mike Glenn. I would just add that I think it's important to separate how we manage our network and the concept of growth. FedEx continues to pursue growth strategy although coming from different segments of the market. So, how we elect to move that in our network obviously we are going to look for the most efficient way to do that, but I think it's important not to confuse the two, how we manage the network and our efforts to grow the business are separate issues.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. If I could switch gears and talk about Ground, where you are just doing a tremendous job gaining share, my first question is related to the sustainability of this trend and I am wondering how far can you push the envelope before you see more significant competitive response.","I guess, kind of more specifically, I am wondering about the pricing risk. Then kind of related to the pricing side, with shippers increasingly focused on containing their own cost, I am wondering to what extent are you seeing some resistance in rates? Thank you.","Mike Glenn","Tom, thanks for the question. Our strong results are a reflection of the structure and culture of our operations, the speed and reliability of our service and our yield management discipline. We have a sales force out there that does a terrific job getting every package in the right network and our customers are increasingly voting with their dollars.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Research","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry to go back to the guidance, but just wanted to get a sense in terms of conservatism. Obviously, now fiscal 2013 was tougher than expected, so how much of this guidance is you guys setting the bar to a very achievable level and then kind of potentially seeing upside or how much really is due to what you are not quite sure about on the fuel side of things. Is there anything that you could do to maybe more quickly get to the higher end of the guidance?","Henry Maier","I promise you we don't play games like that. This is our best 50-50 shot. I will tell you that no CFO worth his or herself will give you the entire bell curve of potential outcomes, but this is our best shot on what we see today based on all the factors that we have talked about and we are certainly not trying to play any games here.","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. Let me go back to the question regarding Ground opportunities. As Henry pointed out, we have a very unique value proposition that is delivering industry leading service levels and our sales team is doing a phenomenal job of positioning that in the context of the broader portfolio of services that we offer.","I do think it's important to point out that we still have plenty of runway for growth in an overall market, where we only have, including SmartPost about 30% market share, so there is plenty runway there. On top of that, we do not have our fair share in the smaller customer segment in the Ground market, so there's plenty of opportunity there to grow the business at higher than average yield, so we are excited about the opportunities, we have a phenomenal service, the Ground has provided our sales and marketing team to sell and we think there are plenty of opportunity going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. Staying on Ground, could you elaborate a little bit on compare and contrast B2C margins and B2B margins? Then a very impressive margin in the quarter, any consideration for how high that can go and then sneaking one more in, an update on Delivery Manager, please? Thank you.","Alan Graf","Well, I would say that we have a revenue management committee. We look at every account that sales presents to us in terms of how it fits in our network and what it means to the business, so we have a very disciplined approach to determining an acquisition strategy in the marketplace. We at Ground are exceedingly disciplined around yield management. It's just part of our culture. I would say that we are extremely confident that we can continue this going forward.","Dave Bronczek","I think it's important when you talk about margins to understand the portfolio that we offer in the Ground network. We have a commercial portfolio, we have a home delivery portfolio and we have SmartPost. So, SmartPost plays a very important role in dealing with those residential delivery packages and that is a key element of our value proposition that allows us to ensure that we are delivering the right returns in the Ground segment. So, as Henry mentioned, we are very disciplined in terms of how we approach the customer and the value proposition that we have with that in mind.","Turning to Delivery Manager, it's a major new offering for FedEx and it has the potential to change the expectations that recipients have in the Parcel Delivery segment and it is in the sweet spot of e-commerce. Since it was launched a few weeks ago, using Delivery Manager over a quarter of a million packages were delivered involving the input from the recipient, helping them get their package in their hands when they want it, where they want it.","Our large e-commerce shippers are responding very favorably to the convenience, the visibility, the flexibility and the options that we offer through Delivery Manager and it's allowing us to provide an improved customer experience, while certainly having a benefit on our cost structure as well, so we are very excited about the rollout of Delivery Manager.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Connor Hustava - Stephens","Yes. Hi, guys. This is actually Connor Hustava on for Jack today. We've seen a few announcements recently regarding growth in your distribution business. Can you maybe give us a sense for the scope of your current contract logistics and distribution product offering and maybe where think you would like to see that go in the future? Thanks.","Dave Bronczek","Hi. Thanks. This is Dave again. FTN is, I think, the group that you referring to and SupplyChain two of our components inside of FedEx Express, and both units are growing and both are profitable and they are a nice bundle to the business. We can go to bigger accounts, which we have been saying all along this morning and move the traffic into the right networks then depending on whether it's in the ocean with FTN in the SupplyChain in any region of the world. Quite frankly, we have SupplyChain set up, so we have seen growth and we've seen it profitably for us in both of those segments and we think that continues going forward.","Fred Smith","Yes. Just for those of you who are not aware of it, I mentioned this earlier. The FedEx SupplyChain and the FedEx Trade Networks operating companies are part of the Express segment as it's reported, but they are individual companies with their own CEOs that report back to Dave. And the reason we are organized that way is, because we have one worldwide global management team and it coordinates our customer activities much better than if we had them in a different segment.","So, sometimes that's lost and that was one of the points I was making a little bit earlier. When you talk about Express, you got to look at the Express segment, because it has the very large Express business, but it also has and reported in that segment is FedEx Trade Networks and FedEx SupplyChain, and FedEx SupplyChain has some very terrific services that we rolled out in the last couple of years and it's really getting up ahead of steam. We are very excited about it.","Henry Maier","Yes. Going back to the point I made, they toggle back and forth and they contribute back and forth between Express and SupplyChain and FTN, and so really that's the point I am trying to make is they bundle it altogether for the betterment of the company, so that's where we are going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Thanks. Good morning. Are there aspects of the new USPS air-lift award other than rates that differ from the prior agreement? For example, what the slight increase to the full share does this new arrangement drive even greater utilization?","Fred Smith","Yes. I will comment on that. We are very pleased with our long-term relationship with USPS. Obviously, the service and the value we provided to them. We are the sole awardee to their entire air transport business and we are very pleased about that. Obviously, there is more business that they had in play than just what we had to begin with.","So, going forward, I think, we have an opportunity to build on that relationship and build on the business that we have with them, and as Alan pointed out, it's a seven-year agreement now going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Chris Ceraso - Credit Suisse","Thanks. So, Alan, I'm hoping you can just help us bridge the fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014. You've mentioned some of the big pieces. You've got $200 million of help from pension, and pick a number maybe it's a 200 million help from the headcount reductions. You've got $70 million negative from accelerated depreciation. It sounds like fuel is a negative. I am interested to know how much you are allowing from a profit standpoint for the ongoing shift to lower yielding packages and if there is any other big pieces that are missing on the walk from 2013 to 2014.","Alan Graf","Appreciate the question. Earnings guidance is 7% to 13% of EPS of FY13 adjusted and that's all we are going to talk about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","Good morning, everyone. Since everyone wants to beat the trade down question to death, let's look at this from a different angle. I'm noticing something very interesting. Normally, when you see trade down, you see people take higher weight packages out of the system. First, because those are more expensive, you guys obviously charge per pound for Express, yet we have seen something very interesting happening. The weight per package has been going up where we are running at about 10.4 for the quarter. That's 18% higher than last year. If there's so much trade down, why are peoples increasing the size, the weight of their packages? What's happening there?","Henry Maier","Well, we have a lot of business that's in our numbers, Donald, in our acquisitions, so there is more weight per package and lot of our acquisitions around world and that maybe part of what you are seeing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon - Bernstein","All right. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit about the balance of B2B versus B2C growth in both, the Domestic Express segment and the Ground, excluding SmartPost part of the business?","Mike Glenn","Well, clearly e-commerce is a major driver of the parcel segment in the U.S. Although I would say that our growth that we have seen in the Express segment has been fairly well balanced. And as a result of a very targeted program, where our sales and marketing team have worked very closely with the Express team to ensure that we are getting the right kind of growth in the networks and we are very pleased with that, but there's no question that e-commerce is continuing to be a larger and larger driver with e-commerce sales now representing a little over 10% of total retail sales. And on top of that, our e-commerce sales have a slightly higher returns rate which also impact the business.","So, there is no question that e-commerce is a driver, but having said that we have seen strong growth in all of our sectors in the Ground business and Home Delivery and we are quite pleased with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.","Peter Nesvold - Jefferies","I think this was asked earlier, but I don't think it was answered. You have made it very clear that you are more or less agnostic to IP versus IE, so long as the freight matches the network. But when you look at that mixed shift towards IE for the next several years, do you see that as something that's sort of semi-permanent? Is this similar to what happened 10 years ago with domestic air Express going to domestic ground parcel? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek. Let me answer that question. I think that we do see that trend continuing very much like the United States, and the great news there is that as that IE continues to grow and we unleash more capacity that makes us money on those products like FTN, we actually can uncap what we have been capping, because it's been sitting in our planes kind of capped before, so that trend of increasing international economy can continue. I think Mike Glenn mentioned it before as a growth opportunity for us that actually makes more money for us.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. I've mentioned this on the call before about a year ago in May of 2012. I gave a speech at The Wings Club, which is an annual talk and it has been published in a little booklet and it's on our investor website, and I would urge you if you are interested in this to go read that speech, because it represents our view about the international cargo business.","And, the reality is that the last several years I have seen a sea change in international trade and in international transportation. And it has been caused by, number one, the increased price of fuel. I mean, we are sitting around with low growth economies and the price of brent is still north of $100 a barrel and people forget that 10, 11 years ago, it was $0.60, $0.70 per gallon versus $3 and some odd cents per gallon now. That's had enormous effects on peoples' thoughts about transportation alternatives, and it does make people willing to trade-off rate for speed.","Secondly, you have policy choices that have been made in China, in the United States and in Europe that have had big effects on the growth in world trade. As Mike Glenn mentioned, for the first time really in modern history, you have seen in the last couple of years worldwide GDP grow faster than worldwide trade. And, a few years ago, worldwide trade was growing 2, 2.5 times the growth of world GDP.","Now that is still huge market as I mentioned. The world cargo, air cargo market is $98 billion market. The sea freight market is well north of a $100 billion, so these are very large markets. They are not going to go away, but these policy choices and fuel have had very big effects on these markets. So, our job as managers is to change our systems to meet those, and that's what we have been trying to describe to you we have done.","I would say the one thing that we are a bit disappointed on, we probably should have moved a bit faster on some of our capacity, because we thought that the mix would be a little bit different than it ended up, but it's like Ground and Express. We are happy to get either one, and we just have to manage properly within those segment demands from the customers.","By the way, I got a question on the Internet.","Do you think that traditional aircraft product cycles are getting shorter? It seems that the high cost of fuel is shortening usual age of a new aircraft from 30 years to around 20 years.","I think that the answer to that question is, yes. I mean, you are seeing that with a turnover of these narrow bodies into the new generation Airbus A320 neos and the 737 MAX, and your same Boeing come out with the 777 888 999 at a period which is much shorter against the 777-300ER than would have been the case in the past and it is driven just as you surmised by the cost of fuel.","Now, what it means for us is, obviously we are re-fleeting as Alan mentioned, with these more efficient twin jet, because of the utilization that we have. I don't think that the twin jets are that we're talking about will be [obsoleted] by technology in any of the foreseeable future and the 767s, 757s are terrific for us.","The good news is, and also part of the question is, yes. Indeed. We can use 767s in addition to the new ones, because they are essentially the same and a lot of the 767s are going to be coming out of the fleets as the 787s and A350s come into place and we do anticipate that we will acquire some used airplanes which will help the capital returns in the Express business.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I will turn the conference back over to Mickey Foster for any additional or closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Before closing, I would like to mention we are changing the date of our next Investors and Lender's Meeting to late September or early October of 2014 here in Memphis.

This is of course a quarterly earnings call for FedEx, but before we get into the business issues, let me note that during the quarter we experienced two unprecedented and inexplicable tragedies.","First, the highway crash in California, the FedEx freight vehicle and a bus of students, which resulted in the worst accident in our history with 10 fatalities and others injured. Then a shooting at our FedEx Ground facility in Atlanta, by a troubled young man who before committing suicide shot six people with two seriously wounded.","All 300,000 and plus of us at FedEx grieve for those who lost their lives and those injured, and we again extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to their families and friends.","Now to the schedule business of this call. As you can see, our numbers are fairly straightforward, Ground and Freight are performing well, and Express remains on track to achieve its profit improvement plan, despite the fuel headwinds we've experienced.","This summer, two of our long serving and finest executives will be retiring in July. Cathy Ross, the Chief Financial Officer of FedEx Express is leaving after 30 years with FedEx. Mike Fryt, our Corporate Vice President of Tax is also retiring after 19 years with the company. I\u2019d like to thank Kathy and Mike for their service, their many contributions to FedEx and all of us wish them nothing but the best in their retirement.","Now let me ask, Mike Glenn, to give you our economic forecast and then, Alan Graf, will comment on our results and the FY \u201815 outlook. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred. Our U.S. GDP forecast is now 2.2% for calendar \u201814 and 3.1% for calendar \u201815. The change to calendar \u201814 is entirely due to bad weather and the inventory shift in the first quarter.","Our expectations for economic growth for the remainder of the year have actually improved somewhat. We expect industrial production growth of 3.6% this year and 3.7% in calendar \u201815.","The global economy is recovering from the Q1 setback in the U.S. and slowdown in China, and should steadily improve. We expect global growth of 2.7% in calendar \u201814 and 3.1% in calendar \u201915.","Now let me make a couple of comments on the company's yield performance by segment. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express Domestic package yield increased 0.9% in the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by weight and product mix.","The Ground package yield increased 2.9% in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by rate and discount, product mix and extra service fees.","Excluding fuel, International Export Express package yield increased 3%, primarily driven by rate and discount improvement, package weight and product mix.","And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight declined to 0.4% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Rates, however, improved during the quarter. Changes in other shipment characteristics including higher weight per shipment resulted in the year-over-year decline in the yield per hundredweight but contributed to margin improvement. The higher weight per shipment drove an increase in yield per shipment.","And now, I\u2019m going to turn it over to Alan Graf for his comments.","Alan Graf","Thank you Mike and good morning everyone. We had an outstanding fourth quarter. Our EPS of $2.46 is an increase of 15% on adjusted basis. And we achieved a corporate 10% operating margin.","Ground play prominent role in our success this quarter with 19.5% operating margin. And freight\u2019s income grew an impressive 51% versus last year's adjusted income. All of our segments increased operating income on an adjusted year-over-year basis, despite one fewer operating day.","Express had a solid quarter. Express operating income was up 3% versus last year's adjusted income and operating margin improved to 6.8% despite the significant negative net impact of fuel in the quarter.","International Priority volume stabilized after four quarters of decline. IP box volume grew 2% while lower yielding distribution services volume declined. International export yields increased 2% as improved rates, higher weight per package and favorable service mix more than offset lower fuel surcharges. These are clear indications that our yield management efforts are working.","Turning to our Ground segment. Ground achieved 19.5% operating margin benefiting from 8% higher average daily volume, an increase revenue per package. SmartPost volumes declined 8% in the quarter but volumes increased 15% excluding the changes in shipping patterns from one large customer. Overall yields increased 8% for SmartPost.","FedEx Freight also had an excellent quarter with operating income increasing $41 million versus last year's adjusted income. Freights less than truckload average daily shipments grew 12% in Q4 with 14% increase in demand for priority service.","During FY \u201814 FedEx repurchased 36.8 million shares for approximately $5 billion, 9.9 million of those were acquired in the fourth quarter. At the end of FY \u201814, we had 287 million shares outstanding. Our buyback contributed approximately $0.12 per diluted share for the quarter and $0.07 per share for the full fiscal year.","Our strong flow of cash from operations enable us to announce last week that we were boosting our dividend, our quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share for a total of $0.20 per share, up 33% from our previous dividend.","During the quarter, we announced two pricing changes. Freight increased its published fuel surcharge indices by three percentage points, effective June 2nd. Ground will apply dimensional weight pricing to all shipments, effective in January of 2015. Currently Ground only applies dim weight pricing to packages over 3 cubic feet in size. This change better aligns our pricing with our cost to deliver.","Turning now to the outlook. Based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about and the momentum we have, we project earnings of $8.50 to $9 per diluted share for FY \u201815. This outlook assumes no net year-over-year fuel impact and includes an approximately $0.45 benefit from share buyback, which were substantially completed in FY \u201814. A total of 5.3 million shares remained on our existing share repurchase authorization as of May 31 and we will complete the share repurchases this year.","We are laser focused on improving operating results of all of our operating segments. For FY \u201815, we anticipate revenue and earnings growth from ongoing improvements in all of our transportation segments with moderate global economic growth driving volume and yield increases.","Our overarching goal is to achieve annual double-digit operating margins for the total company in the near future. We expect revenues in earnings to increase at Express during FY \u201815 primarily due to improve U.S. domestic and international yields as we continue to focus on revenue quality and through ongoing execution of our profit improvement programs and great cost management.","We have an Express business plan to exit FY \u201816 with a run rate of $1.6 billion in additional operating profit compared to what we achieved in FY \u201813. This plan of course is dependent on U.S. economic and global trade growth. It also will be backend loaded as our various cost reduction and efficiency programs continue to gain traction.","Ground segment revenues and operating income are expected to grow in FY \u201815 led by volume growth across all our major services due to market share gains. We also anticipate yield growth in FY \u201815 through yield management programs including our recently announced dimensional weight rating changes.","We expect continued revenue and operating income growth at the Freight segment as well in FY \u201815 driven by volume and revenue per share per shipment increases from our differentiated LTL services as well as continued improvement in network and operational optimization. The recent increase to our fuel surcharge rates for certain LTL shipment will also benefit yields in FY \u201815.","We believe that our outlook is realistic and achievable but there are variables that can affect the outcome that are not in our control, including of course fuel prices, pension return on assets and pension plan discount rates as well as weather. Also global trade growth can have an outsized effect on our results.","Our global trade growth is improving. It is still below historical norms. We do expect the pace of trade growth improvement to continue throughout calendar year \u201814 and into calendar year \u201815. As Fred mentioned, two of our finance executives are leaving in July. Cathy Ross will be replaced with Elise Jordan who will move from her position as Senior VP of Strategic, Financial Planning and Analysis at Express. Elise has 31 years of experience at Express and although we will miss Cathy, Elise will do a fantastic job for us.","Mike Fryt, our Corporate Vice President of Tax will be replaced by Bobby Brown, who has 22 years with the company. Both Mike and Bobby were in Washington DC last week and will be there this week as well walking the halls of Congress discussing advantages of lower corporate tax rate. I\u2019d like to thank Cathy and Mike for their exemplary leadership and wish both of them well in their retirement.","Two other factors, we look at our tax rate for FY \u201815. We think the effective tax rate will be between 36% and 37% depending on the amount and source of operating income. You should note FY \u201814 was 36.3%.","Our U.S. pension plans have substantial funds to meet expected benefit payments and is well-funded. Because of our strong asset returns, we expect lower retirement plan cost in FY \u201815. Our CapEx for FY \u201814 came in below our projection at a total of $3.5 billion as some projects were deferred into FY \u201815.","CapEx for FY \u201815 is expected to increase to approximately $4.2 billion due to these deferrals as well as planned aircraft deliveries to support our fleet modernization program, one of the keys to our profit improvement program and the continued expansion of the Ground network.","We are very focused on achieving double-digit corporate operating margins in the near-term and generating healthy cash flows. Our balance sheet remains strong. All the initiatives we're working on are designed to ensure the near and long-term success of FedEx and include our goal to provide superior returns for our shareowners, which we have demonstrated greatly in FY \u201814.","Next we\u2019ll the open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And we would take our first question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Good morning. And congrats on the double-digit margins in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s been a long time. So, nice to see. But talking about that pace of gains and looking at your outlook, can you talk about the shifting buckets and how expect the pace of improvements? Now that you\u2019ve got all the employees that you would target or that accepted your plan to leave the payrolls, is that all now in the run rate number? Or can we still see some of that accrete into fiscal \u201915, maybe just talk about the pace to get to that $8.50, $9 run rate you\u2019re talking about?","Alan Graf","I\u2019m going to get Dave take the bulk of this answer, but I just want to start off by saying that, obviously the international revenue outlook and global trade outlook today are significantly lower than they were in October of 2012 when we set out the five pillars. So we've had to significantly revise how we get to the 1.6. We\u2019re still working hard. We\u2019ll still get to generally in those categories, but we have to adjust our international network to be able to reach those goals. So we significantly have less capacity than we did in October of 2012, and we will let Dave talk about what his team is doing to continue this down the road.","Dave Bronczek","Thanks, Alan. And thanks for the question, Ken. Fred commented on it and Alan did also. We are on track and on target to hit our profit improvement by the end of running out of FY\u201916. But as importantly, we're on track and on target to run out FY\u201915 on track and on target at 75% of all the profits that we actually talked about in 2012. Alan\u2019s right though, we actually have a different makeup and a different mix. We have better cost management. And partly because of the global shift of business, we had more deferred traffic that entered into our marketplace and into our network quite frankly than we did in 2012. So we had taken down some capacity. We realigned our networks. I wanted to thank all of our Express teams all around the world for actually doing a terrific job of resetting their priorities and realigning our network. And by the way in FY -- in the fourth quarter, Alan mentioned it as well, we had significant fuel headwinds in one less operating day and still beat our operating profit margin and profits year-over-year.","Fred Smith","We have a question off the Internet from [William Flan] (ph).","Unidentified Analyst","And this is a question for Bill. Moving forward, how will Freight get back to the levels of operating income seen in FY\u201906 and \u201907? Are you more focus on cost and productivity or growth initiatives at this point?","Bill Logue","Okay. Good question. Again, first, we\u2019re very pleased with our quarter. And again, as we stated back in the 2010-2011 timeframe, our objective is to get back Freight to the double-digit margins and we\u2019re very pleased with this quarter. We\u2019ve a solid business plan for FY\u201915. And I would just say that from an overall Freight perspective, our focus is on balance. We\u2019re really going after a good balance between yield and volume for the business. The operating team has done a great job on productivity. So we\u2019ll continue network design, focus on yield and volume growth as we move forward and that will continue as we march towards our objective of double-digit margins.","Operator","And we will take our next question over the phone lines from Rob Saman with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Saman - Deutsche Bank","Mike or Alan you guys talked a little bit about the Ground and way changes in your prepared remarks. Could you discuss a little bit how you see that those changes aiding the overall improvement that you're expecting with regard to the yields for the segment?","Mike Glenn","Well, thank you. The FedEx Ground didn\u2019t change the contention of the dimensional weight pricing policy that we've had in place for some time. Dimensional weight pricing is a common industry practice as you know and it\u2019s been in place for Ground for packages measuring 3 cubic feet or more for several years. So what we\u2019re really doing is bringing consistency to the Ground and Express segment by applying the dimensional weight policy to all packages. It's important to note that we announced this change several months ahead of, when we would typically announce the price change and the reason for that is to give us plenty of time to work with customers to refine their packaging specs to make sure that the packaging moving through our system and the system of our customers is the most efficient, which will benefit both the customer and FedEx. So we're taking a very collaborative approach, working with our customers on this, making sure that they have access to our packaging lab and we\u2019re working with them on a customer by customer basis as required to make necessary changes to improve their efficiency. So it will have a positive impact, obviously if we can improve the efficiency, the packaging that creates capacity in the network for us which is a positive thing.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk a little bit on the international side. It was good to hear the priority kind of flattening out a little bit. I was just wondering the couple of things. One is that maybe because of some growth you're seeing out of those regions or because market share gains or because we\u2019re kind of seeing the bottom of the trade-down impact. And then going forward regarding your investment in that area, given the kind of sluggish growth rates, what are you guys thinking in terms of just general investment? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek. Let me answer the international priority question. First of all, it\u2019s important to note that for FedEx Express international priority in our global network represents 74% of all of our international revenue. So it's always been and will always be a prominent dominant role in our network. And to the point that Alan made, our IP box grew 2% this quarter and our IP yields grew 2% this quarter. We did shift some traffic that was deferred out of our networks, that\u2019s actually benefited the customer and benefited FedEx. So just wanted to make sure that the understanding for international priority is still the vast majority of our revenue in our networks.","Fred Smith","There is a question from Art Hatfield over the Internet.","Art Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates","Can you discuss a long-term trend on CapEx beyond 2015?","Fred Smith","We\u2019re basically spending capital on two major initiatives. The first is the growth in our Ground network as we continue to exploit the great improvements that the Ground team had put in place over the last decade.","And second to modernize our aircraft fleet. We\u2019re not adding capacity. But every time we bring on one of these new fuel-efficient airplanes and replace the legacy capacity, we get immediate hit to the profitability of the company and build a much stronger long-term future. So I think we believe capital is going to stay in the same general area that you've seen it.","But as Alan mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019re very focused on improving our margins and improving our cash flow and EBITDA. So while the CapEx will remain high in absolute terms, we believe as a percentage of revenues, they should drift down, but the primary expenditure on those two programs that I just mentioned.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Thanks. Good morning. Just following up on that point, as you see the margin expansion go forward, how should we think about cash allocation from shareholder return standpoint, obviously a nice dividend increase that was announced a week ago? You're almost done with the buyback, should we expect more on that side, is that going to be more sort of regular part of the cash allocation strategy as we move into fiscal \u201815 and beyond?","Alan Graf","Hey, Chris. It\u2019s Alan. Let me say that, echoing what Fred said, we have plenty of room for investment in fleet modernization Express and Ground, as well as to continue to provide return to our shareholders. And as I said, we\u2019re going to finish the buyback the remaining authorization of 5.3 million shares, if not by the end of the quarter, certainly by the end of the calendar year. So we're continuing that.","We had great discussions with our Board about this subject and [it's a kind of focus for us] (ph), not going to comment anything at this point, but we have it right in front of us as one of the objectives to continue to do along with getting the double-digit corporate margins.","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Can you provide a little bit more color on what happened in SmartPost during the quarter? I think you mentioned it was attributed to a particular customer, just a little detail on that?","And then, how you think about the direction of SmartPost going forward, as B2C density improves, is there a desire to reduce reliance on SmartPost at all, especially as postal rate increased, so just how you think about that?","Henry Maier","Yeah. Hi, Kelly. This is Henry Maier. Year-over-year volume comps for SmartPost are really impacted by one customer who change their distribution model earlier in the year. If you exclude that one customer, SmartPost grew roughly 14 5% over the year. That's still a pretty good business.","We are uniquely positioned to ride this wave that e-commerce is generating and I\u2019ve talked about this before here, it\u2019s a portfolio play with SmartPost for largely customers who want to offer free shipping and then FedEx Home Delivery for high-touch, high-visibility customers, who choose that type of service for their product.","I don't think that those can be disconnected. Our customers increasingly are telling us that they want the option for both services in the portfolio and that\u2019s the way we think about this.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. Just curious on within Ground, what type of margins just directionally, are you expecting going forward, with the initiatives that you have there in CapEx and OpEx to grow it out, just curious on a sense for that? Thanks.","Henry Maier ","Hey, Scott. This is Henry Maier. Well, first of all, let me reiterate that the Ground team that includes me would not be satisfied with anything less than margins in the high-teens. We are laser focused on reducing our costs through state-of-the-art technology and disciplined expense control, and we\u2019re focused on sound capacity investments improving our yields and producing industry-leading margin. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens","Great. Thanks guys. Good morning. Just shifting over to the FedEx Freight segment for a moment? Could you maybe talk about what drove the strength in your LTL daily shipments in the quarter especially on the priority side. And then secondly, we've been hearing some rumblings about the potential for our second GRI in LTL role this year. Given that you guys are the market leader, is there any sort of color you could add around that, you think the market is strong enough to support a second GRI this year? Thank you.","Fred Smith","Thank you, Jack. Well, first of all let me say, we don't comment on the competitive pricing strategy at all. I couldn\u2019t speculate regarding what others might do regarding GRIs. We've announced our GRI. We announced the change to the fuel surcharges. Alan mentioned so, I can't speculate on what others might do. The growth that we\u2019re seeing at FedEx freight is driven by several things.","One is a very positive customer response to the value proposition that we have which allows the selection between priority and economy services. Two is the outstanding service that we\u2019re delivering at FedEx Freight. And the third point, which is significant as we've seen an increase in demand from small and midsize customers and that in large part is due to the great collaboration we have between the operating units all the way down to the ramp level in our sales team.","They're executing to perfection in terms of the strategy that we've laid out. And as Bill said, it's allowing us to be very efficient in terms of growing our business with the proper balance between shipment growth and yield improvement to maximize margin. So that's really what you're seeing and we're very pleased with that and we plan to continue that strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Part of the guidance for 2015 was that fuel would be flat year-over-year. I was wondering if you could give us any sensitivities around how changes in fuel might impact 2015 earnings? For example the fuel prices are 5% higher or 5% lower, what would be the risk or benefit to profits?","Fred Smith","Allison, this is a very volatile part of our business on the short-term look on the P&L. And it really depends on the timing of what happens with fuel price and our surcharges versus what happened last year with the timing of prices and surcharges. So it's not just simply fuel price, it\u2019s the relationship of fuel price to when we can catch up with the surcharge and how fast that is compared to what happened in the previous year.","So we have had some years where we\u2019ve had some thrilling impacts to the P&L both good and bad. And so what we\u2019re saying in our guidance is that right now we\u2019re not expecting for the corporation to have that happen this year but of course with things that are going on in the Middle East, it\u2019s a big wildcard. And so we want to make sure that we call that out as a risk. It\u2019s also a possible opportunity.","But if fuel prices continue to go up, there is also the elasticity impact of the size of the fuel surcharge to how our customers react to that in terms of the selection of the service that we\u2019re providing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar","Yes. Thanks. I\u2019d like to ask about an aspect of the growth strategy. Would you please explain the importance of your recent investment in the national hub in Mexico and comment on key growth drivers you find attractive in this marketplace?","Dave Bronczek","Yeah. This is Dave. That was part of the multi pack acquisition we made down there, terrific domestic company that went along with our business we've already had in Mexico. And we see a lot of trade back-and-forth from Mexico to the United States, its increasing. A lot has shifted out of Asia quite frankly into Mexico. So the acquisition we made several years ago now is very valuable for our going forward profitability.","It\u2019s also part of the whole network done in the Latin America. As Mexico play such a key role in that whole part of the world. So it's a good call out. I appreciate that. Their hub is up and running, 65,000 handling packages a day and it can go up from there. So we\u2019re doing very well down there and Juan Cento and his team are to be commended for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Mike, I was hoping to ask you a little bit more on the dim weight, I think in the past you talked about dim weight adding $100 million or so to the revenue line? Is this change bigger than that and along those lines, dim weight is not something you addressed in your annual price increases, should that change or is this sort of something you put in place, let it go for few years and won\u2019t really affect the pricing beyond this year? Thank you.","Mike Glenn","Well, first of all, it would be difficult for me to speculate on the impact of the Ground dimensional weight price change, because as I mentioned, one other things that we are working on right now is helping our customers utilize more efficient packaging.","I don't think I have to tell you, if you receive any kind of packages at your home, whether their cookies from grandma or an e-commerce package, they're not always packed efficiently.","And so there is sufficient opportunity out there for us to work with customers to make better packaging decisions, which would obviously, significantly, impact the extent to which the dim weight change is actually applied in terms of billing.","So, I certainly can't speculate, would not speculate on the bottom line impact dimensional weight change. But we are constantly evaluating all of our pricing policies and as you recall several years ago, we made a change to the dim weight divisor for both Express and Ground that has served FedEx well. We followed that up with this change and we will continue to evaluate those.","But we look at dimensional weight pricing changes, GRIs and other surcharge and an extra service charge fees as part of an entire pricing strategy and yield management strategy.","Alan Graf","This is Alan. I want to add to that a little bit. It\u2019s actually more beneficial from return on invested capital standpoint to have our customers adjust their packaging and for us to collect the dim surcharge. That\u2019s because we basically get free space with no capital investment. So it's equal driver if not more important for that to occur.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith here. Let me make a comment on this in the context of a broader issue and that is the initiative on behalf of the entire LTL and Ground Parcel industry to have the federal standards for the twin trailers which are the standard in these sectors increase from 28-feet to 33-feet.","A lot of time the general news media talks about quote the trucking industry, of course, it's divided into two parts, the truckload sector, which uses 53-foot trailers and often times those trailers are used to pull very heavy loads, which make it controversial in terms of road repair and so forth.","In the Ground Parcel business and the LTL business, in both cases, you cube out long before you weight out. So if the federal standard were increased, there would be millions and millions of fewer miles driven per day, it\u2019s about an 18% increase in cube, massive amounts of fuel saved and CO2 emissions avoided and you would actuarially eliminate over 400 accidents per year just by reducing the number of vehicles on the road.","So the entire industry is behind this and we're very hopeful it will pass in Congress soon, because again, it's safer, it's more efficient and it\u2019s less fuel, and it\u2019s an exactly the same vein as this dimensional weight increase.","At the end of the day with fuel prices where they are today, this industry must do everything it can to more efficiently utilize the cubic space, because we do not come up against weight limits only against cube limit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks very much. I have a question for Henry on Ground side. We've seen margin expand at the fastest sequential rate we have seen in years, but rates are still slightly below last year's level? And so I am just trying to understand, couple things, one, can you help us understand like the, what drove the magnitude of growth sequentially, obviously, there is some seasonality in there, but it has been a noticeable pickup and acceleration? And can we assume that this sort of momentum continues so we can see margins in Ground sort of rival the fiscal \u201812 levels again? Thanks.","Henry Maier","Thanks, Tom. Well, I mean, the short answer is, is that the reason why we had the margin improvement over the third quarter is we stop piling snow, that\u2019s -- I mean, that's the simple answer. I mean, once the weather went back to be and something close to normal and we remove a lot of those expenses. I mean everything normalize pretty quickly both on the operation side of the house for us and what we see with respect to customer shipping patterns.","In regard to your question about fourth quarter margins versus last year, the biggest reason for the differences is simply a higher network expansion cost year-over-year. We have talked about our increase CapEx for capacity expansion. You can't grow 10% a year the way we've been growing the last couple years without add more capacity to the network and we\u2019ve had to do that. And we do that from very disciplined standpoint with very high ROIC hurdles before we approve the project.","I don\u2019t know what more I can say about that, I hope that answers your question. But, I said at the outset here that, we are just simply not satisfied with anything other than margins in the high-teens at FedEx Ground and our operations team works very hard to control expenses and when we design these facilities, particularly the new ones, they include state-of-the-art material handling equipment to reduce our costs over the long-term. Thanks.","Fred Smith","We have a question over the Internet from Ben Hartford at Baird.","Ben Hartford - Baird","It basically is about acquisitions and will our strategy change as our capacity to support both increase returns to shareholders and larger scale acquisitions?","Fred Smith","Let me take the front part of this and then ask, Alan, if he wants to comment on it. Our policy towards acquisitions is not going to change, basically, we would look at a lot of things, but there are three factors that govern whether we have any interest and an acquisition whether it's a large entity or a small tuck-in entity.","Number one, that there is got to be a strategic rationale for making the acquisition, second, that the technology, particularly the IT part and the corporate culture fit and third, that we don't overpay, because there is no reason to overpay for something and thereby decrease margins or your earnings. So, Alan, do you want to comment further on that?","Alan Graf","We like acquisitions. We are always looking with Fred\u2019s three criteria, I think, guiding us. I think, we have made some great acquisitions over the years, Flying Tigers, Caliber, which was RPS, which is now Ground, which you will probably have more EBITDA this year than we paid for it.","We have also not made some acquisitions that had been great. We have a culture fit or it\u2019s going to be too expensive and as we look back on it, we are thankful for some of the moves we haven\u2019t made. So, it\u2019s a two-way street. My eyes are always open and we will continue to look, but that\u2019s where we have always been.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Back to the pricing side of things, the dim pricing at FedEx Freight, we haven't seen density based pricing in LTL for awhile, but there's been a lot of chatter about getting rid of the old classification system and moving to more of a dimensional pricing there. How do you see the pricing direction at FedEx Freight? Can you move to dimensional soon? What will be the impediments to doing so?","Mike Glenn","This is Mike. Clearly, there are multiple considerations when making these pricing decisions. We operate in a very fragmented LTL space and certainly aware of some of the optional dimensional density-based pricing that is being offered in the segment to some customers. As the leader in the LTL industry in terms of revenue and volume, certainly we have a clear view of the market conditions and we will consider any opportunities to more efficiently price the LTL service. I think it is important to note that the class system that is used today is overly complicated. Now having said that, that doesn't mean the change occurs quickly. These are -- this is a pricing system that has been in place for decades and will take time to modify many customers like it and they don't want to get rid of it. And some customers are more open to different pricing strategies. So we will continue to evaluate the opportunities and work with customers, but I think it would serve the industry well over the long haul if the LTL pricing environment was simplified.","Bill Logue","Dave, let me add couple of comment. In this fiscal year, we will be rolling out some of the dim capture machines out there to really go out there and capture dims on our current business. Twofold, number one, it helps us with our classification and current pricing for existing business. But also more importantly, it builds up our costing files, we can really see as we go forward with the renegotiations on contracts or so forth to get it better really look at the actual costing. So once we build that database, it\u2019s going to help us build -- help you really long-term to go out there and move towards that, as Mike said, the dimensional-based pricing solutions which will come over a period of time.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Andrew Gordon - Wolfe Research","Good morning. This is Andrew Gordon on for Scott Group. Henry, I just wanted to piggyback off of a Kelly\u2019s earlier question on SmartPost if you don\u2019t mind and sorry I\u2019m asking to repeat yourself. But, can you clarify what do you mean by that one large customer\u2019s change in shipping patterns as you call it? I\u2019m wondering if they shifted volumes to the regular ground business or if it\u2019s possible that they are differing some volumes? Or do you expect that this is just a complete exit of their business? And then lastly, was this strong yield growth in SmartPost, did you say was exclusively due to this customer\u2019s actions or largely impacted by it? Thanks.","Henry Maier","Yes. I think the short answer is that the distribution change was made to go directly to the Postal Service as opposed to using SmartPost to get their packages into the USPS. Regarding yields, we\u2019ve been focused on yields of SmartPost for some time. We are confident we will replace this customer\u2019s volume with volume that is not only higher yielding but has better margins than the business it left. I can also tell you and I can\u2019t tell you to what extent, but we believe that some of that volume also ended up in other FedEx networks. And the other thing I would say is that I don't believe all of it will leave. So hope that answers your question.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Yes. Good morning, everyone. I want -- kind of a two-part question, but both related. I want to follow up from Dave's earlier comments that it looks like you guys are well on track to achieve the 75% of the $1.6 billion in the run rate by the end of fiscal \u201815. Dave, does that mean that Express EBIT could actually be north of $2 billion for fiscal \u201916? And then secondly, Alan, I also want to follow up on your conversation around reaching the full $1.6 billion, you did say that you're looking for better domestic and international trade growth. Can you perhaps expand upon that? What type of growth levels are you looking for to achieve those numbers?","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave. I will go first. I am just going to comment that what we talked about in 2012 was our profit improvement plan and I just wanted to say again we\u2019re on target. We got there a little differently. And so I'm not sure how Alan all adds it up at the end of the day, but for us what was important for us is we ended up, coming up with the plan that we are now executing, for the end of FY \u201815 to be on target and the end of FY \u201816 to be on target. Alan?","Alan Graf","It used to be that international trade was a multiple of global GDP. And those days have passed and however we are, as Mike told you, looking for improvement in the global GDP through calendar \u201814 and certainly end of \u201815. And with that, we do expect global trade will pick up. I don't think it will be a multiple of GDP but we do expect it to pick up. And when it does, we have the best, fastest, most global network out there and we should benefit from it.","Fred Smith","In that regard, we got a question over the Internet from Michael Mathay, AllianceBernstein. I'll take part of this and then ask Dave to put some color on it.","Michael Mathay - AllianceBernstein","Can you provide an update on the Osaka hub and long-term impact for the Express business?","Fred Smith","Our strategy in the Express business to reiterate is to operate an unduplicated backbone priority network that allows people to move door-to-door express shipments of parcels and light freight between -- between almost any two points on the planet within one to two business days and not dissimilar to Freight and Ground. We also offer an economy service, which in the main is moved on other people\u2019s networks because we have an extra day or so to process and customers make the choice between priority and economy.","Same pickup-and-delivery operations, same information technology, same scanning and so forth and we think that that is a very winning strategy. The Osaka hub was an extraordinarily important piece to this puzzle. And I\u2019ll ask Dave to comment on it because he was out there for the opening. But with our triple seven airplanes, we can come off of the Osaka hub and go straight into our major hubs in the United States which we do everyday and back to our hubs in Europe. And it's the fastest possible service with the latest possible pickup and the ability to add any point on the network without having to have a transpacific frequency.","So this has been an integral part of our long-term strategy and plan. And I'll ask Dave to comment on it because again he was out there just recently.","Dave Bronczek","Thanks Fred and that's exactly right and that nothing short of spectacular. I was there in April for the ribbon cutting. The employees there are fantastic. The customers all showed up in big numbers and they are supporting our network out there and they told us that they would and they have. Fred is right, you can come off of Osaka and go all the way to Europe into our Charles de Gaulle hub.","You can go to the United States, the fastest latest pickup times. You can come off of there with deferred traffic, which we also have. You load up all of our containers and all of those flights and so they're all full. It's been one of our better strategic initiatives that we put in place in many, many years. And I can tell you that it's very efficient, very successful. You can flex up off of that hub as trade goes up and you can flex down if you were to go down. So it's actually perfect.","Fred Smith","Let me just add that one of the objective that we\u2019ve been after aside from the fact of improving our operating margin is to do what Dave just said is to provide much more flexibility in this network so that we can move much quicker than we\u2019ve been able to do in the past, which should prevent us from having big down cycles as we react to this big huge fixed cost network. We\u2019re getting more and more nimble and we\u2019re going to continue to improve that over the next 24 months.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you and good morning gentlemen. What\u2019s your outlook as it relates to FedEx trade networks growth for fiscal year 2015. I\u2019m just curious how should we think about both the air and ocean side as it relates to FedEx trade networks? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave again and then Fred wanted to comment as well. But let me just say that it\u2019s been a very big part of our whole portfolio. It's been very significant when we talk to very big customers or small but in the main, very big and they are looking for fast overnight. We've got that with our triple sevens and one they want deferred, we now have that in a big way with our ocean forwarding business in FedEx trade networks but more importantly, we now can go to a customer and bundle the whole portfolio in a way that we couldn't do in the past. So it's been very successful.","Mike Glenn","I just wanted to make a comment about the international transportation segment. I gave three speeches over the winter, which are published on the FedEx IR website. And I think one of the problems actually sometimes with people commenting on international trade and the air cargo business specifically is you don't break it into the granular sectors that we see on a day-to-day basis. And you really have to understand it in terms of the door-to-door express segment, the general air cargo segment and the ocean freight segment. And what customers are increasingly doing is moving to a more just-in-time door-to-door regime for the things that are important.","And in that segment it is both priority and economy because you're talking about the difference between one to two days and two to four days, still massively faster than sea freight. But as the cost of fuel continues to go up, people are doing all kinds of things including relocating things to Mexico, which is why we several years ago bought a wonderful company in Mexico and we\u2019re now uniquely positioned for the cross-border NAFTA trade there. And then the commodity freight is sort of toggling between the express segment and the sea freight segment. And that's where people get a little bit off base is they tend to look at the market as much more holistic than it actually is. ","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon - Bernstein","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Dave, maybe you could comment a little bit on productivity and capacity utilization levels you\u2019re seen in the Express network today? And how much better you think those levels could get over the course of the next years in restructuring program?","Dave Bronczek","Yes. Thanks for the question. And I meant to comment on this earlier. We talk about international all the time, but our US domestic Express team is doing a fantastic job. They've had attrition and they haven\u2019t backfilled people in the past and going forward that will continue to be the case with consolidated facilities, with consolidated routes. Productivity is going up. Efficiency is going up. The restructuring transformation in the United States is very significant in our plans going forward. So the United States team that\u2019s listening to this call, I wanted to thanks them and congratulate them as well. We talk about international up, but as importantly the United States Express team.","Alan Graf","David, this is Alan. I just want to add that our use of technology here is unbelievable. The productivity that we\u2019re driving, the efficiencies that we\u2019re driving through the great technology that we have and that we\u2019re developing is making a big impact on this productivity issues. We couldn\u2019t do without it frankly and there\u2019s more to come here. And we\u2019re getting traction everyday and I\u2019d like to turn over to my partner Rob Carter to talk about that.","Rob Carter","One of the key elements of the profit improvement program was technology. Whether it was taking down the cost of technology and deploying more efficient and modern technology across the board, we\u2019re helping our operating friends operate their businesses more effectively with great technologies. We\u2019re proud to be a part of these movements and there is more to come. Like Alan said, we\u2019re making significant investments in modernizing and simplifying our technology as well as improving speed to market.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research","Thank you very much. Lot of my questions have been hit. Alan, real quick, you mentioned the pension expense being reconfigured for next year. The markets are up quite a bit over the past year. Could you quantify how much lower you believe your pension expense could be in 2015 versus 2014 in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that forward guidance?","Alan Graf","It will definitely be a significantly lower number in \u201815 and \u201914 as was \u201814 versus \u201913. Jeff, it was on the back of very strong return on assets. We actually had another discount rate decrease at our measurement date, which was May 31, which was a little surprising. But offsetting that are we have merit increases, we have healthcare increases. Hopefully as the company does better, we\u2019re going to rebuild our annual incentive pools to higher level. So we\u2019re going to use some of that pension good news to put in it additional programs for our employees and that's all in the guidance.","Operator","Thank you. It appears there are no further questions at this time.

Alan will provide further insight and our outlook.","FedEx is on track for another record holiday shipping season and we're pleased to say the outstanding service around the world and across our portfolio during the second quarter has continued into December.","We plan year round to meet the intense challenges of the peak season as average daily volumes can more than double with heavy demand for residential e-commerce deliveries.","Most important, let me thank the more than 400,000 FedEx team members around the world for their outstanding efforts to keep our Purple Promise, which is simply stated, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","It's become increasingly clear to all of us that trust and reliability matter to customers when they choose who will be delivering packages to their doors.

Let me express our appreciation to the thousands of FedEx professionals who worked around the clock and tirelessly to mitigate this unprecedented event.","Dave will update you in his discussion of overall global operations. We expect yield and volume growth at all of our transportation segments will support revenue and earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2018.","Our plans remain on target to improve operating income at the FedEx Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. And our goal remains to increase earnings, margins, cash flows and returns, and we are confident we can do so.","We're encouraged by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation advancing in Congress at this very moment. This legislation offers pro-growth, pro-business tax reform solutions that will power the economy, increase business investment, expand job opportunities, and enhance incomes and improve U.S. competitiveness. We, at FedEx, hope all of you have a wonderful holiday season.","And now let me turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon, everyone. Our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $3.18, up 15% from an adjusted $2.77 last year. This year's and last year's quarterly consolidated earnings were adjusted for TNT integration expenses of $0.33 and $0.18 per diluted share, respectively.","As reported and adjusted second quarter earnings this year reflect the estimated negative impact from the TNT cyberattack of $0.31 per diluted share. Results for the quarter improved primarily due to higher base rates, volume growth and a favorable net impact from fuel at each of our transportation segments.","Second quarter results also include a tax benefit of approximately $80 million or $0.29 per diluted share from foreign tax credits associated with the dividend paid from our foreign operations. Our effective tax rate was 32% for the quarter and 35.4% for the first half.","Turning to the segments and starting with Express. Adjusted operating income increased 11% to $813 million, driven by revenue growth and positive net impact from fuel and continued cost efficiencies. Adjusted operating margin improved 20 basis points to 8.7%.","The cyberattack at TNT impacted our as-reported and adjusted results by an estimated $100 million for the Express segment, primarily from loss of revenue due to decreased shipments in the TNT network.","As we noted last quarter, we are accelerating portions of our TNT integration as a result of the cyberattack. TNT integration expenses for the second quarter were $96 million for Express and are included in the GAAP results. Despite the challenges from the cyberattack, total international average package volume increased 5%.","At Ground, operating income increased 12% to $521 million, and operating margin increased to 10.6%. Operating results improved due to revenue growth, partially offset by higher purchase transportation, network expansion and staffing cost, as well as increased self-insurance reserves. Ground continues to work on further restraining costs.","At Freight, operating income increased 34% to $118 million, driven by a 7% increase in LTL revenue per shipment. Freight's operating margin improved 120 basis points year-over-year to 6.7% as revenue quality initiatives continue to benefit results.","For FedEx Corp., we are increasing our FY '18 forecast due to enhanced revenue quality, solid demand trends and our success in restoring business impacted by this summer's cyberattack. We expect to see improved financial results in the second half.","Yield and volume growth at all of our transportation segments are expected to support revenue and earnings growth in the second half prior to any mark-to-market benefit plan adjustments.","In addition, we are implementing various cost reductions at Ground for the remainder of FY '18. We expect ongoing but diminishing financial impacts from the cyberattack in the second half of fiscal '18 in the form of lower revenues.","The earnings forecast before year end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments and excluding expenses related to TNT Express integration and certain first quarter FedEx Trade Networks legal matters is now $12.70 to $13.30 per diluted share for FY '18.","This forecast assumes moderate economic growth, current U.S. tax laws and continued recovery from the cyberattack. Our capital spending forecast for FY '18 is still $5.9 billion although this may increase if the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is enacted.","The TNT integration continues, spanning over 200 countries. By the end of FY '20, we plan to have combined pickup and delivery operations at the local level, one global and regional air and ground network and consolidated operations, customs clearance, sales and back office information technology systems.","We now expect the integration expense over 4 years to be approximately $1.4 billion, including restructuring charges. Approximately $450 million of that expense is expected in FY '18.","Our estimate for the integration expenses has increased due to our acceleration of the integration process and additional investments to move TNT information technology, operations and commercial infrastructure through a FedEx platform.","In addition, we have identified new opportunities to improve our integrated business capabilities for greater profitability in periods beyond FY '20. A portion of the incremental integration expenses relates to establishing a new international corporate structure so that we may leverage synergies to maximize our international profitability, ultimately benefiting our effective tax rate.","We remain committed to our target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in additional operating profit for the FedEx segment in FY '20 versus FY '17, which includes TNT synergies, as well as base business and other operational improvements across the entire global FedEx Express network.","This target assumes moderate economic growth, current accounting rules and U.S. tax laws and continued recovery from the cyberattack. Our effective tax rate forecast is now 33% to 34% before year end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. We have lowered the upper end of the range. None of our forecast reflect any potential changes from tax reform.","So turning to tax reform. I know there are a lot of questions about possible changes for us as a result of that. So let me cover as much as I can. We welcome the possibility of lower corporate tax rate, a territorial tax system and 100% expensing of qualifying capital if these provisions are signed into law.","Any capital acceleration for FedEx would primarily be for replacement of equipment and technology. If tax reform is enacted, we expect our uses of cash from tax savings would include, optimizing CapEx to capture the benefits of 100% expensing to further grow the business and create even more upward mobility for our team members.","Funding our pension plans beyond our current forecast. Increasing the dividend as our board may approve. Continuing our stock repurchase program at our current modest levels, and investing in M&A where it makes sense.","As Raj will discuss, U.S. GDP could increase materially next year as a result of U.S. tax reform. If this occurs, we would likely increase capital expenditures and hiring to accommodate the additional volumes triggered from this incremental GDP growth.","If the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is enacted as set forth in the Joint Conference Report, we estimate our earnings per share could increase by $4.40 to $5.50 per diluted share for FY '18 before mark-to-market year end pension accounting adjustments, primarily due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. This range also includes an estimated $0.85 to $1 per diluted share due to a lower tax rate on fiscal 2018 earnings for the last 5 months of fiscal '18.","As we have stated many times in the past, we would like to see a level playing field for corporate taxes. This tax reform bill would go a long way in making U.S. based corporations more competitive globally.","We have delivered great service levels again this peak thanks to our careful forecasting and planning that results from working closely with our customers to manage record setting seasonal volumes and also thanks to the dedication of hundreds of thousands of team members all over the world that make this happen.","Now we'll turn the call over to Raj.","Rajesh Subramaniam","Thank you, Alan, and good afternoon, everyone. I will open with our economic update and outlook and discuss our revenue performance and business conditions in each segment and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and enhancements to the FedEx portfolio.","We see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. forecast is up slightly on solid current momentum. Consumer confidence is at a 17-year high, and solid PMI readings show the industrial sector is expanding. Passage of U.S. tax reform could add materially to next year's U.S. GDP forecast. Globally, our world GDP forecast for this year and the next reflects the best growth since 2011 with a synchronized global upturn supporting trade volume growth.","The next few slides show details of revenue, volume and yield performance by transportation segment. Overall, it's clear that our pricing strategies allow us to grow volumes and increase yields across the portfolio and are succeeding in doing so.","For our U.S. domestic express business, revenue and yield increased 6% and 5%, respectively. Excluding fuel surcharge, the yield per package increased 3% due to our continued focus on revenue quality.","Despite the impact of cyberattack at TNT, FedEx International export package revenue increased 7% year-over-year in Q2, and yield increased 4%. Excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields declined slightly.","The Ground segment revenues saw double-digit growth at 12% in Q2 with volume and yield up as well, as e-commerce continues to drive growth. Excluding fuel, the yield per package increased 4%.","At FedEx Freight, the revenue per LTL shipment increased 7% mainly driven by our revenue quality efforts. Excluding the impact from fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up 5%.","Turning to peak. I wanted to provide some very exciting updates. As Fred mentioned, we are proud of the terrific service we have provided even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx. We continue to experience many of the trends that have been growing in recent years: the increased demand for larger, heavier packages; and heavy demand on Mondays.","Thanks to the close collaboration with our customers, we were able to plan and engineer our networks and provide excellent service. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our more than 400,000 team members around the world who are continuing to work hard to deliver the holidays during the home stretch of the season. Our team members are the best in the business, and they're always focused on one thing: delivering an outstanding experience for our customers.","As e-commerce continues to grow, customers are looking for new options for access to FedEx. This year, we have dramatically increased our retail access with approximately 8,200 locations added to the FedEx Onsite network with well-known retailers, including Walgreens. Customers can drop off pre-labeled FedEx Express and FedEx Ground shipments or returns. They can also redirect shipments to hold at a FedEx Office or a FedEx Onsite location for pickup.","We now have a convenience network of over 10,000 locations, including Walgreens, Kroger, Albertsons, FedEx Office, and other participating locations. And for those procrastinators, here's a saving grace: pickup is now available on Christmas Day in the vast majority of more than 7,500 Walgreens locations. Our presence has never been stronger during peak than it is today.","We also encourage customers to use FedEx Delivery Manager options to direct packages, thousands of secure and convenient hold locations. Enrollments have almost doubled year-over-year, and the percentage of residential deliveries being delivered to FedEx Delivery Manager enrollees have almost doubled as well. We also have a unique strategy for peak pricing this year but we are not applying an additional peak surcharge to all residential packages, only oversized packages or packages that require additional handling.","This strategy was different from others in the marketplace, but we felt it is important to be mindful of our small and medium customers. Obviously, peak is not over but we have seen very good traction with the small and medium customers, and we will continue to monitor and measure the informal pricing decisions for next year's peak season.","Once again, we are very proud of the results across the portfolio in the second quarter and the outstanding service provided so far this peak season. We believe we are well positioned for the remaining days leading up to Christmas and look forward to helping the holidays arrive once again for our customers around the world.","Let me now turn the call over to Dave for his remarks. Dave?","David Bronczek","Okay. Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. I also want to thank all of our more than 400,000 team members for their dedication year-round and especially in these days leading up to Christmas.","These team members are working right now. They're on the road, they're in the air, and they're probably at your doorstep delivering the holidays around the world. We are proud to report improved financial and operational results, driven by strength across the FedEx portfolio.","This success results from incredible collaboration among sales, marketing and operations. Operations, of course, is our frontline, picking up, sorting, delivering packages all over the globe.","But FedEx has some of the smartest minds in the industry in sales and marketing, working with our customers every day, all year long, constantly innovating our service and marketing our portfolio around the world.","First, let me start off with FedEx Express. They grew their revenues and profits, as Alan just mentioned, despite the impact of the TNT Express cyberattack. The underlying fundamentals of the business remained very strong, with higher base rates and growth in international package and freight services. Cost efficiencies are also improving. For example, we continue to see higher aircraft fleet reliability, which increases our productivity.","I'm also very happy to say that at TNT, we are seeing strong service levels, and operations are back to normal after the June cyberattack. The IT recovery process is complete. We have improved our reliability, we have improved our security, and we are also increasing our investments to expedite portions of the integration process.","While we have been successful in our efforts so far, restoring the full confidence of our customers is our key goal. We expect the impact of the cyberattack on our financial results to diminish in our fiscal second half. Our focus remains on service to our customers, course our customers' priority and hardening our IT environment.","The successful integration of TNT and FedEx Express remain a key driver for the FedEx Express FY '20 operating income improvement target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion over FY '17 results, which we are now reaffirming.","Next, FedEx Ground achieved significant growth in revenue and operating income. We're starting to benefit from the cost-cutting measures we are implementing to address the evolving business conditions. We are improving revenue quality and reviewing long-term capital plans to balance capacity expansion with pricing and volume growth.","From a service perspective, we are having the best peak ever at FedEx Ground. I should add we are having the best peak ever at FedEx Express and FedEx Freight. We are also pleased that Bob Henning has joined the FedEx Ground team in Pittsburgh as the CFO there.","Bob's experience in strategic finance coupled with the FedEx Ground team's immense knowledge of Ground operations and the industry trend will be instrumental as we chart our course for the future.","And finally, last but certainly not least, FedEx Freight stands out with tremendous growth in revenue and profitability as we benefit from disciplined pricing strategies and investments to improve safety and efficiency. We expect this to continue and look for this segment to have one of its best years in over a decade.","With our global portfolio, we're confident of our ability to achieve our goals, which include increasing our earnings, increasing our margins, cash flows and returns.","And with that, we will answer your submitted questions, and I'll turn it back over to Mickey.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","A - Mickey Foster","Okay. We have submitted questions from the Internet.","Frederick Smith","Okay. Mickey, let me take a few that came right in as they apply directly to a couple of the remarks that were made, and then we have a list of questions that came in before the meeting that we assigned people to answer.","So Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Scott Group of Wolfe all would like more clarity about Alan's comments about the increase in TNT integration expense. So Alan?","Alan Graf","I'll start, then I'll turn it over to David Cunningham. If the concern is, are we going to get the return on the additional investment of $800 million, the answer is clearly yes. Somo of that will come beyond the FY '20 period as I mentioned in my earlier remarks.","You should also know that we're spending a significant amount on our tax structure that is below the line, and that will have benefits even with the new -- if the new tax law passes. That will be substantial and that we never quantified for you in the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.","So I'm convinced that we're doing the right thing here. A lot of this was a result of the cyberattack, where we decided to move much more aggressively on hardening and turning the FedEx platforms, and I think David Cunningham and Rob Carter can add a little color to that.","David Cunningham","Well, I mean, Alan, there's not a lot to add in terms of what you just said. I would just add that we are convinced that the additional spending is going to generate results well beyond the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in the marketplace.","Robert Carter","The only thing I'll add and just very concisely is on the heels of the cyberattack, we've become much more aggressive about improving the security posture, reliability and speeding up the integration of the technology platforms.","We've been successful on all three fronts. Dave mentioned those, but we're going very aggressively at moving the TNT enterprise to the more stable and reliable FedEx systems.","Frederick Smith","Okay. That was Rob Carter, our CIO, who just spoke there. I'm not sure he said - that he was entering there, but he obviously knows [what all he speaks] [ph].","Frederick Smith","Now we have three questions about tax, cash flows and CapEx. Matt Troy of Wells Fargo, about CapEx levels on an absolute dollar basis over the next three years, will it decline? Ravi Shanker, over the proposed tax resolution, did your free cash flow performance or free cash flow go up as much as EPS?","And finally, from Lee Klaskow of Bloomberg Intelligence, will FedEx recognize further foreign tax credits in the remainder of FY '18?\" He asked, will it be similar to the $80 million in 2Q? Alan, why don't you answer that last one and then talk about free cash flow\u2026","Alan Graf","Okay. We don't plan to recognize anymore foreign tax credits this year. Things can change, but I think we've done the plan that we need to do for this point. Obviously, Matt's and Ravi's questions are related. I think that with 100% expensing, as I've said at several of the last meetings that if we got that in the new tax law, we would likely increase our CapEx on an absolute basis.","One of the most important things that we're doing in the company is our fleet \u2013 re-fleeting that Express. And if there's possibility to accelerate that, it's the highest return project that we have out there and it's something we would look at.","So Ravi, I'm not sure how you define free cash flow, but in my opening comments, I did mention that we plan to make additional pension fund contributions. And the way I measure it, that would be a reduction in free cash flow.","Although since it's optional, some people don't count that. Having said that, it won't go up as much as EPS because of what I said about CapEx. I hope that gives you the color that you need.","Frederick Smith","Okay. Let's turn to some of the questions that were submitted in advance. Helane Becker would like to know about the two recent feeder aircraft that we ordered, the Cessna C408, the new airplane, and the ATR 72-600 large cargo door airplanes are they growth or replacement aircraft or both. And Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch would like to know how big of a CapEx program this is. So David Cunningham?","David Cunningham","[Technical Difficulty] as replacement capital and a part of our fleet modernization. Our current fleet of ATRs and 208s are 25 to 26 years old and will be approaching 30 years by 2020 when we take the first deliveries. These are twin-engine aircraft with modern glass cockpits, large cargo door, which is different than the others. And they are also containerized versus being bulk-loaded.","And so we're creating a lot of efficiency but we're also creating the opportunity to handle product to markets that we haven't been able to handle in some of the smaller aircraft to this point. So we're very excited about this.","The capital is roughly equivalent to one wide-body aircraft per year. And the orders of the aircraft that we're talking about are 408s, 50 orders and 50 options. The ATRs are 30 and 20. So in terms of the ATRs, we're talking about 6 aircraft per year. And the 408s, we're talking about 12 aircraft per year.","Frederick Smith","The next questions are about Ground margins, also from Helane Becker, wanting to know, does it make sense to continue invest in long-term Ground facilities? Jairam Nathan of Daiwa, how do you see FedEx capacity to handle e-commerce deliveries given the stronger-than-expected growth this year? Should we expect another expansion binge?","Frederick Smith","I'm not sure we've ever binged on expansion. I think they've been pretty well-planned. That's a joke. And CapEx, well, it increased as growth rates surpassed expectations. So I'm going to ask Henry to take both of those.","Henry Maier","Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Our investments in capacity and automation over the last several years have enabled our industry-leading service, including at the busiest times of the year, and we believe reliable service is a key factor in our continued growth.","However, we're approaching a transition point where you will begin to see us dial back network expansion CapEx as we complete certain critical capacity projects already underway.","And we can do this while still effectively serving the growing e-commerce markets because automation and technology improves efficiency, productivity and utilization of network capacity.","Frederick Smith","So we have another question on Ground. What are the specific steps and financial benefits you can take to improve Ground margins to mid-teens? Christian Wetherbee of Citi.","Frederick Smith ","I'll just say we have all kinds of plans at Ground to improve the margins there, and we're confident we can do so. But none of these tax things, we would be willing to discuss with the general public.","Frederick Smith","Is there a general range for the cost savings on delivering to a drop-off location versus home delivery? What percent of Ground shipments are going to pickup and drop-off locations currently? Todd Fowler of KeyBanc. Raj, do you want to take that?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes. Todd, thank you for the question. We don't break out the operational cost for pickup and delivery or percentage of volume for FedEx Onsite or FedEx Office. But as you can imagine, delivering multiple packages to a retail location is far cheaper than delivering a single package to a home.","But the real key here is the advantage of FedEx Onsite is the convenience that we provide for our customers and ultimately providing a win-win-win solution for the shipper, the consumer and for FedEx. As an example, porch piracy is a significant concern that can be allayed by the service.","Now as I mentioned already, we have more than 10,000 FedEx Onsite locations, and we are very, very pleased with the usage trends that we have seen so far. Thank you.","Frederick Smith","So Alan, got one here from Chris Wetherbee from Citi about the EPS estimate for the TNT cyberattack. Alan?","Alan Graf","So Chris, you asked a question about - is $1.20 still a good estimate for the year? We've had $1.10 in the first and second quarters, but it dropped significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter. So I'm not sure it's even going to be worthy of us discussing the second half of the year. So that's the best answer I can give you at this point.","Frederick Smith","So we have a number of questions now on Amazon and e-commerce from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Given the high cost of residential deliveries and capacity stress from handling peak demand, is it actually beneficial to have some customers take in-house some of their deliveries? Or is the detrimental effect on delivery density a stronger negative than the demand relief?","Frederick Smith","We've talked about this yesterday. We're not 100% sure exactly what the question is, but let me give a broad explanation of how we deal with these issues, and I think it will answer the question that you have in mind.","As I've said on a number of occasions, and Dave Bronczek's gone into a lot detail on this, as has Henry Maier and Raj, the secret in our business is to, one, effectively match commercial and residential deliveries so that we don't get too far out of balance and we're achieving our profitability goals.","Now as we just discussed, we put a lot of bow wave expenses to improve and expand our ground network. And as Alan has said over and over again, we anticipate those are going to have substantial long-term returns and improvements to profitability.","And one of the things that I've mentioned over and over again on this call is many times, it seems like some of you are trying to talk about FedEx Ground, Inc. or FedEx Express, Inc. rather than FedEx Corporation, Inc. And by that, I mean when we're knocking the ball out of the park in one segment, we then say, perhaps we can make some investments someplace else so that we can improve their longer term profitability.","So we deal with our opcos as a portfolio of solutions, and not all of them are being run by us to maximize returns every quarter or we couldn't make this long-term investment. So going back to the question, you've got to have a disciplined approach to the mix of commercial and residential packages.","Having said that, we are quite confident that we can handle vastly larger amounts of e-commerce packages in the future at profitable rates because of the investments we've made, these automated facilities that Henry talked about. We have two major hubs coming online next year and a couple more after that. These are substantial improvements to our ability to handle this type of traffic on a profitable, long-term basis.","The other thing that I would mention to you that is often missed in these evaluations or the comments about the e-commerce business, it requires a close collaboration between FedEx and our customers to choreograph these massive industrial systems during these peak seasons.","We will begin literally the day after New Year's planning for next peak season. And we have very close relationships with our major customers. And I think the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Dave told you we're having an outstanding peak. Well, that's because of the investments and the close planning we do with our customers. And that's a prerequisite in this business or you will not be successful.","And some of the questions seem to miss those two points, and I want to reemphasize that our great service is because of the outstanding planning, long-term planning and having facilities in place. We've been off a little bit sometimes but not much, but boy, we had it right this year so far, knock on wood.","And secondarily, it's managing this mix. And third, you have got to have a close collaboration with your major customers who have a lot of residential e-commerce so you know where that traffic is coming from, you can prepare for it and handle it. So I apologize for the long answer but a lot of these questions kind of miss those key points.","Frederick Smith","So then Vernon -- David Vernon asked, if Amazon starts competing for shipping business, how would that impact your go-to-market strategy?","Frederick Smith","Obviously, we don't address hypotheticals. I'm sorry, David. But maybe Raj wants to comment about this.","Rajesh Subramaniam","Well, all I can add to that. We'll just say that Amazon is a long-standing customer of FedEx. But however, it should be noted that FedEx has no single customer that represents more than 3% of revenue or volume.","Frederick Smith","So Allison Landry wants to know about the addressable market for reverse logistics. Are retailers capable of handling the growth in returns and online orders? And how does FedEx plan to capitalize on this opportunity? Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes. Thank you for your question, Allison. We have estimated that, say - that roughly 15% of all goods purchased are returned, with apparel running at about 30%. And the business of returns continues to grow in scale and complexity especially for retailers as they are directly impacted by the amount of online consumer spending.","Now from our part, the integration of FedEx Supply Chain with our existing portfolio has uniquely positioned us for success here because we provide the most robust end-to-end solutions in this growing market and we have some very exciting developments underway that will surpass customer expectations, provide new value for both merchants and consumers.","Now in addition to all this, buying online and returning in-store continues to be - emerge as a core consumer preference. As we talked several times, we have a vast network of FedEx Office and retail alliances, like Walgreens, that provide an ideal opportunity to offer consumers a convenient drop-off point for the returns.","Frederick Smith","So Allison had a follow-on question. Do we collaborate with traditional brick-and-mortar retailers that have successful online strategies?","Frederick Smith","The answer to that question is yes and big time. And we collaborate with pure e-tailers. We deal very closely with our customers. Don Colleran, do you want to make a comment about that? Because it's your people that are right in there, the solutions group.","Donald Colleran","Sure, Fred. I think you did a wonderful job explaining the process. It is a 12 month process where we sit down approximately our top 25 customers and put together very specific and very surgical plans. We share those with the operating companies so there's alignment in terms of where we want to position the resources.","But it's worked flawlessly this year, and the operational excellence that we've experienced at the operating company level is because of the ongoing playing that we do with our top customers as well as our broader set of customers. So we feel really good about where we sit this time of the year going into the last week.","Frederick Smith","So we have a couple of other questions here on CapEx and expensing, and the part that is often missed in the conversation because of the politics involved in this situation is if the tax bill works as anticipated, there will be a significant growth in GDP.","And remember that the Business Roundtable did in a survey prior to this tax bill passing and 82% of the BRT membership anticipated that if it did pass that it would substantially increase their capital expenditures, and 75% anticipated that they would increase employment. Well, they're not making additional CapEx and increasing employment for any other reason than the market is growing.","So if we increase capital expenditures, as Alan said, it will be because the market is growing. We think we can make more money and increase cash flows and so forth. But there's not just any willy-nilly interest in increasing CapEx other than for that except for one thing. In the case of expensing, you increase the net present value of the returns if it is a replacement piece of capital because you get in, in place earlier and you get your money right back.","So to that extent, it would be bringing the money forward and not spending it later. It's the CapEx for GDP growth rates induced by the tax rate that is the important part of any increase in CapEx. And we'll identify which is which if we do that. So you've got something here, Alan, on the...","Alan Graf","Nothing. We're good.","Frederick Smith","Okay. there was a question to Rob Carter on some software...","Robert Carter","Yes, this is Rob Carter. This is from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please update us on SmartPost redirect initiatives. When will address-matching software be deployed?","That software is already deployed, and it's paying big dividends at FedEx Ground where we are taking address-matching capabilities and even proximate capabilities and moving SmartPost deliveries into the FedEx Ground network. So that was deployed this summer at scale, and we are experiencing the benefits.","We are also planning on making available to our customers in the coming time frame, probably next year, a SmartPost Hold at Location capability. So you'd also be able to redirect those shipments to any of our convenient, more than 10,000 locations in the Onsite network.","Frederick Smith","Okay. So here's a question from Ben Hartford. How is FedEx attitude towards migrating closer to the consumer, buyer, a form of retail marketplace evolve? What are the merits and drawbacks evolving [ph] marketplace more directly linked to customers, retail consumer transactions with your broad distribution network?","Frederick Smith","I think, Ben, what you're asking there is why don't we put up a marketplace ourselves. Well, we strongly believe that we should not compete with our customers, and our big customers have marketplaces.","So we think the value-added that we bring to the table and unmatched value-added is the portfolio of solutions and assets that we can help them fulfill their marketplace requirements. So that's our policy in that regard.","Frederick Smith","There's a question about FedEx Express' domestic China deliveries. Has the focus shifted to nearly all import-export? Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. David Cunningham?","David Cunningham","Sure. Thank you. Our domestic business is growing and an important part of our unique value proposition in China. We're the only foreign company with a wholly owned domestic and international business.","The domestic product is closely aligned and integrated with our international import-export business that is doing great. Our business is more focused, the domestic business is more focused on the B2B market and does not compete in the domestic e-commerce market.","Frederick Smith","So there's a question about cross-border and international e-commerce. Matthew Ruestle of Goldman Sachs wants to know the secular opportunity here and what, if any, additional investment FedEx will need to make to best capture the opportunity. Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes. Matthew, thank you for the question. According to Forrester, the cross-border e-commerce represents roughly 11% of the total e-commerce market in 2017, but it's growing significantly faster, roughly 1.5 times faster. And so in a sense, cross-border e-commerce may become 20% of the market by 2022 with a GMV of roughly $627 billion.","But as you can imagine, this market is far more complex than a domestic e-commerce market, and there are only a very, very few players like FedEx who can provide adequate capabilities.","Firstly, we can leverage our existing world-class global transportation network. And secondly, we launched FedEx CrossBorder as a technology play to make cross-border e-commerce as seamless as possible. We are extremely pleased with the progress we have seen thus far and very, very excited about the potential in the future.","Frederick Smith","There's a question about the new Tesla truck. Mike Ducker, would you read who it came from and answer it?","Michael Ducker","It came from Ravi Shanker. And Ravi asked, any thoughts on that Tesla semitruck? Have you placed any orders yet?","And as you know, we already have a lot of electric vehicles operating in - all across our networks. We think they've got good potential, could offer a lot of benefits when they come to market. So we've certainly evaluated the truck. And should we decide to order any of those, we'll certainly make that known early.","Frederick Smith","Yes, I think we had people out there at the unveiling and...","Michael Ducker","Grand opening.","Frederick Smith","Yes. We've worked with Tesla and looked at the vehicle. It's very innovative. So our company.","Frederick Smith","I mean, a question from David Campbell of Thompson Davis. Hope you're doing well, David, an old friend. You want to know whether the company believes that internationally, our shipment growth will continue to achieve the global rate of GDP over the longer term.","And then a related question, how should investors be thinking about a potential slowdown in the pace of growth in international airfreight in 2018 as it pertains to international express results in 2018? Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. And I think Dave Bronczek wanted to answer this firstly, maybe with some color from Raj.","David Bronczek\\","Thanks, Fred. Thanks for the question, David. We absolutely believe short term and long term, the international airfreight shipments continue to grow and outpace GDP, like it always used to be in the past and then it slowed down but now it is again.","That's great news for FedEx because we're the biggest, most powerful airfreight forwarder in global business transportation worldwide. So for us, it's actually right in our wheelhouse.","In terms of slowing down in 2018, Alan talked about the tax reform bill. We think that adds a lot to airfreight in a global economy, and I think that's again going to be very beneficial to us.","Frederick Smith","Dave, I think you misspoke there. You meant to say the largest air cargo and air express company, not the largest air forwarder.","David Bronczek\\","Right, right, yes.","Frederick Smith","Yes. The word just flew out, I thought. I didn't want to leave any misimpression in the audience. And Raj, do you want to add some on that?","Rajesh Subramaniam","I mean, all I can add to that is that the - air freight, in particular, the air express markets, they really serve the high-value, high-sector part of the economy. And in modern times, they've grown faster than regular GDP, and we expect that trend to continue over the long-term.","Frederick Smith","They've also grown faster than the general air cargo markets over a long period of time as well, I might add","Frederick Smith","So new technology, from Ravi Shanker, are you doing any work around integration of blockchain and the customer operations? What impact do you think it will have in logistics? And how can that be an opportunity or threat to FedEx? Rob Carter, our CIO, will answer that.","Robert Carter","Ravi, we definitely believe that blockchain represents a significant opportunity in the custodial control and chain of control for supply chain shipments. We were and are charter members in the Blockchain in Transportation Alliance as well as the Blockchain Research Institute.","And we believe that going forward, the overall prominence of goods as they move around the world and the enhancement the blockchain offers to global settlement systems and payment systems offer a significant opportunity for us. So I think the answer is yes.","Frederick Smith","So there's another question here about our view on electric and autonomous trucks. And specifically about our subcontractor model, would it slow down adoption of such technologies?","Frederick Smith","I mean, the answer to that is no, in general. But Rob just gave an important speech that sort of represents the company's position on this, and we thought it would be a good idea if he just repeated what he said out in the Silicon Valley. Rob?","Robert Carter","Well, first off, the general innovation footprint that we have always has us looking at modern and innovation-oriented developments in the marketplace. And certainly, autonomous vehicles are among them as well as electrification. The reality is that autonomous vehicles are already among us.","And we believe that the most important things that will happen in the near term is using technologies like adaptive cruise control, lane departure, automatic braking, all of which compositely make for autonomy, offer much improved safety for our drivers and a much improved quality of life for the men and women that are on the road for FedEx out there.","So clearly, these technologies won't stop there. There are many opportunities in the future. But right now, we're using a lot of autonomy to make our team safer and to give them a better quality of life on the road.","And we're using a lot of different technologies to make sure that our sustainability efforts continue to improve the environment, and I commend you our sustainability report on fedex.com.","Frederick Smith","So Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer has a couple of questions, one about Freight. How do you anticipate balancing volume and yield in FedEx Freight going forward if current demand environment persists? Mike Ducker?","Michael Ducker","Yes, sir. First, let me thank our FedEx Freight team for a great quarter and a great peak season, too. And thank you for the question, Scott. As we've all read, the current environment is strong. We have very solid business processes in place to balance volume and yield.","The improved revenue quality really is the primary driver of the results in Q2, including a 34% higher operating margin. It's a team game between operations, sales, pricing, solutions, marketing.","Now we work closely together to not only ensure we're giving the best, market-leading service but that we get compensated fairly for it using data-driven decision-making tools in which we've invested in the past.","So we believe we have great processes in place. We expect that our continued focus on revenue quality will drive operating income and margin improvement through the rest of '18.","Frederick Smith","So we've got a couple of questions here from Henry Maier. One from Tom Wadewitz, is FedEx still tapping the brakes on the pace of B2C volume growth in Ground. How much did B2C Ground volumes grow in 2Q? And how much did B2P - B2B Ground volumes grow? Henry?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes, this is...","Frederick Smith","As well as Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes, this is Raj. I would just say that we haven't broken out the volume trends between B2C and B2B and we're not going to start in this call. All I would say is that we grew Ground business 12%, double digits, in the second quarter with healthy volume and yield increase. And we'll continue to monitor customer-to-customer and make sure we make the right decision that balances volume, yield and profitability.","Frederick Smith","So this one's for Henry. Could you please discuss strategic initiatives to accelerate growth in FedEx Supply Chain and discuss what type of growth you anticipate for this business longer term? Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Henry Maier","Thanks for the question, Scott. We think there's great opportunities for growth across several segments and supply chain. For example, we launched FedEx Fulfillment in February to help small and medium-sized retailers, e-tailers and brands.","FedEx Fulfillment has many capabilities, warehousing fulfillment, inventory and transportation management and reverse logistics, so e-tailers and retailers can focus on business itself instead of supply chain.","We also see an opportunity to further leverage our reverse logistics expertise to enhance the overall returns process. E-commerce continues to drive a high return rate, and consumer preferences to return online purchases to physical locations will be satisfied by leveraging FedEx Office and other retail access points.","Frederick Smith","So we have a question from David Ross of Stifel.","Frederick Smith","With international growing again, do you anticipate any flight additions in calendar '18? I think David Bronczek wanted to make a comment, and we'll pass it on to David Cunningham.","David Bronczek","Yes. I would just say that any additions we would make are so miniscule in our big global network that it wouldn't be really worth talking about. And we add capacity to meet demand all year long. And as the volumes grow, we keep matching the volume. So our network is so big and so global now that it wouldn't show up on the radar.","David Cunningham","Well, and just to maybe highlight the scale of what Dave's talking about, we operate 1,600 departures, utilizing 660 aircraft every single day. And we scale up and we scale down to meet demand. And so as Dave said, it will be relatively modest.","Frederick Smith","So where has hiring employees in the network been the most challenging? And has it impeded operations or materially increased cost this year? Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. I think Dave wanted to mention something, and then we'll hand it off to Henry Maier.","David Bronczek","Yes. Thanks, Fred, and thanks for the question, Brian. It's a great question. We talk about it all the time. We had no problem hiring anybody anywhere in the United States or around the world. And quite frankly, it's because people love working for FedEx.","We actually started a program called Friends and Family. So our employees, when their sons and daughters come back from college, we hire them. And it's been fantastic for us, and it continues to be a great program. It's not just for family members but it's also friends.","Henry Maier","Yes, let me add, Dave. This is Henry Maier, FedEx Ground. Our investments in automated facilities coupled with geographically targeted peak wage rates have allowed FedEx Ground to maintain fully staffed facilities across the entire network this peak. We've had no issues anywhere.","Frederick Smith","So David Bronczek, this question, you're uniquely qualified to answer about, the Postal Service, from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Does the recent order on market-dominant products and proposed supplemental pricing authority beyond the CPI cap have any impact on FedEx?","David Bronczek","The very short answer is we do not believe so. I should add, however, that the USPS is a very good partner of FedEx and has been for many, many years, over a decade now. So we keep working the partnership and improving the service along the way.","Frederick Smith","Is there further scope to expand non-conveyable and oversized product pricing beyond current levels? What percentage of ground freight volumes are in this category? Same questioner. Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes, Brian. The non-conveyable and the oversized package is roughly 10% to 11% of the volume we handle at the FedEx Ground network. And we've added sortation and delivery capability to handle these larger, heavier packages.","As you can imagine, there are only a very few players in the marketplace who have the capability to handle such traffic. So we will continue to monitor trends and adjust pricing as needed and -- so that ultimately, we can provide an outstanding service for our customers.","Frederick Smith","And Raj, you can just go into this question from David Ross. Now that SmartPost is going down [ph] in January, when will Freight finally make the switch to dimensional pricing away from the outdated, irrelevant NMFC pricing? David Ross of Stifel. If you take that. And then the mic -- and Mike, when you get the microphone, Ken Hoexter wants to know about any movements or thoughts on 33-foot trucks [ph].","Rajesh Subramaniam","So David, of course, we agree with you and that dimensional density based pricing offers a much more simplified alternative to the class-based system, which is frankly outdated.","We have this capability to customers if you want to choose it today. And it benefits the whole industry to move to a simplified pricing structure based on shipment size. Mike?","Michael Ducker","Yes, sir. Ken, thanks for the question. As you know, we're - FedEx is a member, in fact, a charter member of the Americans for Modern Transportation Coalition. We have, in that coalition, a really diverse group of shippers, retailers and customers, including UPS, Amazon, the National Retail Federation, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others.","And we continue to advocate to -- for these because we believe that they're safer, more efficient. You get an 18% load improvement out of it. It puts fewer trucks on an already taxed infrastructure. And they're - and we've driven more than 1 million miles on these on the road. So we know that they're safer.","It takes out 204 million gallons of fuel a year, 4.4 billion pounds of CO2 emissions. Why wouldn't this be good is our position. So we continue to focus and - on it. And hopefully, the tax reform moving across the go line and the infrastructure package next will be strongly considered. We will certainly be promoting it in that legislation.","Frederick Smith","The last question is from Ken Hoexter from BofA Merrill Lynch. It's basically about our customer sales strategy. David Bronczek and Don Colleran would both cut my throat if I told you any of the -- answer this question, Ken. So I'll just say we have the greatest sales force in the many industrial company in the world and lots of potential new business. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Mickey.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation's second quarter earnings release conference call.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.","Mickey Foster","Good afternoon. And welcome to FedEx Corporation's second quarter earnings conference call. The second quarter earnings release and our 26 page stat book are on our website at FedEx.com. This call is being broadcast from our website, and the replay and podcast will be available for about one year.","We have moved our call to the afternoon to allow more time for us to review our results and answer your strategic questions.

Good afternoon. And welcome to our discussion of results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. FedEx Corporation posted solid earnings and year-over-year EPS improvement of 19%, excluding TNT integration costs and a legal settlement charge for FedEx Ground.","We continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and returns on invested capital. These basic trends should continue well into the future, barring major events or macro-economic factors.","A record number of holiday shipments fueled largely by the steady rise of e-commerce are flowing through the FedEx global networks. Monday, we picked up over 26 million packages global. We greatly appreciate the dedication of more than 340,000 FedEx team members who are delivering the holidays to our customers around the world.","Express service levels in particular have been outstanding. While we have experienced extremely heavy ground volumes in the Northeast, our team members have risen to the challenge and ground system is running as scheduled.","Adherence to our people service profit philosophy and the FedEx strategy of compete collectively, operate independently and managed collaboratively are keys to our success. We will exceed the profit improvement program at FedEx Express this fiscal year and the Aircraft Fleet Modernization program is paying off in a big way.","It's no secret that e-commerce is changing the dynamics of the transportation industry and driving remarkable growth. We have strategic plans to ensure we will continue to benefit in the years ahead from this growth.","For example, we are integrating Ground and SmartPost facilities, and linehaul systems to realize incremental operating expense savings in the future. Multiyear expansion of automated FedEx Ground facilities will allow continued profitable growth and provides the most flexible and fast as ground package system possible.","We are also deploying new technology that will enable us to combine FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost packages going to common delivery addresses, which will significantly improve efficiency, productivity and service. FedEx Freight is focused on improving margin trends in a week industrial economy through better balance and volume and yield and higher productivity.","Our recent offer to buy TNT Express assuming it's approved will quickly broaden our portfolio of solutions, particularly in Europe. Customers of both FedEx and TNT will benefit from our unmatched global network.","Despite contraction of U.S. exports due to the high U.S. dollar, and low world GDP and trade growth, the overall market for international door-to-door Express continues to increase also driven by e-commerce.","A couple of developments in e-commerce are worth noting. First, oversized packages are increasing, and second, a number of e-commerce shippers continue to use extremely cubed inefficient packaging, loaded density and over-the-road ground trailers is therefore declining because of these trends.","In this regard, we are extremely disappointed that Congress did not approve the use of Twin 33-foot trailers on the nation's highways versus the current 28-foot standard. 33 is already permitted in 18 states and we have safely driven them almost 1,500,000 miles in Florida along, drivers tell us they are more stable than the 28-foot trailers, with similar handling and turning.","Our industry estimate this change would, one, eliminate about 6.6 million trips annually and thereby improve safety due to fewer accidents per year, the 33\u2019s would materially reduce congestion, third, it would save over 200 million gallons of diesel and reduce carbon emissions by 4.4 billion pounds per year.","With e-commerce exploding and U.S. automobile models driven reaching a record high this year, 33-foot trailers would be of enormous benefit to our economy and significantly improve road safety.","We would like to welcome Chris Inglis to the FedEx Corporation Board of Directors. Chris retired in 2014 as the Deputy Director and Senior Civilian Leader of the National Security Agency. His Cyber Security and Information Technology expertise and significant leadership experience will be very valuable to FedEx.","Regarding vital issue of cyber security, the pending omnibus bill contains several very positive changes to the law regarding corporations and government agencies. And we sincerely hope it passes.","In conclusion, let me also remind you that this is the earnings call of FedEx Corporation. We manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results, which does not always translate into each segment\u2019s individual earnings and margins.","Now Mike Glenn and Alan Graf will discuss our economic outlook and further details of second quarter earnings after which as Mickey said we\u2019ll take your questions. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thanks Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook and then I'll discuss performance and business conditions in each segment including revenue volume and yield and provide some commentary on pricing and broader industry trends that we\u2019re experiencing. But first I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to acknowledge our team members around the world who are delivering the holidays as we speak.","As Fred noted, we've experienced record-breaking demand during this peak season largely driven by the rapid growth of e-commerce. Our busiest days during peak have exceeded our forecast and more than double our average daily volume and should be noted that our busiest days this year are approximately double what they were just about eight years ago.","Our ability to flex our networks to meet this demand and while delivering service our customers expect requires many elements. We continue to invest in new facilities, capacity expansion. We apply advanced engineering and use state-of-the-art rotation technology. We innovate the portfolio and certainly collaborate very closely with our customers.","But more than anything else, our ability to meet this demand comes down to our people including our drivers, couriers, pilots, package handlers and all team members that are hard at work around the world right now to deliver the holidays. Now let me make a few economic comments.","We continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2.4% as we encounter \u201815 which is slightly lower than our September 2.5% growth outlook. And our forecast for calendar \u201816 is 2.6% which is led by gains in consumer spending in the near-term.","We expect industrial production growth to 1.5% in calendar \u201815 which is 40 basis points lower than our September outlook. And we have a forecast for 1.9% next year, which is consistent with our September forecast.","Energy investment, strong dollar and an inventory correction are restraining growth in the sector. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar \u201815 and 2.8% for calendar \u201816 which represents no change from our far outlook.","Now review our revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates were more than offset base yield growth. U.S. domestic package growth grew by 1%, driven by growth in overnight packages while U.S. domestic revenue per package or yield decreased 2% due to lower fuel surcharges. If you exclude the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields grew by 3%, primarily due to rates and discount product mix in weight per package.","FedEx International economy volume grew by 3% while FedEx International Priority volume declined by 5%. International export revenue per package decreased 9% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset higher base rates.","If you\u2019ll exclude fuel, international export express package yield decreased 3%, primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of weight rate and discount changes. Excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields actually increased 1%.","In the Ground segment, revenue increased 32% in the quarter due to the inclusion of GENCO results, higher ground volume and base rates and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 9% in the quarter, primarily driven by the growth in demand for residential deliveries related to e-commerce.","FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 10% due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, which include additional dimensional weight charges, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 13% year-over-year, primarily driven by changes in dimensional weight rating, extra services, and SmartPost customer mix. Normalizing for the change in treatment of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis, Ground yield excluding the impact of fuel increased 3.9%.","FedEx Freight revenue declined 2% and shipments increased 1% which is directly related to the lower levels of industrial production. We've also seen some heavier weight shipments move back to truckload as capacity has eased. LTL revenue per shipment declined 3% due to lower fuel surcharges, partially offset by higher base rates.","Excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 2% year-over-year at FedEx Freight, which was primarily driven by shipment class rate and discount. As we announced in September, we will be raising rates at FedEx Express, Ground and Freight by an average of 4.9% on January 4, 2016.","In addition to the rate changes, FedEx also recently increased surcharges for unauthorized packages in the FedEx Ground network. We\u2019ve seen significant shifts in demand across our portfolio including higher demand for residential deliveries due to e-commerce growth.","We've rapidly responded to these shifts both through increased investments in capacity, expansion of our portfolio and pricing decisions across the portfolio. The rise in residential deliveries brings with it operational considerations, including the number of increased ops, higher use of fuel as a result of the increased ops and evolving package and weight dimensions.","For example, package is classified as oversized, account for almost 10% of ground home delivery packages during peak season. This is the primary reason why we increase the surcharge on unauthorized packages in November and will be increasing the surcharge on oversized packages in January. As we conduct our post-peak season analysis, we\u2019ll factor all these considerations in the future pricing decisions.","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re experiencing a record-breaking peak season with strong demand across the portfolio, especially for residential deliveries within the ground network. Strong customer collaboration is absolutely critical in preparing for peak as it enables us to anticipate surges in volume and position resources appropriately to meet the customers\u2019 needs.","We've experienced heavy demand for FedEx Ground particularly in the North East as Fred noted. But our dedicated team members are working hard to deliver the holidays. Demand in our industry is rapidly evolving. And we have continued to make changes to our service portfolio and adjusted our pricing strategies to meet customer needs and generate profitable growth around the world.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike. Good afternoon and happy holidays everyone. We had an outstanding quarter and we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half of fiscal \u201816. We reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year, $10.40 to $10.90 per share.","Four highlights stand out to me. First, our adjusted EPS was up 19% for the second quarter. Second, adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 9.6%. Third, our FY16 guidance reflects nearly 20% growth at its midpoint.","And fourth, cash flows from operating activities increased $300 million or 14% for the first half of FY16. I'm very proud of the entire FedEx team for its impressive efforts, which are continuing during this record peak season.","Quarterly results improved largely due to higher base rates at Express and Ground, continued strong growth of e-commerce and positive impacts from the Profit Improvement Program that we announced in October of 2012 and as probably ahead of schedule at this point.","These positive factors were partially offset by lower operating results at FedEx Freight, primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense, significantly outpacing lower than anticipated volume growth and the modest negative net impact of fuel.","There were two expense adjustments this quarter within eliminations, corporate and other expense. First expenses related to the settlement of independent contractor litigation matters of $25 million net of tax or $0.09 per diluted share. Also expenses related to our pending acquisition of TNT Express of $12 million net of tax or $0.04 per diluted share. TNT acquisition will transform FedEx as European offerings and accelerate global growth. We expect the acquisition will be completed in the first half of calendar 2016.","Turning now to Express, another stellar quarter, operating margin grew to 9.4%, which is the best margin for Express in nearly nine years. Operating income increased 26%, despite a revenue decline of 6%.","While Express fuel expense decreased 43% in the quarter due to lower fuel prices, fuel had a slight negative net impact to earnings versus last year. The negative net impact of fuel was a result of lower fuel surcharge revenue year-over-year, primarily and partially offset by lower fuel prices during the quarter.","Currency fluctuations have little net impact on our P&L at Express. It can drive significant changes to revenue and expense. In addition, impacts to our P&L are more influenced by some currencies than others.","Recent strength in the U.S. dollar against certain currencies has caused lower revenue expenses for FedEx Express, as well as a shift in trade patterns as U.S. imports have increased and exports have declined.","A portion of our non-U.S. originating revenue, particularly from large multinational customers is paid in U.S. dollars and therefore is not subject to currency fluctuations. This helps our international revenue and expense denominated in foreign currencies to be more balanced, causing little net impact on our P&L from currency fluctuations. That will change once we acquired TNT and we will update you on what the impact is at that point.","In spite of weakening trends in global trade, Express is realizing benefits from its Profit Improvement Plan, as I mentioned before. This includes strong productivity gains, a right-size workforce, efficient and reliable assets due to the Fleet Modernization Program and improved base yield. These structural improvements allow us to take advantage of the growing e-commerce market and to succeed under current global economic conditions.","Express remains focused on ensuring the right products are in the right network and is looking for more opportunities to improve profit by using purchase transportation on a land by land basis where it meets our service level requirements and add shareholder value. The significant network improvements we're making enable us to profitably handle growth around the globe and quickly address any laying imbalances due to shift in trade patterns.","Looking at Ground, FedEx Ground posted healthy results as a result of e-commerce growth, pricing actions and growth in market share. Operating income was up 13% due to higher base rates and volume. This is the financial metrics that we are most focused on at Ground.","As we expected, operating margin was affected by the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and the inclusion of GENCO results. Together, those items reduced the operating margin year-over-year by 2.1 percentage points for the quarter. GENCO business itself is very good.","By definition, however, it will impact Grounds margins because of Grounds much higher overall margins. This is no surprise to us. The GENCO acquisition complements and differentiates the FedEx value proposition, and is central to our e-commerce strategy.","Opportunities from GENCO will help grow our core transportation business, especially reverse logistics and leverage existing customer relationships to open doors for both companies. Ground\u2019s long-term strategy is focused on sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth.","In addition to GENCO, here are five ways the Ground prepares for the long game. First is automation, we\u2019re making significant investments to add additional automated hub capacity and ensure many new stations are also fully automated, providing significant operational flexibility and capacity, particularly during sustain high-volume and keeping FedEx ahead of the competition.","Second, the SmartPost integration, as one network Ground is able to maximize the use of facilities in linehaul assets to save operating expense and moving SmartPost packages onto a home delivery truck that is already going through a residence is significantly less costly than paying postage for the USPS to deliver the package. Over the next several years as we combine packages that are destined to the same delivery address, we will further increase our efficiency and profitability.","Third is Monday residential service. Online shopping is a 24x7 experience, so we began a pilot test, in which we make weekend pick-ups at retail locations for Monday residential deliveries in the defined area. We may consider additional markets depending on the results of the test.","Fourth is technology enhancements, this is a cornerstone of how we operate inside the FedEx portfolio. We continue to identify test and implement new technology for our operations beyond automated sortation, scanners, package, photo imaging and GPS are a few examples.","And fifth is pricing. As Mike discussed, adjustments to our dimension-based and oversized pricing help offset the increase in package sizes that reduced our cube efficiency and increase our linehaul costs.","The surcharges that went into effect last month applied packages that exceed the length or weight limitations with the FedEx Ground network and are handled at our option. This proactive steps help ensure that oversized packages excepted in our network are properly priced for the space they use.","We expect Ground capital expense for FY17 to remain at its FY16 level of about $1.6 billion, 90% of that will be targeted for growth, largely because of rising cost of land and equipment necessary for Ground expansion and further automation. This is a change from my Ground capital comments on the previous earnings call.","The FedEx Freight, we are adjusting to challenging less than truckload market conditions. Manufacturing especially in oil exploration and production has been weakening for most of the year. The latest reading for November show the Purchasing Managers Index and indicator of the Economic Health for the Manufacturing Sector, down more than 15% year-over-year. Slower manufacturing and weaker economy and mode shifts have been significant headwinds to Freight\u2019s performance.","Freight segment operating income and operating margin decreased due to salaries and employed benefits expense significantly outpacing lower than anticipated volume growth. We are adjusting staffing levels and other items to offset the impact of the current weak industrial environment.","Looking ahead, we expect our solid earnings growth to continue in the second half and it\u2019s significant that we are reiterating our adjusted FY16 earnings guidance. This equates to an adjusted EPS growth year-over-year of 16% to 22%, despite the weaker than anticipated industrial production and global trade.","Earnings growth for the second half of \u201816 will be driven by volume and base yield growth at Express and Ground, and continued benefits from our profit improvement program initiatives.","Year-over-year, adjusted earnings growth is expected to be stronger in Q4 versus Q3 due to the significant net benefit from fuel in Q3 of last year and the growing benefits from our profit improvement initiatives.","Remember this guidance doesn\u2019t include any impact from TNT and mark-to-mark pension adjustments. We will provide updated information at a later date. We still expect to close in the first half of calendar \u201816 and are waiting on regulatory approvals.","Our tax rate is lower this quarter because we able to resolve a state tax matter in our favor. The full year rate is expected to be about 36%, excluding any impact from TNT and mark-to-market pension adjustments.","Our capital spending forecast for the fiscal year remains at $4.6 billion, primarily for fuel efficient, new aircraft and support e-commerce growth at Ground. We will continue to invest in our people, team members pay increase in October, their healthcare premium held steady in calendar \u201916 and our pension fund is strong with an accounting funded level of approximately 87%.","On November 13th we placed our revolver and letter of credit facilities with a new five-year 1.75 billion revolving credit facility that expires in November 2020. The facility which includes a $500 million letter of credit sub-limit and multi-currency capability is available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs.","Also during the quarter we issued $1.25 million of third-year notes at 4.75% coupon. The rating agencies affirmed our current ratings for this transaction. Interest will be $36 million for FY16 from this transaction and $60 million on an annual basis going forward. We use proceeds for some of our share repurchases, as well as other corporate purposes.","Since FY14 we have returned over $7 billion to shareholders through repurchasing over 53 million shares at an average price of about $139, including over 8 million shares we have repurchased in fiscal \u201816 to-date. 4 million shares remained under our existing share repurchase authorization and we plan to repurchase all the remaining authorized shares by the end of the fiscal year.","In closing, let me remind you that despite the economic headwinds, the FedEx Corporation balance sheet is strong, our cash flow is improving and we expect strong EPS growth.","Thanks very much for your attention and now we will open the call up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to Chris Wetherbee from Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. Great. Thanks and good afternoon. I wanted to touch, I guess, on the Express side and how it relates to the guidance. So weaker macro, maintained guidance and you\u2019ve talked about some of the Express Profit Improvement Plan likely exceeding targets? Can you give us some context around that and sort of how you may think about the potential for fiscal \u201916 and then maybe beyond?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. I'll let Dave talk about it. Express\u2019 margins are going up. They are going to continue to go up, absent macro economic or geopolitical events. As I said in my remarks that the Fleet Modernization Program is making a huge difference, Alan said in his remarks, the productivity because the technology is going up, the system from adjustments that Dave made in his network allow us to put the right traffic in the right network and as I said, Express is in a sweet spot.","Dave Bronczek","Yeah. Thanks for the question and thanks, Fred. We are in a sweet spot and if you remember our Profit Improvement Plan was driven mostly by structural costs initiatives and not as much on the revenue.","That being said, the revenue has been better. We've had better yield management. But again we've had a terrific performance in our fleet. The planes are flying at 99 plus reliability and the fuel saving has been great, and of course, the reliability is all around the world.","That being said, of course, our productivity and we've right-sized our U.S. operations here throughout the United States. And really on the global basis the traffic that we are moving on the international economy basis, that's growing is very profitable for us now, because we have it in the right network.","So, yes, we are very optimistic about our profit improvement going forward. It continues to increase the profits. It doesn't stop. Of course, I saw some of the comments earlier. It just continues to keep growing and increasing. And Fred is right, I mean, we had nine year high of our margins at Express and those will continue to grow as well with our profits.","Operator","And we will now go to Tom Wadewitz from UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. If I could -- I don\u2019t know if this is more for Alan or for Dave, but on the Express improvement plan, your -- I guess, it is less clear me, what the kind of metric are versus when you originally introduced the plan, you talked about it, I think, the 1.6 billion? And is that -- and I think that was at the end of fiscal year \u201817 within the base change a little bit related to the pension? So, could you just run through what the right, I think, both absolute amount you're considering to be the plan and then as is year end fiscal \u201917 still the right timing on that, recognizing you'll improve on an ongoing basis, you will try to do that? Thank you.","Alan Graf","Thanks, Tom. As I -- I think we\u2019ve mentioned this before several times, but it\u2019s important to mention it again. The 75% run out weight rate that we've captured, we captured at the end of last fiscal year. FY16 built on that. All five of the pillars are still the five that are producing the results. Quite frankly they're better in almost every category. You can go back and look at all the notes so you can call IR for the five pillars.","But across the Board we are improving each one of the pillars. The one that we counted on the least was the global marketplace revenue and actually we've been better on that. All that being said, that was the one that we were worried about the most. We are doing very well there, because we planned it to be less than all of our cost initiatives. So I would say going forward, obviously, you can see in the numbers, we are having a great year in \u201916 and that will continue into\u201917.","Operator","And we will now go to Nate Brochmann from William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good evening and thanks for taking my question. Fred you started off like talking about obviously all the changes at e-commerce has brought and how that\u2019s allowed you to redefine your network and serve your customers? As your customer supply change evolved, how have you been able to helped them and get deeper into that relationship and particularly how does GENCO helped with that?","Fred Smith","Well, I will ask Mike Glenn to comment on it after I do, but a big part of e-commerce is handling returns. So some years ago as we saw the market evolving, we decided it would be a very, very good thing for us to have a supply chain capability to offer a broader portfolio of value-added services to our e-commerce customers, because this was a huge part of the marketplace. It wasn't just planning on how to get it to the end customer but how to efficiently process the returns and merchandise.","So through quite frankly serendipitous chain of events, this great company GENCO, which was coincidentally in Pittsburgh and was by far the leader in this space in our opinion became available and we did a deal with Herb Shear, a gentleman and great management team that he has assembled. And so we think there are enormous energies there.","I'll ask Mike and Henry to comment on it but we just couldn't be more pleased with GENCO being part of the FedEx portfolio and think it will enhance our competitive position and problem-solving ability for our e-commerce customers.","Mike Glenn","Hi Nate. This is Mike. I think it\u2019s important to note that that our sales team has a solutions organization that works hand in glove with our large e-commerce customers to help optimize their supply chains and that includes everything from types of information management solutions to location of distribution facilities, selection services, all designed to drive value for those companies. And sometimes those solutions are good for FedEx in the short term, sometimes they are not so good for FedEx in short-term but they're always good for us in the long-term because we\u2019re working with customers to drive solutions that are going to benefit the relationship between FedEx and the customer over the long haul.","So we're well ingrained in and embedded into our largest customers and work with them hand in glove throughout the year to prepare for peak season and operations 12 months out of the year. GENCO was a significant addition to our portfolio. We recognized we had an opportunity to enhance the portfolio. As Fred noted, they have world class solutions in the return segment. Returns is a particularly big part of any e-commerce value proposition because they tend to be double digits whereas the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer is in the mid-to-lower digit return rate. So GENCO has been a tremendous addition to the portfolio. We\u2019re well down the track on integration and we see a lot of benefit going forward.","Fred Smith","I should note that GENCO does many things other than returns. And within their capabilities, they\u2019re just outstanding in the market leader in the returns. Henry, you want to add anything?","Henry Maier","No. The only thing I would add is their product footprint on the board, logistic side as well. So customers that want, for instance, fulfillment, GENCO could do. I think it\u2019s important for the folks on the call to understand there are a lot of transportation segments between all of these nodes on the supply chain. And this gives us an opportunity to participate in that transportation whereas before we probably didn't get a chance.","Operator","And I\u2019ll now turn the conference over to our speakers for any questions that may have come over the email.","Fred Smith","Okay. We\u2019ve got some questions over the internet. Ken Hoexter of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Thoughts on Amazon creating its own network. Mike Glenn, you want to comment?","Mike Glenn","Yeah. Thanks Fred. I'm not quite sure how you're defining network but let me say that virtually every major retailer in the United States today has a dedicated linehaul operation to move inventory between distribution centers and stores and Amazon certainly no different in that regard.","Amazon is a very large FedEx customer and we work closely with them as I just noted to optimize delivery needs and of course, work with them very closely to create new solutions to support the future growth. I do think it\u2019s important to point out however that FedEx is a highly integrated global transportation network. In fact, one of only two operating at a significant scale in the United States today and only one of three major delivery networks in the U.S., the other two being UPS, the United States Postal Service.","That\u2019s not likely to change in the foreseeable future as these networks are very capital intensive and information intensive. And I think family, I think it\u2019s important to note that our network is a lynchpin in the e-commerce market and our customers rely on us to sport their growth. So we feel quite comfortable where we\u2019re situated -- comfortable where we situated today.","Fred Smith","Okay. There are a couple of questions here from several Internet questionnaires about the update on TNT. I think we answered that in Alan's comments. We\u2019re hopeful we\u2019ll close by the first half of next year. I'll ask Chris Richards to put any color on that she wants. There is another regulatory question from Helane Becker about is there a concern, the fine levied by the French will be copied by other countries and are you considering an appeal, Chris?","Chris Richards","Thank you, Fred. I\u2019ll start with the update on the regulatory approvals of the TNT acquisition. As we indicated in our joint press release with TNT on October 20th, we have been informed by the European commission that no statement of objections will be issued to the review of our transaction.","We are anticipating that we will receive final unconditional approval from the EU in the first two weeks of January. In addition, we have completed the process and received clearance in 10 other countries including the U.S., Australia, Chile, Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Turkey and Ukraine.","At this time, we are aggressively pursuing clearance in the remaining seven countries, Brazil, China, Argentina, Israel, Korea, Namibia and South Africa. And we are very confident that we will achieve the clearances that are necessary to close this transaction in the first half of calendar \u201816.","Moving on to the question about the French proceeding. No there is not any concern of the fine levied by the French will be copied by other countries because this proceeding involved TATEX, a French company that we acquired in 2012 and the events that are the subject of this proceeding occurred in 2010, long before we acquired the business.","The events were limited to France but despite that situation we are considering an appeal of this decision and will give you an update on it next quarter.","Fred Smith","Jack Atkins of Stephens wants to know what the margin goals for the Ground segment are? He asked a couple of other questions here. But I think they were basically answered because they concern TNT and he\u2019s interested to know Henry about the cost savings to be realized from the integration of SmartPost into FedEx brand?","Henry Maier","The other significant savings when we can marry two packages together, the residential delivery because the vast majority of the cost in any of these networks is really around stopping the truck in front of an address. So when you can pull a package out of SmartPost, for instance, marry it up in single network with a FedEx home delivery package, the savings are quite a bit -- quite a bit that costs are quite a bit less than paying the postage on that package throughout the U.S. Postal Service delivery.","There are a number of other advantages as well. One is, is that we can maximize the capacity between Ground and SmartPost from time to time and at times even geographically throughout the year we see volume spikes. This gives us the ability to move front since the SmartPost package into ground hubs, Throughout the year we see volume spikes, this gives us the ability to move upfront some of the SmartPost package into a Ground hubs, small store operation and process of their as opposed to centrally just bringing in more people at SmartPost to handle the added volume.","There are number of other issues and just in the sense that we can share people now. We have effectively dissolved the corporate structures, so all of SmartPost people are either being deployed in their current jobs and the former SmartPost or within FedEx Ground.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to Allison Landry from Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks. So Fred, you mentioned early in your remarks that e-commerce customers continue to use an efficient packaging. And you\u2019re continuing to see growth in oversized packages. So given that customer behavior is not changing, how do you plan to mitigate this going forward? And do you intend to lean more enterprising?","Fred Smith","Well, the answer to that question is yes on the pricing and of course, we\u2019ve already done some of that and we\u2019ve announced more. That's really where dimensional pricing came from. I mean, we were getting lots of packages that were one or two cubic feet and inside was a six ounce stuff toy and that comes from the way e-commerce is processed there. These large fulfillment centers or perhaps not so large. But they're using a lot of effort, particularly during the holidays to speed up, order fulfillment and they put things in boxes and is quite different than say Procter & Gamble packaging toothpaste in the most efficient and most dense way to minimize transportation costs.","So the reason is it continues quite frankly with more effort not put into it on the part of the e-tailers is the Postal Service doesn't have dimensional price. And I have to tell you, I feel for a lot of our postal folks out there. They operate their parcel delivery system with 200,000 jeeps, which were basically designed for mail delivery and watching them it looks like a submarine.","These people are -- they got at least, packages on the left-hand side of the truck, they have to stop, they have to pull them out, resequence them before delivery and at my house, I can promise you we\u2019re getting a lot of very lightweight cube items coming from retailers through SmartPost or directly from an e-tailer. So over time, all markets are rational and it does not make a lot of sense for the e-tailer or the transportation company or the delivery company in the case of the postal service to pay money to deliver air.","So I think pricing will rationalize it. As I said in my remarks, it's just a terrible shame that the 33 footers were not approved that gives about 18% more cube, very little increase in weight. And as I mentioned, from an environmental safety standpoint, it was just a complete lay up. And the forces that opposed it quite frankly, we\u2019re not well informed on the issue.","And hopefully, the Department of Transportation will move smartly to correct this because as I said, these are already used in 18 States and they\u2019re more stable because it put slightly more weight on the actual of the twin trailers, the passing the 33 foot set of doubles versus 28 foot doubles at 60 miles an hour is basically inconsequential, its about a tenth of the second -- of a second different.","So it\u2019s a great opportunity to have a win, win, win solution in terms of national productivity for e-commerce reduction in fuel and environmental emissions and then would reduce over -- I think it was a 1,000 accidents estimated with the Ground parcel and LTL industry per year. But it is what it is and obviously we will have to operate the 28 footers but that would've mitigated a lot of these inefficient cube developments we've been talking about.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tom Kim from Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","Hi. Good evening and thanks for your time. I wanted to follow-up on the Ground margin question. I\u2019ve question I guess around the integration of SmartPost and GENCO. In the prepared remarks, you\u2019d mentioned that operating margins had been impacted by about 1.2% or more. Is that including anyone off integration costs?","Fred Smith","Well, this is Fred Smith speaking. Alan mentioned that of the Ground margin delta 2.1% out of I think 2.2% was having to report because of the integration of Ground and SmartPost, the revenues at the gross level versus the net level. Prior to our doing that, we simply took the net cost of the postal deliveries and excuse me, the delta between the postal delivery cost and in our revenues, as a single network the accounting rules are such we had to take it on a gross basis.","So there's no diminution whatsoever in earnings, cash flows, the performance of ground, it\u2019s just an accounting situation. The second is the fact that we put GENCO into the Ground segment and Henry is in charge of this because it is so closely aligned with the Ground parcel SmartPost presence in the e-commerce market. Now again, as Henry said, GENCO does many, many other things for Express and freight and so forth. But we're very confident in our Ground margins and Henry want to add to this and say it one more time what our goals are here.","Henry Maier","Yeah. We strive for mid-teens margins at FedEx Ground. There is no discernible integration costs in there at all. I mean this is roughly 10 basis points frankly falls into all other. There was no single large item. You got to keep in mind with the company of this size and the fact that we recognize revenue on delivery not on pickup, having a couple thousand packages move in or out over quarter and have a huge bearing on operating profit.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I was curious, could you address the Transpacific and perhaps Transatlantic, trade lanes. How they progressed through the quarter? What you\u2019re seeing into the coming quarter and also with consideration for capacity? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","Yeah. This is Dave Bronczek. I think I heard your question Transpacific, Transatlantic. It\u2019s generally the same economic environment that Mike talked about at beginning around the world. It's growing but it\u2019s more modest. So I wouldn't say -- I think it is actually growing more out of Europe because of the currency exchange, a little bit less out of Asia but around the world we\u2019ve balanced our network. So for us in Mike's comments, we\u2019ve took that into consideration as to where we put our packages and how we flow our network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Salmon from Deutsche Bank.","Rob Salmon","Hey, thanks and good evening. I guess, continuing on the Ground line of questions? Can you give us a sense of what drove the acceleration in the average daily package volume growth? Was this -- was a lot of -- as a result of the GENCO acquisition, we are starting to sees some of those revenue synergies showing up? How much of an impact was the calendar and if there were any shifts coming out of Express\u2019 U.S. deferred volumes which declined for the first time in a few years? It would be helpful to kind of understand the different puts and takes there?","Fred Smith","The volumes at Ground are growing because we are taking market share and because e-commerce, the delivery of individual packages to businesses and retailers is growing. And on the -- what was the Express deferred, do you want to comment on that Mike?","Mike Glenn","Yeah. I wouldn't read too much in the Express deferred traffic levels on a trend basis. Again, is similar to what Henry noted, specific pricing decisions on a customer by customer basis can impact volumes in any quarter. And so I wouldn't read too much into that. I mean, we are pretty pleased with where we sit from an Express volume standpoint, being up overall with the growth coming in overnight that that's a positive thing for us.","Operator","And I will now turn the conference over to our speakers for more e-mail questions.","Fred Smith","Okay. We have some other internet questions here. Kelly Dougherty, Macquarie. How does a greater unpredictability of online sales challenge impact your year-out-year planning projections?","Well, let me make a couple of comments here and then ask Mike to jump in or Alan. As we mentioned earlier, we have this enormous sales group, which I've unabashedly think is the best in the Industrial Services sector and as an integral part of that we have this wonderful solutions group.","So our good customers that work with us in a partnership basis we can do an excellent job of anticipating what their needs are and provide the equipment in the right place and the sortation equipment.","The people that have the real problem in the e-commerce business by and large are those that view the transportation companies as some sort of utility or a vendor and they make some really, really bad decisions. I mean, they are -- we\u2019ve just watched an amazement several of them just really dig themselves into a whole. But our good customers, we work very closely with them.","Now despite all of the best efforts, despite that, sometimes they grow faster and sometimes they grow in different places because of their customers, I mentioned in the Northeast, the demand was just extraordinary.","However, FedEx Ground is very unique in this regard. Our hubs and those you have been in them you'll know this, they're essentially completely automated. So what that means is that if we're over volume in our New Jersey hub, we can divert that traffic to Hagerstown, Maryland or into Pennsylvania and sorted in a different timeframe, but we are not reliant on the manning inside the hub, because really the only labor that's at the location are the people that offload the trucks and the people that reload the trucks.","And we've been talking about this over and over over the years and I don't think that a lot of people understand the profundity of that automation and that flexibility we have. It\u2019s a big competitive advantage. It allows us to use bigger problems with more direct routings, which is a big part of our 27% day faster situation.","So that's how we do it as we try to work with our customers and I have to tell you there are a lot of our midsize customers that it is very clear that they are figuring out this e-commerce, what they are doing some very, very smart things and creative things. And I think, in part that's why the market is growing as much as it is. Mike, you and Henry want to amplify that.","Mike Glenn","Well, I just want to add that, I think, it's important to note that peak season is a very highly planned period of time. I mean we literally will start working with customers in late January, preparing for next peak season.","The second point is we\u2019re not going to over commit to traffic levels that we can't handle in our network. In other words, we understand what the capacity is on a given day and our operating companies do a tremendous job flexing up capacity. But as we've noted many times on this call, we have to cap certain customers to make sure that that we're providing the service that meets the customer expectations.","In addition to that, we have a team that essentially is conducting an orchestra for about one month out of the year and they have essentially a control tower that has minute by minute discussions with the operating companies, which are making changes to inputs that we received from our customers, which allowing -- allow us to deploy our resources and adjust the changes in demand both up and down.","So as we say in the South this is not our first rodeo and we've been doing this for awhile and I think we have got a pretty good business model here and we've demonstrated that works well in terms of meeting customer expectations.","Henry Maier","Yeah. This is Henry Maier. I'd just like to add to this question a couple things. First of all, Fred mentioned the 33 fully automated hubs we have. The second thing I would add is that we currently operates 49 fully automated satellites as well, which gave us -- which give us enormous flexibility in being able offload volume from hubs to these automated satellites and vice versa. They also provide a bit of a relief if you will for diverting volume away from hubs and being able to sort it and move it direct.","The biggest reason why we are successful as we are and at peak, and we see the surges in volume is simply FedEx people. We have the greatest group of people of any company I believe in the world. We add in the yeoman effort of our contracted service providers and the dedication and professionalism, the commitment to quality and just playing innovation to being able to adapt on-the-fly. I can tell you it, for somebody who sits in my chair it's nothing short of an inspirational. And I think that's the secret sauce here which allows us to be able to handle the unpredictability of online sales.","Fred Smith","David Ross asked will the price of oil if it's lower for longer help or hurt Express? You know on the margin, the elasticity will certainly create more Express demand and on the margin it might be a bit more priority versus economy. But the markets for Express and increasingly the door-to-door International Express are built on customer needs and purchases.","So if you need a defibrillator for an operation tomorrow at the Cleveland Hospital, you do not want that defibrillator stuck and a package be a truck with a bunch of toys and that is why our Express network is focused on these high-value added type of products and high-value added products are sold around the world in global markets.","And finally, what\u2019s really exciting is increasingly they're being sold door-to-door on an e-commerce basis. One customer that has the entire wares of the world for a business or a consumer, and that is going to be a very big market and it's where the Express Intercontinental Network is focused.","So on the margin, yes it will have some effect, but not as much. I think as the fact that people use Express and Global Express when they have an urgent need to move something in one to two business days door to door.","David Vernon of Bernstein asked, has FedEx detail the cost-benefit opportunities and costs associated with the TNT acquisition? And does the company intend to provide guidance on these items at any point prior to their incorporation and the results what we learn as we go as we have GENCO. I\u2019ll answer the first and ask Alan to comment on the guidance issue.","The answer to the first part of the question is of course we have detailed plan. We did an in-depth strategic business case as we do for any potential acquisition, which was studied in great detail. We have a very, very good integration process that\u2019s run through a formal process headed up by Alan and Bob Henning on the financial side and Dave Bronczek and David Cunningham and David Banks, our President of Europe, on their side. And this is a process -- a template that we use on all our acquisitions.","The acquisition, of course, was presented to the FedEx Board of Directors and it is in great detail. Now obviously, based on imperfect knowledge and changing economic circumstances as you get in deeper and you understand things, things will change but we\u2019re already far enough into it. Although we are still not able to completely get into details because we don\u2019t have approvals to know that this is going to be just a terrific fit. And we love the team members over there. And I think they love being part of FedEx prospectively. So Alan on the guidance, you want to comment?","Alan Graf","We have a very detailed integration planning going underway right now that I'm very excited about. First of all, they're executing on our outlook strategy. We agree with that. We've been supportive of that. And they have been successful in that regard. Secondarily the integration teams have great details to the extent we\u2019re permitted to talk about, that is on what\u2019s going to happen on day one, what\u2019s going to happen on next 100 days, in year one, two et cetera.","I can tell you that the people that we\u2019re working with are terrific. There are many, many opportunities that are equal to or greater than I thought when we build the strategic business case. Having said that, I would also tell you that the integration is going to take some time and is not easy to do. There are tax structural and accounting issues to deal with. There are IT issues, there\u2019s rationalizing the lanes, all the things you can think of.","We've got every one of those being worked on. We can't talk to their customers. They can\u2019t talk to ours. We can talk about pricing and of course that\u2019s where some of the big numbers are. But what I'm seeing so far is I\u2019m very pleased with it. As I said day one, we are not going to see big synergies financially until fiscal \u201818. Fiscal \u201817 is going to be a year of getting our hands around some of these very tough issues and making sure that we don't do any harm. The business continuity is there that the customers are taking care of and that we don't miss a beat from service level. So it's not easy but I think the reward is going to be fabulous.","Fred Smith","So let me combine two questions here into one answer because I think this is an important issue. First part of it comes from Allison Landry at Credit Suisse. Have you seen any shift changes in the marketplace with respect to UPS\u2019 acquisition of Coyote in terms of handling the peak season? And on the same line of thinking, David Vernon, as does the transition to the ISP model at ground increase the risk of these larger contracting entities are harder to handle or deal with in essence?","Well, a couple of things here. First of all, we already have a truck brokerage, and transportation management unit inside FedEx and have had for quite some sometime. But much more importantly, I think it's a misunderstanding of the FedEx Ground business model because the very reason we have these small businesses providing our highway and pickup and delivery capabilities is that they are very, very close to the market, very close to the to the customers, very close to the understanding of the roads and geographic areas that they serve.","So by design, we want small business people who have those characteristics and are very, very entrepreneurial and we do not have many contract service providers that have over 7 to 10 trucks. I mean that would be a very big one. And if you start going beyond that, you lose that tactile entrepreneurial feel. And the thing I love about it and I'm most proud about the ground thing is these are entrepreneurs and they do very well if they're good business people and it's just really fun to watch them.","I hated that when we bought RPS, the single route contractor, you watch these young folks and minorities and everything start off and get an area and build themselves a wonderful life. And then because of all of this litigation and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and the state tax people and all that, we've had to move to the point where you have to have a minimal level vehicles and be incorporated.","To be that as it may, we still retain the best of both worlds. And in fact, it's probably much more productive based on our experience to have the somewhat larger unit. So for all intention purposes, I will stay with this business model and that's not going to change. So we don't need the same number of purchased transportation tractors and trailers that UPS does. And so I think it was probably smart for them to get Coyote. I'm not sure that it would be smart for FedEx. And Henry wants to jump in here.","Henry Maier","Well, I think it\u2019s -- I would echo everything Fred said. I think it\u2019s important for the folks on the phone to understand that we provide some peak incentives so that both our PND contractors and over-the-road contractors bring on the necessary resources within their business to handle our projected peak volumes. That just gives us unbelievable flexibility particularly when business spikes et cetera.","I would add that the way you need to think about them as they are coin-operated. They are entrepreneurs. They respond very well to the opportunity to earn more revenue for their businesses and they step up every single year.","Fred Smith","So in essence, we have a huge truck brokerage capability through our highway contract service providers. They get tractors and are able to put this power on much better in the geographic area than a centralized brokerage system for us. However, again we have a wonderful truck brokerage and transportation management capability for our supply chain customers and to help with purchased transportation where we get it.","Let me take one more from the Internet and then we\u2019ll take a few from the telephone. Again this is Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Have you seen a contraction in domestic B2B? The answer to the question is no.","Operator","And thank you for those email questions. We\u2019ll now take a few questions over the phone line. And we will go to Scott Group from Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey. Thanks. Afternoon guys. So just wanted to follow up on the question earlier about Ground volume growth and maybe little bit about seasonality. So nice acceleration and volume growth to 9% in the second quarter. Is this continuing in the third quarter? I\u2019m just wondering if there's any impact of Cyber Monday which was in 2Q this year and I think in third quarter last year. So, Alan, how does that impact the seasonality of earnings? And I know you made some comments about third quarter, fourth quarter, can you just clarify what your point was there?","Mike Glenn","Well, this is Mike Glenn. And let me say, just reiterate the remarks we made earlier. I mean we\u2019re off to a strong start in our peak season. As Fred said, we picked up over 26 million packages on Monday. We've exceeded our forecast for our peak days in the month of December and what January, February holds, we'll just have to wait and see. We don't forecast volumes for upcoming quarters. But we're very happy with where we are based on the start to peak season.","Fred Smith","We don't forecast them for you. We forecast them internally. Henry and Alan want to way in on this.","Alan Graf","Scott, this is Alan. One of the reasons that I\u2019ve taken up my guidance for you on Ground CapEx is not just the -- by the way, fairly stellar increases in land acquisitions and material handling costs and that's all got to do with e-commerce. That\u2019s also because Grounds going to continue to grow.","What we can do and I\u2019m a good Missouri Lutheran, so I can say this, we can\u2019t build the Church for Easter. So part of what we\u2019re doing about yield management and everything else is we've got to get these packages little bit smaller or we\u2019ve got to get paid for the space they\u2019re using. We can\u2019t have a lot of excess capacity lying around the other 11 months of the year and we\u2019re not going to do that. Henry is working his people everyday of the week, we\u2019re open 24x7 for this entire peak season, competitions not doing that and that\u2019s made a big difference for us.","Henry Maier","Scott, this is Henry Maier. I\u2019ll be a little bit more to the point. I\u2019ve been around here for a lot of peaks. This is without a doubt the busiest one I\u2019ve ever seen. And it is been consistent every single day since 11.30 and there's no sign it\u2019s going to led up. So that\u2019s where we are.","Our people are stepping up to the task. Our network is doing -- is performing exactly the way it\u2019s designed. If we didn\u2019t have these automated hubs and automated satellites and the great people, I think we\u2019d be much different shape than we are today.","Fred Smith","Let me just state again what I said in my opening remarks here. We think we have very, very good strategic plans and an in-depth knowledge of this market better or at least as good as any entity on the planet. And we have very, very creative concepts to make our assets sweat more and be able to process more packages in all of our networks. And that's why we were so forthright in saying that we expect this to continue absent macro-economic or geopolitical events.","And let me say it again, we continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows and returns on invested capital, and we are confident these basic trend should continue well into the future, barring major events or macro-economic factors.","Now having said that, I know it's very important for all you folks on the call, sometimes we are off 1% or 2% in the quarter. This is a big, big enterprise. We can pick up, transport and deliver to virtually any address in one to two business days to 90 some odd percent of the global population. That takes incredible networks.","Henry Maier's network at Ground has 550 facilities. David Bronczek has 600 FedEx Express stations, which are very different in the way they're designed that just in the U.S. They're very different in the way they\u2019re designed because they're designed to interface with airplanes, not with 28 or hopefully someday 33-foot hub. Mike Ducker\u2019s FedEx Freight is very different and as I told you, these automated hubs that Henry is operating are some of the most incredible facilities ever put on the planet.","So this is a very big complex business with an enormous amount of value add. And so we can\u2019t get it within 1% or 2% sometimes, but directionally, we\u2019re very confident that we will continue to achieve those things that I just said, increasing margins, earnings and cash flow and ROIC.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to Alex Vecchio from Morgan Stanley.","Alex Vecchio","Good evening and thanks for taking the question. This might be best suited for Chris. Can you just provide just a little bit more color and background on the independent contractor litigation cost at Ground in the quarter, the extent to which we might see litigation expenses going forward related to any lawsuit outstanding. And maybe the overall defense ability of the independent contractor model that you employ. I realize you guys have made some changes there with respect to requesting that the contractors incorporate. But maybe we can just get a recap of the model and the litigation expenses this quarter? Thank you.","Chris Richards","Yes. Alex, I'll try to give you some insight on this. First of all, all of the litigation involved the Ground contractor model that was being operated in the early 2000. And we have made significant changes as you know, both requiring incorporation but also requiring that every contractor treat all of their folks as employees and they provide a complete compliant program including workers compensation, unemployment compensation and all the other matters that are required by the various states to ensure that the folks are comfortable.","But these are in fact, independent businesses running under their own direction and guidance. We have had some litigation that has not been as positive for us, particularly out in the Ninth Circuit. For those of you, who are familiar with the Ninth Circuit, it is a very tough Circuit for business operation. They tend to be very difficult in their analysis of what constitutes an employee. And so we have had some settlements from cases where we had adverse decisions in the Ninth Circuit.","That being said, we have had positive decisions in the First Circuit and in some other Circuits and we still have the bulk of the cases being held at the Seventh Circuit where we are awaiting a briefing and hearing schedule. We do opportunistically settled these lawsuits if we get in a situation where we can do that to resolve the issues and move things forward.","You need to keep in mind that in most of these instances, the bulk of the people who are involved in this litigation have moved on and are not contractors any more. So this is really in our rearview mirror and while it's my job to make sure we get through it on a satisfactory basis, we are extremely confident in our independent service provider model and are all incorporated model that we are operating today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Yeah. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on good results in a very difficult economy. So Fred or Mike, I think for an analyst, it\u2019s been covered in for a long time. If we knew where ISM is going to be, an IP be negative, we would have thought a lot of earnings contraction here for the company because you just historically had a lot of exposure to the industrial economy. So what do you think has decoupled here that\u2019s allowing you actually to get close to 20% growth if you hit the guidance this year? And what otherwise is a very slow growth or even contracting industrial macro backdrop?","Alan Graf","Hey, Brandon. This is Alan. We\u2019ve been working for a very long period of time with profit improvement program and all the things that are involved in that are preparing for the very situation that we\u2019re in. We have significantly reduced our capacity but it's significantly more fuel and maintenance pilot efficient and more reliable and we have a network that\u2019s running pretty tight.","Having said that, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth for IP to continue to grow and move lower yielding products off that backbone network that we flying internationally. Productivity that we\u2019re seeing in the field with our technology and automation improvements at Express are yielding tremendous thing. I mean, its essentially we\u2019re doing exactly what we told you we were going to do in October 2012 and we\u2019re learning as we go. And we\u2019ve got a lot more room to do that. I\u2019m going to pass it over to Dave Bronczek.","Dave Bronczek","Yeah. This is Dave. Alan\u2019s right. I mean and if you remember what I said at the beginning, we structured our network to flex up and to flex down. And we would win on either side of that equation. And quite frankly, we\u2019re not flexing down much anymore because the economy is pretty robust for us. International economy is growing and IP is still 72% or more of my all up revenue for international.","So it's significant, its high yield. So when we actually can flex up or down when we win, we're in a really good spot, so that\u2019s international network, couple that with the U.S. network and the Asia to the U.S. and U.S. back that's why you're seeing such high margins and profits from Express.","Mike Glenn","Bear in mind also we have a huge outbound market share and Express for the United States. So the dollar exchange ratio means that our outbound is affected much more than our inbound. And I think Dave mentioned earlier our European to the U.S. traffic is substantially up and our Asia to the U.S. traffic is it's short of flattish but it's not declining.","And the real pony in here again is e-commerce and you're starting to see these patterns where people are shipping individual items door-to-door because they can now with the software that we're putting out there and others, they can see what the landed cost is and what the duties and taxes are. So it\u2019s a sea change. It\u2019s the same thing that's driving e-commerce in United States but is more industrial because their business products in domain and to some degree individual consumer B2C as well. There is international question about FedEx Trade Networks. It's an integral part of the Express segment. The quest is to comment on them.","Only forwarding industry, I don't think it's appropriate for us to do that but it\u2019s an integral part of the value proposition that Dave offers and the Express system is essentially focused on door-to-door express. There are some freight that moves through that network. We\u2019re capable of flying extra sections of customers needed, particularly at peak and then FTN handles the cargo, the freight and heavy consolidation. So our FTN network which we built from scratch is a perfect complement for our customers to our Express network.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to Kevin Sterling from BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling","Thank you. Good evening. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you briefly mentioned a Monday residential trial run. You are trying in certain cities. Could you expand on that a little bit? What exactly you guys are doing there, kind of, some of the successes you\u2019re having and I\u2019d imagine, it\u2019s trying to increase stop density if you will. So maybe you can expand on that trial run little bit with Monday residential deliveries?","Fred Smith","Yeah. This is Smith here. Let me turn it over to Henry because he can give you some detail and Alan wanted Henry to answer this. But our home delivery network was set up to deliver Tuesday through Saturday and remembers a few minutes ago, about we have lots of concepts based on the growth of e-commerce, how to make our assets sweat more, how do we move more traffic, deliver more traffic with the same assets.","So Henry has begun to deliver six days a week, not just five days a week. Now B2B has always been different than the B2C. So why don\u2019t you give some color around that, Henry?","Henry Maier","Yeah. Since its inception, FedEx home delivery delivered Tuesday through Saturday, which means we've essentially deliver Monday\u2019s volume the previous Saturday. And with the advent of e-commerce, I mean, it\u2019s a 24x7 market, you can buy things online from your phone anytime at the day or night.","The way we are able to flex up our capacity at peak every year as we essentially operate a Monday through Saturday network and we run hubs on Sundays so that we can advance -- we can pick up volume into the network, so that we can smooth the huge peaks and valleys during peak throughout the six days of the week.","It's occurred to us some number of years ago that why don't we just operate that way year round. With e-commerce, Monday is tends to be fairly heavy pickup days anyhow. Why not begin working that volume on the weekend rather than on Monday. Deliver the volume on Monday and then operate the network six days a week year round.","The benefits of that are obvious. The first is, is that on residential service side, we essentially advanced roughly 20% of the volume in the network by whole day, so the customer gets to the day sooner than they would have been.","The other thing is it gives us the ability to smooth the volume, which means that we can operate our fixed network more efficiently throughout the week and by smoothen the capacity we frankly don't need as much of it as we had in years past. And we\u2019ve tried we -- as Fred and Alan mentioned here, we've had a pilot running since roughly May of this year. I would say it\u2019s a success. We are currently studying where we roll it out next.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Hey. Good evening. Just a quickly on the other operating loss, it increased $212 million? Can you kind of delve into what scale that up?","Alan Graf","Well, it had a pension credit unit from mark-to-market accounting really in our K and if you want lot more detail, we will be happy to take that offline.","Mickey Foster","Okay. That\u2019s the end of the call. Thank you for participating in FedEx Corporation second quarter earnings release conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s presentation.

Welcome to our discussion of results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. We appreciate the interest of the people on the call.","As our press release notes, we reaffirm our FY'17 guidance of $11.85 to $12.35, adjusted EPS based on our expectation of an excellent fourth quarter and despite the 30% year-over-year fuel cost increase in the third quarter. Going forward, we will experience less volatility in earnings when fuel prices change rapidly due to our new weekly versus monthly fuel charge adjustment system that was implemented last month. Alan will cover this in greater detail.","I should note given the interest in the subject, FedEx Ground segment margin will be 15% plus in the current quarter and Alan will also comment further on this. FedEx delivered an outstanding peak season with our highest volumes ever and record service levels. I think our team members around the world for doing this.","We believe strongly that our strategic investments to expand our global scope and our portfolio of services will significantly increase long-term profits. During the third quarter for example, FedEx was pleased to extend our 16-year Express Air transportation relationship with the U.S. Postal Service and we added to our range of customer solutions with FedEx Fulfillment to benefit small and medium-sized businesses and we reached agreement with Walgreens to broaden convenient access to FedEx services. Raj will provide additional context on these.","The integration of TNT Express is proceeding smoothly and we are targeting operating income improvement at the FedEx Express Group of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. Alan and Dave Bronczek will offer additional information on this.","We reiterate our continued improvement -- continued commitment to grow corporate earnings, margins, cash flows and returns over the long term. Recently Fortune Magazine recognized FedEx as one of the best companies to work for and world's most admired companies, a reflection of the commitment by more than 400,000 team members who are purple promise, which simply states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","Now I'll turn the call over to Raj.","Rajesh Subramaniam","Thank you, Fred. I'd open with our economic update and outlook, then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and enhancements to the FedEx portfolio.","We see moderate growth in the global economy. We expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.3% and CY '17 driven by robust consumer spending and stronger business investment. Industrial production growth should rebound to 1.5% this year. GDP and industrial production are expected to grow by 2.5% and 2.4% respectively in CY '18. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.6% for CY '17 and 2.8% for CY '18.","Now I'll review revenue, volume and yields trends by segment. U.S. domestic express package revenue grew 3% year-over-year in Q3. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of increased weight per package, dim devisor change and improved rate and discount. Yield excluding fuel surcharge increased 2%.","Fiscal year '17 Q3 had one operating day less than Q3 last year, which lowered the revenue growth and year-over-year comparison. Domestic Express package volume increased by 1% year-over-year during the quarter.","FedEx international export package revenue increased 4% year-over-year in Q3. FedEx international priority volume increased 5%, while international economy volume grew 2%. International export package yield increased 1%, excluding fuel and exchange rate impact, yields increased 2%, primarily driven by impact of product and destination mix.","The Ground segment revenue increased 6% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 2% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 6%, benefiting from the annual rate increase and yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost and the ground dim devisor change. As has been mentioned before, FY '17 Q3 also had one operating day less than Q3 of last year.","Fuel prices did not have a material impact on yield per package. FedEx Freight segment increased -- revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q3. Average daily shipments are flat year-over-year and this is partially driven by our stronger emphasis on pricing improvement. Revenue per LTL shipment increased 4%. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, the revenue per LTL shipment was up 2%.","The third quarter included most of the 2016 peak holiday season. This year's peak was a record-breaking both in volume, but most importantly service. We are proud of more than -- more than 400,000 team members around the world who came together to provide record service levels this past holiday.","With volume that more than doubled our daily average on multiple days, all of our year around preparation paid off and our networks performed as designed to meet the surge in demand. Once again, volume during this season was impacted by the continued growth of e-commerce. The retail and e-tail industry and consumer shopping patterns continue to evolve.","We had record volumes over the peak season although we had a few large customers who had volumes below their peak forecast. We are already well into our planning for peak 2017 to ensure we are ready to meet our customer's needs in a profitable manner.","The retail industry is being transformed the e-commerce and FedEx is at the forefront of innovating and incrementing solutions up and down the value chain that make e-commerce convenient and accessible to consumers around the world. In this context, we made some significant enhancements to the FedEx portfolio during the quarter. Let me highlight a couple of them.","First, we recently announced a long-time alliance agreement with Walgreens or FedEx On-Site. FedEx On-Site is a nationwide network of alternate delivery locations, which is a direct response to our customers setting us they want access to more choices for package delivery and drop off.","FedEx On-Site locations include some Albertsons and some Kroger grocery stores as well as select Office Depot, OfficeMax and FedEx authorized ship centers. Adding Walgreens will dramatically increase the number of FedEx on-site locations. Walgreens is an ideal partner. They're well-respected brand with whom we had a long relationship and are well known for their convenient locations. We already started the rollout and expect nearly 8,000 Walgreens locations with FedEx On-Site in time for this year's peak season.","Second, we also announced the launch of FedEx fulfillment in February. This is an e-commerce logistics solution for small and medium-sized businesses. The strength of the FedEx portfolio allowed us to bring to market a fulfillment solution with advanced warehouse management, the latest same-day cut-off times, two-day ground shipping throughout the United States and a seamless return process.","FedEx Fulfillment also improves order accuracy through top-tier warehouse management systems and experts in fulfillment. We've received strong customer interest over the first few weeks since launch especially with small and medium-sized customers who are in need of a powerful and attractive alternative to competitive e-tail logistics and fulfillment options.","I'll now turn the call over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you, raj. Well done for your rookie performance.","Good afternoon, everyone. I hope your NCAA Brackets are holding up better than mine and all your favorite college teams are winning.","Looking at FedEx Corporation third quarter results, the net impact of fuel, one fewer operating day at Express and Ground and ground expansion costs weighed significantly on earnings. A bright spot was yield growth at all our transportation segments as we continue to improve our revenue quality and manage yields.","Three things you should know about fuel. First jet fuel prices increased 30% year-over-year for the quarter. Second, year-over-year we had a benefit from net fuel in Q3 last year and a loss from net fuel this year and thirdly, last month as Fred mentioned, we began adjusting our fuel surcharge weekly instead of monthly for both Express and Ground.","This should better match volatility of our fuel expenses to our surcharge. With that change, fuel will not impact our future results as much as it did in the past and we will not fully lapp those year-over-year impacts until February of 2018. Our effective tax rate of 37.5% for the quarter was 203 basis points higher than last year and was also a drag.","Higher tax rate in FY '17 are due to costs incurred in connection with the integration of TNT Express as well as local country losses in some entities within TNT for which no tax benefit was recognized due to uncertainty for the utilization of these losses. This impact has been partially offset by the continuing benefit to the tax rate from last year's early adoption of the accounting standards update for share-based payments.","During the next three years however, the benefits of the TNT Express integration, fleet modernization, yield management, e-commerce growth and investments in network capabilities and efficiency will drive significant earnings growth. For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance for adjusted earnings of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share, assuming moderate economic growth as Raj discussed.","Earnings in Q4 will primarily be driven by growth in volume and yield and Express and Ground as well as the inclusion of TNT Express. As Fred mentioned, we expect ground segment operating margin to be 15% plus for the quarter. We expect our effective tax rate to fall from Q3 to Q4 and our FY'17 effective tax rate should be about 35% prior to year-end mark-to-market accounting.","Our capital spending forecast for FY'17 is approximately $300 million lower at $5.3 billion due to reduced spending forecast at FedEx Ground. For the year, we have made contributions totaling $2 million to our tax qualified U.S. domestic pension plans, which is $1.5 billion more than what is required, partially funded by the $1.2 million debt offering we issued in January. We do not expect to make any further contributions to these pension plans during this fiscal year.","We anticipate our U.S. pension plans will make benefit payments aggregating in excess of $1 billion in the fourth quarter to former employees who elected to receive their benefits early under a voluntary program. This payout will allow us to reduce future liabilities and administrative costs associated with our U.S. pension plans. Our U.S. pension plans continue to have ample funds to meet expected benefit payments.","At Ground, operating income declined 8% year-over-year because of higher rent, depreciation and staffing as a result of network expansion, unfavorable net fuel impact and one fewer operating day. Ground's FY'17 CapEx forecast is reduced from $2 billion to $1.7 billion, much of which is timing the projects that are already underway.","We continue our intense focus on balancing capacity and volume growth with yield management at Ground. These actions affected our Q3 volume results and are also expected to mute Q4 volume growth. While network expansion dampens Ground's near-term profitability, we believe these investments will enhance long-term earnings, margins and cash flow.","At Freight, higher salaries, wages and information technology expenses reduced operating income. As with Ground, we're working toward a better balance of volume, pricing and capacity. Those efforts along with an expected improvement in the U.S. industrial environment should lead to better operating results at FedEx Freight in coming quarters.","Express adjusted operating income was significantly impacted year-over-year by the unfavorable net impact of fuel and one fewer operating day. On a GAAP basis, Express results included $31 million of TNT Express integration expenses for the quarter. Express results benefited from higher yields and volumes and we continue to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet and increase productivity.","At TNT, revenues were approximately $1.8 billion within adjusted operating profit of $40 million. Adjusted operating margin was 2.2%. Adjustments to operating income for Q3 included TNT Express integration and restructuring expenses of $22 million as well as intangible asset amortization of $16 million.","With respect to the TNT integration, and you will hear more on the shortly from Dave, we continue to have a great degree of confidence in the TNT acquisition and the value to the enterprise. We have a very long history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx and TNT is no exception as the integration is going extremely well.","In the nine months following close, we learned a great deal more about the TNT business. The business we acquired was severely under-invested, particularly in IT and in operations which is driving additional investments. Furthermore, prior to the acquisition, TNT announced a restructuring program with numerous initiatives to improve the business.","Over the fall, we executed a strategic assessment to optimize capital and expense across the base FedEx Express and TNT businesses, the TNT restructuring program and the integration activities. The result is a more streamlined set of projects and initiatives that deliver the greatest benefits.","We believe that the combination of the businesses is more than just an integration of the businesses and we are positioning ourselves to leverage combined businesses in a very powerful way. We see the combination of these two businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration.","As the integration progresses, businesses are combined and countries are fully integrated. Discrete financial information about the legacy business will no longer exist on a comparable basis. So, beginning in FY'18, we intend to eliminate the TNT segment and to begin reporting FedEx Express group results in one segment, FedEx Express segment.","Given these plan changes, we'll begin describing our target for the TNT integration benefits along with improvements in the base business in terms of the FedEx Express group operating income. We are targeting operating income improvement at the FedEx Express Group of between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in FY'20 versus our final FY'17 adjusted results, assuming moderate income economic growth as well as current accounting and tax rules.","Based on this target and current tax rules, we expect to lower our pre-mark-to-market effective tax rate to around 33% to 34% with the completion of the integration. The pace of the integration activities in FY'17 combined with preparations for FY'18 is dictating higher levels of dedicated integration personnel training for our teams, professional fees to support the integration, as well as for investments in IT and operations.","As a result, we are increasing this year's forecast for integration and restructuring related spending by $50 million to $300 million and acceleration previously planned for later in the four-year integration plan. We expect the aggregate integration expense over four years to be approximately $800 million. The actual timing and amounts of these integration-related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans.","The integration is complex and the timing and pace of the integration is subject to change based on numerous factors and dependencies. However, we ultimately get to our target -- how we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals for the Express Group.","And now Dave will give you an update on our progress with the TNT integration.","Dave Bronczek","Okay. And thank you, Alan. Good afternoon to everyone.","The TNT acquisition as I'm sure you know is the largest in FedEx's history and we have discussed this with you previously. This provides extensive benefits to FedEx, including rapidly accelerating our European and global growth around the world, substantially enhancing our global footprint and leveraging TNT's lower cost road networks in Europe, Middle East and Asia, producing improved results for the entire corporation.","Our global integration teams are working to bring TNT and it's 54,000 employees and their operations across 200 countries and more than one million shipments daily into the FedEx Express system. The integration of TNT and FedEx is on track with significant progress thus far in fiscal 2017.","Our teams around the world are energized, they are focused on delivering the opportunities and the benefits that's provided by this combination. The integration plan that was developed prior to the close of the deal, has been fully validated and did not require a significant revision, which has given us tremendous momentum as we moved into the execution phase.","While we have a multi-year integration ahead of us, my comments will give you some additional context on why we're so confident in the value of this deal and the status of our progress to date, which has gone extremely well.","On the people side, our leadership team is now all in place. We continue to benefit from the expertise of TNT's personnel. More than 35% of our integration, international officer positions are now held by former TNT executives. We have an outstanding leadership team in place to drive our integration and as Alan and Fred have already talked about, the integration is a key driver to FedEx Express FY'20 operating income improvement target of between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion.","The benefits of the integration will be driven by four key areas, the first being optimizing pickup and delivery operations. We are implementing new technology and optimizing the location of all of our facilities and all of our stations to deliver unmatched service. We'll benefit from efficiencies, improved stop density and the economies of scale that come along with the integration of pickup and delivery operations.","Next, we will operate one integrated global express network, capitalizing on technology and solutions, the most efficiently route parcels and freight through our integrated hub, line haul and of course, our Intercontinental air network, to deliver the absolute best service for our combined customers while at the same time, significantly dropping our costs.","Third, we will improve the efficiency of staff functions with improved IT solutions, streamlining support functions and realizing significant sourcing savings globally. And last but certainly not least, we will grow revenue by offering a best-in-class portfolio of services through a single sales team, a single online customer facing tool and through revenue management activities focused on improving market share, yield and of course, profitability.","As you all know, these are network businesses and require the combination of our pickup and delivery operations at a local level, our air and ground networks and our extensive operational sales and back office IT system. Given all the factors, we continue to expect the full integration to take four years to complete from the date of the acquisition, which was last May.","Now on the integration of the two businesses we generally have concluded at a country level there is different integration models and we have identified the planning process. Those integration models are what we call direct serve -- the direct serve; its FedEx the TNT or a global service partner at FedEx through global service partner at TNT or two one or the other.","Using these models however, to date, we have successfully integrated 33 countries around the world already. Beyond these 33 countries, other country integrations are underway, including three that we launched during this third quarter; Spain, Japan, United Arab Emirates, our integration in the United States and Canada, which started in the first quarter of FY'17 will in fact be complete by May 31.","In total, we have approximately 50 countries in process or completed to this point. In addition to representing different integration models, the countries completed to date are well established markets with high value opportunities and from them, we're learning very valuable lessons.","While the integration activities are most visible at the country level, the integration is supported by several key back office initiatives mainly by our IT functions around the world. One of these and a foundational element is the success of the integration of our two companies and the ability for us to handle TNT packages inside FedEx and FedEx packages inside TNT.","This cross-scan technology we are deploying will significantly benefit our customers and of course all of our employees. This first phase of technology was launched February 27.","Now as we look to the fourth quarter in April, we will begin a phased conversion of the intercontinental flights currently operated by ASL Belgium, the FedEx Express operation. The first phase will convert the TNT Transatlantic flight and over time the wide-body operations between Asia and Europe. These changes bring benefits to approximately 100,000 existing TNT customers for shipping to the United States and to Canada, with improved transit times and a broader service coverage.","And beyond the air network changes, country level integration preparation and executions are in full swing. As we are preparing for our FY'18 launch of integrated activities, we're adding 25 more countries. So, as you can tell, we have a complex and multi-year integration ahead of us and we are off to a very strong, fast, productive and extremely important for us, team collaboration going forward.","So, with that, I'm in a turn it back over to Mickey for opening up for Q&A.","Mickey Foster","Okay. We're going to take two questions from questions that were submitted before and then we'll take two live questions. Fred?","Fred Smith","All right Mickey, let's start off with a question about capital. A, will CapEx as a percentage of sales come down by the end of this decade or will it remain elevated beyond 2020. Any specifics would be appreciated. That's from Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. And B, what will be your biggest requirements for capital over the next five years?","As a percentage of revenue, do you expect your capital budgets to be less, the same or more than will be this year Matthew Troy, Wells Fargo. Alan will take this.","Alan Graf","The biggest requirements for capital over the next five years will remain elevated at Express. We have a current pace that we have right now and you can see in our stat book how that pace continues. So, I think over time, we will start to see post FY'18 CapEx as a percentage of revenue will begin to decline. TNT is not nearly as capital intensive as Express is.","Although we are investing a lot in the integration and as you saw in my opening remarks, we've accelerated a lot of these costs into '17 and will bring some of '19 into '18 because we've been so successful as Dave so eloquently described.","There are a couple wildcards in what I'm saying here. One is if we can somehow get approval for 33-foot twins, those have a ridiculously fast payback and we will begin to re-fleet our linehaul ground operations as rapidly as we can. Those were not in my projections and then secondarily, if there is expensing of capital as part of the tax code, we're likely to accelerate our capital spending as well because we get significantly improved returns on essentially the interest-free loan from the government but be able to expense day one.","Fred Smith","Okay. The next question from the Internet is how you drive better forecasting from customers? Can you incentivize them to provide a more accurate forecast or penalize them for overpromising deliveries? Helane Becker of Cowen? Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Yes sir. As I mentioned before, our planning is well underway for the peak 2017 to ensure we provide outstanding service for our customers and we continue to work with our customers year-round to prepare for peak. Now it's important to remember that it was relatively small number of customers that drive the bulk of surge in demand at peak and we work closely with each of them to ensure the highest possible levels of accuracy on their forecast.","But do keep in mind that forecasting e-commerce volume at peak is an exact signs at best. With all that being said, we're looking at several pricing options to ensure that we get a reasonable return on investments that we're making.","Fred Smith","Okay. Now we'll take some live questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] And we'll take our first question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Allison Landry","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow-up on the earlier CapEx question, but sort of honing in on Ground specifically, so it seems fair to say that with elevated spending at Ground over the last two years along with the pretty meaningful ramp in CapEx at UPS recently announced that volume growth has become more expensive.","So really my question is, are the investments that you're currently making to improve efficiencies in margins solving today's problems and then if we look out another three to five years assume customer demand will continue to evolve. Could you find yourself in a similar situation whereby you need to continue to invest to solve tomorrow's issues?","So really has e-commerce led to a structural increase in the capital intensity of the Ground business in your view? Thanks.","Henry Maier","Allison, this is Henry Maier. Well, first of all, I think we get an awful lot of flexibility out of these highly-automated projects that we've deployed last couple years. In fact, today we operate roughly 100 fully automated facility that includes hogs, that includes automated satellites and we have a lot of incremental capacity built into those buildings just by virtue of the fact that the technology not only allows us to operate those buildings more per day, we get better productivity out of them.","They require about 30% less headcount to operate and the automation of the operation allows us to flex that capacity across the network, depending upon where the volume shows up. So, we've invested in capacity today through our CapEx spend, that is going to allow us the ability to flex up and down based on volume for some time.","In terms of just network planning in general, we have a five-year plan. It's a rolling five-year plan. We adjust the number of projects up or down based on trends we see in the business. I would say that other than the items that Alan mentioned, probably the biggest thing out of our control right now with respect to our CapEx spend is the timing of the projects.","We had three major hubs this year delayed due to weather. We had a land acquisition that was delayed because we discovered some historic artifacts on it. So, through the due the due diligence process, we're going to have to comply with the state laws with regard to finding those kind of things.","So, I think we're in good shape today and in the future. I don't feel like we're in the catch-up mode. We've been in the last couple years and I am going to throw this back to Alan. He wants to make a comment here.","Alan Graf","Allison, a couple more points, the vast majority of the volume that we carry at FedEx Corporation is business to business and while e-commerce is the fastest-growing piece, it's the smallest piece.","And secondarily, as we discussed many times and we can discuss that at infinitum, we can't afford the same capital intensity for peak e-commerce volume, which is why we have been backing away from some customers and raising our prices significantly. So that balancing act will continue for us going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee at Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Good afternoon, guys. I wanted to follow up on ground a little bit and sort of the CapEx relative to capacity utilization, so we're assuming $300 million off of this year. I think Alan has sounded like that was a bit of a pull forward.","Are we lowering the ground spend going forward when I get a sense of maybe how your trajectory might look beyond fiscal '17 and then just thinking about the fiscal fourth quarter outlook, your ability to sort of fill up that underutilized capacity that you invested in earlier this year. How that's ramping up through the fourth quarter? Thank you.","Alan Graf","I think you're going to expect that our CapEx spend will decline over time. The size of the projects that we're bringing on, I think will position us for the future. In terms of capacity, we generally buy, we acquire land for what we believe is the end state for the facility, but we don't build to a future need, which gives us the ability to expand those facilities over time as business conditions warrant.","A great example of that is next year we have one new hub coming online, which is in Houston and we have two hub expansion projects, which are at existing hubs, one being in Champaign, Illinois and the other in Northern Kentucky. So, we don't really have -- I don't want to give you the perception here that we have unused capacity. We really don't.","Once, we get the facility in place, we have the -- we just engineer the ability to expand it over some number of years as it reaches full phase in its life.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Now we'll do two questions here. Fred?","Fred Smith","Okay. There are a couple of addition ones on Ground. I think I am going to segue right into that, since they follow on what Henry's been talking about and then there is one of freight. This is a question about what percentage of SmartPost volume can be redirected into Ground by end of 2018?","Any targets you can share in terms of potential margin impact this would -- this could have would be appreciated; Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. And then a related question from David Ross of Stifel, is are you having any problems getting contractors Henry?","Henry Maier","Down the first question, I think we got to keep in mind here that the mission is improving delivery density and revenue per stop and we're getting some software delivered this summer. We call it The Terminator. Internally, it's part of a delivery optimization project that allows us to virtually divert packages in the network from SmartPost to ground that have the same address on the same day.","But you got to keep in mind here that there is also an opportunity with adjacent deliveries and the ability to build density through the expansion of our retail on-site network, which is the Walgreens deal that we did couple months ago that Raj referred to.","So, there is a number of moving parts here that get us to where we believe we need to be. We do have an internal number, but we've decided that we're going to keep it internal for this time.","In terms of Ground businesses and the trouble of finding contractors, you might be surprised to know that the actual number of businesses under contract has declined over time and that's been the result of two things.","One, the size of these businesses is getting larger and two, our transition to a single independent service provider contract nationwide. Currently we contract with roughly 6,000 small businesses that collectively employ over 60,000 employees and we have seen no indication that these businesses are having any trouble attracting drivers either on the line haul side or on the pickup and delivery side.","And we just came through a record peak season and they performed admirably in terms of being able to get the necessary resources to handle the volume.","Fred Smith","So, we have a question or two on freight, you mentioned on the last call the investments being made at FedEx Freight. Is that why the margin is compressed a bit and you talk about the investments being made and how they should set FedEx apart from the competition? That's from David Ross of Stifel.","And what investment is the firm meaning Freight making in natural gas tractors and do you think over the next few years that these alternative sources will reduce fuel expenses at FedEx Freight? That's from Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar? Mike Ducker?","Mike Ducker","Okay. Thank you, David. Yes, there is somewhat that is partial reason for the margin compression. There are a number of different areas we're investing in. Number one, safety systems. 80% of our fleet today has the most recent safety features available on the fleet.","We'll be 100% complete by the end of '18. We're investing in customer automation systems, line haul optimization systems and replacing some legacy systems as well as new dimensioning technology. All of those investments are really aimed at our goal of double-digit margin and improving the customer experience.","So, hope that answers your question. Secondly Keith, we have the signature facility in Oklahoma City with 100 CNG trucks operating today. We opened that facility in October. So, it's somewhat dependent on the difference in CNG pricing and diesel pricing. So, it's really too early to tell the long-term impacts of that.","But we're monitoring that closely and looking at investing in these newer kinds of technology and really the whole Corporation or FedEx Freight Corporation in embracing the new technologies available to us.","Fred Smith","Let me make an editorial comment based on what Mike said about our reaching 80% of our FedEx Freight having these new modern technologies in the tractors. Similarly, Ground has been providing incentives and soon all of our independent service providers will be required to have these same types of technologies and quite frankly, the Department of Transportation and the Congress should mandate these technologies.","It is simply unacceptable to have vehicles on the road that don't have these modern technologies that can prevent so many accidents that take place historically because of the inability to stop in time or to change lanes precipitously and so forth.","So, every truck load carrier in the United States every LTL carry ground parcel, it should all be mandated and we're trying as hard as we can to push this technology into every vehicle we have as fast as we have, as we possibly can do it.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Let's take a couple of live questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to appreciate the new information you update on TNT. This is a lot of good information to work with. It's great to hear about the strong progress there. I was wondering if you could help us understand maybe the new framework of the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion versus the prior framework of $750 million?","How much of an increase is there versus the prior $750 million? Obviously, it's a different categorization. In sounds like it's a expansion on the $750 million that you think there is more there at TNT standalone, but I don't know if you could parse that out on a comparable basis and give us a sense of that? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","Okay. Thank you. This is Dave Bronczek. Then I'll turn it over to David Cunningham. Let me start off by saying what Alan said earlier. We decided and it's in the best interest of our company to just look at it holistically starting June 1. So, we're not going to break out TNT and FedEx Express into the future and the combination of TNT and FedEx Express, the synergies of it all are what we've actually presented to you now.","So, looking at our business and our business model and our strategic outlook, combined with TNT and what we see and what we've seen before and putting it all together, these are the numbers that we've now come up with and so because of all the hard work and because of all the teams that have been working on this for almost a year now, we're confident to give you these new numbers. So, David?","Dave Cunningham","So, just a couple of quick questions and thanks. We got a lot of moving parts in this equation. You got two base business. You got integration. You've got fleet changes and so what we try to do is give you the ability and us the ability to measure our progress in very clear terms between now and then.","So that's what this target is and that incorporates the synergies that we identified earlier.","Alan Graf","It's Alan. So also, everything else we're doing at Express, so there are unbelievable things going on at Domestic Express, things that have nothing to do with TNT in terms of productivity. We continue to deploy automation and IT solutions everywhere that are increasing our cost performance and so I can't see the $750 million anymore.","It's really the issue and I might've been able to see it little bit longer, but we've done such a good job with speeding up the integration that became very clear. So, we haven\u2019t wait till June. We just thought we would deliver this news now and so you'll know what to expect.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Okay. Good afternoon, everyone and thanks for taking my question. Alan or Fred, I guess as I look at the outlet here, if margins are improving at Ground from where we are today and you get the express improvement as you've laid out and we appreciate the guidance as well.","Sounds like you're going to have more free cash flow although I'm not sure that we heard a commitment that CapEx will stay flat from here, but I'm thinking more strategically at the Board level Fred, is there any emphasis or change in strategy as we need to start compensating people on the long-term plans, not just an EPS growth, but also look at free cash conversion or return on invested capital?","Fred Smith","It's funny you should ask that I just requested several months ago another look at whether we should put an ROIC component into our LTI, which Judie Edge who heads up our Corporate HR and Strategic Finance, headed up by Bob Henning just did a crackerjack report and we will show this to our Board of Directors either at the next meeting or the June meeting. I can't member which.","But bottom line is our current correlation between EPS and shareholder return is so close, it's approaching 95% and the dangers of perverse incentives of putting things like that on automatic pilot are so great that we don't think that it makes sense.","Now having said that, for those of you who have been here or listen to what we've said over the last year and a half, let me say it again. I don't think that FedEx Corporation CapEx in absolute dollars is going to vary too much for the foreseeable future. We want to put these new modern airplanes in. We see an opportunity to continue to grow our ground business, the Freight 2020 initiative that Mike said.","But with the numbers that we gave you today, it just reinforces what we've been saying that margins, cash flows and returns are going to increase over the next several years. So, there should be an increase in free cash flow unless we do some other corporate development activity or as Alan mentioned to you, there is expensing of the new tax bill or we got 33 foot trailers, which is a huge improvement in national productivity and safety as we've been arguing over and over again.","That might change in a little bit, but I don't think you're going to see the CapEx materially change the next few years. It's just too lucrative to us and our position does nothing but strengthen competitively by continuing to do this, but we will be throwing off more free cash flow in the years to come as a result of these projections or outlooks that Alan gave to you particularly based on AT&T synergies.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks. Good afternoon. Could you delve in a little bit to B2C versus B2B growth in Ground in the quarter, just to give us a feel of how each of those performed versus past peak? And then a little commentary on what you would think for Ground volume going forward? Thanks very much.","Rajesh Subramaniam","Let me kick if off and then I'll turn it over to Henry. This is Raj. We do not break out our commercial and residential volume growth numbers. Although what I can tell you is that we did see higher growth rates in our residential delivery volume driven by e-commerce.","Henry Maier","Yes, I would say without breaking out our Ground and sorry, commercial and residential volumes, our commercial volume has been very strong and have been for the last three quarters or so. I think I'm pretty bullish on where we are from here, but you need to understand that we're going to continue to balance yield and volume going forward as Alan and others have said here.","And other than that, I think you can continue to see us make good progress in this area.","Mickey Foster","Okay. I think we'll do a couple more questions Fred. Okay on the United States Postal Service, what would be the implications for FedEx and the industry at USPS reform actually passes in the law? As written it seems to broadly support the USPS financially, which could lead to greater competition, but also higher capacity for SmartPost and other products? That's from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan.","And what are the implications for the extended FedEx and USPS day sort contract with Express also from Brian?","So, let me break this into two parts. First let me ask Christine Richards to comment on the legislation that's being considered by the Congress and then I'll get her revert it back to me and either Dave Bronczek or I or one of us will comment about the other two aspects of this question.","Christine Richards","Hello, the implications of this legislation passing would be positive and we strongly support the postal reform bill that passed out of the house oversight committee last week. As you may know, the unique pre-funding requirements imposed on the Postal Service with respect to the cost of their retiree health requires them to pre-find those obligations and may have failed to make the payments for several years now.","It's time for legislation to address this situation and provide stability to one of our largest customers and also a very important vendor for us.","Fred Smith","So, let me just talk about in the broadest terms here. Obviously, our daytime system is as a great asset of FedEx. It's terrific for the Postal Service. It provides wonderful service for their priority mail. It allows us to transport on the same airplane, our two-day express and our IE traffic to and from international points as required. So, I think you will continue to see us put a lot of emphasis in these areas.","In the case of SmartPost overall, I think it's important to people that follow this industry to again recognize that there is no entity that has the delivery density of the United States Postal Service. Henry knows these number better than I, but it's something like $155 million deliveries they make every day. I think it's 120 million residential and 30 how is it, 125 million out of the 155 million are residential deliveries. They have mostly these small vehicles delivering mail, which pays for the route.","The Postal Service's overall revenues are three quarters mail, one quarter package and the packages co-mingle with the mail has proven to be a very great thing for the e-commerce industry and for the Postal Service. The real question is what happens over time as mail is diverted to digital transmission as opposed to physical delivery, which lowers the revenue per stop and what implications that has on the package business?","There is this constant refrain about the Postal Service as quote, \"a competitor as in this question, the biggest part of the Postal Service is packaged delivery business is partial select, that's where you have upstream providers pick up transport and insert into the Postal Service packages for last mile delivery by the Postal Service. That's our SmartPost.","FedEx round every day or every operating day injects into approximately 22,000 postal DD use as they call them, direct delivery units for last mile delivery. It's a wonderful agreement. We do all the upstream, these enormous hubs and operate these twin trailers, which again would be much better if they were 33 versus 28 and our SmartPost UPS's version of this UPS Assure Post and Amazon's direct injection into the Postal Service is the vast majority of the Postal Service's Parcel Select business.","The next biggest cohort is postal pickup, transport and delivery of priority mail, most of which is transported by air by FedEx Express. Then there's some other segments there, first-class mail package or whatever it is at Sub 1 Pound is like the samplers you get and that and the other.","That's the postal package business. There are some other ones, but there's this constant refrain of Postal Service as a competitor, the Postal Service is our good partner in most cases. There's some overlap there, but if you don't define the market clearly, you don't understand what these logistic systems are and what they are not and that's what's led to a lot of this mythology out there that people that only see the delivery end of it and not everything that's upstream.","Mickey Foster","Okay. We'll take some more live questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good afternoon. So, I just wanted to confirm on your 4Q targets. You reiterated your full-year target. If I look at that, it's 379 to 429 to make your range. You noted a 15% ground margin, can be put some other parameters on there. It seems like ground volume slowed down to just over 2%. Can you talk about are you still pushing away volumes there? Can you talk about your outlook and what's in that fourth quarter number, thanks?","Alan Graf","Well, I probably shouldn't have given you the dang bonus about grounds fourth quarter margin. So that will be the last time I do that. I think the point is that we didn't have the financial quarter in Q3 that we had expected, but we had a lot of reasons why that won't repeat.","Notably some of our largest customers at Ground did not hit their forecast, yet we provided capacity for that, that went unused. We had one less operating down on what you have in your model for that. Fuel, as I described was a big change that will probably reverse itself in Q4 and then the tax rate.","So, it's more steady as she goes and I were you guys, I would forget Q3. Look at everything else we said.","Fred Smith","But more importantly what you need to do is look at what Alan told you last June, what was the range you gave last June Alan.","Alan Graf","It was the same range except it was 10% lower on the bottom.","Fred Smith","Well that says everything you need to know.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Hey good evening, guys. Thanks for the time. So just a quick question here, referencing back to UPS' Analyst Day and their decision to initiate Saturday ground operations in the U.S. this year on a rolling basis. What sort of an impact do you think that could have on your own ground business? And would there be any need to make some changes to your own operating days during the week in response? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","Jack, thanks for the question. You should know that we have been operating on Saturdays at FedEx Ground for going on 17 or 18 years now and operating six days a week is absolutely nothing new to us. In fact, every year at peak, at least for the past 10 years or so, we've operated six days a week sometimes seven every day from a cyber Monday through Christmas Eve.","And our highly-automated facilities give us the capability to do this. Now given the growth of e-commerce, we thought some time ago that if retail customers could ship six days a week in December, they might like to do that 12 months out of the year.","So, couple of years ago, we actually put together a concept where we began offering six-day delivery in select markets. Now in addition to the obvious customer benefits to this, you should know that there are some pretty significant operational benefits to operating six days a week around as well.","What we've learned from all of this and what we continue to learn all through these pilots, is in order to get the full benefit of a six-day operation, e-commerce companies must fulfill and release volume over the weekend and time for sortation and delivery on a Monday.","If they're able to do that, then you're going to hit a homerun because you significantly advance volume in the network that would've been due for Tuesday. As customers adjust their operations to fulfill and ship on weekends and do it year-round, I can assure you we are ready to take their business.","Mickey Foster","Fred?","Fred Smith","Okay. We have another question off the Internet. This is about Amazon. Amazon's interest in delivery has evolved rapidly from, this is a quote, not for me, from Cute Photo Ops of Drones who are now registering as an ocean and air forwarder to most recently announcing plans for a $1.5 million air hub not far from your largest competitors.","As Amazon's posturing has become more aggressive and larger in scale have your thoughts changed on their potential impact on the industry and how you interact with them as a customer\/competitor? Matthew Troy, Wells Fargo? Raj?","Rajesh Subramaniam","Thank you. Matthew. Let me just say that Amazon is a long-standing customers of ours and while Amazon does deliver a portion of their packages, they still rely heavily on USPS, UPS and FedEx for delivery and it's definitely worth mentioning that no single customer represents more than 3% of our total revenue and Amazon is far from being our largest customer.","Fred Smith","I think there is one more point to make here and that was Allen's comment a few minutes ago, the vast majority of FedEx business is business to business. 85% plus of our business has nothing to do with e-commerce. So, Amazon is a wonderful company and they certainly have revolutioned the e-commerce world and we're not sure what Amazon is going to do one way or another.","But the FedEx system that consists of thousands of facilities and the ability to pick up transport and deliver it in one to two business days between any two addresses in the United States has been decades in the making and we think that we have a not great risk of being disrupted to use the term and we obviously as Raj and Dave Bronczek and others are putting a lot of effort into making sure that there is no opportunity for somebody to disrupt us on a substantial scale.","So, I think again people focus on the e-commerce because everybody looks at this from their mobile phone forward where the real story is everything behind the mobile phone and that's what FedEx has in enormous quantities; airplanes, trucks, facility, team members. So hopefully that answers your question.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Now we'll take live questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks, afternoon. So just wanted to ask you just going back to the full-year guidance, so you're keeping the range, does that suggest that you think the midpoint is possible or would you think we should be better off at the lower end of the range?","And then just separately, do you have a thought on ground margins for next year? Do you think we'll see year-over-year margin improvement at Ground in fiscal '18?","Fred Smith","I'm sorry. We didn't understand that question. Come on, goodness gracious. We've answered this question about as clearly as we can. We're not going to give you any more specificity on the range. If we wanted to do that, we would have been specific in the target and I think we've answered the question on Ground.","We're very confident in Ground's earnings here, Alan?","Alan Graf","I don't know where to begin. The range is the range because we have a lot of moving parts and this is a big complicated company, but what we do is very hard to do I might add and I am so proud of our team that does this every day that goes back to the question that Fred just answered before.","It is very hard to do. It's very capital intensive. There are so many things that go on around the world. I quit giving quarterly ranges because I can never hit him. So, I think we'll just let it stand for where we are and we'll talk about Ground's margins in FY'18 in June.","Fred Smith","And Scott, let me give you one example here of just what we're talking about. I happened to be in New York last Monday given a talk for Fortune Magazine. A snowstorm hit, which I unfortunate was out in. I don't know what that snowstorm cost FedEx with the size and scope of our operations, but it certainly cost us a significant amount of money at Ground, Freight and Express.","So, whatever it is, that's why we have a range because stuff happens. Now if volumes are a bit stronger than we think in the fourth quarter, they won't make any difference. We'll be at the top end of the range. If volumes aren't quite as strong then that snowstorm may push us within the range to some other place.","So, it's very difficult for us to be any more specific and I think as I mentioned a moment ago, for a company of this size, $60 million for the CFO a year ago June, to tell you that we were going to have a range and we now reconfirm 10 months later even I am in all of that.","I think it's just remarkable with our financial planning folks and the great systems that Alan and Bob Henning and the operating companies to be up together, this is really something to watch that we're able to tell you with the degree of specificity that we do tell you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for fitting me in here. So, I know the fulfillment business is pretty new here, but I was hoping you could just take a step back maybe give us the pitch that you use when you go in and try to convince a customer to use your fulfillment service over something like Amazon's and early on, what do you think is resonating there?","Henry Maier","Yes, this is Henry Maier. I am sorry. I didn't catch your name.","Bascome Majors","It's Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Henry Maier","Okay. How are you doing?","Bascome Majors","All right.","Henry Maier","So, let me give you a couple updates there. First of all the company that was formally known as GENCO was rebranded to FedEx supply chain in the quarter and we launched FedEx Fulfilment which I think you need to look at as an all-in-one logistics solution for e-commerce companies, but primarily targeted at small and medium-sized e-commerce companies, some of which are startups.","Let me just put little bit of color around this. You really need to have somewhere between 50 and 2,000 shipments a day to fit into this and the reason why that range is necessary is because in order for this to work, you got to have the ability to keep your inventory in at least one of potentially two of these warehouses that are run by FedEx supply chain.","The reason why that's important is, is that we've cited those fulfillment centers in such a way as we can reach 94% of the population out of two of the -- out of two of them in two days or less and I will let you this should be obvious to you why that's a big deal.","The pitch is simply this, FedEx Fulfilment is a one-stop shop for warehousing, fulfillment order management, inventory and transportation management, and reverse logistics, which allows these small to medium sized customers to really focus on their business, which is selling things online.","It is not a marketplace. However, since these folks may be selling on their own market, on their own website, it gives them the ability for us to have -- for them to have visibility to their inventory as they could potentially sell across some of the 90 or so marketplaces that exist out there.","Its highly customizable in the sense that you can -- we will actually ship your product in your own branded carton, which is really important because there are now companies that don't allow you to sell or sorry, to fulfill for certain fulfillment operations if it's going to show up in that company's branded box.","They also do gift wrapping as part of this. So, something that's really important for some of these smaller facilities. It's also integrated with FedEx cross-border, which gives them the ability to sell internationally, which is a big deal for these small customers because generally the first thing they find out is once they get online and get the product on one of these marketplaces, orders come in from parts of the world they didn't expect.","I will tell you that we're really grateful for the customer interest we've had in this today because it's far surpassed any of our expectations. Hope that answers your question.","Fred Smith","Again, let me stress what Henry just said here to make sure the plane is there. This lets the merchant sell on any marketplace. So, if they want to sell on Amazon, that's great. If they want to sell on Walmart, it is very aggressive trying to attract marketplace customers that they want to sell on eBay if they want to sell on Ali Baba, JD.com, as Henry said, there are 90 of these marketplaces.","Now obviously, Amazon in this country is the biggest. So that is the advantage that they get all of the centralized support that Henry gave to you, but they can sell in any or all of the channels that they find most useful for their product and merchandise.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Maybe Dave, a question for you on the integration plan with the TNT lease shop. Are you guys planning to keep that as part of the network and as you guys work to integrate that? Can you talk a little bit about how your international capacity or transatlantic, transpacific capacity is going to be growing over the next couple years?","Dave Bronczek","Thanks for the question. Yes, Li\u00e8ge Belgium I was just there two months ago with my colleague Rob Carter and I have to tell you they've done a great job there. We're putting in new technology into the automation, into the hub there. We're starting, you probably saw the press release already come out.","We have a 777 that starts in April that comes out of Li\u00e8ge, comes to Memphis, goes to Seattle, goes to Asia, it's going to be fantastic. In every way, we actually improve our service and our cutoffs and deliveries. So, the answer to your question specifically is yes. I'm proud of the management team in Li\u00e8ge. They\u2019ve done a great job of transitioning from an old facility to a new one.","It's critical to our success there. It goes a long side of our Cologne hub and our CDG hub. So, it will operate all three hubs there. It's very effective for us to have all three hub operations in Europe.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. The question is on the operating income target at Express. Just wondering if you can provide any cadence of that improvement over the next three years and some color on what if any revenue synergies are included in that number?","It just seems like there's an enormous opportunity to increase penetration with European multinational corporations given the enhanced presence in Europe. So if you could just talk about that or talk to that and what's assumed related to that in the new Express profit plan? Thank you.","Fred Smith","Well we agreed, there is a lot of opportunity and we're not going to give you the cadence of it at this point in time because that would be in tantamount to giving your forecast, which Alan does in June. Dave Bronczek?","Dave Bronczek","Yes, let me add to what Fred said, I can tell you that you're right and I said it in my comments, the sales organization in Europe is highly motivated. They're extremely excited to be part of the FedEx global sales organization and the marketing team.","So, I think that you're going to see us become a little bit more aggressive as I mentioned before in filling up our 777s coming out of Li\u00e8ge and the operations in Europe. I think there's going to be more synergies between the volumes, between TNT of the past and FedEx in Europe, including helping our yields and including helping our product profitability, but also fundamentally growing our volume and growing our revenue. No question about it.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation third quarter earnings release conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much. Bye.","Operator","And once again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"8947":["FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) Q2 2017 Earnings Conference Call December 20, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Mickey Foster - Vice President, Investor Relations","Fred Smith - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Alan Graf - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Mike Glenn - President and Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Services","Chris Richards - Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary","Rob Carter - Executive Vice President, FedEx Information Services and Chief Investment Officer","David Bronczek - President and Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","Henry Maier - President and Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Mike Ducker - President and Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Freight","Analysts","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Jack Atkins - Stephens Investment","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Ben Hartford - Robert W.

Welcome to our discussion of results for FedEx\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2017 and happy holidays to everyone. Let me note on the front end, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 earnings forecast, and I remember that the earnings forecast is before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and TNT\u2019s outlook restructuring program cost and intangible asset amortization. But given those considerations, the range we put out there was $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share. And of course, Alan has more detail on that later.","This will be a record peak for FedEx, and to-date, with the exception of several local weather issues, our service levels have been outstanding. We appreciate the efforts of hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members who work very hard to make peak operations successful and to try to keep our Purple Promise daily, which states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding. Our traffic mix this year is a bit different by design as part of our longer term commitment to continue to grow earnings, margins, cash flows and returns. Christmas falling on a Sunday has created anomalies and shipping patterns, and this week, we will see disproportionately higher demand versus other holiday seasonal patterns in the past.","FedEx\u2019s integration of TNT and FedEx Ground\u2019s continued integration of GENCO are well along and going very well with high morale and excellent execution. FedEx Express\u2019 integration expenses will peak next year in FY \u201818 and Express operating margins should widen in fiscal years \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820. As previously noted, there are significant operational synergies in the TNT transaction, particularly in Europe. FedEx Express peak operations this year will result in excellent year-over-year profit and margin improvements foreshadowing the longer term outlook I just mentioned. Of course, our earnings outlook assumes continued modest global economic growth.","Now, FedEx Ground results will be affected this peak, followed with improving margins later this fiscal year versus the current quarter. This is due to the recent opening of 4 major hubs and 19 automated stations year-over-year. It\u2019s one of the most remarkable things I have seen since I have been in the business to tell you the truth. And two, an effort to grow ground traffic in a more profitable manner than last year\u2019s trend at peak, which saw challenging growth of 20%. While we are committed to being a leader in the e-commerce market, it\u2019s important to recognize that non-e-commerce deliveries to residences and business-to-business traffic represents the vast majority of FedEx Corporation\u2019s estimated $60 billion in FY \u201817 revenues. Regarding business-to-business traffic, we are making major systems investments at FedEx Freight, which will result in significant margin improvement by year end FY 2020. We believe this initiative will change the LTL landscape in a major way.","Let me emphasize, FedEx is much more than a last-mile carrier. FedEx is a global transport and logistics company that can connect almost every person and business in the world in 1 to 2 business days door-to-door and we provide unique value-added services across many industries. It\u2019s also important to reiterate that we do not manage our operating companies to maximize margins in each segment all the time, much less each quarter. Over 92% of our U.S. revenue comes from customers using both Express and Ground and 76% of that U.S. revenue is generated by customers that use Express, Ground and Freight. We, therefore, maybe investing in one segment of the portfolio at any given time to produce improved results for the corporation as a whole in the future.","Now, before I ask Mike Glenn to comment on the economic environment and traffic trends, let me again thank him for his 35 years of dedicated service to FedEx. At the end of the call, I will have a few concluding comments about Mike\u2019s contribution before his retirement at the end of this month. Alan Graf will follow Mike with more detailed financial analysis. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thanks, Fred. I will open with our economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends as we come to the close of another record holiday shopping season. We see moderate growth in the global economy. After growing just 1.6% in calendar \u201816, we expect U.S. GDP growth of 2.2% in calendar \u201817 anchored by continued robust consumer spending and strong business investment. Industrial production should rebound after contracting 0.9% in calendar \u201816 to a forecasted 1.6% growth next year. For the global economy, we forecast growth of 2.2% for calendar \u201816 and 2.6% for calendar \u201817.","Now I will review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 2% year-over-year during the second quarter. Yield per package increased 3% as a result of improved rate and discount. Fuel, for the first time in a long time, did not have a material impact on yield per package and revenue during the quarter. Domestic Express package volume declined 1% year-over-year during the quarter. FedEx international export package revenue increased 2% year-over-year in Q2. FedEx international priority volume increased 2%, while international economy volume also grew 2%. International export yield increased 1%, primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes; higher weight per package and region mix, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates. Again, fuel did not have a material impact on yields.","Ground transportation revenue increased 9% year-over-year, while average daily volume increased 5% year-over-year. Ground yield per package increased 4% year-over-year, benefiting from yield improvement in both Ground and SmartPost. Fuel did not have a material impact on increases in revenue or yield per package. FedEx Freight segment revenue increased 3% year-over-year in Q2. If you exclude the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, Freight revenue increased 3.6%. Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. Revenue per LTL shipment in Q2 was flat year-over-year and was impacted by a slightly lower diesel fuel prices and lower weight per LTL shipment. Excluding fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per LTL shipment was up slightly.","We are closing out what has been another busy peak season for FedEx, largely driven by the continued rapid growth of e-commerce. Trends continued to evolve, as Fred noted, and we are proud of the year long preparation and collaboration with customers that has allowed us to deliver outstanding service during this period of intense increase in demand. As e-commerce grows, so does the challenge of peak, with multiple days of volume levels approaching or surpassing double our average daily volume. It should be noted that this surge in demand is driven primarily by a relatively small number of customers. Less than 50 large retail and e-tail customers responsible for the majority of peak demand, so it\u2019s extremely important that we understand their forecast well in advance to allow us to plan resources properly.","While a few customers this year have experienced demand below their forecast, the majority of our large retail and e-tail customers are meeting expectations. Again, we are proud of the outstanding service that we have been able to provide. The secret of course, is our people. We continue to work hard to deliver for our customers throughout the holiday season and beyond. The rapid rise in e-commerce continues to drive the need for alternative delivery options. FedEx understands that the ways people live, work and connect are ever changing. We have long recognized that information about the packages is as important as the package itself and our long-term investments and focus on IT and mobile technologies has allowed us to offer customers truly innovative and useful alternative delivery options. This of course includes FedEx Delivery Manager, which gives customers access with a phone or tablet to options such as appointment delivery and the ability to reroute packages to one of our FedEx offices or locations \u2013 FedEx office locations or third-party locations for secure pickup.","We continue to have strong growth in demand for Pack Plus, which features dedicated packing professionals and supplies inside FedEx office locations. The professionals at FedEx office work with customers, large and small, to provide standard and customized packaging options for even large bulk and fragile items. None of this would be possible without the dedication of our more than 400,000 team members that work right now around the world to help the holidays arrive. Our service levels have been outstanding, with on-time deliveries at record levels even on some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx and it\u2019s all because of our people. I want to share a special acknowledgment and commend them for their hard work and outstanding effort this peak season. Alan?","Alan Graf","Good afternoon, everyone. I have a couple of introductory comments and will then move to my financial review and outlook. First to Mike Glenn, Mike in our 35 years of working together, we have done literally scores of earnings calls. As this is your last one, I want to thank you for everything you have done to help make this company great. You are a consummate professional and the best marketing sales and communications executive anywhere. You have been a fantastic business partner. I look forward to many future years of friendship with you [ph].","Okay. The FedEx Corporation\u2019s second quarter FY \u201817 results, today we announced second quarter FY \u201817 adjusted earnings per share climbed 8.5% to $2.80. Adjusted operating income increased through the inclusion of TNT Express and improved results at FedEx Express, as it continues to grow base yields and control costs. This performance was partially offset by lower operating income at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Our effective tax rate was 35.1% for the second quarter and 36.3% for the first half of 2017 compared with 34.5% in the second quarter and 35.3% in the first half of 2016. The first half tax rate in 2017 has been negatively impacted by local country losses in some entities within TNT Express for which no tax benefit could be recognized due to the uncertainty as to the utilization of these losses. This year-to-date negative impact was partially offset from the benefit of early adopting the accounting standards update for share based payments in the second quarter. Longer term, as the synergies from the TNT Express acquisition result in greater international profits, we expect our effective tax rate to be lower than the rate in recent years. The tax rates in 2016 were favorably impacted by the resolution of a state tax matter. There was also a gain from the sale of an investment in other income that added $0.08 per diluted share.","Looking at Express, revenues increased 2% to $6.7 billion, as base yields improved and package volume grew. Adjusted operating profit increased by $32 million or 5%. Adjusted operating income and margin improved as higher base yields drove revenue growth. Base yield growth was driven by U.S. domestic and international export package. Revenue growth due to volume increases was driven by international priority package and Freight. Expense growth was driven by merit pay increases, higher insurance costs and increased depreciation due to aircraft introductions. Fuel price and exchange rate changes had little net impact for the quarter. Adjusted operating margin increased to 9.7%.","At TNT, revenues were $1.9 billion, with an adjusted operating profit of $90 million. Adjusted operating margin was 4.7%. The TNT Express integration continues to proceed as planned. We estimate approximately $250 million in expenses during FY \u201817 as a result of the TNT Express integration and outlook restructuring programs. We continued to expect the aggregate integration program expense over the 4 years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. The TNT Express intangible asset amortization declined to $10 million in Q2, as we continued to update our purchase price allocation. We now expect the intangible asset amortization to be $38 million in the second half of FY \u201817 and $75 million for the full year. We still expect our FY \u201817 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million, with total TNT CapEx at about $500 million. We expect annual pre-tax synergies, following the completion of the integration program in fiscal 2020, to be $750 million. We will have a full update on the TNT integration and outlook on the March call and I am not going to say much more about that today.","At FedEx Freight, higher average daily LTL shipments helped FedEx Freight increase revenues 3%. Freight\u2019s competitive advantage of having the fastest published transit times in the LTL industry is driving higher growth in its priority service. The impact of lower weight per shipment and higher information technology expenses drove operating income lower. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working to manage costs and increase yields. FedEx Ground, volume growth in residential services and commercial business, along with yield growth helped push revenues up 9%. Operating income fell 12% and operating margin declined to 10.5% due to increased rent, depreciation and staffing related to network expansion as well as higher purchased transportation rates.","E-commerce continues to drive revenue growth, which provides great opportunities as well as difficult challenges, after challenges from higher than expected volumes in certain parts of the country during last peak, Ground invested in increased capacity and technology. This year, we completed 185 facility projects, including four major distribution hubs, 19 fully automated stations and 69 relocations. This equates to more than 10 million square feet of additional sortation space in the network. And all that comes at a cost above and beyond CapEx investment, including rent, building insurance and property tax. We also incurred higher costs from significant additional staffing as we hired and trained people, sometimes months in advance of the facility opening. And of course, purchased transportation increased as we pay contracted service providers to pickup, deliver and transport a growing number of packages. While these buildings and their state-of-the-art technology are a significant investment, they ensure that we have the capacity, flexibility and efficiency needed to handle e-commerce and commercial growth. Although our network projects are impacting Ground\u2019s near-term profitability, the investments will enhance long-term returns and cash flow. We are also working to better balance capacity and volume through improved revenue quality and margins. These actions contributed to the second quarter volume results and are also expected to mute third quarter volume growth.","FedEx Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost network integration and delivery optimization initiatives continue. They will increase facility productivity and delivery density over time. We are also investing in technology to improve safety and mitigate rising insurance costs. We are committed to increasing margins at Ground over the longer term.","Turning to our corporate outlook, based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed, we reaffirm expected earnings before year-end mark-to-market pension adjustments and excluding TNT Express integration and outlook restructuring costs and intangible asset amortization of $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY \u201817. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at $5.6 billion in FY \u201817, including TNT. This month, we made a $178 million contribution that was required to our pension fund and next month, we plan to make a $1 billion debt funded voluntary contribution to our tax-qualified U.S. domestic pension plans.","Now, we look forward to answering your strategic questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. FedEx would like to invite questions via e-mail. To e-mail your question, please use the ir@fedex.com e-mail address and provide your full name and contact information. [Operator Instructions] First, we will hear from Tom Wadewitz, UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good afternoon. Let\u2019s see, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions or a couple of broader questions. I guess, you can answer which you want. On Ground, I thought there was some comment, I don\u2019t know Alan or Fred about you were maybe holding volumes back a little bit or constraining them to enhance profitability. I just wonder if you could elaborate on that and if I heard that right? And then just whether the very large investments in network, if that\u2019s \u2013 you recover profitability in Ground pretty quickly over the next few quarters or does it kind of take longer, look further out for the Ground margin to recover a bit from what we saw in the quarter? Thank you.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me make a comment about Ground expansion and then ask Mike to put more color on my remarks about Ground growth and our effort to manage our traffic a bit better than that was the case in the past and then Henry can jump in on margins. First, as it applies to the network expansion, I mentioned this in my remarks, but these facilities that FedEx Ground had put in place are enormous operations. Some of these things, correct me if I am wrong, Henry, here \u2013 like 250 acres plus and the amount of sortation equipment inside are measured in miles, not in feet and they are able to sort tens and tens of thousands of packages. So as the scale of this network has increased, the reality is we have to put the employees and the training in there. You can\u2019t just sort of open them up when the traffic is required. And the only reason I bring this up is that I am consistently surprised, maybe more so by the popular media, with just the misunderstanding of the gigantic scale of the FedEx and UPS operations and of course, the Postal Service as well, but the Postal Service is much more last mile rather than upstream. So I just want to put that in perspective. And given the level of capital that we put into the Ground business, it is very important for us that we get a good return on it. Now, we don\u2019t have to get an immediate return. As I have said over and over again, and again today, we don\u2019t manage FedEx Corporation as a sum of the parts. We manage it as a broad market segment. And a few years ago, when Ground had less residential traffic, I mean, it was basically supporting increased growth in the corporation\u2019s earnings when we put a lot of effort into reengineering the Express system. So with that in mind, let me ask Mike then to give some color to our traffic management efforts.","Mike Glenn","Hi, Tom. You have obviously followed us a very long time and I think you understand we have demonstrated industry leading growth rates at Ground on a consistent basis. But as I have said many times on this call, our objective is to strike the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize operating margins at each operating company. In that regard, we are constantly looking at opportunities to do that. And over the last several months or so, we have made some decisions to discontinue relationships with a few customers where we couldn\u2019t candidly agree on pricing and capacity requirements for this peak season. And that\u2019s something we do on a regular basis, but we made that decision earlier this year. And as a result of that, we have been managing volumes and we will continue to do that. But clearly, it\u2019s had some effect on this peak season, but that was intentional on our part and we will continue to do that going forward.","Henry Maier","This is Henry Maier. Let me just add, as Alan noted in his remarks, the integration of FedEx Ground, Home Delivery and SmartPost yields a number of benefits that positively impacts Ground margins. To name a few, we get improved delivery density and revenue per stop. We get lower cost through improved pickup and delivery geographies. We get a lower cost structure due to fewer nodes on the network. We reduced our postage expense. And we moved to a single contracted service provider model. All of these things will improve our operating margins over the longer term.","Fred Smith","Alan wanted to add a bit to this reply as well.","Alan Graf","Tom thanks for the question. Take it back up to the 50,000 foot level, from a financial standpoint, earnings, EPS standpoint, this year is going just as I thought it was going to go and my team thought it was going to go. We were well aware that this big increase in capacity and the hiring that we had to do in advance of the peak was going to hurt the second quarter at Ground. We also knew that Express was going to outperform expectations. And if you take a look at Ground\u2019s second quarter results starting in fiscal \u201813 and look through this fiscal \u201817, you will see how well they have delivered on that promise. So, we haven\u2019t changed the year. We still expect to hit the year and this wasn\u2019t very surprising to us at all. We knew this was coming. It\u2019s a little shocking to see a 250 basis point drop year-over-year in the margin. And as I said, it will probably be restrained a bit in the next quarter. But believe me, we have really good plans to get the returns, as Fred mentioned, on this.","Operator","Next up from Barclays, we will hear from Brandon Oglenski.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the career, Mike. So Henry or Alan, I guess I want to follow-up on that. Your revenue was up 9% at Ground. Your op income was down 12%, so a delta arguably wider than 20%. And if I look at your major hubs, I think at the end of last year, it was like 33%. So if you add 4% to the mix and we just think about costs, maybe 10% to 15% additional costs from your new hubs, assuming no revenue even comes through them. So the longer term issue here is I think investors are concerned that as you take more B2C residential deliveries, obviously, there is less density there, so is that where the margin degradation really is occurring or is there some competitive pressure from the post office, can you guys talk more, because this just feels a little bit more than capacity additions, but maybe we have that all wrong?","Henry Maier","Brandon, it was 185 real estate projects. In the history of the company, we have never opened up four hubs in a year, so it is a big deal. If you want to look at the expense line, the biggest drivers were rent, depreciation, building insurance and property tax, which were all driven by the expansion. In addition, in the second quarter, not only did we have to staff those facilities and as Fred noted, these are sizable operations. Some of them take, not hundreds, but up to almost 1,000 people to staff and train. And in addition to that, at the same period of time that these facilities are coming online, we are staffing up for peak. So those are the two major expense drivers. Obviously, when volume goes up, revenue goes up. We must pay higher purchase transportation expenses because we pay contractors more. There is higher postage and higher line haul settlement in moving that volume. So those are the drivers here.","Mike Glenn","Brandon, let me just go back real quick to my comments, where I say we are working to better balance capacity and volume to improve revenue quality and margins. We have opportunity there. We have that opportunity I think, to be better priced for the very, very precious capacity that we offer, not just during peak but all season long and all year long. So we have opportunity on that side as well.","Fred Smith","Yes. Let me just add one other thing here because I think you hit the nail on the head and it relates back to Mike Glenn\u2019s comments. As I mentioned in my remarks, what keeps the lights on here, the vast majority of our revenue in FedEx Corporation is business to business. And a lot of it is business to consumer, but it\u2019s not e-commerce. It may be all kinds of things. We look at these accounts every day, you would be surprised. So e-commerce is basically residential deliveries. And you have to keep in balance the business to business and the business to consumer e-commerce or you can put extreme pressure on our Ground business. And so that is exactly what we were doing in making the decisions on these accounts that Mike mentioned. So no question, we are trying to manage that in an appropriate manner because just business to residential business \u2013 I mean, the postal service is the biggest, at all it makes no money out of it. That should tell you something right there and they are making millions of stops a day. So you can\u2019t be in our side of the business and not manage this. So that\u2019s a very good point that you bring up.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Now, we are going to do two internet questions.","Fred Smith","Okay, here are two internet questions. Well, this is from Ken Hoexter. Where can you continue to increase technology investments to decrease the need for peak seasonal hiring? We are going to ask Rob Carter to mention this, but let me just emphasize one more time. The FedEx Ground system is the most automated such system that you could possibly imagine. The reason for that is FedEx Ground was built in the age of computerization, so if you go to these great big facilities, it may require a lot of people to offload and load trucks, but that requires no people to sort things. Now the FedEx Express system is a bit different because you have to have the flexibility to move things from one ramp to another and on down the line. But these things are marvels of automation and over time, we will get even more out of this automation. And in that regard, I will ask Rob Carter to comment on it.","Rob Carter","Well, that\u2019s right Fred. I mean in fact we have 105 fully automated facilities in the Ground network now, not just the hubs that we are talking about, but the audit stations that exist that drive incredible automation in that network. And that automation contributes not only during peak, for Ken\u2019s question, but all year long. My button is pushed, just no light on it there for the microphone, sorry about that. But virtually, all of our technology investments and operations contribute to increased efficiency and productivity throughout the operation and they are incredibly valuable to us. Route optimization for example, is driving incredible efficiencies as we are out on the road. We are increasing route density and stop density all across the network in Freight, Ground and Express with the route technology. But Mike also mentioned in his comments the customer facing technologies, which are improving these efficiencies as well. Things like delivery manager that are giving customers more choices that increase security and convenience. But at the same time with those choices, customers are then driving into some of our convenience network. Increased stop density and route density that improves our operational efficiency as well. So, all down the line, everything from analytics about better ways to load trailers to sensors that are automating and optimizing scan technology are driving really incredible efficiencies in the network. And all this is already in market today, but is being perfected year by year by year to increase and improve efficiency in the network. So the answer is yes Ken, but the reality is its improving efficiencies all year round, not just in peak.","Fred Smith","So by the way, for those of you who don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t give the paid commercial announcement. Ken is with Merrill Lynch, so I should have said that. Next question, are FedEx Ground ISPs seeing any increased competition or wage pressure in hiring delivery drivers, David Vernon, Bernstein. Henry?","Henry Maier","Hey David, this is Henry Maier. Not that we are aware of, but I would add here that we are increasingly challenged in seven to nine markets to find package handlers. Those markets tend to be markets where many of our customers are operating fulfillment centers and we tend to try to source those handler jobs from the same pool of labor. And as a result of that, we are seeing, particularly this time a year, the need to increase hourly pay rates, offer surge pay and peak bonus pay in an effort to source an adequate number of people to staff these facilities.","Fred Smith","We will go take questions from the call.","Operator","And back to the phone, we will hear from Scott Group, Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon guys. So wanted to ask about Express, so we saw that the U.S. Express volumes turned negative and just curious if you have any insight on kind of the deceleration of volume there. And then Alan, on Express margins, we typically see good margin improvement sequentially from the first quarter to second quarter and didn\u2019t see that this year and any thoughts on what\u2019s driving kind of the margin sequential \u2013 the lack of sequential margin improvement at Express this quarter?","David Bronczek","Thanks, Scott. Let me answer the question by telling you that first of all, we are very proud of the quarter we just finished. It\u2019s our record highest quarter we ever had. $654 million of FedEx Express segment is the highest we have ever had, the second highest operating profit margin we have ever had in the history of our company at 9.7%. Sequentially oddly enough, you asked the question. I actually knew the answer. Its 4 years in a row that we have actually had in the second quarter increasing profits and increasing margins. And actually since the profit improvement plan went in, in FY \u201813, we are up 140%, so how about those numbers. On the issue of the volume in United States domestic, we had some issues in the volume off the West \u2013 the East Coast, primarily due to Hurricane Matthew. We had a typhoon too, that actually hit the West Coast. So we had a little bit of an issue on both sides of the coast for us. But in the main, we are about where we thought we were \u2013 would be. The overall yield increased so that our revenue for domestic packages went up 2%. And across the world, it\u2019s actually gone up 2%. So for us, we are in the sweet spot. Our costs are right where we want them to be and our profits are record high.","Alan Graf","This is Alan, as to Q2 over Q1, nothing to worry about there. It\u2019s mostly just a bucketful, a little timing issue. So I think just keep watching how we do on the year-over-year quarters and how we finish out the year, and I think you will be fairly pleased.","Fred Smith","There was also, at the Express segment, a single customer who moved some traffic out of the quarter in the last part of the quarter that hit into peak. So absent that, it would have been an up quarter, so that\u2019s a little bit of an item that you see in those numbers.","Operator","From Citi, we\u2019ll hear from Chris Wetherbee.","Chris Wetherbee","Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about pricing. So it sounds like there is a couple of accounts that you have walked away from to some extent, but wanted to get a sense of sort of the momentum around pricing and kind of how you think about sort of pricing out what you have stated. And I agree it\u2019s a very valuable sort of capacity and network as you go through these peak seasons. Just wanted to kind of get a sense of that sort of balance as you are incurring these costs, particularly on the Ground side, how you can offset that and what you think maybe the potential is over time of sort of pricing this business?","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. Let me first say that I think the pricing environment is pretty stable at this point. I think our yield improvements that we have noted here today will continue to be industry leading type year-over-year improvements. We will wait to see if that\u2019s the case. But if you look at our pricing management, our yield management activities over the last several years, you can certainly say that\u2019s the case. Having said that, I have also said for a long time that the most important thing that we can do regarding peak is to make sure we price right year round. If we get the pricing right year round, we will be fine at peak. We just have to manage the capacity. But beyond that, we are not opposed to looking at alternatives for the valuable peak capacity that we have and we will continue to explore options in that regard as the market continues to grow at a substantial rate. So we are pretty pleased with how we have taken on these revenue management activities to date. I think we have demonstrated time and time again, we are not afraid to walk away from a relationship. If it\u2019s not in our best interest to do so, we will continue to do that. And we will be open-minded about other opportunities to maximize the value of the network we have.","Fred Smith","So let me mention one other thing here that seems to be not clear to a lot of people. These huge facilities that we are opening up at FedEx Ground are being opened with the firm belief that our FedEx Ground traffic is going to grow, whether it\u2019s B2B or whether it\u2019s B2C. And for all of the reasons that Rob Carter mentioned to you and Henry commented upon, these facilities, when they open up, aren\u2019t nearly at their max capacity. So as more volume goes through these sorting facilities, the marginal cost of sorting, because it\u2019s all automated is shockingly low. So there is huge amount of leverage into these network investments or as Alan and I both have said, we wouldn\u2019t be making them. Now you get to the point on the yield side of the house, because you start talking about pickup and delivery and line-haul expenses versus the network infrastructure. There is where it\u2019s important to have the appropriate mix of traffic, so that you keep your line-haul and your PUD cost at a reasonable relationship, but the bow wave of putting these fixed facilities out will be accretive to margins as more volume goes through there, regardless of whether it\u2019s B2B or B2C and particularly, as Henry puts one network together with these initiatives that he has described to you and which culminates I think in FY \u201819 or \u201820? So, that\u2019s why we say with some confidence, these results will pop back up. You can\u2019t just put these facilities out and operate them at full capacity day 1. They are put out there in advance of volume that we think will be growing over many years and will be accretive to volume \u2013 accretive to profit, sorry.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Let\u2019s go back to two more Internet questions.","Fred Smith","Okay, two more Internet questions. Could you please provide us with an update on the integration of SmartPost into Ground? Well, that\u2019s timely. Have you begun to incorporate dynamic capabilities? And if not, when do you expect this to ramp up? Amit Mehrotra, Deutsche Bank. Henry?","Henry Maier","Yes, thanks for the question. Listen, there is three distinct phases of the integration of SmartPost into Ground and I apologize because we probably haven\u2019t been as clear on this as we need to be. The first was dissolving the corporate entity and moving SmartPost employees and management into Ground. That happened back in September of last year, September 15. What I would call Phase 2 was beginning of the diversion of outbound SmartPost volume from their facilities into ground hubs, which helped improve load factor, drove down line-haul costs and improved service. There are two parts to what we call delivery optimization or internally here, we call it the Terminator. The first part of that came in January of 2016, which was really the ability to manually divert volume that we knew had a high likelihood of matching the Ground package or better yet, just needed to be in the Ground network. The second phase or the second part of this comes in July of \u201817, next summer, when we will get the ability to virtually divert packages, where the system will see matches and automatically divert them out of SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We won\u2019t fully realize the benefits of that capability until fiscal \u201819 and beyond.","Fred Smith","So I have several questions here on the election and what we think that might mean for FedEx. In fact, there are two or three of them. I am going to hold that for \u2013 I will address it a little bit later. But let me get some more, for lack of a better word, technocratic questions out of the way here. There is one about how will we handle foreign exchange hedging following the acquisition of TNT. Will their program be carried over and implemented? And that\u2019s from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan. Alan?","Alan Graf","Thanks for the question, Brian. What we found at TNT is a excellent program, very well thought out, well controlled and well executed. We are getting our hands around what our total corporate strategy is going to be for hedging. We will be hedging. We will probably be using a lot of instruments, but we will only be hedging known exposures that we believe are real. And at the end of the day, with where the dollar has been going, you can\u2019t hedge it all away. You\u2019ve got to continue to use pricing. I don\u2019t know where you think the euro is going to end up, but I know where I think it\u2019s going to end up. No amount of hedging is going to protect us from that and that profitability translation, so it\u2019s a mixture of hedging and pricing.","Mickey Foster","And now we will have questions from the call.","Operator","And our next phone question will come from Jack Atkins, Stephens Investment.","Jack Atkins","Great. Thanks for the time. Could you comment or just expand on your comments around the Freight segment and your expectation for improved margins there in 2020 sort of what do you think is going to be driving that? And then you mentioned how you think this will impact the overall industry. I would just be curious to get your expanded comments on that. And then I guess more broadly, when we think about the three different segments, everything seems to be pointing to 2020 being a very big year in terms of all these projects coming together. Is there any sort of thought of maybe putting together some long-term guidance for the consolidated corporation given that timeframe?","Mike Ducker","Yes, thanks for the question. This is Mike Ducker. Just a word or two about the FedEx Freight margin is certainly our goal to deliver sustainable double-digit margins for the Freight entity. We have had good progress on productivity, our yield and in terms of contractual increases, is improving. And you heard of the investments that Fred said at the outset in terms of new technology, those are both in safety systems installed in our company and also some legacy systems, which we expect to greatly improve overall efficiency and productivity. So those were some of the components for the improvements that we expect at FedEx Freight in the future. Yes, absolutely, it\u2019s customer automation. That also connects all the back end systems together. So the answer to are we going to give you any long-term guidance is no. We will tell you that it\u2019s not a switch, where all of a sudden, boom in 2020, we have this nirvana. We will be improving every year, all the way up and through \u201820 and beyond.","Fred Smith","I tried to give you that forecast and General Counsel came over and grabbed my tie and started pulling it.","Operator","We will go to our next phone question. It\u2019s from Scott Schneeberger, Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. There is a first quarter of international priority volume growth about 2 years and also nice international export yield, so curious just if you can elaborate a little bit on what drove it, how sustainable is it and Fred, maybe I would pull you into the political discussion, just thoughts on trade influence there? Thanks.","David Bronczek","Yes, you are right. We are very pleased with that on the international front and I think it\u2019s our expanded service capabilities and offerings. Quite frankly, we have a different array of offerings now. We have a deferred service offering in the marketplace and that\u2019s growing very nicely at 4%. Overall, international priority now has more space and capacity in our existing fleet and that\u2019s now growing, too. Our sales team is very comfortable selling both. So I would say across the world and especially, in Asia and the United States back to Asia, we are doing very nicely. In fact this quarter, we are doing \u2013 starting in December, as Fred mentioned in his comments and Mike Glenn, we are off to a very good start. So yes, we are pleased, we continue to see it going that way and those are some of the reasons why.","Mickey Foster","Okay. Two more internet questions.","Fred Smith","Well, there are a couple of questions on tax and I am going to have Alan answer this. I would just say this on the political side of the house. There is a lot of confusion and concern over what has been proposed in the House bill, as most of you know particularly this border adjustment. Having said that, I do think that there will be tax reform, which will be beneficial to us and I will ask Alan to put his thoughts on that.","Alan Graf","The question came from Helane Becker at Cowen. Thanks Helane. It involves discussing the potential impact of 100% expense in \u2013 expensing, significant earnings that could be \u2013 outside the U.S. could be repatriated and impact to our healthcare plan. So let me take that those in reverse order. We have an outstanding healthcare plan for our teammates, but it does not meet the definition of the Cadillac plan. So like everyone else, we will be watching these developments as they unfold, but we are very pleased with what we are delivering for our teammates. At May 31, we had about $1.6 billion of permanently reinvested offshore and have about $775 million in cash offshore. We currently plan to use that cash to fund Express TNT needs offshore and have no plans to repatriate that to the U.S. That also is a statement that says we are not going to be taxed on those earnings that we have left outside. If we are, we will probably bring some of those back to pay those taxes. The bigger issue for all of you to look at longer term for us is the features that are in the GOP blueprint in president-elect Trump\u2019s plans that we like a lot and those include materially lowering the tax rate, the effective territorial treatment of foreign earnings and current expensing of CapEx. We think that will positively impact our top line through stronger economic growth and of course the bottom line, potentially in a very big way, through the lower tax rate. Having said that, we are concerned about the border adjustability concept and are trying to figure out how it would affect us directly as well as our customers and trade and global growth in general. And right now, there is a huge debate going on that. So as always, the devil is going to be in the details and we will just have to report back to you later as this begins to unfold. But if you think about our tax rate this year in the 36% to 37% range, a 20% tax rate would be a mighty fine Christmas gift.","Fred Smith","Let me just add some detail on what Alan just said. Alan mentioned that we are not a Cadillac plan at the moment. The reason we are not a Cadillac plan is because we adjusted our plan when the Affordable Care Act \u2013 to move to more consumer driven healthcare with much better tools for our teammates to buy healthcare more expertly and at lower cost. We did things like put in clinics at our high employment locations and we also gave all of our employees HRAs in order for them to pay for some of their deductibles and so forth. So we avoided hitting the Cadillac tax because of the steps that we took. Now, if ACA is not modified in that respect, given healthcare inflation, there is a good chance we would hit the Cadillac tax in the out years, which would result in truly onerous taxes on the benefits above the Cadillac tax level of 40%. So one of the most important things that we would like to see in the reform of the Affordable Care Act is to do away with the Cadillac tax limit and that would give us the freedom to do some other things in our healthcare that we might not be able to do as long as we are on that trajectory towards a 40% excise tax. It really penalizes excellent healthcare plans like we have relative to other folks. So it\u2019s important to understand that context of our healthcare plan design, which was a reaction to the Affordable Care Act and act in the very significant cost that would be incurred in the excise tax on the Cadillac tax plan. I might say this parenthetically to that, that this past year, we paid \u2013 how much in ACA taxes was it Alan, $65 million. $65 million in extra taxes that would have gone into our healthcare plan, but went into the federal treasury in the form of ACA taxes. It was so much per covered life, I think or a plan participant, I forget what. But $65 million, I mean this thing has been a major, major issue to employers who have good healthcare plans like we have had and we have tried to keep great healthcare plans within the context of the ACA. Okay. One more, so there are about three or four questions here on macro and trade, in particular. There is one from David Vernon. There is another one from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank, David Ross of Stifel. So I am going to put this all together, if you don\u2019t mind. Obviously, we are very concerned about the trade issue, which is one of the reasons that I gave a speech on the night of December at the Competitiveness Institute, which was scheduled long before the election results were known because both the Democrats and the Republicans were running on anti-trade platform. So if you go to policy.fedex.com, you can read that speech. It is not a polemic and it\u2019s not a political speech. It is just a factual speech, which points out that one in five American\u2019s jobs are related to trade and we have a trade surplus and services in trade. We have a surplus, when you take the 20 countries that we have free trade agreements with. So the prospect of significantly reducing trade is in our opinion, significantly dangerous and the proper approach is to lean into trade and try to remove barriers, which by the way the Trans-Pacific Partnership did to our exports, not to stop people from selling products and services to us. So I hope that that will make a difference in the debate out there. I would point out, there is an excellent article in Barron\u2019s by \u2013 I forget the gentleman\u2019s first name, Epstein, which sound \u2013 very similar themes. And again, its fact based, it\u2019s not politically based. So we hope these things will be considered. And I think what Alan said to you about the border adjustable tax is spot on. This is just very destructive of trade. It\u2019s not the proper solution to the problem. I think they lowered the tax rate and went to territorial it would accomplish 95% of all of the benefits they are looking for and ignite a significant investment boom in the United States. It would solve the inversion problem. So they have got some very, very good people in this cabinet. And finally, I think the second largest economy in the world is China. In the speech I just mentioned, we were very direct on our own experiences with China and Japan in terms of their tendencies to engage in mercantilist practices. And we feel very strongly it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest to open up their markets. And many of the things that the Chinese administrators are trying to accomplish would be facilitated by opening up rather than keeping their markets closed. So we are worried about it, but we hope that all of these facts will be carefully considered before the Congress or the administration does anything, which might be injurious based on the facts of the matter.","Mickey Foster","You can also get a copy of that speech on the Investor Relations website. Let\u2019s now take some questions from the live call.","Operator","Our next phone question comes from Ben Hartford, Robert W. Baird.","Ben Hartford","Yes, thanks for the perspective there. Fred, I guess, just to quantify your outlook here for 2017, there is a lot of uncertainties as it relates to the 100-day plan and what will actually will come to bear in \u201817, but the markets and investors have become certainly optimistic about \u201817\u2019s growth post the election. But you guys took down your U.S. IP growth forecast by 10 basis points for 2017. And I am just wondering the thought process behind that reduction in the face of what appears to be some optimism from the broader equity market as it relates to reaccelerating growth in \u201817?","Fred Smith","Well, whatever was there was probably related to the increase in the dollar, but Mike put more detail on it.","Mike Glenn","The drags come from energy and inventory and those are the main issues. And though the dollar remained strong, it\u2019s also a headwind to manufactured exports and those were the primary issues. I mean, I would consider that a minor adjustment and especially if you look at the year-over-year change, it\u2019s a pretty significant turnaround.","Fred Smith","And the good news is we carry things both ways. So what you pickup on the sand pile, you ought to find also on the swing or whatever that old saying is.","Operator","Next up from Merrill Lynch is Ken Hoexter.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good afternoon. If we can just kind of return to the volume discussion a bit, you touched a little bit about walking away from Summit Ground, Express being down 0.5%, U.S. freight pounds were also down almost 0.5%. Are you \u2013 would you step back and slow some of the investments here or are you growing too fast relative to what you are seeing or is there something on an e-commerce? Is it slowing or is it just losing share? I just want to understand on a big maybe volume picture. And then just to \u2013 Alan, just to throw in, I want to just reiterate your target, does it include the $0.15 of gains from the quarter, the $0.08 and the $0.07, are they in the new \u2013 the reiterated target?","Mike Glenn","Well, let me take those if I could. In the Freight segment, I think we noted that the average weight per shipment was down. Our shipment \u2013 actual shipment growth is up. We continue...","Ken Hoexter","I was talking about U.S. Freight pounds in the Express side. I don\u2019t know if that was a post office lost or anything like that.","Mike Glenn","Well, the dollar that I just mentioned is having an effect on that and so that\u2019s the main issue there. I think Fred already mentioned and Dave mentioned the timing of a large account has affected the Express volumes here in the quarter. We are not concerned about that whatsoever. The issue with Ground \u2013 the Ground segment, which involves SmartPost, was a decision we made on some specific accounts. And as I have told you many, many times, I mean, we are going to be disciplined about that. We are growing at a rapid rate. We continue to grow rapidly. If you look at our performance over the last several years, we have had industry leading growth rates. But at the same time, it\u2019s important that we balance growth with improvements in yield to make sure we get a proper return given the investments we are making. So we are confident with the level of growth that we see going forward as it relates to the investments we have made.","Fred Smith","Let me just add more detail on it and just what I was saying a moment ago. I mean, we have a fantastic sales force all over the world. So traffic levels are affected on the margin by exchange rates. So when you have the dollar running up to the extent that it has here recently, which has been significant, U.S. exports are not as affordable and attractive to people in other areas. So, it puts a lot of pressure on U.S. exports. On the other side of the coin, with the diminution in the value of the euro or any other currency, it obviously makes their goods less expensive to the United States. So you will see with some adjustment disproportionate traffic growth there given the fact that we have got great sales people on both sides of all of the oceans. So I don\u2019t think you should read into that on these small perturbations anything more than exchange rates adjustments. Now over the longer haul, assuming there is good macroeconomic policy, which quite frankly is not the case in most places around and hopefully will be the case with tax reform here, you will see economic growth. And even with exchange rates, you will see volumes growing. And of course, as always, the fact that we think and I have said before, that we have strategies that allow us to take market share, particularly in the Express segment, which we will benefit from in the next several years.","Alan Graf","So not very strategic question, but so if there is any confusion, let me straighten you out. The accounting standards update for share-based payments which was a $0.07 benefit in the quarters and the tax rate, alright? So it\u2019s in the tax rate range I gave you as well for the year and it\u2019s in the adjusted guidance I gave you for the year. As to the gain on the sale of an investment, because this rose to the level that it did, a materiality of $0.08, we thought we would alert you to that. We have hundreds of little bitty items that go plus and minus in every quarter that we don\u2019t talk to you about, because they don\u2019t reach the level of materiality, but this one did. So, it\u2019s also in the range, but it\u2019s only $0.08 and the range is $0.50 wide. I would point out in the second quarter, year-over-year, our tax rate was higher. And our tax rate is complicated as we absorb TNT and work through our new tax planning structure and I will wait to see what comes out of Washington, so standby. That\u2019s the one that I got the least confidence about, but we will keep at it.","Operator","Our next question today comes from Brian Ossenbeck, JPMorgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. If you could give us an update on \u2013 as you work through some of these volumes that you\u2019ve been talking about how are the non-conveyable package annexes working? I think you said you have 6 built out for peak, is that something that you are also pulling back on or is there something you might look to add permanent capacity to handle some of those larger packages if you are able to, of course, price them accordingly?","Henry Maier","Great question, Brian. Just a couple of things. One is we have had non-conveyable capacity in our network going all the way back to, I think the first year we started the business. I think the change is the rapid growth rate we are seeing in these things as people get more comfortable ordering just about anything over the Internet. We had 8 annexes for non-conveyables this year at peak. I think only two of those we intended to be permanent post peak. But I will tell you that we still have some peak left here, but the early reports are this has been a homerun in terms of keeping large, very difficult to handle packages out of our hubs by virtue of the fact that we have had such terrific service performance this year. And our hub productivity has been excellent as well. So I would say that this is something that we will stick with. I think we still have some work to do in terms of where we sight them. And I think I mentioned this on other calls in here, there is also some pretty promising advancements, some material handling technology to handle these kind of packages. And as we learn more about that and as we experience whether the benefits that are promised were actually there, I think the next step will be trying to figure out how we retrofit existing facilities with that new material handling technology.","Mike Ducker","And I would just add that, as you know, we have made several pricing adjustments to make sure that we are being paid appropriately for the service that we are providing. We will continue to review the growth in this segment and if additional pricing actions are warranted, we will certainly take them.","Operator","Our next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","Yes. Thanks so much for taking the question. My question relates to getting a sense, at a high level, just how revenue growth for the company should or could translate to earnings growth over time, I certainly appreciate that there are a lot of moving parts and some timing items, but if you could just help \u2013 sort of help us understand just from a structural standpoint where you think your incremental margins should be or could be because they were pretty weak in the fiscal second quarter for understandable reasons maybe. But if you could just give us some sense of where you think it should be, what strikes the right balance between returns of investment and when do you think you can get to that sort of optimal level? Thanks so much.","Fred Smith","Well, let me answer this at the strategic level. We have been saying for a couple of years now that we believe FedEx Corporation\u2019s earnings, margins, cash flows and returns will go up. So let me reiterate that again that we believe that to be the case. The reason we think that they are going to go up is because the structure of our networks are such that there is leverage in those networks. And in the Express system, for instance, we are re-fleeting much more efficient. We are moving our international economy in non-asset systems. We have much more capacity in Europe, the pickup and delivery density in Europe. And the Ground situation, I just mentioned the fact that these investments in these facilities, as more and more volume goes through there, they are accretive of and by themselves. In the Freight area, we are very confident that the technologies that we have, which by the way allowed us, for the first time in the history of the LTL business, to offer both a priority and economy service. Nobody had the technology to do that. It would have been literally a scheduling impossibility, absent the sophistication of the technology. Now, we are applying that same technology to get more leverage out of our facilities in terms of throughput, cross-dock, if you will in Freight. Better loading, we have robots under test that \u2013 I could go on here all afternoon. There are just numerous places where we think we have increased earnings leverage with increased volume. An equal part of that, however is to be, as Mike Glenn has said several times, you have to be disciplined. The reality in the transportation business and for that matter, broadening it to the transportation and logistics business, these markets are so huge. You can get a lot of volume that is completely non-compensatory and just not make any money. And there are a large number of transportation and logistics companies that prove that every quarter making no money. And some of them are pretty damn big. So we just have a lot of leverage points and that\u2019s why we say what we have said. If that changes, we will say that, too. But we are not prepared to give you, despite my best efforts to do so, over the General Counsel\u2019s objections, to do what that is. But Alan is very good at giving you the ranges at the start of the year and we are very confident that we can increase our margins, cash flows, earnings per share and our returns with what we are doing. I am going to say one thing again that I said in my opening remarks. This is an enormous enterprise and I can\u2019t tell you on any one given quarter that we are going to have everything lined up in every segment. If I did that, it would be incorrect and misleading. What I can say is that we think we can manage those metrics I just gave you.","Operator","And our final question today will come from David Vernon, Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hi. Thanks for taking the call. I was just wondering if maybe Henry or Alan, you can help us think about the Ground margin outlook and the Ground revenue growth outlook over the next couple of quarters. Obviously, you are taking some more steps to be more selective on which customers you are taking in, should we be expecting this mid single-digit volume growth rate or is this just like a one-time anomaly. And then do you think that this will be kind of our trough year on Ground margins, with recovery next year or do you think we may still be working through this thing as we get to that 2020 goal, just trying to get a sense for how to adjust our medium-term expectations on the margin trajectory and the volume growth trajectory on Ground?","Fred Smith","David, this is Fred. I think we need to leave it with the broader themes that we laid out there. Again, I know from you all a standpoint, if we could be more precise on a quarterly-quarterly basis, we will. We expect Ground volumes, Ground revenues and Ground margins to go up in calendar \u201817 and certainly in fiscal \u201818 based on the traffic trends that \u2013 and yield trends that we see and the leverage in the investments that we have made. So I don\u2019t think you can take one quarter and extrapolate something and \u2013 but I think I will just leave it at that to give you the best guidance I can. And if we could get it better than that, I have to tell you, I would be happy about it to see it inside. But it\u2019s \u2013 there are just too many moving parts to do it otherwise.","Mickey Foster","Fred, do you have concluding remarks?","Fred Smith","Yes. Let me conclude first by thanking you all for being on this call. I would like to express the appreciation not just to myself, which I will come back to, but the SMC, who is all sitting around here and the Board of Directors who met in our normal quarterly meeting just a week or so and past one of the most effusive resolutions of praise I have ever seen in the business and I have seen a lot of these, so all of us, your partners here at FedEx, Mike, thank you for your 35 years. Mike and I have worked together for 25 years directly. I have told other people his office was right next door. There is nobody that has made more contributions to this company\u2019s success than you have, Mike. And that includes the speaker. And I have to tell you the professionalism and industry knowledge, the sales and marketing prowess, in particular, your sense of humor, wry, though, that may be on everything other than old miss football results. And I think it\u2019s the measure of the man \u2013 I have said this publicly, that I think knowing him, all things considered, Mike would have loved to stay here and stayed in the band and had some fun over the next 2 years to 3 years because we believe, just as I was saying to David there, we think they are going to be very good years. But he and Donna have a special needs child and they are making the right priorities. And I think that says everything you need to know about Mike Glenn\u2019s character and his commitment to his family in putting priorities in the right place. So thanks, Mike, for a job well done. I have Mike for 30 hours \u2013 how often, a month, 30 hours a month. So we have been calculating, does that start when he comes in the door or when he comes on the fourth floor as a consultant and we will be utilizing that treasure trove of knowledge that he has. So thanks again, Mike and well done.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation\u2019s second quarter earnings release conference call.

So now, our Chairman Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Fred Smith","Thank you, Mickey. We appreciate everyone on the call participating in it. Let me begin by thanking hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates for delivering our Purple Promise everyday including a great 2015 peak season.","FedEx Corporation continues to improve margins, financial performance and competitive position. As noted, our 3Q FY year-over-year earnings per share is up 23%. I should note there are three recurring areas of concern however expressed in various articles and reports: one, future margins; two, industry disruption; and three, capital spending. ","Regarding margins, the express profit improvement program will be exceeded by May 31. Express segment margins in the current fourth fiscal quarter will be approximately 12%. Likewise FedEx Ground including SmartPost margins will increase in the 16% plus this quarter while the FedEx Ground and supply chain segment will be 15%. Remember, GENCO is now part of this segment and the margins in this business will not be as high as those of Ground itself. However, the strategic importance of our expanded customer solutions resulting from the GENCO acquisition is profound and will greatly benefit our future financial performance.","A significant issue for FedEx Ground over the past year has been the extraordinary growth of oversize shipments which Mike Glenn and Henry Maier will address. It is truly unfortunate that Congress did not increased the federal twin-trailer limit from 28 feet each to 33 feet which would have benefited consumers, lowered fuel consumption and reduced highway accidents. We are optimistic about FedEx Freight improving margins in the future as well and Mike Ducker can talk about that. It\u2019s important to note that we manage FedEx operating companies to maximize the corporation\u2019s performance over the long term. So in any given quarter, we may spend more in one segment to achieve this result.","The concerns about industry disruption continue to be fuelled by fantastical and let me emphasize I chose this word carefully articles and reports which are devoid of in-depth knowledge of logistic systems and the markets which FedEx serves. As we have previously noted, network design technology, facilities capabilities and route\/stop density are the key elements in the FedEx UPS and postal service systems that make it highly likely. These entities will remain the primary carriers for e-commerce shipments in the U.S. for the foreseeable future.","Finally, FedEx is currently investing in FedEx Express fleet modernization and expansion of FedEx Ground\u2019s highly automated facilities. Both of these major programs have high returns and are interval to margin expansion. Our cash flows are such that we can easily fund investments at $4 billion to $5 billion per year while retiring debt used to acquire TNT if the transaction is approved and stock repurchases. Of course we include replacement CapEx in this projection. To reiterate, we believe FedEx will continue to improve margins, EPS, capital returns and increase cash flows which we have told you repeatedly over the last couple of years and again have demonstrated this quarter.","Let me now turn to Mike Glenn for our economic outlook followed by Alan Graf with detailed remarks about our financials. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thanks, Fred. I\u2019ll open with our economic update and outlook, and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment including revenue, volume and yield and provide some commentary on broader industry trends that we are experiencing. ","On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.2% for calendar 2016, 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter and 2.5% for calendar 2017 led by gains in consumer spending. We expect industrial production growth of 0.6% in calendar 2016, 130 basis points lower than last quarter and 2.5% for next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar 2016, which is 30 basis points below last quarter and 2.9% for calendar 2017.","Now I\u2019ll review revenue, volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment, revenue decreased 1% as lower fuel surcharge and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset yield growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew by 2%, driven by growth in overnight packages. U.S. domestic revenue per package increased 1% despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year domestic Express package yields grew 3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. FedEx International economy volume grew 2% while FedEx International Priority volume decreased 3%. International export revenue per package decreased 5% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields.","Excluding fuel, international export express package yield decreased 1%, primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of rate and discount changes. FedEx Ground revenue increased 30% in the quarter driven by higher ground volume and yield, recording of SmartPost revenue on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment and due to the inclusion of GENCO results. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 11% in Q3, primarily driven by growth for demand for residential deliveries related to e-commerce.","FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 8% year-over-year in Q3 due to the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 11% year-over-year driven primarily by weight and discount, and SmartPost customer mix.","FedEx Freight increased revenue 1% as LTL shipments increased 7% and revenue per shipment declined 4%. The increase in shipments is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability and choice of priority and economy services for our LTL customers. Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharges and average rate per shipment. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.","Now, I\u2019ll discuss in more detail some of the industry dynamics that drove the record peak season and beyond. The 2015 peak season was historic by many measures and it was driven by the continued growth of e-commerce. Demand for residential deliveries across the industry surpassed expectations as consumers increased online shopping in record numbers, not only with their higher volumes, but the types of goods purchased online increased. FedEx experienced record demand including multiple days of greater than 25 million packages delivered which is more than double our average daily volume. We are proud of our team members and the incredible job they did with more than 325 million packages delivered during the peak period. We worked very closely with our large e-tail and other peak customers to prepare for their needs and to deliver the holidays.","It is very clear that e-commerce is now enabled the full scale of retail revolution. There are several important trends worth noting. First, referring to a specific peak day is quickly becoming a thing of the past. As evidenced this year, there were multiple days where volumes exceeded 25 million packages as consumer buying habits are changing. We view this as a positive as Mother Nature can sometimes play habit with last minute e-commerce shoppers. Smoothing sales throughout peak season is a trend that will benefit retailers and transportation companies alike. We believe online shoppers will have increasing incentives to order earlier in the holiday season.","Second, more and more retailers are fulfilling e-commerce orders from individual stores or what we call store to home delivery. FedEx is well positioned to service this growing market in the years ahead with our broad portfolio of services including metro delivery and same day services. Third, we are seeing a significant increase in non-traditional items now being purchased online, mattresses to new swing sets and big screen TVs just to name a few. We welcome this opportunity but it is important that we price these items accordingly to account for the operational complexities such as manual sortation to person delivery et cetera. As a result, we will be adjusting the initial handling surcharge for FedEx Ground. Today, if a package length is greater than 60 inches additional handling surcharge will be applied. Beginning June 1, the maximum length will be reduced from 60 inches to 48 inches. We believe 48 inches is appropriate as it is the standard length of an LTL pallet. It is important to remember that the primary value proposition of e-commerce is the ability to order a product online and have it reliably deliver to the consumer.","In that regard, FedEx is and will continue to be a key enabler for e-commerce in the years ahead. By our estimates, more than 95% of all e-commerce orders today are delivered by one of three entities in the United States. FedEx, the United States Postal Service with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport the priority mail and UPS. In fact, if we were to isolate our e-commerce business one could argue that FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.","I\u2019d also like to clarify some of the public discussion and speculation concerning Amazon adding some direct transportation capabilities. First, Amazon is a valuable customer that we worked with for many years and we expect to work with them for many years to come. We\u2019ve been in constant dialogue with them to understand their transportation needs as they've experienced significant growth. We\u2019ve been aware of Amazon\u2019s need for supplemental capacity related to inventory management, which is driving some of the investments they are making in transportation.","Large retailers have long had their own transportation capabilities, primarily to enable movement and positioning of inventory across their store and fulfillment locations. While recent stories and reports of a new entity competing with the three major carriers in the United States grabs headlines, the reality is it will be a daunting task requiring tens of billions of dollars in capital and years to build sufficient scale and density to replicate existing networks like FedEx.","It is also important to note that no one FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue. Additionally, other than the Postal Service, no single customer represents more than approximately 3% of revenue for FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, or FedEx Freight. We manage these relationships carefully to ensure we don't become overly dependent on any one customer. We expect these industry trends and dynamics to accelerate this coming holiday season and we will continue to affect the industry year around. FedEx is well-positioned to provide innovative solutions and to meet this growing demand.","And now, I will turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you Mike for that excellent report and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong quarter with adjusted earnings of $2.51 per diluted share, up year-over-year more than 23%. Adjusted consolidated operating margin increased to a healthy 9.2% versus 8.3% last year. These record earnings proved once again the success of our strategy to manage our portfolio of services to achieve enterprise results and it\u2019s important to remember this strategy does not always translate into each segment's individual earnings and margin performance.","We expect our fiscal 2016 adjusted earnings to be up 20% to 22% over last year as we continue to benefit from our execution of the profit improvement program at Express. Our positive financial momentum should continue into our upcoming fiscal 2017 or we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. This quarter there were three expense adjustments within corporate, eliminations, and other.","First, during the quarter, we reached agreements in principle to settle all of the 19 cases on appeal in the multidistrict independent contracted litigation. The settlements will require court approval. We recognize a liability for the net expected loss related to these cases and certain other pending independent contractor -related proceedings of $204 million or $0.46 per diluted share. These disputes involve a contractor model which FedEx Ground has not operated since 2011. This is good news because assuming the necessary court approvals are obtained it resolves all of the remaining multidistrict litigation cases.","We are defending contractor model cases that are not or no longer part of the multidistrict litigation. These cases are in varying stages of litigation. We do not expect to incur a material loss in these cases. Secondly, net expenses related to the settlement of a U.S. customs and border protection matter involving FedEx trade networks were $69 million or $0.15 per diluted share. And thirdly, our pending acquisition of TNT Express and operating income impacted $23 million and EPS impact of $0.06 per diluted share.","Turning to the segments and starting with our star Express, Express had an outstanding quarter as operating income climbed 51%, and operating margin increased despite lower revenues. We repeat that. Operating income climbed 51% and operating margin increased despite lower revenues, who does that. Express operating margin was 9.1%, a 320 basis points versus last year and is the best third quarter margin in Express segment history.","The increase was driven primarily by yield management, U.S. domestic volume growth, and ongoing benefits from the profit improvement program. Express is efficiently managing volume increases in e-commerce and at the same time continued softness in international volumes. The profit improvement program that we announced in 2012 continues to improve revenue quality, increase productivity, and constrain expenses.","Turning to Ground, Ground saw unprecedented demand with volumes increasing 11%. However, Ground's operating margin declined. The 390 basis point decline in operating margin was primarily driven by five factors, one 190 basis points from the change in SmartPost revenue reporting and the inclusion of GENCO results. Two, 60 basis points from higher cost driven significantly by peak season demand that exceeded both volume and package size expectations as Mike discussed.","Third, 60 basis points from higher self-insurance reserves. Fourth, 30 basis points from increased purchased transportation rates for linehaul. And fifth, 30 basis points from network expansion cost. As Mike said, we are evaluating several Ground pricing initiatives to balance our revenue and cost and increased margins. In addition, over the next two years, we are spending additional capital at Ground to expand needed capacity to support both commercial and e-commerce growth, including non-conveyable annexes designed to more efficiently handle those packages that do not fit on our sortation equipment.","Fred mentioned, we expect Ground to return to mid-teens margins in the fourth quarter. At Freight, Freight continues to adjust to a very challenging LTL market. Freight segment operating results decreased primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense outpacing revenue growth. And revenue growth was negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharges and weight per shipment. We had been installing dimensional scanners to more accurately cost and price shipments.","Freight currently has 45 dimensional scanners in operation today with another eight slated to be installed by the end of the fiscal year. These dimensional scanners pay for themselves in less than a year and an important part of our yield improvement program. We also expect Freights productivity to continue to improve in Q4, as well as throughout 2017. ","From an outlook standpoint, we expect our strong solid earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter from the execution of the profit improvement program and from improvements in our Express and Ground segment's due to volume and yield growth. We are updating the lower part of the range for our adjusted FY16 earnings guidance to $10.70 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. The new range of $10.70 to $10.90 represents adjusted EPS growth of 20% to 22% year-over-year.","Our outlook excludes certain legal cost as well as any TNT integration cost of results. Our expectations for earnings are dependent on several external factors, including fuel prices and moderate growth in the global economy. The capital spending forecast for the fiscal year is now $4.8 billion, which is higher than our previous forecast due to increased investments in FedEx Ground as we continue to expand the network in anticipation of continued high growth.","FedEx is strongly committed to delivering long-term value for our customers, shareowners, and team members. In January, we completed a 15 million share repurchase program authorized in September 2014 and announced our most recent stock repurchase program of up to 25 million shares of FedEx Corporation common stock. Since FY 2014, FedEx has returned over $8.3 million to shareowners through the repurchase of over 60 million shares and during the past two years has increased its dividend by 33% and 25%, respectively.","Our strong balance sheet profit and cash flow performance give us the flexibility to initiate this stock repurchase program, while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives. In the near-term, we are planning the debt offering, the proceeds of which are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and the prepayment of certain tax-exempt debt. We intend to fund the acquisition of TNT Express with cash from operations and proceeds from a planned debt offering in the fourth quarter which we plan to launch shortly after the other debt offering. We will evaluate assessing the Euro market for the TNT funding.","The lower Moody\u2019s rating that we expected will have a de minimus impact on our upcoming financings. Regarding the TNT acquisition, we completed several steps during the third quarter including unconditional approval by the European Commission of our intention to acquire TNT, and TNT has announced agreement to sell its airline operation to comply with rules governing foreign ownership of European airlines.","We had many questions submitted by analysts on the TNT acquisition. Many of which we cannot answer in detail at this time. I will say that FY 2017 will be a year of investment and integration and in beginning in fiscal 2018 I am expecting TNT to be very accretive to earnings. The TNT acquisition is expected to expand our global portfolio particularly in Europe, significantly lower cost to so our European markets by increasing density in our pickup and delivery operations, and accelerate our global growth.","More than 20 FedEx and TNT our operational and geographical teams are planning to make the transition as smooth as possible for customers and team members to position FedEx for long-term profitable growth. We remain confident that we will close the acquisition in the first half of calendar year 2016 and we were very pleased with TNT's recently reported improving operating performance. Want to prove this landmark acquisition is expected to bring over 50,000 new team members to our ranks and significantly improve our global competitive position.","In closing, I am extremely proud of the FedEx team for its impressive efforts. Our financial momentum should continue in FY 2017, while we expect continued solid growth in earnings and cash flow. Thank you for your attention. I\u2019m now going to turn the meeting back over to Fred and we will start the Q&A.","Fred Smith","Mickey why don't we take, we covered most of the Internet answers in my remarks, Mike\u2019s remarks and Alan's remarks, there are a couple of others we will get to, but I will let Mickey moderate at this point in time for the other ones. And I would point out we will spend about 45 minutes on the Q&A or until we run out of strategic questions. We are not going to re-plough a lot of ground that we have done in the past year because it just wastes everybody's time. Mickey.","Mickey Foster","Okay, the first question. We\u2019re ready for the first live question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will move first to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hi thanks, good afternoon. I wanted to think about sort of the bigger picture strategic question for the Express side of business. So far the profit improvement plan has been very successful and you are hitting your goals, do you think about the next sort of three years, excluding TNT for a moment, how do you think about sort of the capital intensity and the asset intensity of that business. Does there come a point where there is an opportunity to maybe do more business with fewer assets in the air and sort of leveraging sort of the supply dynamics within the air cargo market, wanted to think about the bigger picture trend for Express going forward, can you feel more confident using third-party aircraft and how we should maybe think about that?","Alan Graf","Thanks for your question Chris and thanks for your comments about our Express team has done a great job. The answer to your question is, we have a great fleet modernization plan that actually takes us out the a lot of years and we continue to replace the old planes with the new 757\u2019s and the 777's and quite frankly, we\u2019ve actually already been doing things like you suggested using third-party lift, where appropriate throughout around the world and that\u2019s been very beneficial and very profitable obviously, but I think on top of that our FTN, our FedEx Trade Networks Organization and they are strategic part of our business around the world on ocean shipping with the air freight shipping and obviously the priority Express shipping, you can see that we will continue to grow our profits and our margins and for a long, long time, and quite frankly we've got our network right in the sweet zone right now, executing on all cylinders. So, I think the answer to your question, we probably could look at opportunities to add more into our capacity if we needed to. The great thing about what we've done is we can flex up or down and we\u2019ve appropriately done that. So, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to grow our profits and grow our margins and if that appears to be the case we will go forward with that.","Operator","And we will to our next question from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks good afternoon. Following up on your comments regarding capital spending, looking out a couple of years to fiscal 2017 and 2018, how should we think about growth in CapEx at Ground versus Express exclusive of any impact from TNT?","Alan Graf","Allison, this is Alan, you need to think about CapEx exclusive at TNT being at $ 5 billion or little bit over for the next couple of years and most of that increase is going into the Ground networks. We have about 100 projects underway right now that we hope to get finished before next peak. A broad brush across the country, two new hubs, only thing it is going to be automated and I'm sure Henry can add a little bit to that, but easily affordable. The actual number will be higher because we're going to have to invest in TNT, TNT had been under invested in and we will have more to tell you about that after we close it.","Henry Maier","Hi Allison, we have on cap for this year two hubs, and 19 automated satellites, which will bring us up to over 100, I think the exact number is 103 automated facilities out of a network of about 550 by the end of the year. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the majority of our capital spend.","Operator","Thank you and our next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes good afternoon, thank you for the question and I appreciate all the comments at the beginning Fred it\u2019s helpful to get that perspective. On the Express, your various comments are pretty upbeat about how you are ending the year with Express margin and I think you said like 12% fourth quarter, would you reconsider what you might be able to get to in Express margin over the next several years and is there any kind of framework for what might be a path forward, is it, I think you\u2019ve talked about 10% in the past, is there something that we ought to think about 11 or 12 on our full year basis, just wondered if you could frame that kind of additional momentum and how we might think about that in the next few years in Express? Thank you.","Mike Glenn","Well thanks Tom and I appreciate your feedback and I remember you were there when we announced our profit improvement plan and I\u2019m really pleased to say that we are hitting it, exceeding it and the moment actually is carrying us into the fourth quarter and it will carry us into the next fiscal year. And it\u2019s in every area. Quite frankly, we have a D&A now in our company, we\u2019ve a right sized the company, we\u2019ve got the right cost structure in place for our people and our airplanes and our whole network around the world, TNT as Alan mentioned before and Fred is going to be fantastic going forward, but I think the answer will be obvious. The answer is, we continue to grow our profits and our margins, you can see it in the fourth quarter we had 12%, obviously double-digit margins are right on us now and we continue to grow into that going forward. So that being too much more specific than we already are, which we've been more specific than we usually are. Yeah, you can see very strong double-digit margins at Express going forward.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith again. Let me reiterate what I said at the opening of my remarks and the end of the remarks. We anticipate FedEx Corporation's margins, returns, cash flows, and EPS to increase over the foreseeable future. So, obviously with Express and then Ground is our biggest operating companies that should basically answer your questions. Regarding the item on the fleet, I think it\u2019s important to note that FedEx Express is operating 20 less airplanes today in 2016 then we were in 2013. Now part of the reason we are able to do that is because the airplanes are much more reliable. We don't need as many as spares, there is not in many in maintenance intervals, and of course we are always trying to make our assets sweat more. And use assets productively whether they are ours or someone else's. So that's an old part of what we're doing what we do as well.","Operator","Thank you and our next question will come from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty","Hi guys thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to maybe be return to Ground a little bit and any better sense you can provide about the profitability improvement potential that could come from the smart post integration, maybe how long of a process this will take, if it is something that will start to see no noticeable difference in fiscal 2017. I know the goal is mid-teens, gross margins and you talk about that for the next quarter, but kind of from a full year basis, just wondering if you could walk us through, how and when we get there?","Henry Maier","Hi Kelly, this is Henry Maier, thanks for the question. I think it is important to point out here that we are totally focused at FedEx Ground on long-term profitable growth. And we have a number of initiatives underway right now that over long term will fundamentally change the way we operate FedEx Ground. So, let me share a couple of them with you. There are network changes underway that integrate commercial and residential networks and position us to increase our operating days and continue to enhance our service. We are making a number of operating adjustments that enable the cost-effective and productive handling of the increased volume of large non-conveyable packages. ","We are also investing in technology that supports operating one consolidated Ground network, which prior to our announcement last September we had two. We\u2019re also transitioning our U.S. pickup and delivery service providers national to a single operating agreement that enables increased service capacity and improves operational flexibility for these independent businesses. Now these investments, which vary in timetables, but should be essentially complete by the end of, sorry prior to FY 2021, will have a short-term impact on margin, but will ultimately drive cost out of the network enabling Ground margins to return to historical levels. And we continue to believe that we are uniquely positioned to succeed in this new e-commerce world.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from David Ross with Stifel.","David Ross","Yes, good afternoon. I just wanted to turn to FedEx Freight for a second. The shipment growth accelerated nicely, up 7% in the challenging period for the LTL industry, the margins weakened, just wanted to get a little bit more color Mike, in terms of what's behind that in terms of how much is related to fuel, was it a intentional move to not push the price lever as much to get the volume in on what else is going on there?","Mike Glenn","Thanks for the question, this is Mike Glenn. The success that we had in growth was primarily driven by our sales activities in the small and mid-size customer segment. Our sales team is executing crisply and bringing the kind of growth that we are looking for. The primary driver, absent fuel and the lower yield per shipment on revenue per shipment was lower weight per shipment. So, I will turn it over to Mike Ducker to comment further.","Mike Ducker","Yes David, Mike Ducker and I will just reiterate the excellent job done. Most of that growth came in the small and medium sector. In the first half of 2016, we had anticipated volume growth that really didn't materialize. So, we found ourselves over staffed in certain geographies and through a combination of that sales success Mike just talked about and reduced staffing through attrition, we've now better aligned our staffing to volume levels we\u2019re in balance and we've got significantly improved network efficiencies going forward. So a lot of that was input cost on salaries and wages and benefits versus the volume that we had at the first part of the year. So, now we are operating in balance, service levels of the best are the best in many years, we are focused on yield improvement, productivity improvement, and better capacity management in the future. ","Fred Smith ","So, Fred Smith here, I mentioned we covered most of the Internet questions in the prepared remarks, there were a couple that didn't fit, one of them from Nate Brochmann of William Blair, we all likely agree the same day delivery is a relatively small market today and likely will be even in the future. What is FedEx doing to prepare a partner with local delivery\/final mile firms if the market turns out to be larger than expected? Mike.","Mike Glenn","FedEx currently offers same-day delivery in 23 markets and we've seen volume growth in key segments such as retail, e-commerce, healthcare, and others. FedEx Same-Day City plays an important role on our e-commerce suite of services and customers are responding well to the uniformed professionalism of our business model. Having said that it still represents and let you offering in very small percentage of our overall portfolio, but we are able to scale when demand dictates.","Fred Smith","Nate also asked a question about FedEx ground and the productivity of our independent service providers, I think Henry answered that in just a moment ago. So, we will move on to one by David Ross of Stifel, China has been grabbing a lot of headlines in recent months, please discuss the importance of China's economy to the FedEx global express network? Dave Bronczek.","Dave Bronczek","Yes thanks Fred, and thanks for the question David. Obviously, China is a very important to us, but they are not more important than all the rest of the world. I mean they are a part of the rest of the world for us. There\u2019s a lot of multinational companies that are in China that we do business with in China and exporting out of China. So, I would say that we\u2019re always watching how the economy is in China, but it is not causing us any problem or any concern right now because our customers there are for the most part multinational customers.","Fred Smith","There was also a question from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley about Amazon\u2019s building out some of its own capacity. I think that was answered in its entirety by Mike's remarks. Tell me, queue yourself up Ravi, if that\u2019s not the case. Now we will take another question from someone on the line.","Operator","Okay and our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","So thanks Fred and team for a great, great job on the quarter, but may be you can talk a little bit Alan on TNT, I know you want to wait till it closes, but can you talk about the process here, does the appeal slow the potential on closing, is there a timing we should expect on the China decision and then maybe you can talk about in terms of synergies when we can kind of expect to see the level and amount as you talk about, what\u2019s going to go into 2018 and the benefits you get from there?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me ask our general counsel Christine Richards to comment on the first. And regarding the second, since it has not been approved I think unfortunately we need to wait on making any comments about that until the transaction has closed, but we will make sure that we do that assuming that it does close in first call after that. So Chris if you\u2019ll speak to the legal issues.","Chris Richards","Ken, this is Chris Richards, thank you for the question. I\u2019m very pleased to report that we have obtained a tremendous number of competitive approvals from the last call and at this point in time we have unconditional approval in Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the European Union, Israel, Japan, Namibia, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey, the Ukraine, the United States, and Vietnam. We are completing the process and have review pending in Argentina, China and Korea. We also have an appeal of the unconditional approval in Brazil, which was an expected appeal, it is a part of their normal process and we're very confident that we will close the acquisition of TNT in the first half of calendar year 2016 with all necessary regulatory approvals.","Fred Smith","We will take live questions again.","Operator","Thank you. And we will move next to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Salmon","Hi, good afternoon guys. With regard to the omni-channel retailing, I\u2019m curious, which network that is running through when you're getting the from store to home, I would imagine anything that\u2019s going interest store is running across the B2B network probably predominantly in Express, but was hoping to get a little bit of perspective related to which respect of network that runs through and the impact to return on invested capital and revenue per unit would be really helpful?","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. Regarding our metro service capabilities, we have a variety of services. We have Express service for the premium packages that require specific delivery time. We have Ground services that can serve metro eight areas. We also have SmartPost services that can serve Metro. So, we have a variety of services to meet that need. Should also mention Same-Day City, which is operated by our FedEx office team, also has the capability to serve metro toward our home delivery. So, we have a wide variety of service capabilities and we are well suited to participate in that market segment.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me again remind the people that follow FedEx that our services are a portfolio, which are broadly used by customers. I think I\u2019m correct well into the 90% of our customers might use Express and Ground, over 70% use Express, Ground and Freight. And I think based on the emails and the comments that I get on the internet, every man, women and child in America uses FedEx Office. So again our job is to try to improve earnings, returns, cash flows and we have told you that we are confident that we can do that, and I think a little bit on this call not so much is in the past, if you attempt to try to bisect FedEx into some of the parts analysis you\u2019re going to get surprised. ","We buy airplanes because they increase earnings, cash flows and returns over a period of time. We add automated ground facilities because they do the same thing. So there is no motivation inside FedEx to do anything other than to achieve those results at the corporate level and sometimes we decide to be aggressive in one segment because we are achieving our corporate goals and you\u2019ve seen that with the ground numbers when we were responding to the post 2008 crash in Express and fuel prices running up to $147 a barrel. So we launched the profit improvement program and a lot of the corporate results were funded by the outstanding performance of ground. Now, we\u2019re doing a lot of things on Henry side of the house and Express margins and returns are expanding, we are able to do that still buying a lot of stock and pay for a significant acquisition. So it\u2019s important to keep that in mind when you\u2019re asking these questions. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good evening everyone. Fred, thanks for addressing my email question. Just one follow-up on omni channel, can you give us an update on your Monday residential service trial. How many city so far, have you expanded it to any new cities and what have you learned from trial so far?","Mike Glenn","Thanks, Ravi. I guess it\u2019s safe to say that the six day pilot we ran in Tennessee this year was an unmitigated success. We have plans to expand it later this summer and we\u2019re looking very hard at whether or not we just run this network six days a week year round. We get much more turns out of the assets. I think Dave mentioned making the asset, we\u2019ll certainly do that. I think the other thing that\u2019s important to people on the call to understand is that while we talk a lot about peak, e-commerce buying behavior is really shifting to a peak like look around. We are extremely heavy on Monday because of the e-commerce orders that flow in and fulfilled over the weekend. And I think long term I think six day a week operation is probably the best operation to run because these e-commerce stores never shut down. So I think we\u2019re well positioned there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks, afternoon guys. So Alan, I wanted to just follow-up a little bit on the guidance. So if I plugged 12% Express margins for the fourth quarter into the model, it feels like there is some upside potential to that 10.70% to 10.90% range. So any offsets that we should be thinking about to keep us within that range. And I know you made some preliminary comments on fiscal 2017 but can you give any more color on what you consider solid earnings growth of you think we could be in that 10% to 15% long term guidance that you have.","Alan Graf","The guidance is the best that I can do. I missed so many quarters that now we\u2019re back to a quarterly guidance during the fourth quarter. You never know, fuel prices are ticking up a little bit and so that could possibly work against us on a year-over-year basis, so we\u2019re watching that very carefully. There could be \u2013 what happens at the end of the year with aircraft maintenance, we think there might be a little bit of risk with that as well. So we\u2019re watching all these very carefully but I\u2019m pretty confident in that range and that\u2019s why we cut the bottom of it off. And Mike told you about how we\u2019ve lowered substantially our expectations for the economy in 2016 and so we\u2019re keeping our eye on that as well. But having said that, I\u2019m not guaranteeing we\u2019re going to hit inside that range because my track record has not been very good on a quarterly basis.","Fred Smith","Fred Smith here. We have one internet question from Jeffrey Kauffman, The Buckingham Research Group. ","Jeffrey Kauffman","On the TPP trends pacific trade agreement, while the agreement reached seemed a reason to celebrate. It seems that popular politics seems to be voting down free trade in this election season. What does TPP mean to FedEx and does management view the risk of TPP not being approved increasing and can you please provide an update.","Fred Smith","I don\u2019t think there is any question about the fact that TPP is going to be harder to pass given that the leading republican and democratic candidates were presenting United States are against it. Free trade and opening markets has been American policy since 1934 when Roosevelt and Hull passed the trade agreement act that overturned the absolutely disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariffs, those were two republicans that in 1930 put in a lot of tariffs to protect America. So trade contracted by 66% and the Roosevelt Hull action in 1934 turned it around but there is no question that those tariffs created with a big part of the cause of the depression. ","So after the war, one of the first things that Hull still there and Roosevelt before his death worked on was the International Trade Organization along with IMF and the World Bank. They couldn\u2019t get it passed so they instead came up with this framework called the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trades called GATT, and seven times they expanded trade until the World Trade Organization was put in place back in the 90s. So the thought that trade is not been a great thing for the world and America is absolutely belied by facts. Now have they been in merchant list, of course they have Japan and China in particular.","But to lump in all trade with the trade practices of a couple of trading partners is like putting leaches on you and bleeding the way they used to do during the old days and think you\u2019re going to get better. I mean it\u2019s a self inflicted problem and in the case of Mexico, the NAFTA agreement has added hundreds of billions of dollars which is traded with Mexico, yes we do have a modest trade deficit with Mexico but the benefits of trade are always dispersed, lower iPhones, lower TVs, lower priced T shirts, lower automobile cost, on and on down the line which makes everyone standard of living better whereas the pain is always localized like the unfortunate carrier air conditioner shutdown in Indiana that\u2019s being so prominently talked about.","Now TPP, it should be noticed and everybody makes a big thing out of the fact it\u2019s a 54,000 page document or something like that. What it does in the main is to reduce 18,000 tariffs on U.S. goods. So it helps us a lot and I hope as we get into the general election, the profound benefits of free trade over many, many decades can be understood and the merchant list practices of people who are not comporting to the WTO dealt with on an individual basis. So we think that it\u2019s much more difficult to get TPP passed but I can promise you we\u2019re going to work as hard as we can to make sure people understand these issues.","We\u2019ll be able to take another question from live on the call.","Operator","Thank you. And we move to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Good evening everyone and thanks for taking my question, and again congrats on the growth, it\u2019s tough to come by here for most of the companies. So Fred or Mike, can you guys help us understand here because this might be part of the confusion or part of the problem looking at Amazon, as we have more and more omni channel distribution as Amazon puts fulfillment centers closer to the consumer, has there been a length of haul reduction in the average e-commerce shipment or is it by far still regional distribution model? And so if we do go to more a local type distribution, how does that change where you see the capital priorities for FedEx or maybe it\u2019s not even shifting that way?","Mike Glenn","I think Amazon\u2019s strategy is clear, the more distribution facilities they put up the more they would like to be close to the end consumer which by definition makes more deliveries on a local basis. Having said that, all of the conversation about new entrants into the local delivery market, I mean there are hundreds and thousands of local delivery companies in every market in the country delivering parcels. All you have to do is Google local delivery and you will come not sure where you live but Google that in the city where you live and you\u2019ll find hundreds of companies that deliver parcels on a local basis every day, that\u2019s not the market that FedEx competes in on a day-to-day basis. We run a broad global network. Having said that, as I mentioned before, no single customer represents over 3% of our total revenue, so we are not exposed to any one customer and we try to manage our business so that we don\u2019t get over exposed in that regard. So we\u2019re well positioned for growth long term and as I said Amazon is a good customer, we expect to be a good customer long term.","Fred Smith","Fred Smith here, let me refer you to my friend David [indiscernible] remarks after their last quarterly results. He was on CNBC, did a great job and he pointed out that the essential thing in the delivery business is route density and revenue per delivery stock. And that is why he said virtually the same thing that we have said that in all likelihood the primary delivers of e-commerce shipments for the foreseeable future will be UPS, The U.S. Postal Service and FedEx because input costs even though you might have a local operator over the thousands, it might talk about are trumped by the delivery density and the revenue per stop characteristics of the big carriers.","And remember, we are not delivering from 50 fulfillment centers or 100 stores or 60 stores, we have the capability to pickup, transport and deliver an item from 95% of the human beings on the planet much less every business on the world within one to two business days, door to door customs cleared. So that\u2019s known as Metcalfe's law, everybody understands this in the telecommunication business, it\u2019s the number of nodes on the network squared. If you run the hub-and-spoke system, it\u2019s in times and minus one. So whether you\u2019re a big box retailer or you\u2019re an e-tailer that puts their fulfillment centers which is a surrogate for the store delivers the items individually or how you come into the store, the economics are the same. It\u2019s network density and revenue per delivery stop that are the determinant of who is going to deliver these packages in the years to come. ","The postal service delivers to a 140, 154 million addresses every day and so like way the e-commerce packages are perfect for the postal service because they can put them in with a mail and deliver on two residents, that\u2019s why parcel selected they call it is partnered with FedEx SmartPost, UPS share post, Amazon direct injection and another group of smaller competitors in this so called consolidator space. And it\u2019s that misunderstanding that the drivers are network density and revenue per delivery stop that have led to a lot of the misunderstanding about the future evolution of the markets.","Okay, another question from live question.","Operator","Yes. We will move to Matt Troy with Nomura.","Matt Troy","Yes, thanks. I just wanted to look at the Express segment, the rate of growth in the overnight premium product almost doubled versus your year-to-date rate which is curious. Is that more tied to the urgency around peak season or you\u2019re seeing a shift back in behavior by consumers is more sustainable to the premium product?","Fred Smith","We had strong demand for overnight services in peak season. Obviously that is certainly the case as you get closer to Christmas day and that was a key driver for that.","Matt Troy","Okay, thank you.","Fred Smith","Let me take a couple of internet questions here and then Mickey can tie it off with one or two questions from \u2013 live questions. John Barnes ask about then pricing, I think we pretty well covered that. Do you want to?","Mike Glenn","John, let me just say that FedEx implemented then pricing last January therefore the third quarter last year only had two months of impact of the new dimension way pricing while this year had three months in the impact. So it was one difference in terms of month. Dimensional way of pricing obviously is the standard in the industry and I will say that I think it\u2019s had a very positive effect on customers in terms of how they view their packages and the package size. There is still a long way to go on that but certainly there \u2013 we made a lot of progress in that regard. I think you also had a comment about are you concerned about driving customers to find alternative or non-traditional sources of parcel capacity, I\u2019m not aware that there are any viable non-traditional sources of parcel capacity especially in peak season so we certainly don\u2019t see that as an issue.","Fred Smith","Allison Landry asked some questions about parcel select. I think I answered that in the longer window answer I gave about route densities and revenue per delivery stop. Art Hatfield of Raymond James, do you currently see any new regulatory headwinds on the rise in either here in the U.S. or overseas? This along with bad trade policy and bad tax policy is why we are seeing low GDP growth rate and why global GDP has slowed down in global trade. I cannot tell you the on slot of regulatory issues that we deal with every day here. It\u2019s in every possible crevice of the organization from Department of Labor to the FAA to protectionist policies, [indiscernible] security regulations overseas. If you don\u2019t try to stop these things, the natural course of events is they come on the bottom of the ship like barnacles. So that\u2019s happening and that\u2019s why we have low growth rates, bad policies, taxes and regulations in Europe, in the United States and China, in Japan and unless those things turnaround you\u2019re going to continue to have low growth rates. ","So Mickey, you want to finish it up.","Mickey Foster","Okay, just one or two more questions, then we\u2019ll finish.","Operator","We will move to the next question from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling","Thank you. Good afternoon gentlemen. In LTL volumes, do you saw nice volume growth? Are you seeing more growth on the economy side or the priority side and how much is improved rail service helping economy growth?","Fred Smith","We had balanced growth between the two services so there was no material difference there.","Kevin Sterling","Okay, thank you.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Mickey Foster for any final or additional remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation\u2019s third quarter earnings release conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions about FedEx. Thank you.","Operator","Everyone, that does conclude our conference call for today.

Season's greetings to all. Welcome to our call. FedEx is in the midst of another record-setting holiday season, long-term investments in capacity and advanced automation are paying off in speed advantage and outstanding service during peak and year-round. We salute our 450,000-plus team members around the world for outstanding service and we greatly appreciate their dedication to our Purple Promise, which simply states, \"I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.\"","At FedEx Ground, I think it's particularly notable, 96% of packages moved through an automated facility, translating to increased efficiency and speed. During this holiday season, service is at record levels. Just yesterday, 67% of FedEx Ground packages were delivered 1 full day earlier than scheduled despite it being one of the busiest days in the history of our company. What's more? Yesterday was the busiest shipping day ever at FedEx Office. This fall, we opened 2 major ground hubs with Allentown, Pennsylvania being the largest in the FedEx Ground network. Both Express and Ground hub operations in North Carolina have been recently expanded as well.","FedEx second quarter adjusted earnings per share were up 27% year-over-year and we anticipate full year fiscal 2019 and adjusted earnings per share will increase year-over-year despite difficult global economic conditions.","As our volumes and revenues demonstrate, FedEx is experiencing strong growth in the U.S. where the economy remains solid. However, our international business, especially in Europe, weakened significantly since we last talked with you during our earnings call in September. In addition, China's economy has weakened due in part to trade disputes. As a result, we have lowered our fiscal 2019 earnings guidance and are accelerating actions to reduce costs given the uncertainty of global macroeconomic trends. We are highly confident that we will achieve the benefits expected with the acquisition of TNT Express, although we will not achieve our FedEx profit improvement goal in fiscal 2019.","Voluntary employee buyout announced in our earnings release today is consistent with FedEx' People-Service-Profit philosophy and addresses 3 strategic issues. One, we are nearing the end of our IT modernization program, project renewal, which began in 2010 to transition FedEx Information Systems into the cloud, legacy mainframe applications are now being rapidly retired. This is one of the largest such transitions in the history of business. Once concluded, renewal will have vastly reduced the number of FedEx IT Systems, while dramatically improving security, speed to value, reliability, flexibility, productivity and provide new automation opportunities for our customers and many FedEx operations.","The VBO will provide our team members with important career options as legacy systems and technologies are retired. Massive integration of TNT into FedEx will be approaching its end-stages, so a second rationale for the VBO is that we will not need the same number of staff positions at the end of this multi-year integration journey. And third, we believe new productivity enhancing tools from accounting bots, legal system analytics to predictive AI, et cetera, will allow us to operate our company with fewer staff positions going forward.","Of course, we expect overall FedEx employment to increase over the next several years, again, assuming moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, the VBO will help improve our tooth-to-tail cost. U.S. VBO is targeted to achieve an annual savings of $225 million to $275 million per year, providing an approximately 18 to 24 month payback. Alan will further discuss our cost management strategy following comments from Raj and Dave. Let me add, however, that we do not manage FedEx solely for quarterly results. In fact, as we speak, we are also currently planning for the next quarter century of FedEx Services operations.","Let me thank David Cunningham for his valuable contributions and wish him well in retirement after more than 36 years of service, most recently as President and CEO of FedEx Express. Raj Subramaniam, a 27-year veteran of FedEx will succeed David. He brings remarkable expertise and vision to this position, which are critical as we manage the Express business as a part of the global portfolio.","Let me add, to those of you who don't know, Raj served as one of our regional presidents during his long career. Brie Carere, who has more than 17 years with our company will succeed Raj as Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing and Communications Officer of FedEx Corporation. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by giving you our thoughts on where we stand on the economic outlook. In the U.S., growth remains solid, driven by robust consumer spending in favorable conditions in the industrial sector. Internationally, economic strength seen earlier this year has given way to a slowdown. The peak for global economic growth now appears to be behind us.","Eurozone growth has slowed from 2.5% last year to under 2% in the second half of 2018, and economic growth in the U.K. has slowed sharply since July. The secular slowdown in Chinese economy has been exacerbated by trade tensions. Spillover effects from these tensions and the fading tech cycle have negatively impacted growth throughout Asia. Emerging Asia growth slowed from 6% in 2017 to 5.6% in Q3. World trade slowed in Q3 to just 3.5% compared to 5.3% in Q3 2017. Leading indicators point to positive, but even slower trade growth near term.","Now turning to FedEx performance. We grow composite revenue, volume and yields at each transportation segment we have been working to holistically manage base yields and surcharges, including fuel. The domestic pricing environment is competitive, but rational. We recently announced our 2019 GRI of 4.9% for FedEx Ground and Express shipments and 5.9% for FedEx Freight.","As per our announcement yesterday, we are expanding e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, the service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express with next-day local delivery and 2-day shipping to any address in the continental United States. Retailers can extend evening order cutoff time by 5 to 8 hours, with some as late as midnight depending on their current order fulfillment process. FedEx Extra Hours recently launched with select customers, including AutoZone and Best Buy in multiple markets across The United States.","As e-commerce continues to drive business, we continue to invest in our extensive retail network. In October alone, FedEx Onsite expanded to more than 1,200 Walgreens owned Rite Aid locations bringing the total FedEx hold locations to more than 12,000. And extending this saving grace, once again, for anyone who needs it, pickup will be available on Christmas Day at the vast majority of more than 8,900 Walgreens locations.","Further, we are encouraging our customers who have not already done so to register for FedEx Delivery Manager. This will not only alert them of upcoming deliveries, but also allow them to redirect packages to thousands of secure and convenient hold locations during the holiday season. Enrollments have grown over 72% fiscal year to date, a clear indication that customers are enjoying the visibility and control of their shipments.","Thanks to our outstanding team members and unparalleled network, we are experiencing yet another record peak season for FedEx. Once again, we have not applied a residential peak surcharge. FedEx delivers for millions of small- and medium-sized businesses every day and we want to support these customers as e-commerce continues to grow and become a major part of their business. And that's just one of the many reasons we are doing very well in the small and medium customer segment. We are extremely proud of the excellent service levels that we achieved this peak season, especially given the increase in volumes. The last 3 Mondays were some of the busiest days in the history of FedEx, including Cyber Monday where our volume crossed 32 million packages, more than double our average daily volume. We were able to deliver all of that volume with record service levels.","With that, I would like to take this opportunity to thank more than 450,000 team members around the world who are going above and beyond to deliver this home stretch of the holiday season.","Let me now turn the call over to Dave for his remarks. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Okay. Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon to everyone. We are very pleased with our peak service performance as Fred and Raj have already mentioned. I'd like to thank all of our team members all around the world, especially here in the middle of our peak season. My comments are focused on FedEx Express today, where trends worsened in the second quarter, primarily due to international revenue challenges, driven, of course, by international economic weakness. While international revenue was still growing, it is not growing at the rate we expected because of the overall global economic uncertainty that Raj just mentioned. Some of the largest economies in Europe are experiencing weakness. That is impacting our international business. Germany, for example, saw their GDP contract quarter-over-quarter in the third calendar quarter. Italy remains a drag on overall Eurozone growth. The unrest in France, and I was just there two weeks ago, continues to escalate and spread with yellow vest protest now inspiring similar actions in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and of course, throughout all of France. Also, the uncertainty of the United Kingdom with their Brexit issue.","Following TNT's recovery from the cyber attack, we have seen an accelerated shift of our product mix to more freight than parcel, putting pressure on our system, and of course, our costs. Continued tariff and trade concerns and uncertainty in Asia are impacting our business there as well. We continue to work with our customers as they reevaluate their supply chains.","As you just heard from Raj, the U.S. economy remains solid, and we are seeing strong growth in Express deferred package volume. Our TNT integration activities continue and are in full swing throughout Europe, throughout Asia and Latin America. Following the cyber attack, we accelerated the integration of our sales force by 1 full year and to date, approximately 70% of our global sales force has been integrated with the remainder to be completed at the end of this fiscal year. This will provide us a single point of contact for our customers, something they very much are looking forward to.","Further, we accelerated investments in our IT systems and infrastructure to strengthen and enhance and protect the systems we use to run our daily business. Our focus continues to be on keeping our customers at the very center of all of our efforts, while at the same time we are integrating our 2 global network businesses. The stations and countries that we have been integrating to date are primarily in smaller markets and represent approximately 30% of our combined volumes. The completion of the integration in these markets is indeed important, but synergy benefits have been limited given the relative size of the volumes we've integrated.","The remaining integration work is focused on our much larger, more complex, direct serve markets. Said differently, the countries that deliver most of the benefits are weighted to the later stages of the integration due to the complexities of their business. Our businesses are heavily dependent on IT solutions for the integration. For example, these require harmonizations of our services and then corresponding redesign of our multiple customer platforms, including, of course, fedex.com and our customer automation tools. Our original integration planning contemplated the long lead time required to build these IT solutions and accordingly, the benefits of these efforts would occur towards the end of the integration.","While changes in our revenue mix and softness in volume have impacted the timing of the realization of the financial benefits, we remain confident in the long-term value of the combination and synergies to be realized through a single pickup and delivery network, single air and road network, back-office efficiencies, and of course, mainly our revenue growth.","And now, I'll turn it over to Alan Graf to give more details.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave just outlined, since our last earnings release, Express experienced significant weakness in business conditions and a change in service mix, especially in Europe. For the second quarter, International Priority volumes were up 1%, while International Economy volumes increased 9%.","International Priority freight pounds were flat and International Economy freight pounds surged 16%. In the U.S., overnight package volumes were up 3%, while deferred package volumes increased 15%. These volume trends accelerated during the quarter and Express operating profit was significantly below our business plan in the first half of fiscal year '19. To address the shifts in our business conditions, we are implementing and accelerating several cost-reduction initiatives, both in the U.S. and internationally. These initiatives include a voluntary employee buyout program, capacity reductions primarily in international airline network, limited hiring and staff functions and reductions in discretionary spending.","In addition to these cost reductions, we will continue to improve our productivity through various programs, including expanding use of our technology and capitalizing on efficiencies available through the scale of our network as we integrate operations in Europe and gain market share at FedEx Ground. We had positive results from both Ground and Freight. The Ground segment operating income surged 18% to $586 million on an 8% volume increase and a 6% yield increase.","Despite the upfront costs associated with opening two major hubs and inflationary cost pressures, Ground's operating margin increased 40 basis points to 11.4%. Ground's profitability will increase as investment in our market-leading automation, coupled with large productivity initiatives, come online. We will provide more detail on our Ground strategic projects in the coming months.","Freight segment grew operating income 37% with shipments increasing 8% and yields up 6%. Operating margin was 7.7%, up 120 basis points. Cost-reduction initiatives, combined with continued profit improvements at Ground and Freight are expected to increase the long-term growth in corporate earnings and margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness.","Regarding our FY '19 outlook, we are projecting adjusted earnings of $15.50 to $16.60 per diluted share, down from $17.20 to $17.80. This lower guidance is due to a shift in business conditions and service mix at Express, primarily in Europe. We're no longer providing guidance for revenue growth and operating margin for FY '19. Voluntary buyout will be offered to eligible U.S. employees. Cost of this program are expected to total $450 million to $575 million and will be recognized primarily in fiscal year '19 with the remainder in fiscal year '20. This voluntary buyout will have estimated savings of $225 million to $275 million in FY '20.","We are also reviewing similar international opportunities. We are forecasting effective tax rate of 24% to 25% for FY '19 before year-end mark-to-market retirement plans, accounting adjustments. Our capital forecast remains $5.6 billion and we are reevaluating our capital spending going forward. We repurchased nearly $1.3 billion of our shares during the first half of this fiscal year, which has reduced our year-over-year share count.","As I mentioned, we are reviewing all aspects of our financial plans, including whether we will repurchase additional shares this year. As a reminder, we spent $11.6 billion, purchasing almost 76 million shares over the last 5.5 years, resulting in the nearly 18% reduction in outstanding shares.","During the remainder of 2019, we will continue to execute our TNT Express integration plans and will be focused on integrating the largest and most complex countries, which include the largest workforces and facilities. We continue to expect the aggregate integration program expense, including restructuring charges at TNT Express through 2020 to be approximately $1.5 billion and expect to incur approximately $450 million of these costs during 2019. However, based on the timing of the completion of integration activities, including any international voluntary employee buyout program, we may incur additional integration cost after 2020.","The timing and amount of integration expenses and capital investments in any future period may change as we continue to execute the integration of TNT. We expect to realize the benefits of the TNT acquisition that were anticipated when the company was acquired, although at a more moderate pace caused by reductions in base business levels due to increasing economic weakness during the second quarter and a change in service mix following the NotPetya cyber attack. As a result, we now expect the operating profit improvement goal of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion for Express over fiscal year '17 will not be realized in FY '20.","Before we begin to address your questions, I recognize there is great interest on when we expect to achieve the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion Express profit improvement and how much of it we will achieve in FY '20. At this stage, I'm not in a position to give an updated forecast for the reasons that my colleagues and I have mentioned. We are intensely working on further actions and plans to enable progress towards these goals. My hope is that I can give a directional perspective when we report our Q3 results. Like the rapid changes we have experienced, I'm confident that we will see improved operating earnings, margins and cash flow in FY '20 versus FY '19, assuming moderate U.S. domestic economic growth and no further weakening in international economic conditions. ","Now we'll turn the call over to Fred for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Fred Smith","Thank you, Alan. We've got a mix of questions that came in prior to the call and then some that came in after the 10-Q was put up. So I'll go back and forth between the 2 to try to be fair here. So first question, which I'll take. Over the next 5 to 10 years, what are the biggest competitive threats to each division, Express, Ground and Freight? This comes from Donald Broughton of Broughton Capital.","Donald, we don't see any large or certainly no existential competitive threats to any of the 3 major divisions at FedEx. We do however see enormous competitive opportunities and we have over many years taken market share and believe we have strategies in place that will allow us to expand the available or addressable market and to continue, given the considerations that Alan just mentioned to grow FedEx and to improve our profitability and margins and cash flows.","This question came in from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Ground margins have now expanded in 3 out of the last 4 quarters with the heavy investment phase of Ground behind you. Is it right to think about margin in this segment expanding on a consistent basis moving forward. Alan?","Alan Graf","Thank you, Jack. I think in my opening remarks I talked about how excited we are about where Ground is now and where Ground is heading. We'll have more to say about that in the months ahead, but I would say there are 2 things, in particular, as we build scale at Ground and continue to sweat the assets that we have more efficiently, we're reducing costs at a very nice clip on a per package basis compared that what they otherwise would have been, which is going to make us much more competitive in the Ground network. I would also say, the use of technology has helped us to become much better in terms of improving our densities and with scale and technology, and a continued improvement in density, will help drive Ground's operating margins up. I'm not going to give you a percentage, I just will tell you that, we believe, Ground has opportunity to improve its margins over the next several years.","Fred Smith","Here is a question from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. What is FedEx strategy for improving the quality of packages and revenue in the TNT FedEx Europe network? Does FedEx needs to cut price in order to attract premium packages back into its European network? Does FDX need to wait for the network integration to be complete before they can focus on share gain and volume growth in Europe? So I'm going to ask Dave Bronczek to take the first part of this question, but it just so happens that we have the President of FedEx Europe here this afternoon, Bert Nappier, and Dave will turn it over to him and you can hear it from the horse's mouth so to speak. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Okay. Thanks, Fred. Thanks, Tom for your question. I was just over in Europe and talking to the management team there. And of course, as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to grow. We continue to grow just not at the rate that we were hoping to grow, and of course, with the slowing economy that has affected our growth, but we're not shy of volume or growth. The reality is, however, that TNT when we bought that company they had a tremendous value proposition in their freight products and their specialty service. That actually is growing very nicely, very strong and for parcel part of the business, that, of course, is weaker for all of Europe. And so for us, that's our focus and I'll turn it over to Bert.","Herbert Nappier","Thanks, Dave. As Dave noted, the improvement of our revenue quality in Europe really is focused on the Express parcel side of the house. We are growing in that part of our business really and our strategy comes down to value proposition, as Dave outlined. We're focused on speeding up our European road network. We've got a very strong air network. We're making investments in key hub applications in Liege and Paris and when you combine that, we're really going back to our customers with a value proposition that we think is very competitive.","The economy has been a headwind in growing parcels, but what we have been able to do is grow deferred volume and freight volume very nicely. With the semi-integrated business, we're about halfway through and as we continue to integrate, you'll see the capabilities there that we need to grow in the future. So we can do what we're doing with the integration where it is and we'll only be better as we go forward.","Fred Smith","Okay. This is a question from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Have you seen any impact from Amazon Air, Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Ken, the short answer to that question is no. On the contrary, as you can see from our press release, our numbers do speak for themselves as we are seeing significant volume growth across our U.S. domestic parcel business.","Fred Smith","So I'll just take this for me. From a short and long-term perspective, what is FedEx' strategy to counter competition from Amazon? David Campbell of Thompson Davis. You know, I'm not really sure how to answer this question. I mean, we look at Amazon as a wonderful company in service and they're a good customer of ours. We don't see them as a peer competitor at this point in time for many reasons. We think it is doubtful that, that will be the case. So we have very strong strategies, well understood by the management team, the addressable markets that we deal with are growing. And as we've said over and over again, we've grown market share, particularly in the sectors we want to grow, there have been some sectors that we've chosen not to attack for a number of reasons and that can change from time to time.","So I don't know what I can say other than what I just said. I think the prospects of this company is going to be \"disrupted,\" which just occurs over and over again, to quote a previous statement is fantastical. So I'll leave it at that. Raj, could you comment on our new initiative with Walgreens and 1-day prescription delivery? Does this require any investments? What are the financial impacts?","Raj Subramaniam","Okay. Yes, for sure. Earlier this month, as you know, we announced with Walgreens, the nationwide launch of Walgreens Express, which is really a next-day prescription delivery service available at Walgreens locations. Now regarding the question on investment, we are simply leveraging the fact that our current FedEx Onsite retail alliance with Walgreens allows our existing operational flows in and out of those stores, and prescription deliveries will be executed by the same station making the pickup, which our Extra Hour Service now makes possible. So this is one of the -- one more example of how we are committed to increasing convenience, enhancing customer experience and really expanding our service offering for customers. And let me add, we're doing all this in a very, very cost-effective manner.","Fred Smith","I hope I hadn't given Tom Wadewitz two questions here. But if I have, he's a hell of an analyst. So he wants to know about the maintenance expense. How much of the Express maintenance expense in 2Q FY '19 was unusual? Is maintenance expense likely to remain elevated for the next several quarters, Alan?","Alan Graf","Tom, I'll try to help you out here and turn this into a strategic question, because it was an anomaly in the first half. When you're in this business, you have a big fleet like ours, you have timing issues from time to time and we had some timing issues in the first half. Second half, well, the comparisons will be almost flat year-over-year, but that's not the strategic question. The strategic question has to do with our continuing to replace our old aircraft with new and we are continuing to do that. We're checking the pace, but having said that, it's been an integral part of how we're able to continue to hold our cost. The maintenance aspects of new planes versus used planes is absolutely unbelievable, not just from a cost standpoint, but from a reliability standpoint. Our ops division is doing a fantastic job. It's making a big difference in peak to have these new aircraft out here who have dispatch reliability through the roof. So from a strategic standpoint, the maintenance cost is going to go down over time relatively to our revenues on our packages because of the newness factor.","Fred Smith","So there was a question for Raj here about his -- let me just read it, from Jack Atkins of Stephens. Raj, as you step into your new role, what are some of the immediate changes you expect to bring to the seat? And what are your first priorities for express?","Raj Subramaniam","Jack, thank you for the question. Obviously, very excited to be in this role and my first priority is really to focus on Europe, and where we have focused on integration and focused on positive change in Europe. Having said that, we're very thrilled with some of the new value that we are creating for our customers all across the board and look forward to continuing the growth of express in a profitable manner.","Fred Smith","As long as we got you on the phone, Raj, why don't you answer Christian Wetherbee's question from Citi, way up in the Northeast. Is the international express yield deterioration driven by missed changes at TNT or are there other factors affecting yield?","Raj Subramaniam","Well, Chris, the international yields are negatively impacted by exchange rates and product mix and, to some extent, region mix, those are the key factors.","Fred Smith","So here's a question from David Ross of Stifel, which I would normally give to Raj or Dave Bronczek, but I'm going to take it because it's -- the answer is pretty clear. For the Express changes, regarding international network capacity reductions, where are these taking place? Does it involve number of flights or facilities? Will they be permanent or temporary? So the answer to the question, David, is if I told you that we would have to come and kill you because it would be -- this is competitively sensitive. Obviously, we can't tell our competitors what we're going to do, but anything, you've got to recognize our networks are so big and the size of our Asia and our Pacific and our Asia to Europe and Europe to Asia networks are so extensive, we can take capacity up and down. So all kidding aside, Dave wants to jump in here. So don't tell him.","Dave Bronczek","No, I won't. I can tell you that, and I have said this many times in the past, our networks are so big and so flexible, we can go up and down. And obviously, some -- a quick example would be some of the traffic that's not flying on our Purple tails, right now we've consolidated. We would eliminate that cost, we'd put it on our Purple tails. I mean, there's good examples all over the world like that, but it's certainly true that the flexibility of our global fleet and our global network lets us go up and lets us go down.","Fred Smith","So Allison Landry of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. How much flexibility you have to throttle back to $5.6 billion CapEx budget, Alan?","Alan Graf","We had a lot of questions regarding CapEx and airplanes and everything. So thank you for the question, Allison. And I'll try to just consolidate it into one answer, and that is, obviously, we're looking at everything. I would point out -- and there's a reason I gave you the things I gave you in my overview to call out. I mean, all that information is in the press release and you could have found it later, but we're still carrying an awful lot of things and we're still growing in terms of pounds and packages. So we're off on our yields and a lot of that is macro. So we're still going to grow this company going forward. I don't -- I think we have the ability, as Fred and Dave both mentioned, to flex down if we have some real big meltdown. We don't think we are going to have that happen, but we could certainly do it.","As far as our planned acquisitions and our CapEx, we have some big projects underway, Indianapolis and Memphis hubs, and we've got an order book of aircraft, and we're looking at that, but we need those things for the long-term. And as Fred mentioned, we're planning for the next 25 years. And the technology that comes with those expansions and the technology that comes on the airplanes and the reliability are vital to us. So it's a balancing act. It's going to be a little bit tougher this year. We probably will slow some things down to see what happens. But at the end of the day, we still need to move forward with the majority of the programs that we've got in place.","Fred Smith","So this is a question from Lee Klaskow of Bloomberg Intelligence. I'm going to give it to Dave Bronczek because he lived for many years overseas and in Europe and then in Canada. Is it culturally harder to have employees outside of the U.S. to volunteer for these buyout programs? You take it Dave, and maybe Mark wants to add something to it as well.","Dave Bronczek","No, Fred, it's not. And I've been offshore half of my career, quite frankly, and the people over there are the same as people here. They want opportunity, they want diversity, they want a chance to grow with the company. On the other hand, they want our people philosophy. And part of our people philosophy is, if you have a voluntary buyout, they can voluntarily move forward to do it. I think that it's going to be well received. Alan and Fred didn't mention it in their comments, but we are looking at a global part to the voluntary buyout. And of course, part of it was originally planned in the TNT integration. This is beyond that, this is much more than that. This is, of course, Europe and it's all around the world. So I think, that it is part of our culture, our company's culture that our employees actually like very much.","Fred Smith","So there is another question from Tom Wadewitz from UBS about the air network. I think we've answered that, that there is lots of flexibility in it. We don't want to give details about the percentage moved in the Purple tails and the -- that moved in underbelly. Suffice it to say, our Purple tail network is scheduled, so it provides unmatched service. And obviously, with the lower yielding less service-sensitive business, we have the option either to put it on our planes or put it on other carriers until we build up enough density to put another flight on the network. That's the way the system works, but it's not in our best interest to go into further detail about that because of competitive interest. There are a couple more questions on Amazon Air, one from Dan Ronan of Transport Topics. What concerns does FedEx have regarding the recent expansion by Amazon Air at Northern Kentucky, Rockford International and Alliance Airport, Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Well, Dan, as we've talked about before, we don't have any concerns. And so far as you can see, our volumes in the domestic networks are continuing to increase, and we value Amazon as a good customer of ours. Thank you.","Fred Smith","I think it's also important to recognize, and again, there is a significant misunderstanding, the Amazon Air network is set up to move inventory within the Amazon system, which is prodigious. It's big, it moves not in stock and low-turn SKUs and forward stocked items for their third-party customers, who can't duplicate inventory every place. So it's scheduled differently than FedEx or UPS's system. There is a very good analysis of this that came out from David Vernon of Bernstein. So I'd recommend people that are interested in that to read that. The -- let's see, there was -- I mean, take some of the questions that came in earlier. Scott Group of Wolfe Research. International volumes were up 5% year-over-year and international yields were flat. So it didn't seem to be an issue with volumes, but one of bad pricing and bad mix. Do you think the mix issues are company-specific related to TNT or macro driven? I think Dave wants to say something about this and then Alan can top it off.","Dave Bronczek","I'll go ahead and start. There is no question about the fact that I mentioned -- made in my comments that one of the things that TNT really did very well, and we continue to do well with TNT inside FedEx, is the freight product and their specialty freight product. So after the cyberattack that product came booming back because no one is better than we are in that product. So that product, of course, has a little bit different mix, a little bit different cost structure to it. We're focusing on our parcels as well. As you pointed out, the questioner pointed out, our volumes are growing, they're just not growing as fast as what we would like them to grow. And with the economy being depressed somewhat, we're still dealing with that. But that's the point, we're still focused on parcel and freight and we're still growing.","Alan Graf","And this came on us fast -- this as Alan. This came on us fast -- this mix change, and so we can adjust and we will. And one of the great things about promoting our head pricing guy to a P&L, I see now he cares a whole lot more about yields at express than he did in the past. So I'm sure that he's going to be on breed to make sure that we get the mix back right.","Fred Smith","Yes. We've got some interesting things underway in the pallet or the freight business. We'll tell you more about in calendar 2019. But I think, to some degree, it's our success in attacking the pallet business that is creating the problem. I mean, we've been aggressive in this area and it's growing in some of the more traditional areas where we have a higher market share. It's been affected by the macroeconomic issues that has created this mix issue. But we'll have a lot more to say about it in March and June. I know that's difficult for people that follow the earnings of companies on a quarterly basis to acquiesce. I am sorry, we can't be more precise on that, but been hard for to bear it as the so-called tensed talks between U.S. and China following the conclusion of the G20 Summit earlier this month produced any meaningful improvement in customers' volume growth expectations in 2019, particularly during the first half of the calendar year. If not, does your updated 2019 guidance assume a particularly weak February-March international volume environment during and following the Lunar New Year. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Again, at this point, given what we know, we are assuming that the current softness that we're seeing continues into the New Year, and that's what we -- as you know, our guess. And if that changes, we'll update you in our next quarterly call.","Fred Smith","So Raj, as long as we got you at bat, what magnitude of increase in post office pricing is needed to materially affect private carriers pricing power?","Raj Subramaniam","I don't want to particularly comment on the pricing decisions of other carriers. I will just reiterate the broad point that we have made in previous conference calls that the cost of Last Mile delivery will continue to go up in the years to come.","Fred Smith","Let me just add something to that. It's a particular pique of mine. Many of the observers of this industry continued to misrepresent the total package market by double counting the postal packages, many of which are given to them for direct injection by FedEx SmartPost, UPS SurePost and Amazon Direct injection. So that is the so-called Parcel Select service, which has been in place since 1997. It was originally designed for only items that could be placed in a mailbox, if you go back and research it. And that could be put in one of the right-hand jeep delivery vehicles.","Of course, the postal service has expanded that. And as e-commerce has grown, the packages have gotten large, which has created this own set of dynamics inside the Postal Service. So many times, you'll see while FedEx is going to handle this many packages for peak, UPS is going to handle these many packages for peak, and the Postal Service is going to handle these many packages for peak, a lot of the postal packages are actually FedEx SmartPost and FedEx SurePost. Now that's not the case, though -- UPS SurePost, my pardon, excuse me, now that's not the case for priority mail, of course, which is a postal service end-to-end product or first-class package service, which was introduced a year ago, as I recall, it was moved a package product that was previously in the regulated noncompetitive sector over into the competitive sector to give the Postal Service more pricing freedom. Those are like the small kraft packaging, you get prescription drugs and\/or small cosmetics or vitamins or something like that.","So this is not well reported and it's something for people who follow the industry to be careful about. The Postal Service, put it different way, as we've said many times, has very little in the way of upstream network capabilities. And so when people talk about the industry as FedEx, UPS and the Postal Service, it leaves out that significant issue of the postal services network capabilities. So Dave Bronczek, did FedEx win any LTL business when a competitor declined to accept shipments for a brief period recently, Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar?","Dave Bronczek","Let me just answer the question by saying that we always look in terms of how we can handle the customer if we have extra capacity. In this case, when one of our competitors was having some difficulty, we did, and we moved it in our network because we knew we could provide outstanding service. So our FedEx freight team did a great job of handling that. In that case, we did take that part of the business. I do want to go back, Fred, if it's okay with you to a question earlier about China that Raj answered.","It is true that our customers are talking to us daily about possibilities of weakness, softening in China just potentially for the future. And the good news for us, with our customers, is we have such a broad array of our portfolio between our ocean, between deferred shipping, our express, of course, shipping, so we've been talking to our customers. There is a concern out there that has been raised. We've been able to talk to our customers about any number of different possibilities keeping the business inside FedEx that I wanted to make that extra point, Fred.","Fred Smith","Excellent. Let me go back to question from Donald Broughton of Broughton Capital. And I'll ask Raj to speak to this. With TNT solidifying your position in Europe, are there plans to expand this service offerings in Asia or is the next great opportunity somewhere else, Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Well, Donald Broughton, Dave has talked a lot about Europe. So -- but outside of Europe, TNT has fantastic ground networks in Middle East, in Asia, in Latin America. And when you combine those networks with FedEx's unmatched intercontinental air system, we now have a unique network that allows us to offer new value to our customers in a very, very cost-effective manner. And this allows us to now target multiple large international market segments, and we are very well positioned to expand these service offerings, including Asia as you point out. For instance, the largest air cargo lane in the world is Asia to Europe. With the capabilities that we just talked about, we are now extremely well positioned to win in this market segment that I just talked about.","Fred Smith","Let me add to Raj's comments, I was down in Southeast Asia recently, Raj happened to be with me, and I think he will agree the Southeast Asian road network we have has just unmatched our position in Singapore. We have a wonderful regional hub there that's among the most productive in the FedEx system. We just began a flight from Singapore down to Sydney and they were doing extremely well, our sales and marketing people have done a great job, putting that capacity on. So we have, as I have said earlier, strategic plans where we think we can attack a larger express addressable market and can grow FedEx even in a low-growth environment now.","As we've said repeatedly today, obviously, when you have a change that comes on you as fast as this did, it's hard to react to it. But I have a very timely question in that regard from Helane Becker of Cowen. It said over the next 5 years, is it possible that while the rhetoric from politicians continues to be protection focused, companies will ignore it and continue to grow internationally. So let me answer that question from a broader perspective. The most important thing that is different about today than has ever been true in the history of the world is billions of people, and more being added every day are equipped with a personal order entry device, a mobile telephone. And you can now access the goods of the world and see them, compare shop and with the services we provide, you can get the landed cost of the item from FedEx CrossBorder and have it delivered in 1 to 2 business days to virtually any business or any person on the planet. That's never been the case before.","And so you have this tremendous bottom-up business ecosphere today that we're right in the middle of, and I think the profundity of that will, in the end, create the demand on an ongoing basis just like it has been for time immemorial for human beings wanting to travel and trade. This type of bottom-up commerce is completely changing the politics, for instance, in Africa and in parts of Latin America, which often had been politically mismanaged, but now people are not as dependent on the patriarchal or the corrupt political class. This is very, very important. And I'll just conclude by saying, most of the issues that we are dealing with today are induced by bad political choices. I mean, making a bad decision about a new tax, creating tremendously difficult situation with Brexit, the immigration crisis in Germany, the mercantilism and state owned enterprise initiatives in China, the tariffs that the United States put in unilaterally. So you just go down the list, and they're all things that have created macroeconomic slowdown.","The good news is, with the change in policy, they could turn it around pretty quick too. So fundamentally, we think trade will continue to grow. We have a question here about stocking. No question, lot of stocking took place across the Pacific in advance of the 1st of January. And so, as Alan I think mentioned, I mean, we're rig for silent running here on the submarine. We think that the first quarter will see some ripple effects of that. But China is a manufacturing powerhouse. Just looking today's Wall Street Journal, this fantastic groups of charts that show that. So I think hopefully, the political folks will get it right and trade growth will resume. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but you can't just give a pithy one-liner and realize what our perspective is without talking about it in greater depth. Here is some question from Helane about the market share on the TNT cyberattack. I think we covered that -- did adequately, no? Any more.","Okay. All right. So I hope that was adequate for you, Helane. Raj, talk a bit about the large structural shifts you've observed in B2B and B2C shipping patterns over the past 3 to 5 years? And how do you feel the business is prepared to respond to these dynamics going forward, Todd Fowler, KeyBanc?","Raj Subramaniam","Thanks, Todd. The first thing I want to mention here is that roughly 75% of our business is driven by B2B transactions. And our infrastructure and value proposition we put in place over the last 40-plus years, they stand us in very, very good stead as we continue to reliably serve our customers. And having said that, as you all know, the e-commerce market continues to grow roughly 3x to 4x the pace of traditional retail. And for instance, just in this quarter, calendar quarter 2018, e-commerce sales grew 14.5% year-over-year in the U.S., and that drives a lot of innovation for companies like us as we leverage our existing infrastructure to create even more value for our customers.","And again, it should be noted that the core offerings that we have, FedEx Home Delivery, FedEx SmartPost and others are integral to our e-commerce, and we are building on that strong foundation to enhance our retail infrastructure, to launch new services like FedEx Extra Hours, FedEx Fulfillment, and so on. And it should be noted that more than 80% of our U.S. population is now within 5 miles of FedEx hold location. We are also making great progress on the digital front with FedEx Delivery Manager, which I mentioned earlier. Also on a global basis, once again, we are leveraging our core or unparalleled network. There is a lot of focus on the last mile, but don't forget the first few thousand miles. When you combine our network with the FedEx CrossBorder solutions, you can quickly see how we are becoming a force in the fast-growing CrossBorder e-commerce space as well.","Fred Smith","Let me take one real quick here. Have you seen any manufacturing move out of China to other Asian countries in light of the tariffs, Kevin Sterling of Seaport? Kevin, when I was out in Asia a few weeks ago, there is a lot of talk about that. And they're on definitely some significant growth in Vietnam and Thailand and Indonesia, but China is working very hard to go upstream on the value chain, which, again, the charts in today's Wall Street Journal show. So I don't think there is going to be any wholesale move to manufacturing out of China, and I don't think it could be done even if people wanted to do it, but markets adjust over time. So we do see it along the lines of that I just mentioned to you. So Matthew Reustle of Goldman Sachs wants to know, can you please differentiate the drivers to your 2019 EPS cut, is it entirely macro to what you attribute to higher growth and lower-yielding products? Alan?","Alan Graf","I think we talked about this quite a bit. Let me just maybe cap it off by saying that the reduction in the range for this year is entirely macro, it's entirely express and it's entirely revenue. It came on as fast we're going to adjust to it, make it back up. During the second quarter, as I mentioned, Freight and Ground performed admirably. Both those entities are continuing to improve their margins. They're taking advantage of technology and scale. You're going to keep hearing more about this. Very excited for those 2 entities about what's ahead for them. So we'll get back on track here, but we want to make sure you understood exactly what happened and the differences between now and where we were at the September call.","Fred Smith","So Dave Bronczek, please discuss the expected benefits from the decision to lease about 900 electric trucks in the long-term? What percentage of the fleet could be electric, why is leasing versus owning them preferred? Todd Fowler, KeyBanc.","Dave Bronczek","Okay. Great, thank you, Todd, for the question. Of course, we're always looking for ways to improve our sustainability and efficiency in all of our vehicles, whether they're on-the-road vehicles or in the hubs. In this case, we've worked with Ryder, and Ryder actually is a risk mitigator for us, quite frankly. More than 3% of our fleet in the United States will be electric. We hope it's more than that. So far, the tests are coming in very favorably. So I think, for all the reasons that you would suspect, the carbon emissions, the fuel savings, the efficiencies, it's proving to be very good so far for us.","Fred Smith","So let me add to that 2 things: one, part of the rationale for this acquisition is that this is required by California regulations; and second, these are Chinese vehicles. Chanje is, I think, the way we pronounce the manufacturer name. They look to be terrific. You need to recognize that China by-law requires all large, heavy public vehicles to become electric in the next few years. So they are the market leader in buses around the world. In the automotive sector, not so much success, but in these heavier vehicles, so we're very excited about getting these Chanje vehicles into the fleet. As Dave said, it was a good way to do it for us, Chanje and Ryder. Let's go to Raj, from Jairam Nathan of Daiwa. As automation levels increase across the industry, operating leverage increases as well, how do you think it affects pricing discipline among industry players over the long term?","Raj Subramaniam","Jairam, I'm not sure how best to answer that question other than to say that our pricing environment continues to be competitive, but rational. And it's hard to predict how it's going to evolve, but I expect it to remain rational in the very -- in the near future.","Fred Smith","So Raj now we've got you on deck, let me squeeze a couple of answers -- additional answers out of you. So please discuss the progress of FedEx Supply Chain within FedEx Trade Networks, Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","Raj Subramaniam","Thanks, Scott. We are making very good progress in FedEx Supply Chain. We have brought in both very strong FedEx and external leadership to the organization and a renewed focus on growing the business, and that's paying the dividends already, with a number of new customer wins and also a very healthy pipeline for future opportunities. At the same time, we're also standardizing our offerings and driving efficiencies in the business, which will improve our profitability.","Fred Smith","So keep swinging here, Raj. Do you have plans to expand same-day offering beyond your current 30-city footprint? Kevin Sterling of Seaport.","Raj Subramaniam","Actually, Kevin, the same-day city is currently offered in 33 U.S. markets, covering 1,800 cities and it is used by customers as a crucial tool in their business for an increasingly diverse set of industries. I want you to be aware, they are health care, retail, business services, manufacturers and so on. And it plays an important part in the e-commerce suite of services that we offer as shippers particularly respond to the uniform professionalism of our business model, and we are very happy with the way the daily volume is growing. It's growing at a healthy rate and we expect to continue the growth rate in 2019.","Fred Smith","So David Vernon asked, are ISPs seeing any increased cost pressure as competition for labor heats up? Is there any difference in the rate of inflation linehaul -- between linehaul and pickup and delivery? Alan?","Alan Graf","Thanks for the question, David. Let me just say that our ISPs are great. They do an unbelievable job. We're very proud to be their partners. Certain markets are experiencing some higher labor costs due to increased competition for people, and it affects the service providers, both linehaul and pickup and delivery, as it does any other business. So they're one of the many factors that we take into consideration. Each ISP agreement is unique and negotiated, and we -- as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we do have some inflationary pressures at ground, but because of their great productivity and technology, they're overcoming those and driving the margins up.","Fred Smith","So Dave Bronczek, please describe any similarities, dissimilarities you are witnessing between the current environment in your FedEx Freight business versus the prior peak period, Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. David?","Dave Bronczek","Thanks, Scott, for your question. John Smith and his FedEx freight team have done a fabulous job. Our peak right now is booming. As Alan mentioned, we're up 8% year-over-year. Revenue is almost the same, total revenue. So the pounds are way up. I would tell you that in spite of the pounds and in spite of the volumes, in my -- we have a daily call with my operating President, that'll be mad when I say this, our service levels have never ever been higher in Express, in Ground and in Freight. So there is a lot of similarities from peak to nonpeak even though our volumes are very strong.","Fred Smith","So we've got 2 more questions here, are the ones that have been given to be. So if you've got any problems with, we didn't get your question, get after Mickey Foster, not me or Dave or Alan or Raj. So there is a question from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. How has the pilot program for heavy home good deliveries progressed so far? If expanded, would this service take packages shipped with FedEx or would it be incremental volume? Let me just say this before I ask Raj to weigh in on this. It's important, people in this call, understand there is the oversized market and there is the heavy hard-to-handle market.","Oversized market is basically handled by FedEx Ground where there has been, over the last 5 or 6 years, a substantial growth in that sector and Ground is responding to that by doing some unique things with sortation, automated robotics that handle these types of things. You're going to hear a lot more about it. On the heavy hard-to-handle items and, Brian, this is for both business and residential, not just one, these are items that require a dock height truck, a liftgate, dollies to move it and they generally require movement over the threshold into the office of the building. We've just started offering that as a FedEx Freight product, FedEx Freight Direct, and you'll hear a lot more about it. But Raj will give you the state of play here.","Raj Subramaniam","Yes. As Fred mentioned here, the heavy hard-to-handle goods market is one of the fastest-growing segments in the e-commerce and it represents roughly a $10 billion market opportunity. And the customer response to FedEx entering the market has been quite positive and it'll represent a new revenue stream for us as we go forward.","Fred Smith","All right, Raj, this is a cleanup question here because I don't want any complaints about anybody on this call that we didn't answer any question that you might have fully. How do you see the push towards 1 day shipping by the e-tailers affecting capacity? Can the USPS handle Last Mile Delivery for 1 day shipping growth or does it fall on FedEx and UPS? Jairam Nathan of Daiwa.","Raj Subramaniam","Thanks, Jairam, for the question. I can't answer what the USPS might do or anybody else, but I can just say that the push is no surprise for us, and we are well prepared not only the impact of capacity, but also the cost to serve. The global infrastructure, the technology, the capabilities, the knowledge that we have to compete in this business is quite extraordinary as we leverage off our base to build. Now you asked specifically about e-tailers, but I also want to make a quick comment on traditional retailers. When you combine the store infrastructure of retailers with our logistics infrastructure, it allows retailers to offer compelling value proposition for orders received late in the day, and the launch of our FedEx Extra Hours is clearly a very, very positive step in this regard.","Mickey Foster","So, thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions about FedEx, thank you.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.","Mickey Foster","Good morning, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I would like to remind everyone that our Investors and Lenders Meeting will be held here in Memphis on Tuesday and Wednesday, October 9 and 10. Therefore, we ask that you please save your cost reduction and profit improvement questions, which we will cover in great detail for the October meeting.","The first quarter earnings release and our statistical supplement book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being broadcast from our website, and the replay and podcast will be available for approximately 1 year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media.

Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. Following my remarks, Mike Glenn will highlight our views on the economy, and Alan Graf will detail our financial results and outlook.","In the quarter just ended, while FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight improved their profitability in the first quarter, the slowdown in the global economy and global trade constrained revenue growth at FedEx Express and affected overall earnings. We have significant efforts under way to reduce cost in the Express segment, some of which we'll talk about today and all of which we'll talk about in detail at our Investors and Lenders Meeting on 9 and 10 of October, and we hope most of you can come to that meeting.","Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn.","T. Michael Glenn","Thank you, Fred. On the economic front, we continue to see modest growth in the global economy. Our calendar year '12 U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2.2% and 1.9% for calendar year '13, which is 0.5 points lower than our fourth quarter earnings forecast. For industrial production, we expect a growth of 4.2% in calendar year '12, slightly below last quarter, and 3% in calendar year '13, 0.5 points lower than our fourth quarter forecast. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar '12 and 2.7% for calendar '13, 0.3 points lower than our last call.","Turning to yield and revenue management, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield increased over 4.4%. The increase was driven by pricing and rate discount improvement, followed by favorable service and customer mix changes. The Ground package yield increased 3.6%, excluding the impact to fuel. Year-over-year increase was driven by lift and discount improvements, followed by an increase in extra services charges.","Excluding fuel, International package yield declined 2.3% year-over-year due to the impact of exchange rate. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, FedEx rate yield per hundredweight increased 2.4% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by pricing rate changes.","And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan B. Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. For FedEx Corporation, revenues and operating income increased slightly in the first quarter due to improved profitability at FedEx Freight, the strong performance at FedEx Ground and partially offset by the impact of reduced demand for priority services at FedEx Express. Revenues increased 3% to $10.8 billion primarily due to yield increases, which Mike discussed, and higher volumes at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Our EPS closed at $1.45 per share, which was a little better than we anticipated 2 weeks ago, slightly down year-over-year due to the tough global economy.","Looking at Ground, revenues increased 8% to $2.5 billion as a result of yield and volume growth at FedEx Ground and volume growth at FedEx SmartPost. Average daily volume at FedEx Ground increased 5% to 3.9 million packages per day due to market share gains, resulting from continued growth in our commercial business and our FedEx Home Delivery service.","FedEx SmartPost volumes grew 18% to 1.7 million packages per day as a result of growth in e-commerce. Ground operating income increased 9% to $445 million due to yield and package volume growth, and operating margin improved year-over-year to 18.1%.","Turning to Express, although Express revenues increased, operating income and margin decreased due to declining U.S. domestic package volumes, the demand shift toward lower-yielding International Economy services and increased depreciation and employee benefits expenses, which more than offset significant ongoing cost containment activities.","Recent acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations affected both revenue and expense but had little net impact on operating income for the quarter. Fuel costs decreased 8% during the first quarter due to decreases in the average price per gallon of jet fuel and lower aircraft fuel usage. Based on a static analysis of the net impact of year-over-year charges in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges, fuel had virtually no impact to operating income at Express in the first quarter.","Despite lower U.S. domestic package volumes and unfavorable exchange-rate impact and lower fuel surcharge revenue, Express revenues did increase 1% due to the impact of new acquisitions, U.S. domestic package yield growth, growth in our Freight forwarding business at FedEx trade networks and higher international export package volumes. U.S. domestic package volumes decreased 5% due to weak economic conditions resulting in reduced demand for our services. Meanwhile, international domestic revenues increased 49% due to recent business acquisitions.","In order to increase transparency, we have provided the details for priority versus economy package for international and collectively refer to them as international export. You'll be able to see that International Priority volume fell 2%, while International Economy grew 13% year-over-year. This trade-down has been hurting our Express margins.","Looking at Freight, revenues increased 5% to $1.4 billion as a result of higher average daily less-than-truckload shipments and yields. Average daily LTL shipments increased 4% due to market share gains as customer demand increased for our economy service offering. Priority volumes were flat, while Economy increased 12%. As a result of the increase in average daily LTL shipments, LTL yield growth and ongoing efficient improvements -- efficiency improvements in our integrated network, Freight's operating income increased an impressive 114%, and operating margin increased 320 basis points to 6.4%.","Also new this quarter, we have provided details for Freight's Priority and Economy yields, which show that our composite LTL yield grew 2% while our economy yield grew 10%.","Turning to the outlook and looking ahead, we're expecting earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.45 for the second quarter and have lowered our guidance for the year to $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share. This guidance assume weaker economic growth in the economy than we had expected when we first gave you guidance for FY '13, as Mike described earlier.","We are taking significant actions to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and adjust our networks to match anticipated demand. These actions and opportunities build on the actions taken in 2012 and during the first quarter, including our recent announcement to implement a voluntary buyout plan and decisions to retire certain aircraft and modernize our fleet at Express. We have a very strong cash position, especially after our $1 billion debt issuance in July at historically low interest rates for the company. Half of those funds were from our first 30-year bond offering in over 2 decades at 3.875%, and the other half was from our 10-year bond offering at 2.625%.","During the first quarter, we paid a little over $500 million in cash for our acquisitions in Poland, France and Brazil. Out of our cash from operations, we paid $972 million for capital expenditures and repaid $300 million of unsecured notes at 9.65% in June. We also repurchased 2.7 million shares of FedEx common stock for $246 million.","We look forward to seeing you here in Memphis at our October Investors and Lenders Meeting, where we will discuss our cost reduction and profit initiatives in very great detail. I'm sure you will enjoy the time spent with us.","And now, we will open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So I wanted to ask you about how you think international trends will develop the next couple of quarters. You seem to be cutting the guidance for the full year fairly aggressively relative to what seems to be about a 0.5-percentage-point cut in your overall economic view. So I'm wondering if you can give us some more thoughts on what your assumptions are within International and how you think that the, I guess, the trade-down effect will take place, if that's going to be a continuing issue going forward and if that's part of the reason that your guidance has come down as much as it has.","David J. Bronczek","Tom, this is Dave Bronczek. I'll start off, then Mike Glenn will add some color to it. First, on the International numbers, and I think it was appropriate that we split them out now. And I already talked about the International Priority and the deferred, the economy, you can see sort of what happened in our mix shift, a 2% down in our very high, very profitable International Priority packages. And a dramatic increase, 13% in deferred, that actually grew and drove our linehaul per -- the pounds went up 4% this quarter. So we're taking a hard look at it, and you'll see some of the decisions we've made on moving some of our traffic on the ocean through FTN, our customers have talked to us about that. Putting the right freight in the right networks. We're very pleased that the customers are talking to us about their package content, their high-tech customers, and in terms of their value per pound and their shipments so that we make sure we get the right network for the right customer at the right price for the right profit. So yes, we were a little bit surprised that the International deferred package volume went up so much, and it drove some of our linehaul an increase of 4% in our pounds. But that's a good thing as we adjust our network.","T. Michael Glenn","Tom, I'd just add that when we see weakness in the economy, not unlike what happens in the United States, we see a shift from our Premium Services in the Priority network to deferred services to take advantage of lower transit times and lower rates. That's just one way that customers manage their supply chains in difficult economic conditions, so I think that's what we're seeing.","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me weigh in here, Tom. I mean, fundamentally, what's happening is that exports around the world have contracted, and the policy choices in Europe and the United States and China are having an effect on global trade. Global trade has grown faster than GDP, except for the 2000, 2001 meltdown and 2008 and 2009, for 25 years. And over the last few months, that has not been the case. So that's what's really going on, is that exports and trade have gone down at a faster rate than GDP has.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Justin Yagerman.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So piggybacking here on Tom's question a little bit, I'm just trying to reconcile the outlook. I understand that over the last quarter and over the last several quarters, we've seen this contraction. But what we're hearing in the tech and telecom world is about all of these different product launches: Windows 8, iPhone 5, iPad Mini, if that gets released in the back half. These should be all high-value, high-priority goods. I guess the big question is whether or not there's demand there for it. Your guidance would imply that there really isn't and that we're not going to see that pickup in the International Priority side of things, where you really get that margin expansion. Is that what you're hearing from your customers? Is that just based on a gut feel right now? Can you give us a little bit of insight into why you think this big step down as we head into what should otherwise be a fairly productive time of year?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, let me elaborate on what I said just a moment ago. I mean, systemically, the policy choices that have been made in Europe and the United States and China are having effect on world trade. The episodial product launches that you refer to, we've been talking about for 2 years. And we are carrying a huge amount of that traffic, but it is episodial. At the same time that you have that going on, you have a declining value per pound. In a lot of electronic equipment, you have fuel going up, partially in response to the quantitative easing.  I mean, as the Fed puts more money out there, people put more money into commodities and drive the price up. So you have products that are getting lower in value per pound, which is the key correlation for goods being moved by air. And so they're going on the water to an improved container liner system that's been developed over the last few years. So you've got a lot of things that are going on there, and the product launch of Apple's and Microsoft is not going to provide the type of sustained growth in the international trade that the world has seen historically. So when that turns back around I think is directly related to the economic macro system in Europe, North America and particularly in China.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann from William Blair & Co.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk just -- and follow up on that a little bit, maybe, Fred.  I mean, what's your long-term view of global trade and the opportunities to get that going again? And I understand all the near-term policy issues and obviously fully agree with that, and those are big headwinds. But what do you think in terms of the long-term opportunities to get that going again, and how do you think of global trade and then the investments kind of long term?","Frederick W. Smith","I think that, that remains to be seen. I mean, the global trading economy is still the largest single economy in the world. But over the last several months, particularly as we went into this fiscal year, it's been disappointing, and I think it's reflective of the low growth in the United States. You've got contraction going on in Europe. And because of North America and Europe, China's export economy, which has been driven by the consumer economies in the United States, North America and Europe, are reflected in the lower trade numbers. So I think until some of these macro issues get resolved, you'll see the relatively low international trade numbers. Now having said that, we're actually taking market share. We'll talk about this at the October 9 and 10 meeting. We're taking market share in the intercontinental trading area. The problem is, as Dave pointed out, the mix of traffic, the configuration of our networks was set on one set of assumptions, and those have turned out to be correct. So you'll see at the October 9 and 10 meeting, where we have a significant initiative under way in Express to take huge amounts of money out of the Express networks, reflecting what I just told you about.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Ross from Stifel, Nicolaus.","J. Bruce Chan - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","This is actually Bruce Chan on for David Ross. I just wanted to change gears a little bit and talk about Freight. You all did a nice job there. Your margins were certainly better than we expected, and it looks like much of that came from progress on the expense side, although maybe revenue per hundredweight was a little bit less than what we had assumed. I'm wondering if you can comment on the yield environment. Are you seeing any softening there of the pricing momentum that carriers seem to have been enjoying up till now, or is that somewhat of a mix effect or an issue with the composite economy and priority figure?","T. Michael Glenn","I think our sales team is doing an outstanding job balancing the traffic growth levels and yield improvement in the Freight sector. Yields in any one quarter are impacted by a variety of issues. Since a tremendous amount of the traffic is contract-based, we deal with contracts that come up during any given quarter, and so we have an opportunity to influence different amounts of traffic during any given quarter. There's also some mix issues there. We saw strong growth in the Economy segment and not as much in the Priority segment, but we're really pleased with the job that our sales team is doing managing yields in the Freight segment.","William J. Logue","Bruce, this is Bill. Let me jump in for a second. Again, as Mike said, we're very pleased with our quarter. I mean, volume was up 4% all up, yield up 2%. A lot of the focus we have is on making sure that as -- the customer's embracing our new offering in choice, and that's clear. And our objective is to make sure that whether customer picks a priority or economy shipment in any length of haul, that we'll be profitable. So very focused, and a lot of our -- we made a lot of changes back in July on our network design, and it's all designed for that. So as far as the quarter, we're very happy about it. The yield is a -- as Mike said, is a very important focus for us, and the sales team is doing a nice job of managing the environment out there. And as far as the pricing environment, again, I think it's rational, and we're very focused on them.","Operator","And our next mission comes from Helane Becker from Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","So just to understand something with respect to the lower growth and the GDP outlook and so on and so forth, does this in any way change your thought process about international expansion? I mean, I think one of the big things is the revenue growth you saw with some of the recent acquisitions, would this in any way change that?","David J. Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek. No, thanks for the question, though, Helane. No, we're actually adding some super express freighters in October and November, one out of Taipei that gives our customers there 2.5 hours of later service and cutoffs for them into North America and into Europe and actually another one that starts in October out of Munich that comes up into Milan and directly heads into our hub here in Memphis. So our customers continue to see great value and great service, and we keep adding more and more traffic. As we pointed out before, the shift has been different, so we're going to spend a lot of time with you on October talking about our international network and how it redesigns around the mix and the product types that we have going forward so that we're much more profitable while we gain more volume and more business.","Frederick W. Smith","I should add, though, that those super express freighters Dave talked about are not additions of capacity. They are changed routings in order to take advantage of the 777's nonstop capabilities and give our customers better value. And going back to the question about Apple and Microsoft and so on, these product launches, a part of what Dave is saying to you, we manage that by adding extra sections and extra capacity. So we have been very reluctant in the recent past to add scheduled capacity and meet these requirements with variable capacity. And that's probably going to be the case for the foreseeable future. I mean, we'll probably put up very little incremental schedule capacity. And Dave, you might want to add to that.","David J. Bronczek","No, that's right, Fred. And of course, our FedEx Trade Networks organization is becoming very, very successful at bundling the customers' products, and a lot more traffic is moving on the ocean now in our same technology, great value-added service. So we'll talk a lot about all of these initiatives that we have going forward. I think you'd be very pleased with how profitable our International divisions around the world become.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay, we've got -- Mickey gave me some e-mail questions from Ken Hoexter. Let me give Dave Rebholz one of these.","Where do you see Ground margins trending from here? If volumes and pricing continue on this path, can they operate at a 20% level?","David F. Rebholz","This is Dave. Clearly, our goal is to be moving towards 20-plus percent. We see an expanded growth of our product across all product lines that we have, both Ground, Home and SmartPost. We feel that we have the right cost structure in place to be able to manage through that process. Each and every quarter is a different set of circumstances, but quite frankly, I think we've proven to you that we're fairly consistent and we're very successful at producing the kind of financial returns. And as we continue to gain market share, I have nothing but very positive and very comfortable feelings as we move forward to achieve the goals that have been set out for us.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ben Hartford from Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about yield expectations in the International Express segment, kind of paying mind to the fact that capacity utilization among the more heavyweight air freight providers still appears to be pressured.  Capacity has come out of the market, but as you guys have talked about, volume is weak, and as we understand, there's going to be some capacity redeployment potentially into these lanes as well. So can you talk a little bit about what the expectations are for the yield dynamics in that segment over the course of the next couple of quarters?","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. I think the main thing is our goal is to strike the right balance between yield improvement and volume growth to maximize the operating profit within each segment of our business. The main issue that has put pressure on yields in the International segment is the mix shift that Dave talked about earlier, where we're seeing strong growth in our deferred services and a slight decline in our priority services. Obviously, as the economy remains weak, it is tougher to grow those Premium Services in our -- in the priority network. So we'll have to manage through that going forward, but that's the main issue putting pressure on yields at this point.","Operator","And our next question comes from William Greene from Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Alan, can I ask you for just a little bit of color around some of the guidance numbers? If we look at the second quarter, it's quite a bit below what normal sort of sequential change would suggest. And if we sort of follow that through, it kind of leads to either an assumption that there's a pickup you're assuming in the second half or we'll be toward the low end of that guidance number. So is it fuel in the second quarter that's causing that below-seasonality, or maybe you can add some color around kind of near term and long term?","Alan B. Graf","Well, I think the key here is what we've talked about several times. When IP is in a declining mode and IE package is in a strong growth mode, that's a big factor, and we think that's going to continue. I mean we took significant haircuts, that Mike mentioned earlier, to our calendar year '13 numbers. And so we see the economy not improving from here. And I watched Mr. Fisher this morning, the ex-Fed member, saying that he thought the economy was at stall, at current. And I think that it's -- not a voting member, he's still currently there. I think that's what we're seeing. So we anticipate more of the same in the second quarter for Express. And also, we'll have some fuel headwinds versus the previous year at Express the way the fuel surcharges and our bands are working out in terms of price increases in the lag. So fuel's definitely an impact, but not going to see much improvement in Express in the second quarter as we keep our service levels high. And we'll be telling you in October what we're going to do and when we're going to do it at Express. So those are the 2 keys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling from BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","You guys have spent a lot of time talking about customer shifting to deferred services. Are you seeing more customers maybe taking a step further and shift from the air to the ocean? And, Mr. Smith, you briefly mentioned you guys are taking market share. Does that imply that maybe you've taken market share from the freight forwarder community as you build out the FedEx Trade Networks?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, what's going on in the movement of goods internationally in the Air Cargo segment, the door-to-door Express part of it is taking share from the traditional airport-to-airport cargo segment, and that's going to create a lot of issues as a tremendous amount of capacity that's been brought into the market, a lot of new aircraft by the traditional airport-to-airport providers, whether they're combination carriers or the pure freighter operators, that market is not growing at all. And, in fact, in the last several months, it's almost contracted about, what, 3%, I think?  Something along those lines. So that's what I was talking about that Express is taking market share, and there are 3 major Express networks. We're the biggest in terms of transporting goods by air, and then you have UPS and DHL. And then there is clearly a diversion of traffic from traditional airport-to-airport air freight onto the water, and that's being caused by the falling value per pound of the traffic that's being moved. I mean we all benefit, particularly in the electronics sector, with improved pricing because of technology. Well, the thing that is most correlated to air freight demand or the air cargo market demand is the value per pound. So there is traffic that's moving onto the water because of that, and at the same time, over the last 10 years, the container liner services have gotten a lot better. I mean, there's now daily service from almost every major port in Asia to the major ports in the United States and Europe. This will be even more pronounced once the Panama Canal has expanded to the so-called Panamax-sized ships in 2014. So that's what I was talking about market share. The Express segment is taking market share from the traditional air freight segment, and the traditional air freight segment is losing some traffic to the sea freight area. And that's our strategy.  We're participating in both of those, with FedEx Trade Networks in the sea freight area, which has been a major expansion effort over the last few years.  It's really fantastic what our team has done there. And we're now an increasingly big player in that segment. And at the same time, our Express system has grown, but the customer has selected the less expensive of the 2 services that we offer, and it's -- we have to modify our system and our capacity to reflect that changed demand. So long answer, but you have to understand a lot. Dave, you want to add something?","David J. Bronczek","And to add to that, our FedEx Trade Networks organization has done a tremendous job of opening up, I think we're up to 51 markets, 125 cities now. And, of course, the visibility and the technology that we provide at FedEx across the board in all of our networks is something that the customers value very much. So when they're moving on the ocean, they still see the visibility, they still see the tracking, they still see the reliability of the service commitment on deliveries. So it's a movement for our customers that adds more value to them, and we'll be talking more about that in October.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker from Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up more on FTN network development. I think the latest K mentioned 130 offices, and you say 125 locations. This must be 100 more than just 2 or 3 years ago. And I recognize you'll continuously position offices to capture shifting trade patterns. But could you please comment on sort of near term, what kind of expansion is required before the network is sort of completed?","David J. Bronczek","Well, we're in very good shape right now. You're right. We've added over 100 cities, probably, in the last 3 years, and we're in very good shape right now in all the major markets around the world. We'll add some more. We'll continue to open more cities. But by and large, in the main ports and the main lanes, we're already there and just adding customers. And with our bundled capability internationally, it's really positive and up. We have a lot of upside potential with FTN.","Alan B. Graf","This is Alan. Look, we're going to continue to build scale at FTN, and we're going to continue the expansion. But there is not a customer out there right now that FTN can't compete for, which is a position we haven't been in until just recently. So that's going to be an important part of our game plan, as Fred mentioned.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christian Wetherbee from Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Question maybe on the domestic side, just looking at the Express side from a volume standpoint. When you look at the 5% decline there, I was just wondering if you could give some color around the trade-down you may be seeing out of Express and into the Ground and maybe how much of that 5% is kind of being captured there relative to the overall weakness in the economy. You try to parse that out, maybe a little bit more color on that would be great.","Alan B. Graf","Sure. I'll let Dave get some specifics. This is Alan. I'm going to just say again and iterate this, we manage the U.S. domestic business as a portfolio. And if you combine our Ground and Express domestic businesses, you have one heck of a great profit story. And in fact, Express domestic's profitability is good, even despite there's a 5% volume decline, because we're managing the heck out of it. So I'll turn it over to Dave.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, I'll answer that, then Mike Glenn will jump in, too. Alan's exactly right. I mean, our FTEs, and you can see that, is down 3% year-over-year. It's 3,450 FTEs. The service has never been better. The quality of our customer care has never been better. Our linehaul in the United States is down 2% as well. So -- and our Aircraft Maintenance is better. So across the board, we've been diligent at reducing our cost commensurate with where the volume is, but the volume is between Express and Ground at FedEx, so that's a good thing.","T. Michael Glenn","Christian, I think it's important to point out that almost 1\/2 the year-over-year decline during this quarter was due to one customer in the cell phone industry shifting from a total Express solution to a combination of Ground and SmartPost in order to manage their supply chain during this economic period. Beyond that, the weakness has been relatively broad-based among industry sectors and is largely economic-based.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman from Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","A fair amount of my questions have been answered at this point. What I'd like to do is drill down a little bit more into your international forecast change. There was a  slide you put out, I think over the summer, where you were looking for Eurozone to contract about 0.5% and emerging markets to grow at about just over 5%. I was speaking to a gentleman from China the other day who had expressed to me that he had thought that the Chinese economy was going to be stronger in the fourth quarter and first quarter and they were seeing changes in real estate market, what have you. Could you talk a little bit more about where you've incrementally changed outside of the U.S. and in particular, with some of your emerging markets?","T. Michael Glenn","Just from an economic perspective, as I mentioned, our global forecast is -- for calendar year '12 is 2.3%. In the developed countries, we're expecting 1.3%; in emerging markets, which is 5.1%. Again, this is slightly lower than we were last quarter. In '13, we're looking for 2.7%. Again, developed countries, 1.5%, and emerging markets, 5.7%. We've certainly seen a growth slowdown in the emerging Asia sector in the first half of Q1, but that's probably run its course, and domestic demand remains robust in the global headwind -- into global headwinds. But obviously, there are a lot of policy issues that will impact that.","Frederick W. Smith","I can tell you this on China. The locomotive that has driven China's growth is its export industries. And with the situation in Europe and, to a lesser degree, in North America, that is a significant issue for the Chinese economy. Now the consumer consumption in China is not increasing at a significant rate, contrary to everybody's hopes. While exports from, say, the United States into China have grown, they are dwarfed by the exports from China into the United States. And as the big economies in Europe and the U.S. have grown or contracted -- grown at a far lesser rate or, in the case of certain European countries, have contracted, that's reflected in the numbers in China. And you can't escape that. I've been somewhat amused watching some of the China observers, I think, completely underestimate the effects of the slower exports on the overall China economy.","David J. Bronczek","Jeff, this is Dave. And to add something else that you'll see in October that you probably don't see now is we've, on purpose, added a lot of investments in Europe. Our organic European plan, it's -- is very successful, and you're going to see a lot of the benefit to that. And also, in Asia, organically, in terms of more salespeople, more stations that we've opened. So it's -- we've added some costs and some investments that we are very confident will pay off in a big way, and you'll see more of that as well. So that's somewhat into our numbers too that you probably can't see at the moment.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Group from Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So first, thanks for the breakout of IP versus economy. It's helpful, and if you have any more history going back before fiscal '12, it'd be helpful for us. And then my question is on the restructuring. So there's been this view that I think it'll be largely a domestic Express restructuring. Is there a chance now that it can be broader and touch International to help manage some of the structural headwinds we're seeing as we see the shift from International Priority to Economy? Can you do much to address the cost structure of an Economy product versus a Priority product?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, first, let me clarify something. The management of FedEx has never used the term restructuring. That's something that you have mentioned and the media has mentioned. We intend to take a significant amount of cost out of the Express system, and on October 9 and 10, you'll see how we're doing that. But it's not the -- we're not going to lay off people and we're not going to take some Draconian steps. All of the things are very well-thought-out, and we're very confident we can achieve them, and I think you'll be surprised at the magnitude. The organic expansion in Europe and China, they make great contributions with IP or IE. That's not the issue with the domestic operations. The issue is the linehaul operations, because it costs the same amount of money to put up a unit of capacity whether you're flying it full of IP or IE. And so I think you will see, commensurate with the outlook that we're talking about, FedEx Express being very cautious about adding capacity, unless it's competitively differentiated, and then moving the lower-yielding traffic into the right network, which is what Dave was talking about. But we'll see you on October 9 and 10, and you'll get a lot of detail on that.","Alan B. Graf","Just to finish the thought up, yes, there will be a significant amount of SG&A reduction around all FedEx Corporation on top of what we're doing at Express, and that would be my part of the show.","T. Michael Glenn","Yes, and Alan's right, and Fred, of course, is right. We're going to talk about international opportunities there and how our linehaul and our networks reposition to handle the right products in the right network. The same is true in the United States. We have worked on this for many months, and you'll be, I think, surprised, as Fred pointed out, the magnitude of the numbers. And, of course, our aircraft fleets, we're going to talk a lot about that as well. That's been a big upside to our profitability going forward, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe just to follow up on the themes that we're hearing on this call, should we be thinking this push towards deferred air products is more structural in nature? The shippers tried in these softer times, what are some of the fences that you guys can enact when things maybe get a little bit more urgent in the future to push people back into those higher-revenue segments?","Frederick W. Smith","The movement between Priority and Economy is essentially driven by the macroeconomic situation relative to the capacity. And so if the economic outlook changes, people buy the Priority Services in order to assure that they get moved on the time frame that they're looking at. It's really an arbitrage. Now having said that, on a systemic basis, as the price of fuel has gone up inexorably, almost, over the last decade, what you're seeing are these big trends that I talked about a little earlier. The air cargo market in its traditional definition is not growing. The door-to-door Express portion of it is growing relative to the overall market, and the -- a lot of traffic is moving onto the water because moving goods by air is very energy-intensive. So a huge part of these things, of what's going on, is driven by the price of fuel, and that's going to change people's decisions on manufacturing and supply chains. So we're going to talk about that on October 9 and 10. But you can't have jet fuel going up to close to $4 a gallon on occasion without it having a big effect on the choices people make in terms of the speed, price trade-off and the decision as to whether to move bulk commodities by air or on the water.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ceraso from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, that leads into my question. It seems like you're in a bit of a tough spot where there are some secular shifts, like you said, towards ocean away from air. And at the same time, you also need to make your air network more fuel-efficient, so you're upgrading your air fleet. But in the short run, that seems to be leaving you with very little excess cash flow. You're running close to 9% CapEx as a percent of sales. Do you expect it to persist at that level, leaving you with limited free cash flow over the next 2 or 3 years?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, I don't know where you came up with the term limited cash flow. I think our cash flow's very strong. And we have done 2 major things with the Express fleet. One is we have deferred deliveries of the 777s, because we are not going to escalate the scheduled aircraft in the near term, and we have accelerated the replacement of the MD-10s with 767s, which provide a high ROIC, and they're 30% more fuel-efficient. And we're going to continue to do that. And the reason we're going to continue to do that is because we have such strong cash flows. I mean, our EBITDA is going to be very large this year, so it's not like we're not making money. I mean, we've given a $6.20 to $6.60 range. And if you do the math, I think you'll find out our cash flows are very strong.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a question on the domestic volume change. It looks like the deferred volumes are the weakest of the bunch, and I'm wondering if that was sort of a customer-specific thing or if that is something else that's going on in the U.S. domestic landscape.","T. Michael Glenn","David, this is Mike. As I mentioned earlier, almost half the decline in the Express domestic segment was due to one large customer who shifted from a largely deferred Express solution to Ground and SmartPost as a way to optimize their supply chain during the weaker economy. So that was the primary driver during the quarter regarding the deferred traffic.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So you're not seeing a greater than sort of market decline in deferred outside of that one large account?","T. Michael Glenn","We're certainly seeing some pressure on deferred traffic levels.  As you would expect to see any time when you have a weak economy, there's some trade-down from deferred to Ground. There's some trade-down from Ground to Freight in the larger shipments. So certainly the economy is having an effect on that, but the primary issue is one large customer.","Frederick W. Smith","Let me just say what I've said on a couple of occasions here, and again, we'll talk more about it in October. The company doesn't view its individual segments as stand-alone businesses. I mean, we manage the system as part of a portfolio. And I think we've been pretty good in forecasting where the market was going. I mean, that's why we bought Caliber, that's why we upgraded FedEx Ground so that it's now the fastest ground system out there. It's making a lot of money. It's because we understood that that's where the market was going. As Dave Bronczek mentioned, we've expanded over the last 3 years our FedEx Trade Network significantly, so we're now a major player in a much broader international trade marketplace than we were just a few years ago. I think the one thing that has changed faster than we would have anticipated, and it is directly related to the policy choices made at the governmental level, is the price of fuel. And the price of fuel, if you plot it over the last 10 years, it's really quite astounding.  And it's a little bit like a frog being boiled quickly or boiled slowly. I mean, it jumps out if you boil it quickly. But when you do it slowly, it sits there and gets cooked. So the world economy has absorbed an incredible increase in the price of fuel, and that has had very big implications on the way people think about supply chains on their decisions to move ocean or whether they move things by air. There's a  great logistician up at MIT that said if it keeps going, the places where you ought to put manufacturing plants are Mexico and Eastern Europe. So it's not by accident that FedEx made a great acquisition in Mexico, which is just going barnburners, the MultiPack, and in Poland, in OPEC. So I think the only thing that's been at issue here is that the growth rates have been far below what everyone would have wanted because of policy choices. And secondarily, the increased price of fuel combined with those macroeconomic issues have slowed the growth of exports and, secondarily, they've made people trade down, whether it's in the domestic market or in the U.S. market. But none of this was -- we didn't miss any of it. We did all of the right things. It's just here late in the last few months, it's been very disappointing in terms of the macroeconomic environment.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference.

And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Frederick W. Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012. Following my brief remarks, Mike Glenn, as we started to do at the last one of these meetings, will address our economic outlook and yield situation first, and then Alan Graf will offer an overview of our financial results and outlook.","Prior to FY '12, we committed to you that we would increase earnings, margins, returns on invested capital and cash flows, and we have done so. I'd like to thank the more than 300,000 FedEx team members around the world who turned in a world-class performance during a very volatile and challenging year. We had, of course, exceptional performance by FedEx Ground, and the powerful new value proposition at FedEx Freight and improved yields across all transportation segments fueled these outstanding results. We also will continue positioning our company for the long term. In this regard, last week, FedEx Express completed the acquisition of the Polish company, OPEC. During the fourth quarter, Express announced agreements to acquire companies that serve domestic markets in France and Brazil. We've also opened scores of new stations in Europe as part of an aggressive organic expansion strategy and we're very pleased with our progress there.","Let me cut to the chase about FY '13. We again are stating to you unequivocally we believe we will continue to improve earnings, margins, returns on invested capital and cash flows, and I would add that the earnings guidance that Alan will talk with you about does not include the effects of significant cost reduction programs currently under review that we believe should be announced in the fall.","Let me now turn the call over to Mike Glenn. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn","Good morning. FedEx's economic outlook calls for moderate growth to continue in the U.S. and global economy. Our forecast calls for calendar year '12 U.S. GDP growth to be 2.2% and industrial production growth to be 4.3%. For calendar year '13, we expect GDP growth of 2.4%, and our outlook is largely in line with the consensus economic forecast. We expect calendar year '12 world GDP forecast to be 2.4%. It's important to point out that successful management of the debt crisis in Europe and the avoidance of significant tax increases next year in the U.S. are important assumptions in our forecast.","Turning to yield, FedEx continued to do an outstanding job managing our yields. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield increased to over 5%. The increase was driven by price, rate and discount improvement followed by favorable service and customer mix changes.","In the Ground segment, our yield increased 4%, including the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by list rate and discount improvement, followed by an increase in extra service charges.","On the international front, excluding fuel, IP yield increased almost 2% year-over-year, with improvement being driven by weight and rate and discount changes. And finally, in the Freight segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight increased 1.5% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by pricing rate changes. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Graf.","Alan B. Graf","Thank you very much, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $1.99, up 14% year-over-year, excluding a previously announced $0.26 per share aircraft impairment charge at Express. Despite a global economy that was softer than expected, our FY '12 adjusted earnings per share was $6.59, up 34% from fiscal year '11. Overall, our FY '12 adjusted operating margin increased to 7.7% versus 6.5% last year, on 9% higher revenue.","At our Ground segment, operating margin increased to 20% in Q4, as Ground continued to efficiently manage expenses while improving the networks for quicker deliveries and continued growth.","At Freight, operating margin climbed to 5.8%, which is the highest fourth quarter margin since 2008. Our Freight segment profitability should continue to improve due to volume growth, base yield improvements and the network design changes that are increasing our operational efficiencies. Result has been a strong turnaround in Freight that will continue in FY '13.","Express Q4 operating margins declined year-over-year, primarily due to a $134 million aircraft impairment charge and declining package volumes. A demand shift toward lower yielding International services also negatively impacted margins.","We anticipate revenue and earnings growth in 2013 despite modest growth in the global economy. We believe U.S. domestic and global economic conditions will be impacted by the European debt crisis, slowing growth in Asia and the uncertainty these issues create on the global economy and the demand for our services. These weaker global economic conditions have driven a shift by our customers from premium services to our deferred products, and we expect that trend to continue in 2013.","Our anticipated earnings growth in '13 is predicated on continued improvement in profitability at our FedEx Freight segment and a sustained strong performance of our FedEx Ground segment. International revenue growth and productivity enhancements at FedEx Express should also contribute to our earnings growth in 2013. However, headwinds in pension expense will hamper earnings growth in 2013, as a historically low discount rate at our May 31, 2012, measurement date will increase these costs by approximately $150 million.","During 2013, we will continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and adjust our networks to match anticipated demand. Initial actions were taken in 2012, as we made the decision to permanently retire 24 aircraft at FedEx Express to better align the U.S. domestic air network capacity to match current and anticipated shipment volumes. In addition, we remain focused on modernizing our aircraft fleet at FedEx Express by adding newer aircraft that are more reliable, fuel-efficient and technologically advanced and retiring older, less efficient aircraft. These actions will improve margins at Express.","Our capital expenditures for 2013 are expected to decrease to approximately $3.9 billion, with fewer aircraft deliveries in 2013. We will continue to evaluate investments in critical, long-term strategic projects to ensure our capital expenditures generate high returns on investments and are balanced with our global outlook for economic conditions.","Looking at the FedEx Express segment, we expect to increase revenues in 2013 in our international services and improve yields across all Express services as we continue to focus on our yield management programs. We do anticipate a slight decline in U.S. domestic package revenue in 2013 due to lower volumes. We anticipate improved operating results due to productivity enhancements, including continued improvement in on-road productivity, air operations initiatives and ongoing realignment of our U.S. domestic air networks. Express is developing a detailed operating cost structure plan to further improve its operational efficiency and we plan to discuss this with you in the fall.","Turning to the Ground segment. We expect continued growth in operating income at the Ground segment in 2013 due to volume and yield increases, as well as through productivity enhancements, including automation of the planning and execution of free load and pickup and delivery processes. Ground will also install GPS devices on all trailers and dollies to improve fleet management.","At Freight, we anticipate revenue growth in 2013 from yield and volume improvement due to our unique value proposition. Freight operating income is expected to increase significantly in 2013 from this revenue growth and from continued improvement in productivity and efficiency across our integrated network. We will continue to use investments in technology, focused on network and equipment planning and customer automation to further enhance customer service levels during 2013.","Looking at the balance sheet. At May 31, 2012, we recorded a decrease to equity through other comprehensive income of $2.4 billion net of tax to reflect unrealized actuarial losses in our pension plan during FY '12, resulting from a decline in the discount rate and mark-to-market accounting. Despite this charge to equity, our balance sheet remains very strong, with cash of $2.8 billion and debt of $1.7 billion. Our effective tax rate was 35.3% in FY '12 and was lower than FY '11, primarily due to favorable audit developments. We estimate our effective tax rate for FY '13 will be in the 37% to 38% range depending on the strength in specific country source of our international earnings. During FY '12, permanent reinvestment benefited our rate by 1.3 percentage points. We're now ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's see. I wanted to ask you about the, let's see, the restructuring in a sense that you gave us some initial information on fleet reduction, it sounded like in that release that a lot of the aircraft that you were reducing or retiring were actually already parked. And I think one of the things we're trying to figure out is what's the magnitude of potential capacity takeout that you have. So I understand you're saving a lot of this for the fall, but I was wondering if you could give us kind of a directional comment on what -- how big is the opportunity to actually take out capacity in Domestic Express.","Frederick W. Smith","I think we'll wait until the fall to talk about that because it's a comprehensive program and I'm not sure we could do it justice here on a telephone call.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When you guys think about your networks, as I see them right now, I mean, especially in Express, in the domestic market, how much of what's being moved in the Express market could really find a home in Ground? And I guess, as you've seen this accelerated Ground growth and continue to see strong margin improvement there, Fred, I think you talked to getting to a 20% goal last quarter. You're there now. Where does the bogey move to? So a 2-part question, how much from Express could move into Ground? And as you get that density, how much better can Ground margins get?","Frederick W. Smith","Justin, first, I think it's important to point out that the growth in the Ground segment is largely driven by superior value proposition, which is based on a significantly faster network and outstanding service levels. And the Ground also benefited from some growth in the e-commerce sector. Having said that, any time you see softness in the economy, you see some mode shift where customers reevaluate their supply chains and look to see if they could rely on a slower mode of transportation in some cases or the lack of a time-definite service. So we do see some of that. We work with customers to put their products in the right network that's going to benefit them and, of course, benefit FedEx as well. So it's hard to put a specific number on that because it gets down to the requirements of individual customers in terms of what their needs are.","David F. Rebholz","Justin, this is Dave Rebholz. First of all, let me make the comment that every day, we strive for improved margins and service. And that's not lost commitment on the entire organization and they'd buy into it because that's how we grow. Having said that, there were a lot of headwinds into Q4. You heard me tease you previously about my boss with me, which was totally appropriate. The reality here is, is that we had a lot of good things come together. We had great revenue growth, as Mike already mentioned, on the yields. We had great volume growth, both in Ground and Home, as was evidenced earlier by the additional surcharges we benefited from, and SmartPost. So we're a healthy proposition. We will continue to strive for 20% each and every quarter. I don't know that I can commit that each and every quarter. What I can commit to is that we will continue to improve our performance, both on a margin and service basis so that we differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. And so far, it's playing out very well for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you tell me a little bit about the international traffic trends? Is European Express traffic generally getting worse as Asia might be getting a little bit better? And then on air freight capacity in Asia, has it been rightsized or people still pulling plains out of that market?","T. Michael Glenn","David, this is Mike. Let me comment about overall traffic levels, if I can, in the quarter. Clearly, the softness in the global economy impacted IP volumes, with the Asia Pacific being impacted the most during the quarter. However, I think it's important to point out that the weakness in APAC was largely driven by specific customers in the tech sectors and how they handled product launches. So if you excluded that issue, IP volumes would've been positive year-over-year during the quarter, and that's an important thing to point out. So APAC was impacted the most, with the other segments performing much better.","Alan B. Graf","This is Alan. Europe's actually performing very well through this crisis. We're very pleased with how that's performing, and I'll turn it over to Dave Bronczek to get his comment as well.","David J. Bronczek","Yes. [Audio Gap] They're both exactly correct. I mean, Mike commented on the high-tech sector hadn't -- we had such a big increase in one customer last year in the fourth quarter. Across the board, we would actually have an increase in IP volume. In Europe, as is pointed out, I think several times on the last few quarters, continues for FedEx Express to perform and outperform quarter on top of quarter. So we've seen very good results from our European business.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","In Express, you talked about the growth in the deferred services, and does this include a modal shift from the air to the ocean? Or is it mainly just a shift from a premium air product to a more economy air product?","David J. Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek again. Yes, there is a shift into some more of our FTN network. Our FedEx trade network is handling more traffic, specifically out of Asia, on the ocean. But some of the traffic has shifted from international priority into international deferred, and we're adjusting our network to handle that and handle it more profitably. So I think it is the combination of both.","Frederick W. Smith","I think, in the larger perspective, over several years now, it's very clear that the door-to-door Express segment is growing, the movement of goods on the water is growing and traditional Airport-to-Airport commodity airfreight is not growing.","David J. Bronczek","And if I could just add one other comment, I think Fred's exactly correct. You're seeing a lot of companies that just have traditional freighters are finding it very difficult out in the marketplace these days with high fuel costs and relatively low yields on their freight. So the question that was asked earlier is the capacity coming down, at some degree, that's correct with these all freighter parts of people's businesses and companies in general. I think that's exactly correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Can I just please ask the question about Europe specifically? When you say that Europe is doing well relatively speaking, are you talking about within Europe or you're talking about Europe outbound, Europe inbound, Asia-Europe? Can you just like put some color on to that?","Alan B. Graf","Helane, this is Alan. I'll let Dave go. As we've been talking about for several quarters now, we have a very aggressive organic expansion going on inside Europe. And so we're gaining new customers and new business every day as a result of that expansion. It's working very well for us. So really, across the board, we're very pleased with how well that management team is executing. As you know, we bought the company in Poland, bought the company in France. So despite the turmoil over there, we probably are a little bit more bullish on Europe than others as a result of what we've been doing.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, I'll just add my comments. Europe in general is very profitable. They're doing exceptionally well. They have a very focused, detailed plan on improving service, opening up markets, adding salespeople. We're actually opening up one station per week in Europe, very, very successfully. The international side is growing and profitable as well. So really across the board, to Alan's comments, we're doing very well in Europe.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Dave Bronczek, maybe could you talk a little bit about utilization trends in -- between the 2 networks? If I look at Domestic Express versus international Express or IP, can you talk a little bit about utilization relative to one another and then maybe where each stand against the historical benchmark?","David J. Bronczek","Yes, I'd be glad to. For example, in the domestic flight hours, I'll use that example, we actually are down 3% or 2,000 hours per year year-over-year over the fourth quarter. On the international side, our international pounds are actually up. So IP and IP freight are up. So even though there's a shift into some deferred, actually we're flying more pounds. So we're actually reducing and looking at our domestic network closely to match more of the volume to the weight and to the lift, so there is a shift. It may not be apparent to you, so I thought I'd point that out. The same is actually true on our global FTEs. In the global FTEs, we actually have been acquiring some companies that are fitting in very nicely for our quality service and worldwide coverage expansion. On the other side, because of the domestic volumes coming down slightly, we're adjusting the FTEs there. And again, for example, our U.S. domestic FTEs have come down 3% in the fourth quarter, and that's over 2,600 FTEs, while they may be growing in some other parts of the world, like India and Europe and Asia, so we are always looking at this balance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Alan, at the Investor Day 2 years ago, you gave some aspirational targets about EPS trajectory versus previous recoveries. And so we're running a little bit below trend, but not materially so. But I'm curious, the cost initiatives that we potentially could see underway here, particularly at Express, do you think those are enough to get you back to that trajectory? Or is improving macro really required here to hit those kind of aspirational goals?","Alan B. Graf","Yes, I think a couple of years ago, Bill, we were looking at GDP for the U.S. and global to be better than they've actually been. They're moderate, they're not strong. And I think for our aspirational goals, we needed a little bit stronger growth than what we've had and what we're actually looking for. So having said that, we now realize we've got to adjust the networks that we built for higher GDP growth than we're actually seeing. So right now the opportunity, I think, is good. We are ongoingly taking out costs as we speak, and we'll come back to you in the fall with some more things that we're going to do to continue to do that. I think that will be 2\/3 of the issue. As the economy improves at some point, we have a lot of leverage in these networks. And a very small improvement on GDP percentage point growth comes to the bottom line very rapidly, so that will provide us with the other 1\/3 towards our aspirational goals. So it's sort of 2\/3-1\/3.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a real quick one on the guidance and then maybe longer term on the same issue. Can we just know what your fuel estimates are for your guidance range? And then it looks like when we've seen jet fuel cross the $3 threshold, we've seen a pretty big degradation in Express package demand globally. Is there any enthusiasm that you guys are seeing in the marketplace? So maybe if we can keep oil crisis around where they are right now, you could potentially see better growth rates ahead?","Alan B. Graf","I'll take the first part and then I'll turn it over to Mike for the second. As we say, every release we come out with, that the current guidance is for fuel prices to be stable where they are. Now whether or not that'll hold will remain to be seen, and let me turn the demand question over to Mike.","T. Michael Glenn","Thank you, Alan. I think it's important to note that fuel prices are just one component of the equation. Clearly, the economy and the moderate growth that we're seeing to the bigger issue, and I think customers in general are being fairly conservative in terms of how they're managing their supply chains until they see a little stronger growth. But certainly, lower fuel prices will help.","Alan B. Graf","And just to remind everybody, it's not so much the price changes, it just how rapidly they move up and down because we have this 6-week lag between the surcharge and the -- into plain costs.","Operator","And we'll now hear from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe talking a little bit about the underlying assumptions within the first quarter guidance just strikes me as a little bit, I guess, softer than maybe the trend would suggest. I guess maybe if you could give us a sense of what you're seeing so far in the month of June and particularly on the Domestic Express side, if volumes look like they're trending kind of in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter, if they're kind of better or weaker?","T. Michael Glenn","Christian, I would say they're trending more in line with what we saw in the fourth quarter. And I think it's important to point out that in the first calendar quarter, the Express overnight market declined 1% in volume. But if you exclude the strength in the lightweight e-commerce sector, the decline was certainly more in line with the numbers that we reported. We've been fairly selective in pursuing lightweight e-commerce, residential delivery, overnight express traffic. I think that's one of the main reasons why our yields excluding fuel have improved over 5% relative to the market in general. So we'll continue to balance our volume and yield management activities, but I would say certainly more in line with what we've seen.","Alan B. Graf","And if you just consider the pension and employee cost headwinds and the higher tax rate, I mean, we had last year, that also plays into headwinds for the first quarter, which is why we're working so hard to get to the fall time frame to get our cost structure better acclimated to the volumes we're seeing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I was thinking about it, Mike, you gave the view on industrial production for calendar '12, but not for calendar '13. I'm assuming it's 3% or stronger. When was the last time you saw 3% to 4% industrial production growth and declining domestic package volumes? I mean, is there that much inventory in the system that customers can manage it that more tightly or is it something else?","T. Michael Glenn","We're not seeing declining domestic package volumes. We -- you keep segregating the Express from the Ground. It's one basic market, so it's important to focus on that.","Unknown Executive","Jeff, let me add. We've had all the way back to -- if you look back to Q1 of '11, it was 4.4%. In Q3, it was 5.3%. So as Fred pointed out, if you look at our parcel traffic as a whole, we perform quite nicely relative to the market. We've been gaining market share in that regard. But clearly, customers are manning -- managing their supply chains relatively conservatively given the moderate economic outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","When you think about cost cutting, are you willing to cut into the service levels? Or just so we understand, is that in violate in terms of the larger picture, in terms of service center and aircraft domestic cuts? And then on the International, if you see IP growing so slow, is -- are there any opportunities to stall the 777 deliveries any further?","David J. Bronczek","Well, let me jump in here and answer both questions first, and then Fred may want to follow up on that. But in terms of the fleet for International, as you probably are aware, we moved some of our 777s back when we announced the 767s  prior to this. So we actually have done some of the fleet adjusting already, which is actually why some of our CapEx is -- might be better in FY '13. Give me your first question again, Ken.","Alan B. Graf","I got it, Dave. I'll handle it. It's Alan. Ken, several things here. First, we continue to work on our fleet. We continue to work on the size of the Ground network. I think it's important to understand what Mike said. It's one market, so our growth there is pretty strong. And so we have opportunities here, but be sure that you understand, we are going to improve service levels in every transportation segment while we reduce our costs.","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith here. I think that it's very important to understand our philosophy in that regard. We have people coming from all over the world to study our management system, which we call Quality-Driven Management or QDM. And the facts of the matter are that improved service levels actually decrease cost, they don't add to cost because they take out rework mistakes, lost customers and so forth. So we are very committed in FY '13 to doing the same thing we've done for the last 30 years through the use of our quantitative management systems to steadily improve the customer experience, not degrade it at all.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, let me add to Fred's comment because he's exactly right. At FedEx Express, I'm sure Dave Rebholz and Billy at FedEx Freight and Ground are the same. We even now had 12 consecutive years of improving service at FedEx Express, our world-class service. In FY '13, it improves again, once again to the 13th year. On top of that, we have cost initiatives that are prudent and they're in the plan, and we are going to talk about them in October. So we're going to be doing both, and the 2 go hand-in-hand.","Alan B. Graf","We'll be accelerating day savings in Ground. We'll be adding to our First Overnight product, our Saturday zips. We've got a lot of service enhancements across the board that'll be coming in FY '13.","T. Michael Glenn","We have an e-mail question for Bill Logue. It's a 2-part question. I'll give you the first part here, Bill. What's the average age of the FedEx Freight fleet currently? And will we see FY '13 Freight CapEx in the same level as the FY '12 level of $340 million?","William J. Logue","Well, again, as far as the age of the fleet, we're slightly above kind of normal historical trends. And as you saw, we made a good investment here in FY '12 in the fleet and we will be making a very similar investment in FY '13 going forward. So we're happy where we are. We had an opportunity with the -- when we networks together, so we're in good shape from a fleet perspective. And again, most of the capital will go towards replacements.","Alan B. Graf","Longer term, this is Alan, I hope we have the opportunity to invest more in Freight for its growth but also for technology changes on energy-efficient engines and, hopefully, 33-foot hubs [ph].","Mickey Foster","The second part of the question here for Bill is with the best OR performance for Freight since 2008 at 94.2%, what further OR gains from technology investments like GPS initiatives at the dock and dolly level and customer automation initiatives can we expect? This is from William Flin [ph] of Potomac.","William J. Logue","Two important issues for us in FY '13. First and foremost, number one is on our network design. We've learned a lot in the last 16 months, and obviously, every opportunity we get, we continue to adjust it. And as you saw in our release, we're making some significant adjustments in July designed to improve our efficiency, so we're excited about that. At the same time, we'll be speeding up about 6,000 lanes with that same move. So very important change for our network in July and also designed to give great and improve our customer service. And as far as technology, again, '12 and '13 are important years for us as we transition to our Eden Project, which basically automates a lot of our pickup and delivery and dispatch opportunities, as well as our dock and yard, which come on board later this year, which really kind of enhance and make our dock -- movement in our dock and yard interface much more automated and much more efficient for the network. So we're in a very good phase of our rollout and expect to see very positive results from both those initiatives.","Operator","And our next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners, LLC, Research Division","This question is for Bill as well. We saw, what, 4% increase in volume and a 4% increase in pricing on freights. If you had your druthers, would you rather have a little bit more volume or a little bit more of the yield in order to optimize your profitability?","T. Michael Glenn","Donald, this is Mike. I'll comment first and then let Bill add anything he'd like. The advantage that we're in right now is that customers really value our differentiated network and the value proposition that we have. They like the choice of party in economy and our sales team is doing a great job helping customers understand how these services will assist them in managing their supply chain. I think we're in a very good position right now in that we can balance the volume and yield growth through the benefits of the operating company, and we are being selectively aggressive where appropriate and then managing yields where also appropriate in terms of improving existing customers' operating ratio and things of that nature. So I'd say we're in a pretty good spot right now in terms of the strength of our volumes and our ability to manage yields as we go through FY '13.","William J. Logue","Don, I'll just add on that. Again, great job by Mike and his team on bringing on some very good volume for us at the appropriate yield. As we move into '13, as I tell the team internally, 3 objectives. Number one is continue the yield improvement, which, obviously, is we're very laser-focused on that; more volume at the right yield; and then as I mentioned earlier the network design is really important to really move  this volume efficiently through our network to put it to the bottom line. So the team is very engaged on it.","T. Michael Glenn","Let me just add, Donald, that one of the advantages of our revenue management committee where our sales and marketing team works with the operating companies on a weekly basis is we can actually fine-tune the strategy as we go through the quarter and the year. So there'll be some periods where we have a little bit more volume focus and there'll be some periods where we have a bit more yield focus. So that's the advantage of working so closely together with our revenue management team, as we're always in sync with the operating company on what's going to benefit them most.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So I got a quick thing I want to clarify on the guidance, and then a longer-term question. So in terms of the guidance for fiscal '13, are you -- I know the broad restructuring, there's no savings in there. But are you assuming any fuel and maintenance savings from the aircraft retirements already announced? And then on the longer-term question, it feels like some carriers are benefiting from tech launches and others aren't. What's your sense of what's driving changes in carrier decisions from customers like Apple? And is there anything strategically you think you need to do to be better positioned for future tech launches?","Frederick W. Smith","I think that's 2 questions, but I'll answer the first one. Yes, there would be some savings from the retired aircraft, but remember our depreciation express is going up because we shortened the lives on the ones that we did not retire. So they should about offset each other for the year.","Alan B. Graf","To switch gears, you're going to get a significant improvement as we continue with this fleet modernization program. This is a very big part of achieving double-digit margins at Express. As to the product launches, let me comment on this briefly and then ask Dave Bronczek and Mike Glenn to weigh in on it because we've mentioned this over the last couple of years. This is a very big strategic issue in what's going on in the \"air cargo market\" defined in the broadest sense. And the segments, as I said earlier, are the Express and the traditional door-to-door commodity airfreight. The important thing in FedEx in terms of product launches is that we benefit from our scale. I mean, we have 100 long-range, wide-body airplanes. So our ability to put up additional capacity for these episodial launches is much easier than it is if you're a smaller carrier, and that's going to continue, I think, for some period of time. Mike? Dave?","T. Michael Glenn","Let me just comment that I think the product launch decisions move much further up the supply chain than just looking at the transportation. Clearly, when there's more flexibility on the manufacturing side, there are certain companies that want to use forward deployment models. When the schedules are much tighter, obviously, they use more express-type models. So the same customer for one product launch might use one model and then use a different model the next product launch simply because of activities going on much further up the supply chain. So the good news for us is we have the flexibility to work with these customers regardless of the model they elect to go with, and that's what we've been doing.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, let me just add, this is right in the wheelhouse strength of FedEx Express. I mean, when customers move into the interior of China, for example, we're right there with them. And with our 777 aircraft, now we can fly nonstop to Europe, nonstop back into the United States hubs. We have 2 hours to sometimes 3 hours later pickups, which is very significant for these customers and get the earliest delivery. With our First Overnight, you can get it by 8:00 a.m. I mean, so it's right in the strength in the wheelhouse of FedEx Express.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Chris Ceraso with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher J. Ceraso - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have a question about the Domestic Express business. Do you see that business as being past the point of maturity and now into a decline phase? And so what do you think that means for the potential margin in Express? Do you still think you can get to double digits at some point and how do you do that?","David J. Bronczek","I think that's a difficult question to answer at this stage largely because of the modern economic activity that we're seeing. If we were seeing more trend-like economic growth, I think obviously the Domestic Express business would benefit. Having said that, we manage the organization as a portfolio and we're constantly working with customers to make sure we're putting the right product in the right network. But clearly, I think once we see more trend-like economic growth, that'll be an easier question to call.","David J. Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek again. And we -- at Express, we look at this as a global business for Express. The United States is just one more region of the world. So as the regions develop offshore and as the growth continues in the higher-yielding IP products and so forth, that the combination of all of it, including our cost decisions in the United States and our growth decisions in International, yes, we see Express into double-digit margins, all up collectively.","Frederick W. Smith","I think it's important to focus on the longer-term strategy, which we've mentioned several times over the years, but let me just reiterate it. Our portfolio of our operating companies was put together to complement or execute, I guess would be a better way, the strategy, and that was to produce at FedEx Ground the market-leading, fastest and most efficient ground parcel company. And we have largely done that. It is a formidable competitor now in the marketplace and the results show that. For many years now, we have felt that the Express market was a global market. Many of the products that 10 years ago we might have moved in the \"Domestic Express\" market are now moving internationally from a foreign origin point to a domestic location or between emerging markets. So our strategy was to increase substantially the International revenues of Express. And as Dave mentioned, the United States is just one, an important and a big one, but one node on that international network. The only thing that's basically changed in our strategy is that because of the policy decisions around the world, the international growth has been lower than we had anticipated. And some of the customers in the international marketplace, not dissimilar to FedEx Freight or, for that matter, FedEx Ground, with its FedEx SmartPost service, they opt, in times of low growth, for the more economical, slower service and we've seen a significant growth in the Express segment, in the international economy package service, International Economy Freight service, International Economy Distribution service. So Dave Bronczek and his team are rightsizing Express and modernizing Express to meet the revised outlook for global growth, but we are firmly convinced that we can get Express to double-digit margins because of the significant contribution levels of the international traffic as it moves through the network regardless of its origin and destination. Put a different way, again, I think it's unfortunate to some degree that we have to report Domestic and International and Express because we don't look at it that way. It's one network. We haven't added a pound of \"domestic airlift capacity\" in years. The capacity in the United States is driven by the movement of intercontinental traffic that's moving through the network, to and from the hubs and onto an International destination or from an International destination to a U.S. destination -- from an International origin to U.S. destination. So I hope I\u2019ve clarified that again. And it's very important to understand that we were quite confident that given any sort of growth rates in the International marketplace, that we can achieve those goals for Express as Alan Graf said a little earlier on a 2\/3-1\/3 basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies.","H. Peter Nesvold - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I have a longer-term question for Fred. Fred, I've heard you speak a few times in the past about how ocean freight is becoming more of a competitive substitute to international air freight. In the past, when FedEx has made really big bets or big calls like that, you've acquired something and sort of Asia comes to mind, the Ground business comes to mind, LTL. When you look at FedEx Trade Networks today, do you feel that you have sufficient capacity in that business in order to really capitalize on this bigger and longer-term trend? Or do you need to do something strategically bolt-on, perhaps, in ocean freight forwarder in order to really capitalize on this long-term trend?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, fortunately, we're in a position that we don't have to make any acquisitions in any sector. And we have selectively made some great bolt-on acquisitions. We've got a great corporate development group. Alan and I both have described to you the criteria we use for acquisitions. We'll do so again in October, but we're very disciplined in that regard. But to go down the list again, we just have a wonderful company in the United Kingdom we bought several years ago. We've got a great team down in Mexico that we acquired through an acquisition. We've made 2 terrific acquisitions that fit like a glove in Europe, we think, with TATEX in France to be closed here shortly and OPEC, which was disclosed. We have a great company in Brazil, we've had a long-term relationship. Now in the sea freight area, we have got a wonderful team that's headed by Fred Schardt. And Fred works for Mike Ducker and Dave Bronczek. And I think the deployment of FedEx Trade Networks over the last few years has been one of our great success stories and I'm not sure has gotten the recognition that it should. But they are a formidable competitor that's achieved scale very quickly. And Dave, you may want to comment on that because it's growing at a very rapid level.","David J. Bronczek","Well, it really is, Fred. And we're seeing the combination of that great team that Fred Schardt has in place, not only in Asia but around the world. And we're capitalizing on that with our tremendous international global powerhouse where we're gaining customers in that bundle almost weekly now. So we think that there's a big opportunity to leverage exactly your question, Peter, in the strength of that network going forward. But if there's opportunities in the future, we'll always take a look at them. But right now, we're very confident that we'll continue to grow and grow profitably there.","Frederick W. Smith","But you're exactly right. Sea freight has gotten a lot better over the last few years. And you're seeing more daily sailings, you're seeing better reliability from the container carriers. The information systems are much better, and right at the top of the list is the information system we developed for FedEx Trade Networks. It's got that high-quality FedEx IT capabilities. The customers love it and that's why we're closing a lot of that business. And of course, on the U.S. side, in particular, the FTN product and the more economy-minded shipping or the lower value per pound shipping fits like a hand in a glove into FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. So we have a compelling value proposition there and there's no requirement to make an acquisition. Obviously, we're always looking for opportunities, but we have no requirement to make an acquisition to be successful in that area. But think it is a high-growth area and a high ROIC sector, and that's one of the reasons that Alan and I both continue to say we're confident we can improve our returns on a go-forward basis, is in part because of the FTN activity.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So we're hearing a lot about demand for economy-types of services in the international market, and that seems to be a little bit at odds with some of the investments you're making operationally to do a lot of the nonstop flying from Asia. Is that something you guys are looking at as part of the broader restructuring or is that an investment that you think is still going to pay off from a service perspective?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, let me mention a couple of things and ask for Dave to weigh in here. 2 or 3 years ago, our strategy was built around adding 777 as fast as possible into the international marketplace and pushing our MD-11s into the domestic marketplace. The way the market has evolved and given the opportunity to do a mutually attractive transaction with Boeing on the 767s, what we've done is to acquire 767s, which are very efficient relative to the MD-10s and very accretive to Express' earnings and to continue to move the MD-11s into the -- or use the MD-11s into the international system. And the 777 nonstop flights are flown in those markets that need the IP service and the terrific improvement in cutoff times you get from nonstop service. And we're doing more of that this year. But the MD-11 is still a very good airplane, particularly when you come off of Asia and go over our anchorage hub, you don't need the 6,000 nautical mile range. So we've adjusted to what the customers want. And we, just like in freight, have 2 flavors of ice cream: the Priority, which is best-in-class; and then the Economy, which is terrific as well. And what you're talking about is the Priority service is late cutoff times, next-morning delivery to every address in the United States, and the Economy service is a day or 2 longer to any address in the United States. So they're both terrific services and the 777s do the former without equal and the MD-11 is a good workhorse for the International. So that's what's changed is 767s replacing MD-10s in the Domestic business rather than MD-11s, and the MD-11s staying in the International marketplace where they're perfectly adequate for moving the International Economy product line. I hope -- Dave, do you want to add anything?","David J. Bronczek","Yes. Well, Fred said it exactly right. I mean, you're going to see a nice overview of this discussion in October. We're very excited about it because the MD-11s are a perfect airplane for what David, I think, the questioner asked us about for that deferred traffic. In International, the super express freighters on the 777s are perfect for a lot of the high-tech sector and a lot of those customers, the one overnight. So we have beyond what we're going to talk about in the United States in October, we're going to talk about our whole international overview. And we're very excited about that opportunity because we think we have a lot of leverage there. We think we'll make a lot of profits there and we have a lot of opportunity to grow there. So we're going to be showing you that as well in October.","Operator","And that is all the time that we have for our question-and-answer session today.

Happy holidays to everyone, and welcome to our discussion of results for the second quarter of fiscal 2014. FedEx posted solid second quarter earnings, reflecting improved performance at FedEx Express, as the profit improvement initiatives that we introduced more than a year ago continued to gain momentum. We are very pleased with the excellent work by the entire Express team in improving their results.","While a later start to the holiday shipping season contributed to a decline in operating margin at Ground, on a year-to-year basis we expect the full year operating margin at Ground will be consistent with the FY13 margin of nearly 17%. FedEx Freight results were affected by a shift in customer mix and shipment attributes.","Overall, we believe our strategy is working well, and we are confident we will achieve our goals. We expect revenue and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of 2014, driven by ongoing improvements in the results of all our transport segments. Our balance sheet is strong, giving us the flexibility to initiate the significant stock repurchase program announced in October while continuing to execute our strategic growth initiatives.","The profit improvement program and the stock repurchase exemplify, I think, our commitment to deliver outstanding value to our shareowners. I\u2019d like to thank our more than 300,000 team members around the world, many working in very challenging weather this very day, to deliver the holidays to our customers. The past three Mondays, December 2, 9, and 16, were record days for average daily volume, with this past Monday setting a record of more than 22 million packages.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Glenn and following that, Alan Graf. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred. I\u2019ll cover economic commentary, as well as some commentary on yields per package. The FedEx economic forecast calls for moderate growth in the global economy. We see real GDP, industrial production, and consumer spending better sequentially in both calendar \u201914 and calendar \u201915 in the U.S. and globally.","Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.4% for calendar \u201914 and 3% for calendar \u201915. For industrial production, we expect growth of 3.1% in calendar \u201914 and 3.6% in calendar \u201915. Policy risk remained high, but improvement is ongoing in Europe and China. We estimate global growth of 2.8% in calendar \u201914 and 3.2% for calendar \u201915.","Turning to yields, excluding the impact of fuel, year over year express domestic yield for package increased 4.3%. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements, followed by increased weight per package and service mix. The ground package yield increased 3%, excluding the impact of fuel. The year over year increase was driven by rate and discount improvements, as well as an increase in extra services charges.","Excluding fuel, international export express package yield increased 3.2% year over year, primarily due to service mix. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, FedEx freight LTL yield per hundredweight declined about 1% year over year. The decrease was driven by changes in shipment attributes and heavier quarter end revenue deferrals due to the timing of Thanksgiving in the month of November.","Alan?","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Second quarter earnings increased to $1.57 per share, and operating income increased 15% to $827 million. Yield improvements and cost management at express were the primary drivers of the profitability improvement. Results also benefited from the favorable comparison to last year\u2019s Sandy-impacted results, lower pension expense, and a modest benefit from the voluntary employee severance program.","During the second quarter, the company repurchased 7.2 million shares of FedEx common stock for a total of 10 million shares repurchased fiscal year to date. The second quarter share repurchases had no effect on the quarter\u2019s earnings per share, but will have an estimated $0.04 per share impact for the full year.","Express had a wonderful quarter. Operating income increased to $326 million and margin increased to 4.8%, despite slightly lower revenue. The profitability improvement was driven by stronger base U.S. and international package yields, lower pension expense, and lower net expenses from ongoing cost reduction activities.","International priority revenue per package increased 3% while average daily volume declined 5%. Important to note that within the IP category, average daily volume for the lower-yielding distribution services declined, while IP average daily volume, excluding these distribution services, increased 1%. International economy average daily volume grew 10%.","Fuel costs decreased 8%, due to 6% lower jet fuel prices and fewer flight hours. 3% fewer gallons were used year over year, as we optimized our network and flew more fuel-efficient aircraft. Fuel price did not impact income for the quarter, based on a static analysis of the net impact of year over year changes in fuel prices compared to changes in fuel surcharges. Express is implementing a 3.9% average list price increase, effective in January.","Turning to our ground segment, revenues increased 10% to $2.9 billion and operating income increased $424 million, due to volume and yield growth at ground and volume growth at SmartPost. Average daily volume at ground increased 8% from continued growth in our commercial business and home delivery service.","The increase in operating income was partially offset by higher network expansion costs as we continued to invest heavily in our growing high margin ground and SmartPost businesses. Operating margin declined, primarily due to this year\u2019s later start of the holiday shipping season as Fred mentioned, as Cyber Week occurred in December this year versus November last year. The seasonal increases in volume, revenue, and operating income related to Cyber Week will be realized in this year\u2019s third quarter versus the second quarter last year.","Ground and home delivery will be implementing a 4.9% average list price increase, effective in January. SmartPost rates will also increase.","At freight, revenues increased 4% from higher weight per LTL shipment and higher average daily LTL shipments. Operating income increased slightly as higher revenue from increased demand was partially offset by higher purchased transportation. Weight per shipment increased 2% due to freight\u2019s priority service offerings. Average daily LTL shipments increased 4%, as economy and priority services both grew.","Turning to the outlook, we expect revenue and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of FY14 from ongoing improvements in the results of all of our transportation segments. Based on these improvements, plus our to date share repurchase results, we are raising our earnings per share guidance for the full year to 8% to 14% from the FY13 adjusted results. This compares to our previous growth range of 7% to 13%.","This outlook reflects share repurchases made to date, but does not include any benefit from additional share repurchases. We plan to continue purchasing shares under the program, but have no specific timeframe for completion. We have 32.2 million shares under our current authorizations remaining.","We are continuing to execute on the profit improvement programs we announced in October of 2012. The majority of the benefits from our profit improvement programs will occur in FY15 and to a greater extent FY16.","Given our economic outlook that Mike discussed, coupled with continued execution of our profit improvement programs at express, and earnings growth at ground and freight, I see increasing earnings, returns, and cash flows over the next several years.","I too would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during our very busy peak season. They are truly an amazing team. And lastly, remember that Monday is the last day to ship your presents overnight and have them delivered before Christmas. And Dave could use the business.","Now we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] We\u2019ll take our first question from Art Hatfield. Your line is open.","Arthur Hatfield - Raymond James ","Just on the IP category, if you could discuss the reduction in volumes through distribution services. Is that something that you guys are focused on that you want to reduce exposure to? And if so, how could we think about that going forward from kind of a modeling or thinking about volume in that segments, on the go forward?","Mike Glenn ","We made a specific decision and elected not to participate in some product releases that would have traveled in our distribution services capability. That decision was driven by our revenue management and yield improvement programs, and that was the primary issue there that affected those volumes in the quarter.","Dave Bronczek ","Alan mentioned it, and it\u2019s a good point, the majority of our IP of course is not the distribution services product, and that actually grew 1% all around the world, led by the U.S. outbound and Europe. And on top of that, our international priority yields grew 4%. So we\u2019re very pleased with that category.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","I wanted to ask you a little bit more on the ground margin commentary, both in terms of the second half and I don\u2019t know if you want to offer any kind of medium term comment, just on how we think about that. But I kind of thought that in ground margin, sometimes when you went through the peak and you had the maximum volume going through, that actually made you stretch the network. And that was sometimes a little bit of a margin headwind. But I guess you\u2019re characterizing the Cyber Week timing as being a factor that hurt your margin in the second quarter and maybe helps you going forward. So just wondering if you could give a little further perspective on ground margin near term and then if we think about it, medium term as being kind of stable, in the high teens, or however you want to comment on that.","Henry Maier ","Let me give you a little bit of color here as to what\u2019s going on. First, I think it\u2019s important to realize that not only is ecommerce increasing our volumes during peak, it\u2019s making holiday volume spikes peakier. And you need to understand, over a four to six week period of time each year, our business typically more than doubles.","And preparing for this phenomenon, and ensuring we\u2019re able to handle it with the level of reliability and services customers expect, is a year-long activity that starts in January of every year. And yes, it means every year we invest increased operating expense in the second quarter.","This year we had to do some unprecedented things to prepare, which is just another indication of how we\u2019re enabling this new ecommerce economy. For example, our network expansion costs increased to ensure we have capacity for the forecasted volume.","This is not only a peak phenomenon, but it\u2019s just building the base capacity we need to handle the growth we see coming year-round. Our purchased transportation cost increased to ensure we have the resources to pick up and deliver all the packages. This happens every year and it includes rental equipment and purchased line haul transportation.","This year, we incurred some increased vehicle maintenance costs in Q2 that we\u2019ve historically spread out throughout the year. We decided this year, in preparation for the peak season, given the fact that it\u2019s so compressed as opposed to years past, it made sense to incur these maintenance costs now. And again, the focus on that was ensuring outstanding service for our customers during this holiday season.","Now, we operate our network seven days a week during peak, allowing our fixed assets to truly sweat, and avoiding the cost of carrying capacity the rest of the year when we don\u2019t need it. These decisions afford a significant flexibility to manage our network in the busiest time of the year while providing unparalleled service to our customers.","Now, all these things that I\u2019ve mentioned are not atypical to what we do every year. The only thing that\u2019s different this year is the timing of Cyber Monday, which begins a week that typically reflects some of the busiest volumes we see throughout the year and the fact that this year peak is compressed into three weeks rather than four. And we call that the compression of the calendar, which by the way will be the same next year and then in \u201915 we go back to something more normal, which is a four-week period of time.","So I hope that answers your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Atkins of Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens ","I think it\u2019s pretty clear from your results that you guys are making some significant progress on your profit improvement plan. But I guess just to kind of step back and kind of see where we are over the course of the last year, of that $1.7 billion that you expect to generate in incremental profit, where are we to date as far as the run rate that you\u2019ve, as far as costs taken out of the business, or incremental profit that\u2019s now in the business if it wasn\u2019t there this time last year?","Alan Graf ","Let me just say that we\u2019re on track to be where we need to be by the end of FY \u201916. I think you could see, in the express results, that we\u2019re making some significant progress. We\u2019re also managing the business as we go. As I mentioned in the last call, the five buckets that we talked about back in October of 2012 are likely going to change, but we\u2019re still committed to the number. We\u2019re managing very aggressively the trade down in international. We were glad to see our pure IP grow and our yields go up this quarter. I think that was a very good sign. So we\u2019re not going to give you benchmark measurements on where we are until we get further into the program. We\u2019re only two quarters in, but we are on track to be there by the end of \u201916.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","I know it\u2019s early in both, but on One Rate and Delivery Manager, would love to get any commentary on how those are progressing, any quantification would be great.","Mike Glenn ","We\u2019re very pleased with the response to Delivery Manager. Of course, it\u2019s a key enabler to ecommerce this time of year by allowing consignees to really take control of the shipment, to manage the signature requirements, to redirect that to a hold location or schedule a future delivery. So it\u2019s a big bonus to have that active and up and running during the peak season, and it\u2019s critical to our ecommerce strategy.","One Rate is still relatively new. Again, we\u2019re pleased with the response to that. Customers love the convenience and simplicity of the service and we expect a future positive response as well. So we\u2019re very excited about both of those opportunities, and both of them play a part in ecommerce, which is especially important this time of year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - Merrill Lynch ","SmartPost only was up in the upper single digits. I guess it\u2019s the second non double digit growth in the past 19 quarters. Is there a change here? And did this impact the margins at ground? Can you talk a little bit about that as well?","Henry Maier ","Volume at SmartPost was affected by the calendar and the later start to the holiday shipping season. The yield was impacted by lower fuel in the quarter. Everything else was in line with what we historically see. Once again, it was all about the calendar.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","I had one follow up on Tom\u2019s question, and then I had a question for you on international economy. If you guys could quantify any numbers around that Cyber Week shift in ground, it would be helpful. And then similar to the question Ken just asked on SmartPost, I was curious on international economy, since this is a newer segment and it obviously ties in with the whole program you guys have on using third-party line haul. We had a 15% growth rate last quarter. We had a 10% growth rate in volume this quarter. How should we be thinking about growth in that product going forward, and your capabilities in terms of offloading to that third-party line haul network?","Henry Maier ","More than a quarter of the volume that we see in peak comes in Cyber Week. And if you think about it, that volume and revenue and profit was all shifted to the third quarter.","Dave Bronczek ","On the IE question, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in IE for many, many quarters now. But don\u2019t forget the IP product, the pure IP product, is still the dominant product that we have. It\u2019s over 70% of all of our international packages around the world. So IE, yes, it\u2019s going into other networks. It\u2019s in a network that makes us more money, but the IP is really the key going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird "," ","Alan, can you provide some perspective on whether the $32 million share repurchase authorization was incremental relative to the last quarter? Can you just give us some perspective in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about prior comments regarding the dividend and try to take the dividend yield up to a 1%-ish type yield versus thinking about buybacks on a shorter and intermediate term basis? Can you provide some perspective on that capital allocation strategy?","Alan Graf","Well, I thought we were very aggressive in the second quarter, accumulating 7.2 million shares in that quarter alone. We don\u2019t have a specific time for completion, but we will continue to be buying shares. And as for our dividend policy, of course that\u2019s a board decision. Our board generally takes that decision up in the June meeting, which has been what we\u2019ve done for several years. And my expectation is that\u2019s when we\u2019ll address it again.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi ","Can you talk a little bit about capacity in the international lanes, sort of where you stand? And is there further progress or need to move towards third-party capacity, particularly on the trans-Pacific routes? Are you sort of where you need to be relative to what the volume flows are right now? Or is there any more to do in the short term?","Dave Bronczek ","We\u2019re very pleased with where our capacity is right now. The customers are as well. And we\u2019ve mentioned, in several quarters now, in the past, that we\u2019ve made some trans-Pacific adjustments. And going forward we\u2019ll see how things go, but right now we\u2019re very pleased with where our network is.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","My question is on the express side, and kind of following up on Justin\u2019s question a bit, how much of the economy business, or how much of the overall business, has been moved, at this point, out of FedEx aircraft onto third-party aircraft? And where do you think that can go? And then just along those lines, when we look at capex for the year, I know you\u2019ve kept the guidance unchanged, but you\u2019re kind of below the run rate of $4 billion. Do you think that there\u2019s any flexibility to cut that $4 billion down a little bit?","Dave Bronczek ","I\u2019ll answer the first part of the question, then I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan. Our customers sit down with us all the time, and they kind of tell us what kind of services they\u2019re looking for from express. And we\u2019ve balanced our network right now to achieve those goals for our customers and for ourselves. And so yes, we have opportunities to move more IP. We have more opportunities for more IE as well.","As you know, the global marketplace for underbellies around the world keeps increasing, so we see that there\u2019s really no end in sight for what our customers want from us, and we of course have a great product offering in our FTN ocean business, and that keeps growing. We do a tremendous amount of business in FTN now as well.","Alan Graf ","On your first question, that Dave just addressed, let me just say that we are continuing very hard to continue to work on our international networks. As you know, we\u2019ve taken down two trans-Pac flights since the announcement of our profit improvement program, going from 10 to 8. Recall that we retire a lot of airplanes early, and accelerate the depreciation of a lot of others.","And we are in a process, and we are managing our customers\u2019 needs with our continuing to get to the right place on our networks, and that\u2019s going to continue all the way through \u201914 and all the way through most of \u201915 before we\u2019re going to probably be exactly where we need to be. But having said that, it\u2019s an integral part of our profit improvement program.","Now, as to capex, I\u2019m very happy with where we are in our capex. We\u2019ve got a very strong balance sheet. It\u2019s very important that we do the two things that we are mostly doing with our capital. One is the fleet modernization has to continue at express. It\u2019s an integral part of our profit improvement program. We\u2019re seeing significant benefits and you saw those in the second quarter, particularly in fuel burn and maintenance. That\u2019s going to continue as we continue to add the 767s and 757s.","And the other big piece of this is we\u2019ve got to continue to expand the ground network. And we are in the process of building three to five major hubs over the next several years. These are going to have very high ROIC. We\u2019re going to continue to grow round at a nice growth rate and maintain those high teens margins, and that\u2019s an important part for what we\u2019re doing as well.","So we are as steely-eyed as ever on capex, but we are intentionally spending a little bit higher than our 6% to 8% range right now in order to get the benefits to the bottom line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","I wanted to ask a question on LTL. If you exclude the impact of weight per shipment and the shorter length of haul, what would the core pricing run rate look like, just within the context of some of your peers reporting numbers in the roughly 3% range?","Mike Glenn","Well, clearly customer mix impacts that. What you typically see is smaller customers tend to have lighter weight shipments and shorter length of haul. And we\u2019ve been very successful diversifying our customer base for LTL. So it certainly had an impact, and it certainly has a drag on yield per hundred weight when you do see the change in mix of traffic.","Now, we also had some stronger growth in other customer segments, stronger than anticipated, which provides an opportunity for some yield management activities which we have initiated and will be conducting going forward. So we think we\u2019ve got a good handle on yield per hundred weight and where the levers are, and we will be managing that, along with the FedEx freight operating company going forward, to continue to improve our margins.","Bill Logue","Let me jump on that. Again, we\u2019re really pleased with our volume across all the segments, and particularly the priority economy mix. We saw very good growth in both. So we\u2019re excited about that. And also, the year over year fuel surcharge came down, so that kind of was a big impact as well, on the yield. So look at that, and again, as Mike said, we\u2019re very focused on our yield management process. So we\u2019re in a good position.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Greene of Morgan Stanley.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Fred or Mike, can I ask you to comment a little bit on the evolution of the ecommerce space? There\u2019s, lots of times, some discussions about what Amazon\u2019s doing and could they ever sort of become a transportation company themselves with some of the logistics efforts they\u2019re trying. You don\u2019t have to speak to Amazon, but how do you see that space evolving? Do players in that world become a competitor to you? How do you make sure you\u2019re kind of guarding against that kind of outcome?","Fred Smith","I\u2019m going to make a couple of comments, and then I\u2019m going to ask Mike to amplify on this and maybe some of my other partners can jump in here too, Henry or whomever. Because this is a big subject, and quite frankly I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen more mythology in the press about anything than I have about the ecommerce space over the last year or so.","The first thing I would say to you is there are two enormous transportation networks that are built around moving light packages and freight, and they are FedEx and UPS. And the size and scale of these operations are so big that it\u2019s almost amusing some of the comments about delivering items by drones. And we have a drone expert on the staff. It\u2019s Rob Carter, our CIO. He actually owns a drone, and he reported that it can operate about eight minutes and carry four Budweiser beers at his farm.","Now, that\u2019s not to belittle UAS technology, because we\u2019ve got a lot of studies underway in that area ourselves. But at the end of the day, the intercity transportation networks of FedEx and UPS, and to a lesser degree the postal service, which is designed around delivering very lightweight items. All you have to do is look in your neighborhood, with the small jeeps that drive down the road, and the right hand drive and so forth. That network is designed to move very lightweight things and publications and correspondence or letters.","Now, the whole issue about ecommerce, at the end of the day, is it\u2019s very expensive to deliver things to residences. Not every residence gets a package every day, and it\u2019s quite unlikely that every residence will start getting an item every day.","So in certain situations an Amazon.com or some very large etailer, they can unquestionably do local deliveries, should they choose to do so, and I think, in the case of some of them, they use various local delivery options today. But the vast majority of products moved, it\u2019s almost certain that they will, if they\u2019re going to be delivered, be moved by one of those three large networks, and then some of the smaller regional players, as far as the eye can see.","Mike, you want to amplify on that?","Mike Glenn","Yeah, I would say the important point to understand here is ecommerce has a very long runway, both domestically and internationally, and FedEx is well-poised to benefit from both of those. Clearly ecommerce is growing at a multiple of overall retail sales, but having said that, based upon the Forrester research, it will be 2017 before online sales represent a total of 10% of all revenue. So we\u2019re still at the tip of the iceberg here in terms of ecommerce and its potential.","I think another issue that is a big driver is mobile devices now account for about 11% of online transactions. Free shipping is part of about 50% of the transactions. SmartPost is particularly poised to take advantage of that.","So there are a tremendous amount of emerging trends in ecommerce before you even get to looking at how big box retailers are starting to respond, picking at the store level to facilitate efficient next day delivery on a cost-effective basis, which FedEx is well-positioned to take advantage of.","So I would say, even though there\u2019s a tremendous amount of talk about ecommerce, we\u2019re still in very much the early stage development of this channel. And we sit right in the sweet spot of it. We talked about delivery manager earlier in the call, about enabling our companies to really take control of the transaction. Our retail network enables people to get their packages when they want to, and we\u2019ve got other technology out there that we\u2019re working on to further facilitate this.","So FedEx is extremely well-positioned with our broad portfolio, but I think the important point here is that we are, again, very early in the overall stage of this channel. And again, I would just refer you back to that Forrester research, which states that it will be 2017 before we reach the 10% point of all retail sales being generated online. So a lot of runway here, and we\u2019re well-positioned to take advantage of it.","Dave Bronczek ","I\u2019ll just jump in from Express\u2019 point of view. Obviously, the globalization of ecommerce and our global powerhouse network around the world, with over 200 countries and all these customers, and they\u2019re all global reaching now. And this is a synchronization around the world. It\u2019s an art form, and we\u2019ve been doing it successfully for decades now.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays ","I want to come back to the discussion around capital priorities, especially in light of the share repurchase announcement back in October. Alan or Fred, is that really a change in strategic direction for the company? And I know you have a lot of aircraft renewals to go the next couple of years, but when you look out beyond fiscal \u201916 and you think about capex relative to revenue, should we be thinking longer term that\u2019s going to turn closer to that 6% range rather than the 8% you\u2019re running today?","Alan Graf","Hard to say. We\u2019ll have to see what the opportunities look like there in terms of ground\u2019s growth rate and how far along we\u2019ve come on the express profit improvement program. But certainly we probably will be high for the next couple of years, and if we have the ability to move a couple of things around, you know, one or two planes come due in May instead of June, it could change these numbers.","But I think at least through fiscal\u201916 we\u2019re going to be at probably about where we are, and then we\u2019ll see how well we\u2019ve done with our profit improvement program and how we\u2019ve improved our returns, which I think we\u2019ll be successful at. So as long as we can see that modernizing the fleet and ground growth continue to improve our returns, we\u2019re going to keep investing in them.","Operator","Our next question comes Helane Becker of Cowen.","Helane Becker - Cowen Securities ","Alan, I think this might be for you. You mentioned that you were continuing to expand the ground operations and you were building, I think you mentioned, three to five hubs over the next couple of years. Just wondering, are you comfortable that you\u2019re able to expand these operations fast enough, and that you\u2019re ahead of the changes that are taking place in delivery requirements. Or are you still kind of chasing change?","Alan Graf","I\u2019ll start, and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Henry. One of the great things about our company is our operations and engineering group and OR groups are brilliant in determining where the forecasted future traffic flows are going to be, where hubs need to be, and how much capacity we need to have.","And even though we\u2019ve significantly stepped up our investment and will continue to do that in ground, to keep up with its growth, it\u2019s going to remain tight. And it\u2019s going to remain tight by design. We\u2019ll be able to handle those 50% increases that Henry talked about for the three to four week periods of peak, but the rest of the year, it should be running fairly close to full. And I\u2019ll let Henry give you some more information about that.","Henry Maier ","We manage between 150 and 200 real estate projects a year, typically. We take a five to seven year view of the marketplace when we plan these facilities. We are very careful not to add capacity we don\u2019t need 11 months out of the year. And at peak, in the month of December, we plan to add operating expense as best we can to handle the volume surges so we can dismantle it when the volume leaves. And that essentially the way we\u2019ve run the company for the past 20-some years, and it\u2019s worked out very well for us.","Now, sometimes we might get a little bit ahead. Sometimes we might get a little bit behind, but as Alan said, we are a highly engineered and highly automated operation, and we have incredible flexibility to be able to flex up or down in the short term to handle customers\u2019 volume as it comes. So I think you should be confident going forward that we have a good plan to handle anything that happens in this business.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ross of Stifel.","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus ","Bill, can you talk about the reacceleration in FedEx freight shipment volumes? Was that driven by bundling? Increased sales force size? What was going on there to kind of show you the best growth rate you guys have had there in a couple of years?","Bill Logue ","Obviously we\u2019re very pleased with the volume growth, and as I said earlier, it\u2019s across all segments, the small, medium, and large customers, and focusing on priority economy, volume coming out both segments, is really showing the value prop is kicking in. We went through a couple of quarters there that we had some volume challenges the last two quarters. So the team really responded well, went out there and brought in some excellent volume for us. And as we go forward, as I\u2019ve always said, our goal is double digit margins, and to get there, we need really good balance on both volume and yield. And that\u2019s our focus going forward.","Mike Glenn ","We have terrific collaboration between the freight operating company and our sales team. And let me remind you that the entire FedEx sales team in the U.S. sells our complete portfolio of services. And that is a strategic advantage for us. It allows us to target and provide coverage for customers that are not typically seen by an individual when dealing with LTL transactions. And again, combined with the power of the bundle and the terrific collaboration that we have with the operating company has really been a plus. We\u2019ve also had enhancement to our automation systems, which has made it much easier for our customers to do business with us. And the outstanding service levels that the freight team is providing really give us an industry leading value proposition.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs "," ","I have a couple of questions with regard to express. First off, can you give us a guide as to the air freight demand outlook by region, based on your forward bookings and your discussions with your customers? And I also would just like to follow up with regard to one of the earlier questions with regard to third-party capacity utilization. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of your IE is going on your planes versus third-party capacity? And just in terms of the relative context, let\u2019s say at the beginning of the year versus where you think it might be at the end of, let\u2019s say, next year?","Dave Bronczek ","I can tell you that, and I mentioned this before, the U.S., international, as reported this quarter, was up. Europe was up. Asia was off a little bit because of the distribution services primarily and the release of some of the product launches. Other than that, though, they were up in Asia and clearly across the world. So where our volumes and our yields and our network capacity sits, we are very pleased with where we were and we are this quarter as well.","In terms of third-party distribution, we\u2019re using FTN, which is a sister company inside of express very much now, and we\u2019re using it for some of the launches, quite frankly, as well. And we just have a lot of opportunity around the world to continue to move lower-yielding traffic into the right networks to make us more money.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Van Sciver with Hedgeye.","Jay Van Sciver - Hedgeye","Looking at the intercompany charges line for the different segments, why is express seeing its costs decline relative to sales while ground and freight have seen probably less progress there, or slight increases? And should we expect that shared overhead to be down in the second half of fiscal \u201914 and into \u201915?","Alan Graf","Well, obviously that\u2019s one of the big places that we\u2019re working as part of the profit improvement program, to get our overhead down not just in services but at every operating company. And I think we\u2019re doing a very good job of that.","Our intersegment charges are very complicated. Some are directly based on revenue, which would explain a little bit of why ground\u2019s getting a little bit more and express getting a little bit less. Others are directly charged, and others are just using basic good old cost accounting to arrive at what the appropriate ones are. I can tell you that one of the good things about our company is the great debates we have on this subject. And we have the right amount of pension in there, and I think it makes us focused to keep them all as well as possible in total.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","Alan, I want to focus a little bit on the capital for the ground fleet and the air fleet. You mentioned you\u2019re taking capacity down, and I know we\u2019ve got fewer trans-Pacs. We\u2019re bringing on new aircraft. Two questions. One, what are we doing with the MD-11s that we might not be using in some of those markets? It doesn\u2019t look like you\u2019re planning on taking those planes out of the system just based on what you have in the release. And number two, can you talk a little bit about your thoughts on alternative fuels, particularly as it pertains to the domestic delivery fleet?","Alan Graf ","Let me direct the fleet MD-11 question to Dave, and then we\u2019ll talk about who\u2019s going to answer the alternative fuels. But there\u2019s a lot of work going on in that regard. So, Dave?","Dave Bronczek ","We\u2019re obviously putting our 777s, high reliability, low fuel, better operating cost airplanes, the 777s, in our international network, bringing back the MD-11s into our U.S. network. They\u2019re replacing the older MD-10s, some of our older planes. Some of those MD-11s are on lease as well. So we\u2019re going to be continuing to cycle this through our global network, but where the global service improvements and cost improvements are coming from, the 777s are going there, the MD-11s are coming back here.","Alan Graf ","Over time, we\u2019re going to be an all-twin operator. So that\u2019s longer term. And I\u2019m not going to give you any specific timeframes on that, but that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed. And I\u2019m going to ask my boss to talk about alternative fuels.","Fred Smith ","Well, regarding alternative fuels, we have efforts underway in all of the operating companies. In FedEx freight, there\u2019s a lead on natural gas powered vehicles. We\u2019re operating two test LNG over the road rigs, two compressed natural gas over the road tractors. They\u2019re performing very well as I understand it.","We have lots of focus on fuel improvement at FedEx freight with aerodynamics. In FedEx express, because they tend to use the lighter, smaller pickup and delivery vehicles, they\u2019re the lead company on electrification. We have about, I think, almost 500, maybe more, of all-electrics and hybrids. And ground has pioneered a lot of things, hydraulic vehicles and so forth.","On the specific question of biofuels, our aviation department has a lot of work underway in advanced projects of all types, including autonomous aircraft, as I mentioned, or augmented aircraft, which is what I think is going to happen, just improved assistance for the flight crews. I think it\u2019s going to be a long time before you\u2019re going to see a lot of autonomous airplanes operating.","And there\u2019s no question that you can produce biofuels. FedEx freight is buying biodiesel and FedEx express is involved in a number of things with BioJet. The problem with all of them is that while they\u2019re technically drop in fuels and interchangeable with petroleum, they simply have not been produced at scale, at a cost-competitive price. But we\u2019re pretty confident that that will happen over time, using a number of feedstocks. The one contract that FedEx freight has, for instance, is for biodiesel made of woodchips, I believe, produced at a refinery in Columbus, Mississippi.","So we\u2019ve got a lot of work there, but at present there\u2019s no large scale biofuels that are available to us. But I suspect that will probably change as you get into the 2020s. A lot of work going on, and a lot of progress.","Henry Maier ","With respect to ground capex, 90% of our capital expense in FY14 is to expand capacity. And included in that are expenditures for the new hubs Alan mentioned: building expansions and relocations, material handling, and rolling stock.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein Research.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Just wanted to ask you, maybe Dave or Fred, on the international network strategy, some of the other investments that you guys have lined up in hub capacity and in Osaka and Shanghai, and get a sense for how those investments play into the sort of future development of the international network. Are you guys changing that thought process around those investments given the changes in market conditions? If you could comment on that I\u2019d appreciate it.","Fred Smith ","Let me make a couple of comments here, because I want to make sure there\u2019s no confusion on the part of the investors. And I\u2019ll ask Dave to specifically talk about Osaka and Shanghai. Regarding the network of FedEx express, the current system of eight transpacific flights and seven transatlantic flights, and of course we have some Asia to Europe operations as well, in all likelihood, that\u2019s not going to materially change for some period of time.","That network is designed to offer competitively superior cutoff times and transit times, and it is performing very, very well, and the facilities, which Dave will talk about, are an integral part to speed up those processes and make them more automated and more efficient and handle the volumes that sometimes have been inefficiently handled, just because facilities are very difficult to put together in certain parts of the world. And the two you mentioned are going to be huge improvements.","So what you can anticipate, based on what the customers are telling us, is probably relatively slow growth in the IP sector, with customers opting to take a day or two longer in transit in the international economy sector.","And both priority and economy have three flavors. There\u2019s the door-to-door package IP and IE, the door-to-door freight IPF and IEF. And then we offer a distribution service in both categories, which is a large shipment that clears a border on a single clearance document and then it\u2019s exploded and goes to many different destinations. And that can be either packages or freight. And sometimes that lexicon, those terminologies, get misunderstood.","So that\u2019s why it\u2019s important, and Dave and Alan have both mentioned this to you, that IP, which is the real key product line, is actually growing, and the yields are going up. The IPD, it\u2019s hard to make money with that product.","So I think what you\u2019re going to see is not very much change in the near term in the backbone network, and a lot of growth in the economy traffic, which lends itself to being put in underbellies, which is going to grow next year, according to the last report I saw, the capacity, by about 5%. The 787, the 777, nine, the A-350s, there\u2019s going to be a tremendous amount of that underbelly capacity out there, which is very attractive in terms of cost per pound, and we are very effectively utilizing that. And Dave\u2019s plans are to do even more of that.","So I didn\u2019t want anybody to be confused about those terms and about the backbone priority network, which is working very well. It\u2019s going to work even better here with a couple of things that Dave\u2019s going to tell you about.","Dave Bronczek ","Thanks, Fred. That\u2019s exactly right. Osaka opens in April. We\u2019re really excited about it. It lets us flex up and flex down off of our main backbone network without adding to that network, with change of gauges, flights from Asia feeding Asia into the rest of the world over Osaka. It\u2019s going to be terrific. So as the volumes grow, we just add change of gauge in Asia. Or if they decline, we can flex down as well. So it\u2019s a terrific flex up and down. Shanghai is, I was just out there recently, a new facility. It\u2019s tremendously automated, very efficient, right in the heart of a lot of our business opportunities in China. So we\u2019re very excited about both of those hubs that are opening here shortly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","I\u2019m asking about longer term use of railroad, and I believe you\u2019ve recently mentioned using rail for about 17% of freight line haul. Do you envision this increasing through the next couple of years? And maybe even beyond the freight segment, are you connecting anything through trade networks using rail? And maybe even stretching it a bit more, does rail make sense for SmartPost line haul at some point?","Bill Logue ","On the freight side, over the past three years, as you\u2019ve noticed, we\u2019ve grown our rail usage substantially, particularly on our economy offering. So that\u2019s worked out very well for us. We continue to look at lanes and adjustments we made this past July. And again, going forward, we\u2019ll continue to look at our network. You saw some of our purchase transportation growth this year, and again, that was due to our rail increases coming off in July. And again, we\u2019ll tweak and adjust our network as we see appropriate for the most efficient way to run our business.","Henry Maier ","We used a little bit of rail throughout the year. In the month of December, our rail usage jumps up. In fact, I think this month it\u2019s about 7% of the miles that we run. And that would include ground and SmartPost. We use it where it makes sense. We won\u2019t use it where it degrades our service, so that\u2019s how we think about this in our network.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our final question from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony Gallo - Wells Fargo ","If I look at FedEx express on the expense side, excluding fuel, you did a nice job year over year, but you\u2019re still up a fair amount versus fiscal 2Q \u201912. And part of that looks like it\u2019s in SG&A, despite the fact that you\u2019ve made some changes there. You\u2019re using more purchase transportation as the mix changes. How much of that was pension year over year and how much of that is pension versus, say, fiscal \u201912?","Dave Bronczek ","On the purchase transportation, remember a lot of FTN expenses are in the purchase transportation. And the revenues are up in there too. We made that change last year. In terms of our overall expenses, as you can see, they\u2019re actually performing very well. Pension should have been a positive for us in the quarter.","Operator","thank you. That does conclude our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mickey Foster for any additional or closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for participating in FedEx Corporation\u2019s second quarter earnings release conference call.

Welcome to those on the call today. First of all, let me extend our thoughts and hopes for a rapid recovery to those affected by recent natural disasters, Hurricane Florence in the United States and two typhoons in the North Pacific.","Turning to the first quarter. FedEx delivered higher earnings driven by a solid execution of our business plan and a strong U.S. economy. We believe we will continue to increase revenue, cash flows, earnings and returns in fiscal 2019 and beyond. We\u2019re very optimistic about our prospects for profitable growth and remain confident we\u2019ll reach our goal to improve FedEx Express operating income by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017. Our thanks go out to our more than 425,000 plus team members worldwide, their dedication to the Purple Promise that simply states, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","Now Dave, Raj and then Alan will offer a few insights and then we\u2019ll move to questions and answers. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Thank you and good afternoon. We announced a very important initiative last week. We will be operating our FedEx Ground U.S. networks six days a week all year, not just at this upcoming peak season. We anticipated this and are prepared for customer demand in the rapidly growing ecommerce market. Our significant investments in automation over the last decade has given us the flexibility and speed in the network to continue to expand even while we are reducing capital spending at FedEx Ground. Also, we continue to make very good progress on our integration of TNT. The integration of our sales team is well underway, and we will complete the sales integration this fiscal year.","During the first quarter, integration activities began in all of our major markets in Europe, and we anticipate the completion of the integration in the Middle East at the end of this calendar year. Our integration of TNT continues to expand our network, improve our global capabilities and our competitive posture and of course, increase profitability. We are very confident in reaching the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion of operating income improvement that Fred just talked about at FedEx Express in FY \u201920 over FY \u201917.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Raj.","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. We are seeing solid economic growth, especially in the U.S. Growth in jobs and incomes are keeping confidence high and driving positive trends in the consumer spending and retail sales. The industrial sector continues to perform well and outlook for business investment is strong. Internationally, we do not see a repeat of last year\u2019s synchronized global growth story as the Eurozone and China slow. However, we expect another year of sound global growth as the economic cycle plays out. Global manufacturing and business investment continue to expand.","Regarding trade matters, current tariffs impact a small portion of our volume coming out of China. However, the uncertainty surrounding the issue is not helping and thus has a broader impact on the market. It\u2019s important to note that our revenue on the China-U.S. lane bidirectionally represents 2% of our total FedEx revenues, and the tariffs impact only a small portion of that.","It\u2019s very difficult to predict the future course of tariff implementation. We\u2019re monitoring the situation very carefully and we\u2019ll adjust our strategies according to market conditions. Clearly, we continue to support lower trade barriers for all our customers.","And one thing remains very clear, we see continued success with our pricing strategies as we grow composite volumes and yields at each transportation segment. We have been successful at holistically managing base yields and surcharges including fuel. This month, we implemented changes to non-conveyable surcharges and the fuel surcharge table, the details of which can be found on our Web site. We are fast approaching the holiday peak season and preparations are well underway. We forecast another record year with four Mondays during peak expected to be among the busiest days in the history of FedEx.","Once again, we are not applying a residential peak surcharge. FedEx delivers a millions of small and medium size businesses every day, and we want to support these customers as e-commerce continues to grow and becomes a major part of their business. We continue to have excellent momentum with our small and medium customer segment. Our sales and marketing teams are out executing the competition and our pricing strategy for small customers is proving successful.","To further support the influx of e-commerce volume, we continue to invest in our extensive retail network, and we will have more than 12,000 FedEx total locations for this year's peak season. For our customers who want to proactively take control over their shipments, especially during the upcoming peak season, they can customize Express and Ground deliveries to any of these FedEx total locations through FedEx Delivery Manager, not only improving value, safety and convenience, but also reducing our cost.","And let me now turn the call over to Alan Graf for his remarks. Alan?","Alan Graf","Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon everyone. For the quarter, adjusted earnings were $3.46 per share, up 38% year-over-year. Financial results benefited from higher volumes, increased yields and a favorable net impact of fuel at all of our transportation segments. Net results benefited by $0.50 per diluted share as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, primarily from a lower statutory income tax rate.","Higher variable compensation accruals and accelerated wage increases negatively affected results this quarter by $170 million or $0.48 per diluted share, driven by lower accrual levels last year for variable compensation due to the effect of the cyberattack at TNT, which negatively impacted our results, and the accelerated wage increases for certain hourly employees in the U.S. following the enactment of the TCJA. All of our transportation segment operating margins would have been up year-over-year excluding these impacts.","While strong international volume growth reflects a recovery from the TNT cyberattack last year, the impact to operating income was partially offset by shifting service mix and the timing of variable compensation, aircraft maintenance and merit increases. As we continue to grow package volume, our revenue and overall operating income will benefit. We remain committed to achieving $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in operating income improvement at Express. Other details about our segment results are in the 10-Q which was filed this afternoon. I would like to thank my accounting and legal teams for the extra work that they put in to get you this information earlier than ever before.","Regarding our outlook, we are raising our EPS guidance for FY '19 and reaffirming our other financial targets. We are projecting adjusted earnings of $17.20 to $17.80 per diluted share for FY '19, up from $17 to $17.60. The increased guidance range is due to strong U.S. economy and continued traction on our revenue management initiatives. We expect operating profits to be up year-over-year for the corporation in an all of our transportation segments. We are reaffirming our revenue growth target of approximately 9% and adjusted operating margin of approximately 8.5%. These forecasts assume moderate economic growth and stability and global trade.","Our adjusted forecasts are before year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments and exclude expenses related to the TNT Express integration as applicable. Our forecast for our adjusted FY '19 effective tax rate is approximately 25% before year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments. This forecast assumes current TCJA interpreted guidance, which is subject to change based on future guidance. Details on recent developments are outlined in the 10-Q.","TNT integration expenses are expected to be $459 million. Capital spending is expected to be $5.6 billion or about 8% of projected revenues. Our cash flows and returns are improving with our earnings growth. Contributions to our primary pension plans in FY '19 are not required. All the contributions we make to these plans this fiscal year are voluntary and will be significantly lower than last year. We repurchased $625 of million stocks during the first quarter and increased our dividend for FY '19 by 30%.","Now, I will turn it over to Fred to moderate the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Fred Smith","Well, Alan, since we've got you on the grid why don\u2019t I give you the first three questions and then I'll key one up about Blockchain to Rob Carter who is some place out in the Ether. So following the pension accounting restatement, can you please give us updated long-term margin targets by segment, that's from Scott Group, Wolfe Research?","Alan Graf","After giving this a lot of thoughts, Scott, we decided to stop giving segment margin projections. The way we operate with business on a portfolio basis and the way we allocate our costs depending on how we do those pricing decisions are impacting those. And I think getting down oin the weeds on that is not as important as where we are for the corporation as a whole. But as we stated in our long-term financial goals, we'll continue to target double-digit operating margins for the corporation as a whole. And based on what I just told you about where we think operating income margins will be this year, it would have been very close to double-digit had it not been for the change in pension accounting. And by the way, I'm sorry I didn\u2019t get the Blockchain question.","Fred Smith","So Alan, Scott Schneibergur of Oppenheimer would like to know. What strategies are you able to employ to offset the earnings impact from a substantial slowdown in global trade?","Alan Graf","Well as always, we have several operational levers we are able to adjust should global trade slow down. These included adjusting on network capacity through flat reductions temporarily parking aircraft, decreased reliance on purchase transportation and other network adjustments. We can flex our overall network up or down by offense or defense. And our continued integration allows us even further flexibility and efficiency from a network perspective.","Fred Smith","From David Vernon, Alan, how is Express post the profit improvement plans better able to manage through macro shocks?","Alan Graf","We've constructed the networks to be much more flexible in years past, and any shock we\u2019re able to, I think react to very effectively. Remember, we\u2019re still trying to replace old aircraft, for example, that simply could be parked and not flown during this time. We have use of other peoples\u2019 assets in our Express network that are flying traffic around for us. We have a significantly high level of purchase transportation by design as part of our expense structure. All those can be flexed down very rapidly. We also have an ability to change our order schedule of our new aircraft deliveries to accommodate something should something like that happen.","Fred Smith","And then finally, Alan, should we expect FedEx to generate positive free cash flow and add an increasing rate over the next three years? That\u2019s from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.","Alan Graf","Yes. And to clarify, we are generating free cash flow and it is increasing. We expect it to grow significantly this year and expect to see increasing free cash flow in the future as we realize returns on our network investments. We continue our strategy of balancing capital allocation with returns to shareholders. Since FY \u201914, we have bought back 73.1 million shares for $11 billion and increased dividend significantly this year. We expect our stock buyback program and dividend increases to continue. In addition, the well funded status of our U.S. pension plan and lower integration spending at TNT beyond FY \u201920 will also improve cash flow.","Fred Smith","Rob, wherever you might be, how well the use of Blockchain to negotiate logistics transactions change the way FedEx does its business? That\u2019s from David Campbell of Thompson Davis. Rob?","Rob Carter","Good afternoon. Thanks David. I think that there is an opportunity to usher in pretty fundamental changes in logistics chain using Blockchain technology. The first one is that custodial chains are very likely to extend beyond our direct custody of a shipment from the pick up to the delivery. The prominence on item before it came into FedEx\u2019s hands and then custody once it\u2019s delivered at the end delivery point for us is very likely to be how Blockchains work, showing the very important prominence of the shipments such as the pharma shipment to know that its source was exactly what the end customer expected it to be.","The second big area of potential impact is Blockchain\u2019s smart contracts capability. Blockchains have the ability to embed contractual notions into that custody chain, things like specific delivery commitments, dispute resolution, all of those things can be embedded into a Blockchain to help satisfy the additional transactions that go on around the space of a shipment. So those are the two big ones that I think are likely to change over the course of the next few years.","Fred Smith","We've got several now for Dave Bronczek. Please update us on your ability to fill peak season and ongoing needs for pilots, sort workers and drivers? From Helane Becker of Cowen and several other people have similar questions. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Let me begin by saying that FedEx anticipates, as Raj already mentioned, record amounts of volumes this year like we had last year. The four Mondays in December will all be record volumes for FedEx. So we anticipate that already and have been working on it actually all year. FedEx has announced last week that we'll be hiring 55,000 additional team members for this holiday season to ensure we deliver the Purple Promise that has already been mentioned as well.","The majority of these team members, however, will stay on with FedEx after the holiday peak or become permanent employees of FedEx. Our HR planning occurs year round, our peak hiring, our efforts our year-round. I can tell you that right after the holiday season is over, we start the process in every operating company. So that we can deliver once again world-class service and that\u2019s what we'll do again this year.","Fred Smith","So Dave, how much additional volume could the ground network handle without significant investment? That\u2019s from Todd Fowler of KeyBanc.","Dave Bronczek","As you saw last week, we announced the six day Ground. It's a huge issue for us and a big, big deal for our customers. We expect to gain significant capacity and volume without adding any more facilities, by shifting to a year-round six day operation. Additionally, we'll increase the focus on innovation and technology such as automation, robotics, route planning. Many of you have seen this already in our hubs and Ground and Express, significant opportunities for our employees too. We have a lot of our employees now that are very pleased with the extra hours and the flexibility to the hours. So this is a very big opportunity for FedEx.","Fred Smith","So in the same vein, how should we quantify the incremental capacity at Ground related to the six day -- to adding a six-day of operations? That\u2019s from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Well, it's sort of the same points I just made, Allison. For Ground, it opens up a lot of capacity and existing opportunities for our current employees to get more hours and more flexible hours. But we'll be able to handle a lot more volume without more CapEx. So it\u2019s very incremental for us on the profit side. It's really actually very good for us on service but less so the volumes flow through our network more evenly. So it was a big deal big enough that we thought we should send it out and be announcing it last week.","Fred Smith","So Dave, when comparing B2C to B2B shipments within Ground, is there any meaningful difference in total transit time? Ben Hartford of Baird.","Dave Bronczek","There is really no big significant difference. However, obviously, it is a difference that you see you a lot shorter zone now for B2C volume and a lot of retailers are moving their inventory closer and closer to customers, they've been doing that for many years now. It's important to note that for us at FedEx, especially FedEx Ground that the average package at Ground whether its B2B or B2C is between 64% 65% of it is delivered in two days or less for us today.","Fred Smith","And finally, Dave, can you discuss some of the differences in the degree of automation between older and newer facilities?","Dave Bronczek","Yes, I'm thrilled to be able to answer that question. And it is a big difference. We have strategically been investing, and many of you know this and many of you have seen our facilities, and I'll just use the FedEx Ground facility for example. Over the last 15 years, we put a lot of capital into these facilities where 130 plus of them are automated. And what that means is you can walk into one of our facilities, and it's the state-of-the-art technology, state-of-the-art robotics in terms of unloading, autonomous tugs, yard management systems, geo-fencing, GPS system. It's truly remarkable you'll hardly see our any employees at all. And the speed to which our package gets through our hubs now is unbelievable. So we're able to handle a lot of volume especially at peak because of all the investments we've made over all the years.","Fred Smith","So now we have several teed up for Raj. Can you discuss the current and potential impact of tariffs levied on China? That's from Chris Wetherbee of Citi and several others have similar questions.","Raj Subramaniam","I covered some of this in my opening remarks. The China-U.S. lane bidirectionally represents roughly 2% of our total revenues. The tariffs that have been implemented so far only accounts to less than 10% of that volume. And then if new tariffs are implemented on the 200 billion dollars of import that's being considered that might impact roughly a quarter of those 2%. So that gives you a frame of reference for what we are talking about in the context of the whole enterprise. Now having said that, the uncertainty around the issue and the potential for additional tariffs is affecting the market and we're beginning to see some of the economic activity in China starting to moderate as a result of that.","Fred Smith","So are you seeing any supply chain adjustments from customers because of tariff concerns? That's from Matthew Russell. I hope I pronounced it right of Goldman Sachs.","Raj Subramaniam","Matthew, I think we have not yet seen any significant ships in the customer supply chain. However, if the situation continues for any amount of time, we do expect customers to diversify their supply chains and perhaps some of the trade patterns might change. And the good news here is that FedEx has got a large unparalleled global network that can flex and adjust and support our customer needs as they make their changes. I want to reemphasize the point that was made earlier by Alan and some of others that the scale and flexibility of FedEx will enable us to deliver strong results in enterprise despite any uncertainty on trades and tariffs.","Fred Smith","So Raj, here is one from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Response to UPS initiatives focusing on small and midsize businesses is his question. As FedEx gain share with small and midsize businesses over the past decade. If UPS becomes more aggressive in this market segment, how might FedEx respond? Is there meaningful risk of pricing pressure in this customer segment, if both large players are focused on growing with the same group of customers?","Raj Subramaniam","I can't directly comment on whatever competition does, but I believe the answer to your question is really yes. As I have covered in the opening remarks, small and medium segment business has been, is and will be a strong focus for us going forward and we have only accelerated in this regard. Why is that; is because we have very, very strong value proposition; we have a speed advantage; we have a very strong pricing strategy, a holistic pricing strategy; and to top it all off, we have a very strong sales and marketing team who are out executing in the competition. And as you all know, this is the most profitable segment so more business is better for us.","Fred Smith","So there are two questions here that are similar, so I am going to split this between Raj and Dave. The first part of it is from Brian Ossenbeck of JP Morgan. Where are the largest opportunities for share gains with a combined TNT FedEx Network? And how far along is the combined entity in addressing those opportunities? I\u2019d give that one to Raj.","Raj Subramaniam","Brian, clearly the opportunities are very large. As you all may know and TNT and now FedEx has a fantastic Ground network that handles parcels and pallets in Europe. I mean TNT is a key player for intra-European ground markets and key domestic markets in Europe. Of course don\u2019t forget that TNT also has a terrific ground networks in Middle East, in Asia and Latin America. So when we combine that with FedEx\u2019s unparalleled inter-continental air system, we have a unique network that allows us to offer new value to our customers in a very cost effective manner.","And that opens up large international market segments and which are now extremely well positioned to gain significant share. And the good news here is we are well on our way to unlocking the value and we are pleased with the progress. As Dave talked about, we are progressing well on the integration and customers are already beginning to see this value. And all I can say here is that the sales and marketing teams in the world are very excited to see the progress and really provide new value for our customers.","Fred Smith","So somewhat similarly, Lee Klaskow, of Bloomberg Intelligence wants to know where the TNT integration with FedEx gives us some competitive advantage. Dave, do you want to talk about that?","Dave Bronczek","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. And obviously, one of the reasons we\u2019re so interested in this, we with TNT they didn\u2019t really have the reach into the rest of their global network, that\u2019s our strength. Our global network is our strength. And so for them and for their customers, they had great Ground services, as Raj just said. In Europe, they\u2019re now accessing our global network all around the world; Europe, Latin America, Asia, Canada, United States. So really for them and for other customers and telling us this all the time, this is fantastic news for them and this is a big growth opportunity for us.","Fred Smith","So from Chris Wetherbee of Citi to Alan, what are your plans for buybacks this fiscal year?","Alan Graf","Chris, the management team feels pretty strongly that probably one of the highest uses of our free cash flow is we continue to repurchase our shares. We\u2019re very confident about where we\u2019re headed in the next three to four years in terms of improving our cash flows and our margins and our competitive positioning. We\u2019re very excited about what\u2019s going on at Ground with this existing network and selling those assets and we\u2019ll start seeing some real improvement in that in the second half of this year and on into FY \u201920. So I am not going to get specific, but I\u2019d like to say it\u2019s a high priority and use of free cash flow.","Fred Smith","So I guess one for Raj with rollout of the Amazon Delivery Service Partner Network, is Amazon a more competitive threat?","Raj Subramaniam","As I mentioned in previous calls, Amazon is a long-standing customer of ours. However, no one customer represents more than 3% of our revenue and Amazon is not our largest customer. Now Amazon and other customers of ours have certain elements of the logistics in-sourced to deal with capacity issues, as well as inventory management. And while there has been significant media interest in what Amazon is doing to expand their in-source deliver capability, this should not be confused as competition with FedEx. The global infrastructure, the technology, the capabilities, knowledge, they're near to compete in our business, is quite extraordinary and we have built that up over 40 plus years. I'll just point you to the video at our Web site fedex.com\/dream where you can see further information in this regard. Thank you.","Fred Smith","So I'll take the last one here. This is from Donald Broughton of Broughton Capital. What are the top two or three areas domestically and internationally that make sense for FedEx to pursue in the next 10 years?","Well, referring back to that little video that\u2019s on the Internet, and I'd urge anybody interested in FedEx to watch it again go to fedex.com\/dream. And we have a new one that's going be put up on November the 1st, called, The Day of Possibilities. But when you watch the existing video much less than new one that\u2019s coming up, which we just viewed, you are immediately struck by the incredible size and scope of the FedEx Networks. There simply is nothing like them in the world. And we have the capability to basically attack the trillion dollar plus transportation and logistics market in a unique way. We worked very hard, as Alan has mentioned, over the years to develop a very flexible capability to do so.","We're well aware that supply chains change. If you were talking about supply chains 15 years ago, you'd be talking about a lot of things that are built in China that were built in Malaysia, and so they shifted. Well, as Raj said, they may be about to shift again. But we just have these unduplicated networks, which we developed over 40 years and we're very optimistic that we can deploy the resources to continue to grow the Company and increase our financial performance. And then as Alan mentioned, within that context, we, well over the next few years be generating a substantial amount of free cash flow, which we will deploy along the lines that Alan described to you. Now that\u2019s obviously exclusive of any corporate development activity, but we're very optimistic about that side of the business.","And the final thing that I would like to say before we sign off is there's a lot of conversation about the trade issues these days, and they are very worrisome. And clearly, the U.S.-China trade dispute that took on even greater prominence today with the administration's announcement, is worrisome to everyone. And the reason its worrisome is not because of just the individual dispute, it's because history is very, very clear that countries that pursue the most open markets are the ones that prosper the most and whose citizens' income increases the most. Mercantilism does not work. There is an example after example of it.","People that try to manage economies, particularly worldwide economies from a centrally managed perspective cannot do so. There're always parochial interests, whether it's dairy farmers in Canada or the chicken tax in the United States, which protects our pickup truck, most people don't realize it. But if you import a pickup truck in the United States, you pay 25% tariff. So overtime, the effort to try to dismantle those parochial interests has been herculean. And a lot of people over the years, the USTRs, Charlene, Barsheski, Carla Hills, Mickey Kantor, Michael Foreman and all of done the yeoman's work to do that. So I think that at the end of the day, history shows that people want to travel and trade.","And the final thing that I would point out to you that is unprecedented in human history. Every consumer in the world almost today, billions of people, have an unprecedented order entry device sitting in their pocket, they can see the wares of the world. And when you see this new film that goes up, The Day of Possibilities, you'll see this. These small customers in Columbia, and seafood producers in Maine and companies throughout the world that are now able to access consumers, because they have the capability to buy and sell with duties and taxes explained to them with the type of software we provide them, but most importantly, our networks that connect 99% of the world's GDP in one to two business days.","So I urge anybody that's interested in FedEx understand the fascination with these quarterly earnings and so forth. It's the much broader perspective that's important when you examine FedEx. And as all of us have said to you today, we're very optimistic about the Company and feel that we're flexible enough and deft enough to deal with, with whatever the marketplaces might bring us.","So with that, I'll turn it back to Mickey to close the meeting.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much. Bye.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today.

Welcome everyone to the discussion of our results for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2016, significant year for FedEx. We announced sometime ago we will complete the acquisition of TNT Express in the first half of calendar 2016, and we officially acquired the company on May 25. Greatly appreciate the outstanding work of our Express, Finance, and Legal teams in getting this transaction completed without conditions.","Annual revenue exceeded $50 billion for the first time and we're particularly pleased with our adjusted operating margin improvement of 1% year-over-year to 10% for fiscal year 2016, and our adjusted operating margin of 11.7% for the fourth quarter.","We believe we will continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flows, and capital returns over the next several years, given expectations for moderate economic growth and excluding TNT financial results and pension mark-to-market costs. Like to congratulate and thank all FedEx team members around the world for their dedication to our purple promise, which simply states I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","As we integrate the acquisitions of TNT, GENCO, and FedEx CrossBorder will continue making investments in modernizing the FedEx Express aircraft fleet and expanding the highly automated FedEx ground network to extend our leadership in the rapidly growing e-commerce market. These initiatives are integral to achieving our goals.","Let me close with a few brief remarks regarding Friday\u2019s successful conclusion of the Internet pharmacy case. First, I'd like to thank our inside and outside counsel. They did an outstanding job representing our Company. FedEx has always been innocent of these charges which should never have been filed. We strongly believed we should not admit to things we did not do and pay millions to avoid a criminal trial.","FedEx delivered packages for licensed pharmacies registered by the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration. Very few companies have done more during the last four decades to cooperate with law enforcement than FedEx as was true in these matters, and we will continue to do so.","We're especially proud of the hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members worldwide who demonstrate every day their commitment to provide our important services safely, reliably, and at all times ethically.","Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn, who will comment on the economy and our revenue followed by Alan Graf, who will discuss FedEx's financial performance. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with our economic update and outlook, and then we'll discuss business performance in each of the segments, and then I'll have some commentary on broader business trends.","On the economic front, we continue to see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S GDP forecast is 1.8% for calendar '16, which is 40 basis points lower than our forecast last quarter, and we forecast 2.4% for calendar '17, led by gains in consumer spending.","We expect industrial production to decline 0.6% in calendar '16, 120 basis points lower than last quarter, and increase 2.3% next year. Our global GDP forecast is 2.3% for calendar 16, 20 basis points below last quarter, and calls for 2.8% growth for calendar 2017.","Now a review of revenue volume and yield trends by segment. In the Express segment. U.S domestic average daily package volume was essentially flat in the quarter due to the decline in the deferred product category.","Yield per package increased approximately 1% year-over-year, despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yield grew 2.3%, primarily due to rate and discounts. Revenue grew 2.1% year-over-year driven by one more operating day and yield growth. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge, domestic revenue grew 3.7% year-over-year.","FedEx International Economy average daily volume grew 3.5%, while FedEx International Priority average daily volume declined 2.1%. International export revenue per package decreased 2.6% as lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates negatively impacted yields. Excluding fuel, international export Express package yield was slightly positive primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.","In the Ground segment, FedEx Ground revenue increased 20% in the quarter, driven by higher Ground volume and yield, and the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q4, primarily driven by continued growth after peak season for both residential and commercial deliveries.","FedEx Ground revenue per package increased 7% year-over-year in Q4 due to the recording of FedEx SmartPost revenues on a gross basis and higher base rates partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Excluding the impact of fuel, Ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 8.6% year-over-year, driven primarily by extra service charges and weight per package offsetting a decrease due to SmartPost volume mix.","FedEx Freight revenue increased 2.3% as average daily shipments increased 7.5% year-over-year, and revenue per shipment declined 5.3% year-over-year. As a reminder, Q4 in FY16 contained one more business day than Q4 in FY15. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability, and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers, and we also saw increased demand from our larger customers during the quarter.","Revenue per LTL shipment declined due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per package. Excluding the impact of fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 2.1% year-over-year due to lower weight per shipment.","Now I\u2019d like to take a few minutes to further discuss and address the growth of e-commerce which continues to outpace GDP growth both in the U.S and globally. E-commerce has become a way of life for consumers requiring goods around the world, but the success of e-commerce continues to be dependent on transportation companies\u2019 ability to reliably and quickly make residential deliveries around the world.","As we noted during our last conference call on earnings, more than 95% of e-commerce packages in the U.S are delivered by FedEx, UPS, and the United States Postal Service, with whom we have a strategic relationship to transport their priority mail. E-commerce would be impossible without these companies and our expansive networks. If you were to isolate the FedEx e-commerce business, it would become clear FedEx is one of the most profitable e-commerce companies in business today.","During the past quarter, we made significant investments in expanding our global transportation portfolio and e-commerce capabilities around the world including the acquisition of TNT, the introduction of FedEx cross -- and the introduction of FedEx CrossBorder. The TNT acquisition will transform the global transportation and logistics industry. It is the largest acquisition in FedEx history and instantly accelerates our European and global growth strategy.","FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe with a range of transportation options from Express to Economy for both parcel and freight. This significant enhancement to our portfolio in Europe helps not only our customers in Europe, but also provides benefits for customers around the world shipping into Europe. In addition, we will substantially enhance our capabilities globally by leveraging TNT's lower-cost road networks in different regions around the world.","While the integration will take time to fully execute, we have the benefit of similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common mission of providing superior service and value to customers around the world. FedEx CrossBorder offers e-commerce technology solutions that enables e-tailers to navigate common CrossBorder selling challenges such as regulatory compliance, secure payment processing, multiple currency pricing, credit card fraud protection, and also offers access to e-commerce shoppers around the world.","CrossBorder is the relaunch of Bongo International, the company FedEx acquired in 2014. When combined with our recent GENCO acquisition, we have significantly strengthened our e-commerce portfolio of services. Of course demand for e-commerce increases significantly each year during the peak holiday season and we're deep into preparations for the upcoming 2016 peak season. We're closely collaborating with large e-tail and retail customers to understand their peak shipping needs including geographic mix, and package characteristics, so that we can once again have our resources positioned and ready to provide outstanding service.","We will also be leveraging some new and evolving services to meet the heavy demand during peak, including FedEx Delivery Manager, FedEx SameDay and an expansion in FedEx Hold at Location Services. Delivery Manager allows U.S package recipients to customize home deliveries to fit their schedules including changing the time and location of the delivery, requesting a signature upon delivery, or leaving instructions for the courier.","FedEx SameDay city is available in 24 markets across the country offering customer same day service with uniformed FedEx drivers, branded vehicles, real-time tracking, and world-renowned FedEx reliability. FedEx Hold at Location offer secure package pickup at more than 2,400 FedEx locations including more than 1,800 FedEx office retail stores. These hold services allow customers to redirect packages for pickup and drop-off at FedEx and many other third-party locations.","One additional point as we continue to get questions concerning Amazon in the evolution of their transportation capabilities and needs. Amazon continues to be a valuable customer and they\u2019re among the large e-tailers that we stay in close dialogue with throughout the year to understand their transportation needs as they continue to experience significant growth and generate demand for FedEx transportation. Because of our close relationship with Amazon and close collaboration, we have a very clear and specific understanding of their needs across the FedEx portfolio during FY17, and further we expect them to be a significant customer for many years to come.","Having said that, it is important to remember that no single FedEx customer represents more than approximately 3% of total revenue. Finally, I'd like to mention the introduction of the new FedEx Freight Box, which makes transporting less than truckload shipment simple with improved flexibility, increased security, better shipment integrity and best of all no freight classification.","The FedEx Freight Box comes in two sizes, a standard freight box that requires a pallet to ship and a smaller freight box with an integrated pallet. The freedom to choose your freight box makes freight shipping accessible for any business, no matter the size. With the distance-based pricing structure, the FedEx freight box allows you to ship LTL avoiding the complex and antiquated pricing structure used in the industry. The Freight Box was introduced in selected markets with great success during the second half of FY16 and is rolling out to customers nationwide this month.","And now I will turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thanks, Mike for your very informative comments and good afternoon everyone. We had a great quarter. Adjusted earnings of $3.30 per diluted share increased 24% year-over-year and our adjusted consolidated operating margin increased 11.7% versus 10.5% last year. Among the operating companies, Express was the most valuable player of the quarter, posting an impressive double-double.","Operating income was 27% higher versus last year's adjusted income and operating margin climbed to a 11.3%. Operating income grew at Ground as average daily volume increased 10%, and Freight's operating income was unchanged. Growth at Express, despite essentially flat revenue per Q4 year-over-year is a strong testament to Express's continued yield and cost management efforts. Yield did have a positive impact year-over-year on the quarter, while currency exchange rate changes have little net impact. One additional operating day also provided a benefit. We expect Express operating income in FY17 to continue to improve, as we manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize our fleet, and drive productivity increases throughout our U.S and international operations. These benefits will be partially offset due to timing of aircraft maintenance events and one fewer operating day.","The [indiscernible] on our remarkable year was the acquisition of TNT Express. We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquire TNT on May 25, a few days before our fiscal year-end. Today is our 28th day of owning TNT. We have a solid integration plan that we are in process of validating with live data. Our senior leadership team is in place and we're partnering together in the marketplace for commercial opportunities to bring the best solutions for our customers. The transaction, financing, and integration planning expenses related to this acquisition were $132 million or $0.45 per diluted share in FY16, which consider certain non-tax deductible costs as a result of the closing of the acquisition. These expenses include TNT's operating results from the time of acquisition and are predominantly included in corporate eliminations and others in FY16.","In FY17, we will report the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT separately in two different segments. We will also provide an overview of the FedEx Express Group, which combines the two segments. And when the timing and complexity of the acquisition, presentation of TNT in our financial statements including the allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and we will likely change in future periods.","We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY17. TNT operates road transportation networks and delivers documents, parcels, and freight to over 200 countries. The strategic acquisition broadens our portfolio of international transportation solutions with the combined strength of TNT strong European road platform and our strength in other regions globally, including North America and Asia.","Prior to our acquisition, TNT announces outlook strategy aimed at doubling at adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency, and productivity and customer service. We plan to continue these profit improvement initiatives in FY17 and we will also begin activities to integrate operations.","Our focus will be on combining TNT strong European capabilities with our strength in other regions globally. Although we are in the very beginning of the integration process and are continuing to validate our information. We currently expect our FY17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million and integration costs to be around $200 million. However, the timing and amount of these costs is subject to change as our plans are refined.","Integration expenses including professional fees information-technology costs and intangible asset amortization related to TNT are expected to impact operating income and margin during FY17. We're very excited about the TNT acquisition and we will provide you updates on the operating results and integration cost on a quarterly basis going forward. We do expect TNT to be accretive to earnings in FY18.","Turning to our Ground segment, operating income grew year-over-year due to higher volumes and increased revenue per package, as well as the benefit of one additional operating day. These factors were partially offset by higher operating costs including network expansion expenses. Operating margin was lower due to the change in SmartPost revenue reporting. We expect Ground revenues and operating income to increase in FY17 driven by e-commerce volume growth and market share gains. We also anticipate continued yield growth to yield management programs including changes to our pricing for larger shipments. However, we anticipate Ground operating margin will be negatively impacted by higher operating costs in FY17, driven again by network expansion. Other operational costs may also impact margins as residential volumes grow from e-commerce.","Capital expenditures at Ground are expected to be about $2 billion in FY17, as we continue to make investments to grow our highly profitable network due to facility expansions and equipment purchases. The impact of the depreciation of these investments will continue to partly offset, earnings growth in FY17 at Ground.","At Freight, operating income was unchanged. As improved operating efficiencies higher revenue and an additional operating day were offset by increased salaries and employee benefits expense and the impact from lower weight per shipment. During FY17, we expect revenue from lower weight per shipment.","During FY17, we expect revenue, operating income, and operating margin improvement at Freight driven by continued effective yield management as well as modest volume growth from small and midsize customers. Freight earnings growth will also be positively impacted by improvement in productivity and further investments in technology.","We incurred a non-cash pre-tax mark-to-market pension accounting loss of $1.5 billion in 2016. Due to its effect on income before income taxes, the adjustment for mark-to-market accounting reduced our 2016 effective tax rate by 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate was 33.6% in fiscal '16, which is also favorably impacted by an internal corporate restructuring done to facilitate the integration of FedEx Express and TNT. It was offset by nondeductible costs incurred as part of the acquisition.","For FY17, we anticipating -- making contributions totaling $1.1 billion for our U.S pension plans. In FY16, we continue to buy back shares repurchasing 2.7 billion of our common stock through open market purchases. From FY14 through FY16, we repurchase 63 million shares of FedEx common stock and return more than $8.8 billion to shareholders at an average price of $140 per share. As of May 31, 2016, we had approximately 19 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. Two weeks ago we announced that we were boosting our dividend by 60% for a total of $0.40 per share per quarter.","Turning to our outlook, based on the outlook that might describe from an economic standpoint in the momentum we have we project adjusted earnings to be $11.75 to $12.25 per diluted share for FY17 excluding TNT financial results, including integration of financing costs and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. Our expectations for earnings growth in FY17 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and global economic conditions. Due to our recent acquisition of TNT, FY17 will be a year of intense integration activities for our dedicated team at Express.","We're committed to the successful integration of these two great businesses. Meanwhile FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express.","Capital expenditures are expected to be about $5.1 billion in FY17 excluding TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures and FY17, which will include spending for network expansion at Ground as I discussed and the continued aircraft fleet modernization of Express. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, cash flows, returns and margins.","With that, we will open up for strategic questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","Fred Smith","Okay. This is Fred Smith speaking. Mickey asked me to take several of the questions that were sent to us in advance. They were 43. There may have been one or two others that have come in on the Internet and Mickey will be looking at the calls coming in and we will try to answer many of these that we can. There were a lot of questions in the 43 that were submitted, that we won't address for one reason or another and let me deal with those. One there were a number about Brexit. The reality is we don't have any better crystal ball than anybody else. So we don't think it's appropriate for us to be speculating on what may happen in the United Kingdom and should Brexit take place. Obviously, we will be telling folks what we intend to do to adjust to a new situation, but it's certainly premature.","Second, lots of questions on TNT. We will take a number of them, but quite a few are focused on areas where it's just too early in the process for us to deal with. For instance, what are the implications of the South American Road Network of TNT and the Southeast Asian Road Network of TNT and our Regional Presidents and Express Management are working through that with the integration team. So we\u2019re going to defer those until we get a little bit further along.","Third, there are a fair number that are hypotheticals about what new services we might offer or adjacencies and of course that\u2019s not in our best interest to answer from a competitive standpoint. So, now let me get to some of them that do get the nail on the head. With the acquisition of TNT, can you discuss major IT requirements going forward, specifically are the current systems robust enough for the combined entity and are there any needs at the product service level. So I\u2019m going to ask our great CIO, Rob Carter to opine on this.","Rob Carter","Well, thanks, Fred. Obviously there are a lot of systems needs and integration needs that have lined up with regard to the TNT acquisition. This is our largest acquisition, but it is certainly not our first. We\u2019ve prepared diligently over the years with integrations of acquisitions in Mexico, Brazil, the U.K, Africa, India, and others around the world to become really quite good at the process of integrating customers, integrating products into the mix. We also have been working very hard on our systems here at FedEx to modernize and simplify them in ways that really position them to be very in effective integration activities. That\u2019s a key design point for the systems that we\u2019ve been building and pushing forward, and then lastly we've had a planning and execution team on the ground. With the teams, we've done very robust planning with regard to these integrations, including what it would take on day one which was executed flawlessly, what our needs are at day 100, and then as we go forward the preferred future state of the organization of systems that will be needed to operate with the combined entity. So we're very confident in the systems that we have, the team that we have, and the efforts that are underway to support our customers.","Fred Smith","Okay. Thank you, Rob. Allen, what was the primary reason for hiking the dividend? Does significant dividend increase indicate a shift in preference to returning capital through dividends rather than buybacks and how should we think about the volume of share buybacks in the next few years compared to FY14,'16 levels? This question comes from Allison Landry of Credit Suisse and I should've mentioned question about the IT integration was from John Barnes of RBC. Alan?","Alan Graf","Allison, thanks for the question. We've been talking about this for a number of years, how we wanted to be more aggressive in our dividend peace of our shareholder returns. And so we picked the 60% increase to try to get it up to a 1% or as close to 1% yield as we could which we think is an important milestone. I can't make any promises for a year from now, but we will look to continue to drive up our dividend and we will continue to buy back stock and will balance that with all the other needs that we have for capital in the in the Company, but we feel that that's an important part of our shareholder returns as well.","Fred Smith","Let me ask Dave Bronczek, this question, maybe a follow-up from Alan. It's also related to TNT, how long do you think the TNT integration will take. UBS recently said they expect it would take 1000 people five years, what\u2019s your margin outlook for the EU business longer-term. Is there a structural reason you can't add margin summer at UBS [ph] international business over time. What are the milestones? Well, that's our entire business plan, but Dave Bronczek will give you as much of it as he can. Okay, Dave. ","Dave Bronczek","Thanks for asking and that is my business plan. Let me just say, and Rob Carter said a lot of it already, we\u2019ve had a team on the Ground, our best of our best people in operations, in sales, in marketing, in IT, and really across the board and they've been working for many, many months now. And so, what we\u2019re coming away with is a company that we believe is going to be very, very strong and powerful into the mix with FedEx. If you remember, I ran FedEx Europe for many years and TNT was my partner over there in the outlying area. So, I already knew that their service was good. I already knew that their culture aligned up with our culture. I was over there on day one for the integration, 28 days ago and I can tell you that they\u2019re excited and we\u2019re excited. So going forward you\u2019re going to have the integration take place that needs to take place, so that we make sure we do it right. And when we come out of the integration process, we have the most powerful service, cultural for people, and profitable business that you can have over there in Europe and that will be the case.","Fred Smith","That question was from Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie, and she had a follow-up here before we take call from Mickey. Can you give us a sense of what you're planning to spend and dollar and project terms as you invest in the TNT network?","Dave Bronczek","Well, we -- I said earlier, we think about $200 million of expense -- integration expense and about a $100 million of integration capital, but it's very early days. Our team is extremely excited and there were a lot of great ideas out there that looked at high returns and actually the demand probably is even higher for that, but we\u2019re going to have to channel that so that we don't do any -- anything too fast and have some sort of a breakdown or whatever. So, we will be getting that as we go. Again, I have a pretty good idea about the outlook as on its own about what TNT plan to finish it here through calendar '16, but we're working right now on finalizing their plan or what the integration will do that outlook plan and carry it all the way through to May 31 of 2017. And so we will be talking to you about that in the September timeframe.","Mickey Foster","Okay. We will now take questions, live questions on the call.","Operator","Thank you. Our question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering could you clarify whether directionally you expect margin improvement at both Express and Ground in fiscal '17 in spite of the negative impacts from the TNT integration and the grounds network expansion costs that you highlighted?","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me take that question on a broader front, because this is one of my hot buttons as you probably know. We don't manage FedEx Corporation trying to maximize each segment margin each year. If we did that, we would never be able to take advantage of this broad portfolio in the cross-selling that's available to us. So sometimes we're doing things like we're doing in ground now putting the SmartPost and ground operations together going to six day delivery on and on down the line at the same time we have the wins and our sales from the basic Express operation excluding some of the TNT issues that are -- that were just mentioned. So, our comments of improved margins and returns are at the corporate level. And it would be wonderful if every year we could have maximum margins either at all of our operating companies, but that\u2019s just not realistic. So you want to put any more color in at, Alan?","Alan Graf","I'd say we're putting a significant amount of long-term capital into Ground. We did in '16, we\u2019re even increasing it in '17. That has a pretty hard drag. We are also converting from to our -- to our model which also has some drag, and we\u2019re putting in new services that take a while to roll out and develop. So, I\u2019m not going to sit and say where the Grounds margin is going to go up or down, because we\u2019re going to just manage to -- we think the long-term growth needs a [indiscernible] in '17, but I\u2019m sure that the operating income is going to go up. And to Express, if you exclude TNT absolutely we are on an improved margin and operating income level and we will again maybe talk about that more later.","Mickey Foster","Any other question? Okay.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS","Tom Wadewitz","Yes. So, let's see I think you -- I know Fred you want to talk about the margins together, but just going back when you -- whatever it was I think like four years ago so you had an Express improvement plan, you\u2019ve had a lot of great execution on that, and you talked about a $2.8 billion target. Would we assume that in fiscal '17 you're still on track for that or would you just say, don't focus on that anymore because that's not the way we run business going forward. You just had real optimistic comments on that in the past and kind of running ahead of track. So I just wondered if you had kind of a brief comment on that or even a look forward going beyond 2.8? Thank you.","Dave Bronczek","Hey, Tom, this is Dave Bronczek into the question. Yes, we're very optimistic going forward. Alan has already said it. It's in our DNA. Now we been successful with our profit improvement plan. It's -- it continue to roll out, all five of the pillars are doing great. We beat the plan. Execution of quarter earlier than we thought and yes it's in Allen's outlook, Express is going to continue to roll. So on the operating profit side, yes up. On the margin side, yes up.","Mickey Foster","Thank you. Take another call from -- the live call.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, great. Thanks, guys. I wanted to ask you about TNT, and then thinking about some of the potential opportunities for synergies. So Alan, I know you mentioned fiscal 2018 highly accretive, when you think about sort of where some of these opportunities. I understand, I think revenue getting put into the system as a big part of it, what you think about the cost side. Can you walk us through on your thoughts on where some of those targets might be and when you might be able to get them?","Alan Graf","Yes, I said accretive in '18, just to be sure, because there may be some things that we want to do early on in '18 that we don't get done in '17, but it will be accretive in '18, Chris and I think obviously the European road network is the gym significantly lowering Express's cost for intercontinental pickup and delivery, allows to be much more competitive in Europe, than would be able to be in the past. I'm seeing -- I think in the tax area we're going to get some good synergies. I have no doubt about that. I\u2019ve underestimated what we're going to get on the sourcing side of the house and I think we\u2019re going to see great productivity as we integrate these network state.","Dave Bronczek","Yes, Alan is right about all of that. I\u2019ve looked at it now for a lot of months and they have the best road network in Europe by far. When you layer all of our international businesses around the world coming in to Europe at that efficient productive, low-cost network and you add it to the European network on its own, all of a sudden you start multiplying the benefits in there, they\u2019re very high. On top of that, we actually have a very excited sales force between their team and our team and we've been meeting with them. I think we\u2019re going to see a lot of benefits there that we actually hadn't really added into the equation yet. They\u2019re going to be coming in, and of course the sourcing. So, I think on all fronts we're going to end up with one powerhouse in Europe going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Salmon","Good evening, guys. Alan, a quick clarification with regard to the fiscal '17 guidance. I\u2019ve been getting a bunch of emails from client who are -- in fact I\u2019m little bit confused as well, when you're guiding to the current guidance, does it include the $200 million of integration costs you're expecting with TNT?","Alan Graf","The 11.75 to 12 on the quarter is nothing from TNT.","Fred Smith","Yes, let me make sure you understand that comment that was just made. There's nothing in that guidance pro or con from TNT. So, obviously we picked up the TNT revenues and whatever profitability they have plus the integration expenses, that's what I've meant when I started early on by saying it's very early days with us and we will update this in September. But I will say one thing here that it's obvious to me looking at some of the questions and some of the reports that have been published there's this sort of underlying theme that TNT is its own business and it's had these low margins and so that's going to go forward. The whole rationale of buying TNT, in fact it's right in the middle of this whole e-commerce debate. In this business the number one item after the line haul in upstream systems is delivery density, cost per stop, the number of stops per hour and so forth. So the two plus two equals seven equation, so to speak, of us buying TNT is extraordinary. And that's why Alan says to you with such authority as we integrate these PUD networks and take advantage of the unmatched surface networks of TNT, there is going to be a tremendous opportunity to increase the margins in earnings in the Express segment. So, we know we are going to have about $200 million in integration expense. We can't tell you exactly when it is, but offsetting that are going to be the TNT revenues and the profitability of their existing business on a go forward basis. So I hope that clarified it a bit.","Let me take another couple of -- three of these Internet questions submitted in advance. David Vernon of Bernstein. How important are store replenishment activities in the FedEx portfolio services as e-commerce take share from traditional retail. Is there a risk that demand for any set of services falls off in a consequential manner? Mike and Henry, you want to comment on that?","Mike Glenn","Commercial Ground delivery and LTL delivery to stores is an important part of our business. I would just say and remind everyone that today e-commerce is about 10% of total retail and are growing faster than traditional retail. Traditional retail is still growing. So, we don't expect any major impact in terms of our volumes going to the retail. As a matter of fact, we think there may be opportunities going forward as omnichannel plays began to be more prevalent and e-commerce strategy involves pickup at the store level. So, we think there's an opportunity there. I\u2019m quite comfortable with our position.","Henry Maier","The only thing I would add is that historically when you get close to peak we\u2019ve seem B2B business drop-offs and convert mostly to B2C less peak because of the trend toward stores being used is e-commerce fulfillment sites. We actually saw our commercial traffic through the month of December stay fairly strong.","Fred Smith","Let me say a couple of other things which I think may be informative to the people that are interested in the segment, in FedEx. We know from research that the millennial generation, the largest generational cohort in American history is not going to stop going to stores. In fact, we had a wonderful presentation about just a couple of weeks ago at our Board Meeting. So, e-commerce is fantastic and its going to continue to grow and we intend to be a major player in that space. But as Mike just said, it's not going to --- in our opinion and in the research from very credible sources, going to eliminate retail. What it may do is change the character of retail. And one of the things that you see happening are very focused, integrated product in-store networks too that come to mind that are just fantastically successful are [indiscernible] which is a company that's located in Spain and well-known for its fast cycle small shipment replenishment of its stores are able to turn on a dime of what's selling and move it around the world. And in Japan a great company called UNIQLO [ph] does the same sort of thing. So as these types of retail operations continue to proliferate, there will be a fair amount of B2B business and as Mike said remember of all retail e-commerce is now about 10%, growing fast, taking share, but it's going to be a long time before retail is threatened. And B2B meaning the underpinnings of the business world medical production, automotive, and things like that that in the main is not going to be diverted to e-commerce anytime soon and that is the backbone of the FedEx networks.","Let me take one more here while we\u2019re queuing up another call. Demand for final mile service by the USPS is out growing demand for traditional package services, driven in part by the popularity of SmartPost. Does FedEx see any risk or opportunities associated with USPS's ability to invest and keep pace with that demand. Mike, Henry you want to take that one?","Mike Glenn","Well, clearly the U.S. Postal Service did face some challenges going forward with the dramatic growth of the e-commerce and we won't speculate on how they deal with that, but we see e-commerce as a tremendous opportunity. At some point it may make more sense for us to deliver a lot of the SmartPost packages in our network as Henry's talked about. We certainly have the technological capability to do that and when we do that our cost goes down. So, we think we're pretty well prepared.","Fred Smith","Alan what level of debt, capital or debt to EBITDA should we be thinking about over the long-term for the Company? And there are a number of questions about future CapEx. So let me just lump all that together into a balance sheet question for you.","Alan Graf","Well, balance sheet is strong. Our credit metrics are I think -- we are at -- we\u2019re a Company with the growth opportunities that we have need to be, and we intend to work on improving those over the next 24 months. So I think I've been in the financial markets from a debt standpoint a lot in the last couple of years, and we will probably take a little break on that, because as I said, we think, we know we have the cash flow coverage for what we're trying to do. So, going forward we've always said we're a capital intensive growing transportation company. We think the sweet spot for CapEx is 6% to 8% of revenue. Next couple of years we\u2019re going to be above that basically because we're re-fleeting, we're expanding Ground as rapidly as we can, as efficiently as we can and we got the TNT integration put together. But having said that, it's very manageable with what's in front of us. As I said, we are going to continue to increase earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. And we have been improving our ROICs and we\u2019ve been definitely improving our return on equity, but at the end of the day, that's not the most important metric. Most important metric is shareholder return. So, over the last five years we have had a share price return of 88%, which is a CAGR of little bit over 14.1% as compares to 53 for UPS, 63 for S&P 500, and 47.5 for the Dow Jones Transports. That's the number that's the most important for our shareholders and the same goes for total return. And when it go back longer-term, last 15 years our total return to shareholders have been 377.6%, UPS has been 170. So, while ROC and ROE are -- ROIC and ROE are nice metrics, they know win the ballgame.","Operator","Right. And our next question is from Jack Atkins from Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for the time. Just a couple of things here on the Ground side. The $2 billion in CapEx in FY17, would you characterize that as sort of peak CapEx for the Ground segment this cycle, and if not how should we think about that? And then, could you give us an update on the integration of SmartPost in the Ground. What major milestones have been achieved there so far and sort of what additional items do you expect to accomplish in FY17?","Mike Glenn","Well, let me just say this Jack, we think that FY17 this should be the peak. It's not going to drop much off of this going forward based on the growth we're seeing and the expansion we have planned. And I\u2019d like to remind everybody that our volume grew 10% year-over-year and on an average daily volume basis our volume is double over the last 10 years. So you have to expand CapEx to build the capacity and you just run the business day-to-day here. On the SmartPost side, we\u2019re well along. We haven't integrated all facilities yet and that's largely due to the fact that the growth in that service has been such that we\u2019ve been a little bit constrained by Ground capacity and being able to move more volume into the network. But the two big IT events, the first occurred in January, which just allows us to begin manually matching addresses on packages and moving them into the Ground network for final delivery. And then, the next big event will come next summer where virtually we can have the system match addresses and move them. And as I\u2019ve explained in the past, you move a SmartPost package into the Ground network, you can deliver that incremental package for roughly 25% of the postage as opposed to tendering it to the USPS. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that. We're looking forward to get in the spring behind us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good evening everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the TNT and this a little bit longer-term, but obviously you spend a lot of the time on your people and your leadership teams. How do you manage that and kind of integrate those teams together and take the best in breed and strategically make sure that nothing gets kind of lost throughout this whole integration, practically on the customer and the service side?","Mike Glenn","That was a great question, and I just came back from Amsterdam and I can tell you that we\u2019ve already announced to our team at FedEx Express and the TNT folks as well, we have announced several Senior Vice Presidents in our new organization that came from TNT. The Head of Customer Service for all of our organization came from TNT. Some of their leaders in sales that will be our new team are from TNT, integrated with our folks. Their culture is very, very similar to ours. I can tell you that they're excited about joining our team and our culture, however, because we\u2019re more global than them of course. So, I think you're already seeing and I was told first-hand by all the people that I met with over there was thousands of people, how thankful they were that we were integrating their people with our people. It should be also said that that is the history of FedEx across-the-board. We've done it in every acquisition, we did at Flying Tigers, Caliber, and on and on. So they already kind of knew that, but now they know it for sure.","Fred Smith","Dave for you and Mike Glenn, how quickly will the TNT name go away so the entire international parcel and freight network is branded as FedEx? That\u2019s from David Ross at Stifel.","Mike Glenn","Let me take a shot at that first. This is Mike Glenn. I want to remind everybody that we -- when we acquired Caliber Systems, we actually operated RPS as RPS for about 18 months to two years. We did that because we wanted to make sure that the service that we were providing in the level of integration was consistent with the FedEx brand. We got a very detailed brand plan that is part of our integration efforts with TNT. There are certain countries where the TNT brand is quite strong and actually has a higher level awareness than the FedEx brand. There are other countries where the FedEx brand is stronger, there are other countries where they\u2019re approximately the same and we have a brand's transition scenario for all three of those. So it will take us some time, but we\u2019re going to follow what we know works and that is to be patient to make sure that we make these changes at the right time, because candidly we want to leverage the strength of the TNT brand during the integration.","Fred Smith","And Mike as long as we got you at the mike, David Ross also wants to know besides FedEx office locations, is FedEx expanding its pickup, drop-off presence in the United States? And if so, how?","Mike Glenn","The answer to the question is yes. We continue to expand our FedEx office locations through hotel and convention service opportunity site specific logistics opportunities. We also are expanding through our FedEx authorized ship center network. In addition to that, we leverage third-party opportunities such as office superstores. So we're continuing to focus on that as we know that\u2019s going to be a critical part of e-commerce going forward.","Fred Smith","Here is a question which issue is most concerned, FedEx in the coming election? I would say, we would have a hard time putting up a list of the things that don't concern us giving the two candidates position, but obviously we're concerned about the anti-trade rhetoric a lot of the anti-business positions and it's very worrisome. But hopefully after the election cooler heads will prevail. There are lots of things that need to be addressed. We talk about it many times, I mean, China has been quite mercantilist on its trade policies, but the way to deal with that is to negotiate which I don\u2019t think not to threat them or take all of the huge benefits of trade and throw them away. We have thousands and tens of thousands of highly compensated people working for FedEx in the United States are involved in trade, pilots, mechanics, customs clearance people, pickup and delivery personnel, that's the story that never gets told when the tragedy of a local plant closing gets put on the TV. So I'd be happy to debate the mass benefits of global trade with anybody that wants to do it, but we're very concerned about the positions of both parties in trade, in particular.","Operator","Would you like to take a question from the phone?","Mickey Foster","Yes.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. Our next question is from Helane Becker with Cowen. And Helane, if you could please check your mute function. It looks like Helane must have stepped away. So next we have David Ross with Stifel Nicolaus.","David Ross","Yes, good afternoon everyone. This question for Mike Ducker. On the LTL side, wanted to know why yields and revenue per shipment on the economy shipments are 27% higher than those on priority shipments, when we think that the priority would be more expensive or high revenues in the economy?","Mike Ducker","David this should be the last score that you have to deal with that. Frankly the -- that is a change in reporting that we made when we took spot shipments out of priority and put them into the economy bucket, and that should normalize next quarter. So that was done last June.","Fred Smith","I have a Internet question from Ravi Shanker about LTL. We are doing here as long as Mike's answering questions. How would you characterize the LTL environment specially in terms of pricing and competitive actions.","Mike Ducker","Right now I don't think there is any secret. We're not trading in a very robust market. The industry shipments have been somewhat sluggish this year. However, I would characterize it as very competitive market, but rational and that's how I would characterize it.","Fred Smith","And from Kevin Sterling of BB&T, what benefit are you seeing in LTL from the 48 inch odd freight surcharge?","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. As you know we just implemented that change to June 1, so we're only a few weeks into that. It's premature to comment on a potential benefits and in fact we actually don't expect to see a lot of benefits. We expect those shipments that that those characteristics to continue to move primarily in the Ground network, although there could be a few that move over to LTL.","Fred Smith","And Mike, Kevin also wants to know about Walmart now offering a two day subscription service for free shipping, similar to Amazon prime. Walmart is going to use more regional carriers for last mile delivery, if other retailers follow suite to keep with Amazon, how will this impact FedEx?","Mike Glenn","Well, first let me say Walmart is being a long time and growing customer. We\u2019ve been business partners with Walmart for many, many years. They\u2019re named carrier of the year on a consistent basis and I think they clearly value the service that we provide. And so I expect those trends to continue in terms of our growth with Walmart going forward. Regarding regional carriers, I mean the fact matter is regional carriers simply don't have the scope and the scale to be able to compete with the networks that make up 95% of the e-commerce shipments in the U.S, and as said before that would be FedEx UPS, United States Postal Service. So thoroughly there's a role for regional carriers and -- but they cannot compete in our opinion with FedEx over the long haul.","Fred Smith","There is a question from Helane Becker, who wasn\u2019t on the phone, but she's here [indiscernible] with her Internet question. [Indiscernible] old friend and I hope she's out having a Cabernet or something, but she ask an important question, is cost to converting options to firm orders for the six 767 freighters announced recently including in CapEx guidance? It is and I think it's important because there have been several things that been printed about this which indicate a lack of clarity out there about this when Dave and his team did the deal with the Boeing on 767s, it call for 10 firm airplanes per year over a number years to a total of 50, and then there were options with given dates and these six aircraft were the first options that became due and they are for delivery in fiscal year '19 and '20. The next options are not due until June of calendar year 2018 when Express will decide whether it wants to exercise a tranche of six and then the next one after that is June 19 with a tranche of six. Basic deal is we have 10 firm airplanes per year and the ability to go up to 16 airplanes. Now it\u2019s a little more complicated anatomy out years, but Dave you want to add anything on that?","Dave Bronczek","No, that\u2019s exactly right, Fred. The only thing I would add is that we're not adding capacity. And I think that's an important point. We\u2019re replacing the older planes that have less fuel efficiency and higher maintenance costs with these new more modern better planes. So they\u2019re not adding any capacity, just replacing.","Fred Smith","There is a question that's an important issue also from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley, which Henry and or Mike should answer. Oversize packages, last quarter you noted that the oversize packages are hurting your margins, have you been able to raise prices to offset the productivity loss? How your customers reacted to your adjustments to handling surcharge policy since June 1?","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. We made a number of pricing changes targeting this specific area starting with the change in unauthorized package charge, which is packages that are oversize and outside the characteristics of the Ground network in which we can handle at our discretion, we increase the surcharge there. We actually increase the surcharge on oversize packages. As noted, effective June 1, we increased surcharge on additional handling packages, additional handling surcharge changing the dimensions, the linked dimension from 60 inches to 48 inches. And we're considering other options that would be appropriate for that space. Having said that, that business continues to be robust, and a growing business and an important part of these e-commerce growth going forward. There are plenty of stories of companies out there that are being successful in non-traditional e-commerce retail segments, which would be packages that are typically larger like mattresses and other things like that. So we're happy to handle that, but we expect to be compensated for the service that we provide.","Fred Smith","Question from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Long question, but netted down, do you think it's feasible for someone to build an efficient national parcel network combines in-house air and truck linehaul between regions, but outsources the costly last mile delivery to either the U.S. Postal Service or the low-cost regional local couriers. Is that a competitive threat that concerns you? Answer to that is no, and the reason for that is that the upstream infrastructure to do that is enormous. I wish I could have a film or something to show you these facilities. Henry has got how many hubs with the new opening this year? Henry, 30?","Henry Maier","[Indiscernible].","Fred Smith","Yes, but total, what is that \u2026?","Henry Maier","37.","Fred Smith","37 hubs, I mean the size of these things are 250 to 300 acres. They handle tens of thousands of packages. The miles driven by FedEx Ground per year is 1.2 billion miles and freights in the same capacity level. So these upstream modes are very substantial and actually the last mile is the easiest thing to do if you don't have any upstream infrastructure. Problem there is that you cut yourself off from the tens of millions or billions of potential other shippers from every other part of the world that can be co-mingled to lower stop caused by having more stops per hour or more deliveries per stop. And that's the thing that we\u2019ve been consistently saying, I use the word fantastical, if you recall, because all of these analyses are either unmindful of that or they make assumptions that are erroneous when you actually understand what the real world numbers are. Let me just give you one statistic. I don't mean to impeach any one entity, but there have been several analyst reports that have come out and said will 767 airplanes can carry 120,000 pounds and so the calculations are done on that. The maximum cubic revenue payload of a 767, we're pretty damn good at this is far less than 120,000 pounds and if you load it up with just pallets, you're probably talking about two thirds of that if that the airport locations to process these things and the containers they\u2019re more difficult than the airplanes by far. So, I use this opportunity. Thanks for the question Bascome, but again to point out some of the analysis that's being done, that's not in accordance with the facts on the Ground, literally and figuratively.","Operator","Would you like to take a question from the phone?","Mickey Foster","Yes.","Operator","Right. We have a question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Unidentified Analyst","Good Afternoon This is Daniel [indiscernible] on for Scott. Thanks for the time. Could you discuss the operating efficiencies in freight in the quarter? Elaborate on that and what do you expect going forward?","Mike Glenn","Sorry. Yes, frankly earnings stayed flat. We had good revenue growth, but we were impacted from the well deserved pay increase and also some benefits from last year. Our expectation is double-digit margins at the freight company going forward. We will achieve that through balanced yield and volume growth, as well as adding technology into our network for the future.","Operator","Thank you.","Fred Smith","There are a couple of question we have, we\u2019re live on here. Go ahead.","Operator","Yes, thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty","Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just want one quick clarification on TNT and then a question on capital intensity. It's hard to keep beating [ph] at that horse here, but after you roll in the revenue and expected profitability from TNT offset that with the integration costs, [indiscernible] financing, TNT net is likely to be modestly dilutive in '17 and then accretive in '18, is that kind of the bottom line way to think about all of those different moving parts?","Fred Smith","I [indiscernible] told you about something Kelly. Nice try. I said I would come back in September and will be accretive in '18.","Operator","Thank you. We have a question from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good evening. Just on the Ground side, are we seeing a swap from the deferred at Express over to Ground, and can you talk if we\u2019re seeing that double-digit growth? Can you talk about the opportunity for additional cost efficiencies at Ground to improve the margins there?","Mike Glenn","Yes, this is Mike Glenn. Let me comment on the Express deferred numbers. What we saw during the quarter was a shift in mix from deferred actually to overnight from a couple large customers and we also had a couple of releases last year, which impacted the quarter. So the numbers were skewed a bit, it's not an issue where we're saying Express business trade down to Ground.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes, thank you for taking my question here. So Alan, you talk about TSR and I think a lot of people on this call are very interested in keeping FedEx TSR high going forward. But CapEx, cash flow returns are all interlinked here, I guess, as we look forward into e-commerce world is it just that the value proposition per package delivery keeps this business, in a low teens margin environment with a lot of capital intensity or now that you\u2019re close to a $60 billion global organization, I mean, you\u2019re one of the largest transportation companies in the world. Is there a significant ability looking for that you can really leverage the capital base to generate more consistent free cash flow and really get an equity valuation that the market would be willing to mark much closer to some of the quality industrial facts that are out there that are similar sized?","Alan Graf","It mean do better than the 5 and 50 numbers I just gave here, which are already pretty good. We make these capital investments for the long-term and I think our cash flow and EBITDA are fabulous and they're growing great and they\u2019re going to continue to grow great, but we\u2019re aggressive. I mean, when we bought TNT and you spend $5 billion on capital the same year, and you buy back a bunch of stock, that\u2019s aggressive. So, the confidence that we\u2019ve in our markets going forward and our ability to continue to improve our margins, I'm not concerned about being [indiscernible] and just staying in low numbers, we want to exceed those. And give Express a couple more years with TNT under its belt and stand back.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Ben Hartford","Yes, thanks. I guess, Alan to that points, on the dividend, obviously a big hike recently, is this now roughly 1% annual yield or this representative -- is this a representative target for you and the Company or are you still intend to move that dividend yield higher over time?","Alan Graf","Well, that would be my preference but I\u2019ve a Board of Directors. We\u2019ve got a lot of things to balance and decisions to make, but we\u2019ve been very consistent over the last number of years of -- in our June meeting of raising our dividend, and so I would expect you could see us continuing to do that. I can't say exactly how much, but it will be the objective. And again with the reduced number of shares since we bought so many back, when the scheme of our cash flows, the dividend actually is kind of on Page 3, in terms of it impact our overall cash flows and spending.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Mr. Foster, for closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in our conference call today. Feel free to call anyone on the investor relations team if you have any additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude today\u2019s call, and we appreciate your participation."],"8959":["FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) Q2 2015 Results Conference Call December 17, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Mickey Foster \u2013 VP of IR","Fred Smith \u2013 Chairman and CEO","Mike Glenn \u2013 President & CEO FedEx Services","Alan Graf \u2013 EVP & CFO","Dave Bronczek \u2013 President & CEO FedEx Express","Henry Maier \u2013 President & CEO of FedEx Ground","Bill Logue - President and CEO of FedEx Freight","Analysts","Robert Salmon - Deutsche Bank","Nate Brochmann - William Blair","Ben Hartford - Robert Baird","Chris Wetherbee \u2013 Citigroup","Ken Hoexter \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Kelly Dougherty \u2013 Macquarie Capital","Scott Schneeberger \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.","Jack Atkins - Stephens","Art Hatfield - Raymond James","Donald Broughton - Avondale Partners","Scott Group \u2013 Wolfe Research","Allison Landry \u2013 Credit Suisse","Bill Greene \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Tom Wadewitz - UBS","Brandon Oglenski \u2013 Barclays Capital","David Ross - Stifel Nicolaus ","Thomas Kim \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","David Vernon \u2013 Sanford C.

","And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Fred Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Good morning everyone and welcome to our discussion of results for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. ","FedEx posted strong results and a higher operating margin with earnings up year over year 36% per share with continued growth in volumes and base yields in our transportation segments. Results also were positively affected by the benefits from our ongoing FedEx Express profit improvement program which is on track. We expect revenue and earnings growth to continue into the third quarter and the remainder of 2015, driven by ongoing improvements in the results of our transportation segments. ","As we enter the final stages of this year\u2019s peak shipping season, I\u2019d like to thank the more than 300,000 dedicated team members around the world for again delivering outstanding service to FedEx customers during the holidays. We\u2019re very pleased with our plans for two transformative acquisitions announced earlier this week that will expand existing service offerings in the retail, ecommerce and international markets. Mike Glenn will provide additional details in his remarks on these acquisitions. ","Before turning the call over to Mike and Alan Graf, I would like to recognize Bill Logue, our long term colleague and business partner who is retiring as President and CEO of FedEx Freight on December 31. Mike Ducker, a 40-year veteran of FedEx and currently Chief Operating Officer of FedEx Express will succeed Bill and he is here today as well. ","After 25 years of distinguished service to FedEx, Bill leaves with our gratitude, our support, our friendship and best wishes for a long and healthy future. Mike Glenn?","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred and good morning. First, I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate Fred\u2019s comments and thank our team members as they work around the clock to deliver the holidays for customers worldwide. The dedication of our team members combined with the investments that we have made in our networks have allowed us to deliver outstanding results despite weather and all the challenges that we encounter during the holiday season. ","While we are still in the heart of peak season, there are several trends and developments that are affecting the season, including labor issues at the West Coast ports that have affected productivity and impacted retailers\u2019 ability to get inventory where it\u2019s needed and when it is needed. This issue has impacted our operations as we\u2019ve made adjustments to capacity in key markets to support our customers facing these ongoing port slowdowns. ","In some situations, the slowdowns have caused unexpected shifts in retail and etail customer needs in certain markets and we put limits on customer volumes in order to ensure we meet our service commitments. Despite these challenges and significant weather events during the peak season both in the Northeast and on the West Coast, I am proud to report that we\u2019ve been able to maintain outstanding levels of service across our networks. ","We\u2019ve already delivered multiple days this peak season that ranked among the busiest in the history of the company and our service levels have been terrific. ","Also, I want to briefly discuss the two acquisitions that were announced this week that are transformative in terms of the FedEx portfolio of ecommerce and supply chain solutions. GENCO is one of the largest third-party logistics providers in North America. They have a broad range of product lifecycle and supply chain services that will significantly expand our portfolio, including a market leading position in returns, test and repair, remarketing and product liquidation. GENCO processes more than 600 million return items annually from many of the world\u2019s leading brands. ","In Bongo International, we\u2019ve acquired a leader in global cross-border ecommerce technology and solutions. Bongo\u2019s technology and processes provide a comprehensive end to end solution that helps retailers and etailers grow by reaching international ecommerce consumers. Bongo is delivering cross-border enablement solutions to a base of more than 2000 retailers to more than 200 countries worldwide. These acquisitions will transform our global portfolio through the addition of new best-in-class ecommerce and supply chain management solutions. ","Moving on to our overall economic outlook, the fundamentals of the US economy continue to improve and expectation is for real GDP growth to average around 3% for the next several quarters. Our US GDP forecast is 3.1% for calendar \u201815 and we expect industrial production to grow at 3.9% in calendar \u201915. ","Global economic growth is expected to broaden with the US leading and emerging markets picking up. We expect global growth of 3% in calendar \u201915. ","Now let me make a couple of comments regarding the company's yield performance by segment. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields declined slightly by 0.4%. While we experienced a positive impact from rate and discount, it was more than offset by a lower weight per package due to an increase in e-commerce and telecommunications traffic. ","In the ground segment, yield per package excluding Smart Post increased 3.3% year-over-year, excluding the fuel surcharge, driven primarily by rate and discount. For Smart Post, yield increased 7.8% year-over-year without fuel, which was driven by a change in customer mix. ","In the international export segment, excluding fuel, yield per package increased 0.7% which again was driven by a product mix and rate and discount. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 2.3% at FedEx Freight. The increase was driven by rate and discount and changes in weight per shipment. ","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf. ","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. We had a spectacular second quarter as our earnings per share grew 36% to $2.14. Corporate margin rose 120 basis points year-over-year to 8.5%. Revenue grew 5% to $11.9 billion from increased volumes and generally higher base yields, which drove a significant increase in earnings for each of our transportation segments. ","At Express, Q2 operating income increased 36% and operating margin increased 170 basis points year-over-year, driven by the revenue growth in our US and international export business, cost management related to the profit improvement program and lower pension expense. ","US domestic volumes increased 7% in Q2 driven by both overnight and deferred service offerings. And international export volumes increased 2%. The net impact of fuel had only a slight benefit to operating income. Maintenance and repairs expense increased 16% due to the timing of aircraft maintenance events. Operating expense growth was favourably impacted by the profit improvement actions at Express. ","Turning to ground, segment revenues increased 8% due to volume and yield growth at ground and yield growth at Smart Post, partially offset by lower volumes at Smart Post. Average daily volume at ground increased 5% and operating income increased 6% driven by higher revenue per package and the volume increase. Higher network expansion costs partially offset the increase in operating income as we continued to invest in the high margin higher ROIC growing ground businesses. ","Freight had another great quarter with 35% higher operating income and operating margin up 130 basis points year-over-year. Higher less-than truckload revenue per shipment and higher average daily LTL shipments drove operating income and margin higher. Average LTL shipments increased daily 8% and revenue increased 11% year-over-year. ","I want to speak a little about our fuel surcharge and our fuel surcharge tables. FedEx regular reviews its fuel surcharge tables and will update certain tables at Express, Ground, and Freight effective February 2, 2015. ","While second quarter results benefitted slightly year-over-year from the net impact of fuel, due to lower fuel prices this year versus last, the year-over-year reduction in fuel surcharge revenue largely offset the benefit of the lower fuel prices. ","Understanding the net year-over-year impact to fuel on our results involves three key considerations: timing lags and adjustments to our fuel surcharges; the structure of the fuel surcharge tables and the manner in which we purchase fuel. ","Our fuel surcharges for Express and Ground incorporate a timing lag of approximately 6 to 8 weeks before they are adjusted for changes in fuel prices. For example, fuel surcharge index in effect at Express in November was set based on September fuel prices. Additionally, the structure of the fuel surcharge tables for Express and Ground does not adjust for direct changes in fuel price but allows for the fuel surcharge revenue charge to your customers to remain unchanged as long as fuel prices remain within certain bands. ","Finally, we purchase fuel under our contractual arrangements tied to various indices around the world. Approximately 75% of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchases tied to the index for the preceding month, rather than based on daily spot rates. While the daily spot price of jet fuel declined almost 30% from the end of August to the end November, the average monthly price we paid for jet fuel under our contractual arrangements did not change by a corresponding amount. As a result, the average price per gallon for jet fuel in Q2 only declined 8% quarter over quarter or 10% year-over-year. ","Collectively, these three considerations affect the net impact of fuel on our results in the short term. An expanded discussion of the net impact of fuel is available in our first quarter 10-Q and will also be available in the second quarter 10-Q when filed tomorrow. ","Turning now to the outlook. Based on the economic outlook that Mike outlined, we reaffirm our FY15 earnings-per-share forecast of $8.50 to $9. The outlook assumes continued moderate economic growth and modest net benefit from fuel. We expect revenue and earnings growth to continue for the rest of the year as moderate global economic growth drives volume and yield. Our results could be constrained by the funding of incentive compensation programs. ","Our FY15 results will continue to benefit from the profit improvement programs and will also benefit from lower pension expense. ","In closing, I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during our very busy peak season. I'm very proud to be part of such an amazing team. We will open the call for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Robert Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Salmon","Alan, perhaps you could elaborate a little bit more in terms of the ground margins. What caused the contraction in the second quarter? It looks like other expense was a little bit higher than we are anticipating. I'm sure also the Cyber week as well as the investments played out. And then with regard to the Genco acquisition, can you give us a sense if there's any revenue synergy opportunities? It looks like they managed about \u2013 got visibility into about 3.5 billion related to small package spend. How much of that is currently being managed by -- is currently running through FedEx versus other competitors?","Henry Maier","Hi Robert, this is Henry Maier. Q2 margins declined slightly due to investments in our network, many of which were in preparation for peak. The calendar this year was the same as last year. There\u2019s only one more shopping day between Black Friday and Christmas Eve. Many of these peak related investments are driven by what customers tell us they think their volumes will be during the holiday season. So most of what you're seeing in margin decline is the result of short-term investments we make for peak. Now let me say this. Once peak ends, we will share [ph] this cost as quickly as we possibly can and we remain committed to high teens margins in the ground segment.","Alan Graf ","As to the Genco question, of course there are revenue synergies. We love this acquisition for all the reasons that Mike outlined and for that fact, and we are excited, can\u2019t wait to get it closed and get it working for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair. ","Nate Brochmann ","Alan, maybe just to follow up on the Genco acquisition. And I might be a little bit misplaced on this but I recall back in the day of you guys kind of saying that you didn't really want to get that deep into inventory logistics management. And I certainly have known the Genco guys for a while and I think they bring a great asset to your organization, kind of probably fill a gap. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit in terms of just strategically where the thinking lies in terms of what Genco brings to you, and maybe what other gaps you might look at in terms of your overall logistics framework in terms of where the market is moving and why that\u2019s so valuable?","Fred Smith","This Fred Smith speaking and I am going to turn it over to Mike Glenn. In years past we were not particularly enamored of the so-called 3PL business because it was a relatively low margin business that saw a lot of loss of contracts on the first renewal. It was more of a commodity type of business and one of the big sales pitches of a lot of 3PLs was that they were carrier agnostic in terms of the transport system that they used. What of course has happened over the decades since we expressed those remarks is the entire logistics and retailing sector has changed particularly with the emergence of e-commerce and the empowered consomm\u00e9 [ph] with mobile phones and electronic devices that allow them to order and move their shipments around. ","So the attractive part of Genco was that it had sailed directly with those wins into the market leadership in the reverse logistics space and with the substantial market presence that we have particularly with FedEx Ground and FedEx Smart Post in that sector, it was just a natural fit. So our view about that business in the main hasn\u2019t particularly changed but world has changed. And this was really a great fit, the culture was a perfect, the management team is terrific, very high ROIC asset light which complements some of our more capital intensive businesses and Herb Shear and his team has just done a great job of building this business over the years and we\u2019re just very happy to get it and that\u2019s the reason that we changed our opinion about the business and it's also why we were very very careful in getting the right candidate that fit all those criteria that I just mentioned. Mike?","Mike Glenn","I just had a couple comments. Genco\u2019s expertise in infrastructure and targeted verticals and specifically in technology, healthcare and retail all complement the FedEx portfolio of services and those have been industry segments we\u2019ve been interested in for a long, long time. In my opening remarks, I mentioned that Genco processes more than 600 million return items annually and that's a critical decision criteria when developing relationships with our e-commerce customers. I don\u2019t have to tell this group that returns in the e-commerce segment are more important issue than they are in a typical retail channel, represent a larger percentage of overall sales. So it's critical we have these capabilities and as Fred mentioned Genco is the perfect partner.","Henry Maier","This is Henry Maier. Can I just add something here at the end? Genco is a company that we have admired for many years. Culture is, we believe, a perfect alignment with the FedEx culture as Fred and Mike have said they have an excellent management team. And like FedEx Ground, Genco was proud to call Pittsburgh home and I think this just reinforces our commitment to the region. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert Baird.","Ben Hartford ","Just looking for a little bit of perspective on the 4Q peak, and how you may or may not be benefiting from some of the tightness that we\u2019re seeing in that Asia to US land. Maybe you can just walk through, just the puts and takes, I understand the capacity has been tight out of key gateways out of Asia, leading up to recent weeks. You talked about some of the limits on customer volumes that you\u2019d implemented, so I imagine load factors are high. But I'm curious to what extent you are able to participate in the strength in the spot market as it relates to pricing with some of the volumes against potentially having to pay more for third party capacity into that context, as well as if you could provide some perspective there? And then also maybe speak to how you see the transpacific market developing in 2015 given this volatility that we\u2019re seeing in this year\u2019s peak, is it episodic or is it something that can be more sustained? ","Dave Bronczek","Yes, hi, this is Dave Bronczek. First of all, we are able to participate quite a lot. We have extra sections that we can fly into Asia. We've done that consistently through the months now in December. We've seen a lot of demand quite frankly that has come along because of what Mike pointed out on the port issue in Long Beach. So yes we have tight capacity but we\u2019re able to manage our capacity globally because of our extra sections that we can put in. So I would say that from a perspective -- from Express\u2019 point of view we\u2019ve been very very successful in managing through this. ","Mike Glenn","I would add just a couple of comments on peak in general. I think we've seen some shifts here that will be positives for the long haul and that is demand is really shifting more towards the entire peak season rather than on specific days. I'm sure you've noticed that the Black Friday and Cyber Monday events have become more of weeklong events to really de-pressurize those days a bit and I think those are challenges that that e-commerce companies and retailers are working through but I think will be a positive impact on the peak season overall going forward.","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave Bronczek. Again just one more thing to add to what Mike said. We\u2019re seeing strong demand obviously through December. It's been more rational though it\u2019s been spread out. The volumes have been strong but our service has been outstanding. We've had good weather to go along with it but I just wanted to make that point as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee ","I was just wondering if maybe you could give a little bit more color of sort of what the benefit of the profit improvement was in the quarter, and maybe sort of order of magnitude relative to the benefit, I think that you said was slight from fuel within Express and then just thinking sort of on that Express note as you look into fiscal third-quarter, Alan, would you expect sort of what we have seen with this continued step-down in jet fuel prices to provide in a bigger benefit to the third quarter, is it being \u2013 if you can add [ph] a little bit more in line with the type of benefit you saw in fiscal 2Q?","Dave Bronczek","Well let me start off. This is Dave Bronczek again. Our profit improvement plan is working, it\u2019s on tract, our management team is successfully executing, I am very very proud of them. Along with the profit improvement, our service has been outstanding as well. I wanted to make that point to our management team. But from a profit improvement perspective, in Q2 fuel had a slight positive to FedEx Express. I know many of you had written that our profits for the quarter would be very high relatively speaking and they are \u2013 we\u2019re up 36%, 170 basis points but only a slight improvement in fuel that went along with that. And when you think about it, our expenses were only up 1% for the quarter -- and for the quarter and our volumes were up 7% in the US, 2% internationally, and as Mike pointed our yields were all up. So our profit improvement plan is really driving most of our success.","Alan Graf","This is Alan. I think we\u2019re continuing to do exactly what we described we were going to do. The revenue outlook at Express particularly in the domestic business is very good because services are still outstanding. Our costs at Express are significantly prominently lower than they would have been had we not done the profit improvement program, and those are going to carry through throughout. We haven't backfilled one person and don't intend to. So it\u2019s steady as she goes. We\u2019re exactly where we told you we would be when we had our fourth quarter earnings call for the year and we will just continue sailing. ","As far as fuel as I said, very little improvement for the year as a result of fuel based on where our new fuel surcharge tables will be and where we think fuel will be. So we\u2019re getting in from the old-fashioned way which is good solid service and unbelievable cost management. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Can you talk about the scale of the ground investments? Were these a surprise addition or do you expect margins to deteriorate in your prior outlook on a year-over-year basis? And then can you delve into the incentive comp commentary and what that's expected to impact margins as we go forward?","Henry Maier","Ken, this is Henry Maier. I mean concerning the ground margins, there is nothing unusual here. I mean we plan for peak every year, it\u2019s a 12 month exercise. We start working with customers in August based on what they tell us they are going to need in terms of capacity for the peak season. We make peak investments accordingly. The rest of this is just normal network investments for organic growth.","Alan Graf","This is Alan. I would also say that \u2013 reference back to what Mike said, looks like peak is more spread out than in years past. So while we had a great November at Ground, it was a little bit lower than we had planned for and we put in all that peak planning cost and everything. So it had a little bit of an impact and as we noted, Smart Post is down year-over-year because of one customer. So we\u2019re very happy with where ground is. It\u2019s going to continue to have a great year and a great next year. ","Mike Glenn","We have an email question coming in from William Flinn from Potomac, and the question is - in the second quarter, Freight revenues were up 11% and operating income was up 45%; how much of this excellent execution was due to yield initiatives versus market share gains? We did have an excellent quarter at FedEx Freight and I am particularly proud of the collaboration between our sales and marketing team and the freight operations team. We spent a lot of time working to make sure that we get the right amount of traffic in the network at the right yields. And the answer to the question is the combination of both. We continue to take share in the segment. Due to our industry-leading value proposition and our sales team is executing crisply and I need to mention our pricing team as well, they've done a phenomenal job working with our sales and operations team to make sure that we\u2019re getting the traffic in at the right yields to ensure that drops to the bottom line. So it's a terrific quarter for Freight. We\u2019re very proud of that, we\u2019re very proud of the collaboration we have with the Freight team. ","Bill Logue","I will jump in; this is Bill. And again as Mike said, we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter, up 35% in OI and we\u2019ve seen some great performance in the revenue quality area and commitments from all the sales team, our pricing team and partners. So that\u2019s very encouraging going forward. And again the ops team continue to do a great job in the frontline service to our employees \u2013 to our customers and that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing outstanding continued growth in our business. So we\u2019re very pleased with the quarter.","Mike Glenn","And let me correct I read the question as submitted, it said operating income was up 45%, as Bill noted, it was actually up 35%. But I read the question as submitted.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie. ","Kelly Dougherty ","Hi, thanks for taking the question. After your last call you announced plans for a buyback that seems primarily to offset the dilution. So can you help us think about plans to return more capital to shareholders especially as your free cash flow ramps or maybe now that it seems to be you're in more of an acquisitive mode. That buyback is a return of capital and may take a backseat to that at least for the time being? ","Alan Graf","This is Alan. We are going to continue to buy back shares. We will probably do at a lower pace than we did when we did the initial one. We\u2019re certainly going to at least prevent dilution from our comp programs. We may or may not go further than that. We also review our dividend at the end of every fiscal year with our board and you should not assume that the Genco and Bongo acquisitions only way we\u2019re going to change that because we have plenty of cash flow to go around to solve both of those issues. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger ","Thanks, good morning. Could you address in the Freight segment some of the puts and takes in the quarter, specifically with regard to the margin and how you see that developing over the back half of the year? ","Bill Logue","Yes, Scott, this is Bill. Again, good quarter up 35% on the operating income and in the quarter we took a well deserved pay increase in October for our frontline teams, so between that and other compensations and healthcare costs, that was a pretty big headwind on our numbers and we still came back with a 35% improvement. So again we're pretty excited about that and going forward we'll have a little bit of headwind in Q3, Q4 from the October pay increases but again we're still very excited about where we're going here in the second half. ","Operator","Next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. ","Jack Atkins ","Great. Thanks for the time this morning guys. I guess this question is for Fred or Dave. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on how the lower oil prices that we've seen over the past couple of months will impact international air freight demand especially if we see a period of sustained low fuel costs. Do you think that's going to help drive increased demand for your higher yielding more time sensitive services in the portfolio? ","Dave Bronczek","This is Dave. Absolutely. We do believe that's correct. We've positioned our global powerful network around the world with exactly the right infrastructure, we have the 777s of course that are now flying non-stop out of Asia Pacific and around the world. So we think that the decrease in oil is going to have an increase in customers demand for higher yielding products. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James. ","Art Hatfield ","Good morning everyone and Bill, good luck in your retirement. Just to go back to the ground margins and Alan, I think you commented that November while strong didn't live up to kind of what you thought it would. Is that a function of customers just didn't hit the level of demand they thought or is it a timing issue where some of that actually got pushed into December? ","Henry Maier","Art, it\u2019s Henry Maier. I guess I'd answer that both. November volumes were softer than our expectations but you need to know that this is not at all unusual in this new ecommerce economy. Over the last several peak seasons we have regularly observed situations where volume hasn't always come where we expected it or come when we expected it but one thing has been certain, it always comes. ","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me put a little color on an issue that I think has been underreported and I suspect you're going to hear a lot more about in January when the retailers start putting their results out. The slowdown in the West Coast ports has been a much bigger deal than people think and a tremendous amount of inventory was simply not put through the ports in the timeframe that the retailers had expected. This in turn has led to a lot of not in stocks and one of the things that Henry has had to deal with that's extremely important is that because these delays at the port, at the West Coast ports and the East Coast ports because a lot of people saw this coming and diverted traffic into the East Coast ports, we received a lot of traffic on the two coasts which normally we would have anticipated getting from distribution centers in the middle of the country. So we've had to move power where the customers needed it but that has slowed down a lot of the retailing activity in late November and early December and led to a lot of not in stock. So I suspect that you'll see a lot of purchases of gift cards in lieu of merchandise and in January you'll see some of that traffic moving in the truckload sector and elsewhere into the retailing brick and mortar system. ","The second thing that's very different this year and it's something that you should pay attention to is a lot of traditional retailers have gotten very, very good at ecommerce in terms of their marketing and their apps and their ability to sell things online. What they haven't gotten as good at in some cases is processing those orders and getting them out the door and so some of the major retailers that we deal with particularly in Henry's organization were telling us in November that they were seeing orders but the orders were backlogged. And so we are seeing a great deal of that traffic now moving into the December timeframe but I do think you'll see when the retailers report their results that the West Coast port issue has been a bigger deal for the peak season than most people have thought it was to date. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners. ","Donald Broughton ","Yes, gentlemen. One of the biggest variances between what we were looking for and what you reported was certainly in the maintenance line. You said it was timing of aircraft maintenance. Can you give us a little bit more color, a little bit more understanding if for no other reason than we can model it better in the future? ","Alan Graf","It's Alan. Dave can add to this. It's timing. It has to do largely with MD10s and to some extent MD11 engine maintenance. It will probably continue in the third quarter and then it will start to mitigate and we should see much more normal comparisons going forward from there. It was expected, it was in our guidance, we needed to do it particularly on the MD10s to keep the reliability up and that's why we are getting 767s. ","Dave Bronczek","Well, Alan said it, and I think it\u2019s in the press release. Our fourth quarter aircraft maintenance costs subside, so that's probably what you're looking for and it's in the written report. Even with the 16% increase in aircraft maintenance expense this quarter, our all up expense for the quarter was 1%. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. ","Scott Group ","Thanks, good morning guys. I'm not sure if I missed it. Can you share with us or are you going to disclose how much you paid for Genco and how you're going to finance it? And then just on that maintenance question from earlier, what's the total aircraft maintenance up this year in the guidance and does it go down next year or does it kind of flatten out next year and not increase further? ","Alan Graf","We are not going to disclose what we paid for Genco at this point. We will, down the road. I'll let Dave handle the maintenance thing and oh, by the way Scott, I know you were disappointed in our results but I sure am not. ","Dave Bronczek","Yes, hi, this is Dave. Our aircraft maintenance is flat year-over-year and it subsides, the costs still of course continue but they continue at a lower level. ","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith. Let me make one other point here which is essentially you understand and Dave Bronczek's results, his expenses are only up 1% but the Express unit also had a wage increase effective on the first of October as we did corporate wide and in the United States network. And so his productivity is absorbing a lot of expense increase in addition to benefiting from the macro profit improvement program. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. ","Allison Landry ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So you mentioned earlier that an improved consumer should help some of the premium products. So I was just wondering if that's actually dialed into your guidance. ","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. I'll let Mike put color on this. I think as he mentioned in our macroeconomic outlook we're looking for a 3.1% US 2015 GDP increase and a 3% global increase. I think that a lot of the euphoria that people are seeing with the lower fuel prices at the pump for consumers and things of that nature will to some degree be offset by the reduction in CapEx and the oil and gas exploration and production sector. I mean the facts of the matter are that capital expenditures are a huge driver of US prosperity and income and you see that over on the consumer side just as well as you do lower gasoline prices. So I think it's not quite the universal good that some people think it may be. ","Now having said that consumer confidence and so forth is a very big deal in our economy which is 70% consumption but just be a little bit careful there about assuming that the economy is off to the races with all of the pressure that's going to be on this oil and gas sector which has been a huge part of the increase in GDP over the last several years. Mike? ","Mike Glenn","Yes, let me make a comment and kind of give you an analogy. One of the strategic moves that we made in the FedEx Freight network was to adjust the network so that whether we grew in priority or economy freight we benefited from that and a lot of our strategy in the international line haul network and providing the flexibility in the network has been designed around that same philosophy. So while we do expect to see some lift, those things tend not to happen as fast as you might think and so the network design we have in place allows us to flex based upon demand so we're quite comfortable with where we sit at this point. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. ","Bill Greene ","Hi good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask your thoughts on some access the post office has been taking, so trying to compete a bit more in B to C with price actions but also in the holidays here delivering seven days a week. It seems to me that you guys probably compete very vigorously every day but competing against the government doesn't seem quite fair either. So like what's your view on this? Are they a meaningful competitor in that market or is it not really something you come across? ","Mike Glenn","Well of course a lot of the traffic that moves through the postal service actually moves on our line haul network. So we see that day in and day out and we have a very good relationship with the postal service. I'm assuming you're talking about some of the pricing changes they've made to address really the low weight segment in order to take advantage of some ecommerce capabilities. I think the thing you need to keep in mind is their network is very different than ours. They tend to operate smaller vehicles that really cube out pretty quickly as opposed to the network we have in place. The lighter weight ecommerce traffic that we target, we try to push through Smart Post which moves actually the final mile in most cases through the postal service for final delivery. ","So the heavier weight traffic which is more in tune with our sweet spot and the home delivery network and the express network is actually not the traffic that they've targeted with their price decreases. So there are a lot of moving parts to that question but again the postal service plays an important role in our value proposition by providing that last mile delivery and you are seeing more consumers and etailers utilize Smart Post and direct injection models through the postal service because it facilitates free shipping, which is a key promotional tool. So we're seeing a lot of that in the ecommerce sector and we're benefiting from a lot of that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. ","Tom Wadewitz ","Yes, good morning. So Alan, I appreciate your thoughts on fuel and providing some further explanation. I think there was another question on it as well. But I wondered if you could give us a number of comments on how you think if we stay at substantially lower fuel prices for a period of time for more than a quarter or two and also looking beyond the two month time lag impact, is there a benefit to profitability of Express from significantly lower fuel prices perhaps some slippage on fuel surcharge or other ways that it comes through the P&L because I think there is a sense that Express is fuel intensive and fuel sensitive, or is that just the wrong way to look at it and you don't really get a margin or an operating income benefit out a couple quarters from fuel prices which are pretty dramatically down?","Alan Graf","Tom, thanks for the question. I'll start and let Mike add some more color. Everything else being equal lower fuel prices helps elasticity at Express by having a lower surcharge. And there is a trade up factor just as there's a trade down factor when prices are extremely high. But I did quantify that by saying everything else being equal because lower oil prices seem to be roiling some of the markets at the moment and people are still trying to figure out what it means particularly if you're in a oil business and what it means for capital expenditures for the oil and exploration companies and how that impacts the economy and everything else. So there's a big impact all around and of course we provide service for their machine parts and other things that they need to get on just in time basis to where they need to be. So there are so many things that impact this, it's hard to just nail that through the wall but maybe Mike can add to that. ","Mike Glenn","Yes, Tom. When you get right down to it, the fuel surcharges at all of our operating companies are a pricing tool index to the price of fuel and of course we review those on a regular basis and make adjustments based upon market conditions. But if you take Express and Ground for example, the changes we're going to be making to the design are largely or at least in partly designed to reduce the volatility of the surcharges for our customers. It's also important to note that how customers view surcharges differs in the parcel segment versus the freight. ","In the parcel segments, customers tend to look at the fuel surcharge as part of the overall rate the customer pays and the freight segment, it's more put aside and the customer is more focused on the base rate and not as much on the fuel surcharge. So it really does differ by segment and of course as I mentioned what we try to do is to review these on an annual basis and make adjustments based upon market conditions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. ","Brandon Oglenski ","Well good morning, everyone. Alan, just a quick comment. Thank you again like Tom said for walking through the fuel surcharge. I think a few analysts might have gotten carried away with it here including this one. But longer term, Fred, the acquisition of Genco here, does this signal a strategic shift for the company? I mean are you guys going to be looking more at the non-asset part of the business here as you expand your portfolio as opposed to the acquisitions we've seen in the past at Express more internationally focused by smaller carriers in Europe and some of the emerging markets? ","Fred Smith","Well, Alan and I both have commented on our criteria for acquisitions and they are threefold. First, there has to be a compelling strategic rationale and that was certainly the case in Genco as I mentioned a few moments ago. We've identified for several years in our strategic management committee and at the board level the gaps in our portfolio that we would like to fill either on a build or buy basis. So if an acquisition comes on the horizon we are certainly interested in that and I would say that clearly, we like non-asset intensive parts of our portfolio because they tend to add to our overall returns on invested capital as well as broadening our portfolio and we are selling a portfolio. We've got some wonderful advertising at the moment that makes that point very clearly. ","So all things being equal, of course, we would rather have things that are non-asset intensive than things that are asset intensive. That's basically what most of Wall Street thinks about every day and to some degree, too much so in my opinion to the detriment of job creation and increased income for our citizens. ","The second criteria that we have is there a good fit in terms of the culture and the technologies, because most acquisitions founder on one of those two bases and then the third thing which my partner is sitting right beside me here feels very strongly about, you can't overpay. I mean why I go buy something which destroys shareholder value, so that's our criteria for investment. We certainly like non-asset intensive parts of our portfolio because they are complementary but it's basically those three criteria. Strategic fit, culture and technology makes sense as we said before that's the case at Genco in a very big way and third, the numbers have to make sense.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel Nicolaus.","David Ross ","Yes, good morning everyone. Maybe a question for Bill and Mike. Now that you've moved or are moving in the New Year to all dim weight or dimensional based pricing in ground; any thoughts on shipping to dim pricing in FedEx Freight and any barriers to that potential switch? ","Bill Logue","Hey David, it\u2019s Bill. I will jump in first. Yes, we are rolling out right now some of the dimensional overhead machines to kind of take a good look at it. Again we look at it in kind of three ways; one, you can capture some instantaneous revenue and get accurate dims on existing shipments but also it's a very good tool for us to continue to improve pricing, knowledge of what\u2019s actually moving to our systems, so that\u2019s kind of where we\u2019re going there. I think as far as dim technology, again we have -- we have opportunities to currently with some customers to use some dim pricing, but again long-term that is a key objective of ours to keep on moving both our business that way. And again I think as we try to become freight \u2013 FedEx becomes a significant part of our business we want to make sure that we\u2019re also able to give customers the parcel side of the business the same type of deals that they deal with everyday on the parcel side. We\u2019re working hard at it and Mike\u2019s marketing team spends a lot of time kind of working this issue and leading it for us.","Mike Glenn","Just to add, the density-based pricing is something we already offer to select customers and we will continue to do so. We find it offers a more simplified alternative to the classification based system which is extremely complex and quite frankly out-dated. So I think it would benefit the industry as a whole to move to more simplified pricing structure and get away from the classification system. But obviously the market will dictate that. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim ","Good morning. Alan, can I ask you a question with regard to your FX sensitivities within Express and then also to what extent does lower fuel impact your purchase transport costs? ","Alan Graf","Well certainly purchase transportation is a high and growing part of our cost structure particularly around peak. So the lower fuel is the lower those costs are which is an indirect not to the fuel line but an indirect benefit to us. I think it's very important. What was your first question again? ","Thomas Kim ","FX sensitivities, please?","Alan Graf","Okay. Well remember that since we are not a big manufacturing company we can adjust our pricing very quickly based on dramatic changes in foreign exchange. We expect the dollar to strengthen as is everybody else and of course in areas where we are profitable, that will be a very good thing for us. But it's really got a very minimal impact to our overall P&L because the way that we\u2019re able to manage the pricing side of the house which has been very beneficial to us.","Dave Bronczek","Yes, this is Dave Bronczek. I just wanted to go back and make the point again on our expenses and our costs. Our aircraft maintenance costs were actually less in Q2 than they were in Q1. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling ","Thank you and good morning, Bill hope you enjoy retirement. Mr. Smith you'd touched on the West Coast port congestion. Maybe I can take it a little step further. How much of a negative impact, if it did have a negative impact on your NVOCC business within FedEx trade networks and maybe some of that freight that you see a shifting of some of that ocean freight possibly to the air side within FedEx trade networks? ","Bill Logue","Well, I think the reality is that the container lines and FedEx trade networks and the other NVOCCs as you mentioned found that the die was cast by the time it became clear that the port issues were going to be a big problem. If you followed the negotiations out there it was really only obvious in November that the slowdown was taking place. And I don't know the details of that but certainly, certain people in the shipping industry have said this work to rule activity in the ports is the cause of traffic taking a couple of weeks to get through the ports in what should have been two to three, four days. So that's a very big deal in terms of the inventory decisions that were made last spring and the shipping plans that were put in place last summer. ","So I don't think you should think about the fact that all of a sudden this slowdown happened and everything moved by air because what drives the movement of goods by air more than any other thing is the value per pound and there may be some closing samples that go air express or move by air but the vast majority of apparel is never going to move by air simply because the price point of the goods won't justify the much higher cost of moving by air. So a lot of people get that mixed up. It's only on the margins that surface to air makes sense. ","Now longer term as Alan said the elasticities are very important there because markets are logical. The biggest effect I think as I mentioned a moment ago on the peak season is that there are a lot of not in stock situations among all the retailers. We have a lot of expertise and within the company and even on our board of directors in this sector and I think you're going to hear this from a lot of the retailers when they report their results. So I hope that clarifies some of this thing. I don't want people to go away from this and think there's a systemic shift from sea to air because of a short-term issue here. That just won't happen. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. ","Jeff Kauffman ","Thank you very much and congratulations on the quarter. Bill, best of luck in retirement. Let me ask kind of a broader simpler question. Fuel is down and I think you've said a number of types that your view is that will be good for volume on the consumer side. Your economic outlook sounds a little bolder. You announced two pretty decent acquisitions here. Why is there no improvement in the forward outlook? ","Alan Graf","Jeff, this is Alan. Well, I think again there was probably a little over estimation about the benefit from fuel for us for the year, so we don't see that. We think it's still going to be slight so that's what's in the guidance but I haven't given you FY16 yet. So that's coming pretty soon. ","Jeff Kauffman ","Okay and the acquisitions would take effect more in FY16 than FY15? ","Alan Graf","For sure. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon ","Thanks for taking the question. Are you guys -- with the international market being a little stronger the last few months from the IATA data and also a little bit we're hearing sort of anecdotally on expediting, are you seeing sign that the capacity situation in the international air freight market is getting tighter that rates are getting better or are we seeing just a lot of the excess capacity that may have been put down to the ground come up limiting any positive impact on the rate environment? ","Dave Bronczek","David, this is Dave Bronczek. It's relatively flat still. I mean you still have a lot of extra capacity in the underbellies of a lot of the passenger airlines and so forth. So I would say that right at the moment to Fred\u2019s earlier point because of the port issues we have seen some increases there on rates and on freight. But generally speaking it\u2019s flat. ","End of Q&A","Operator","We have no further questions in queue.

Welcome to all joining our quarterly call. Fiscal 2019 was a year of both challenge and change for FedEx. We faced weakening international revenue growth, driven by the slowdown in global trade, less favorable service mix of TNT Express business after the NotPetya cyber attack and continued rapid growth of e-commerce demand. We are very proud of our team members who are responding with positive actions and innovative solutions that will make FedEx even stronger and more successful in the future. ","FedEx enters fiscal 2020 with a sharp focus on extending our lead as a premier global transport and logistics company and on making the necessary investments today to capture the significant market opportunities we see for the future. These steps include enhancing FedEx Ground capabilities, speed and efficiency, improving FedEx Express hub automation, particularly in Memphis and Indianapolis, finishing the integration of TNT, modernizing our aircraft fleet and reducing unit cost and increasing productivity, especially for e-commerce deliveries.","While these investments are long-term in nature and their success cannot always be measured immediately. We're confident they will drive significant earnings growth and improve margins cash flows and returns for our shareholders over the long haul.","Let me emphasize, however, that based on our current forecast of U.S. GDP growth for FY 2020 we anticipate FedEx freight will increase earnings and margin over the period. We believe FedEx Ground will increase earnings for the fiscal year with modest if any margin compression from current levels, despite the investments we've announced, such as six and seven day per week delivery, large package capabilities and in sourcing of SmartPost.","Global trade disputes and low global growth rates create significant uncertainty for the express business leading us to be cautious and projecting FY 2020 earnings for this segment. The integration of TNT is now progressing at a good clip, and we will see significant benefits by this time in summer 2021. The major focus of our investment strategy I should note has also improved sustainability and efficiency.","We intend to substantially grow our e-commerce business and are well aware improved profitability in this market requires greater efficiency in delivering residential packages and we have sound initiatives to steadily improve our cost to serve this market. To these ends for example, we recently announced in-sourcing 2 million SmartPost packages and an agreement with Dollar General for over 8,000 pickup and delivery on-site locations and sparsely populated in rural areas. Over FY 2020 we will announce several additional initiatives in this regard.","Let me also caution observers who follow FedEx in this industry to be very careful extrapolating past assumptions and trends into the future. For instance, we've noted repeatedly short haul package delivery will become increasingly important as retailers ship e-commerce orders from store or local fulfillment. Hence the average yields have to be matched with operational changes, not visible to most to assess -- to ensure potential future profitability.","Also future developments in speeding up e-commerce deliveries and postal reform, which by the way we have supported will likely be discontinuities in the next several years. FedEx is uniquely position for long-term success and will continue to deliver a great future for our customers, share owners, team members and the communities we serve.","Let me now turn to Raj followed by Brie and Alan, and then a brief comment by Mark Allen, and then we'll take questions. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam ","Thank you, Fred and good afternoon. As mentioned in the last call, our focus is long-term profitable growth that drives increased shareholder value. Fiscal Year 2020 is in many ways a transition year for FedEx, as we continue to reinvigorate our business to capitalize on e-commerce growth and execute significant initiatives to reduce our costs to serve. ","In the U.S. alone, we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026. As the market grows, so to do our abilities and offering -- capabilities and offerings, our global network serves as the invisible backbone for the fast, easy and reliable e-commerce experience that consumers demand today, and we continuously build upon our offerings to customers.","One way we are doing show is by strategically working with retailers to enable market leading value propositions. This includes working with target to leverage their stores as local fulfillment centers through our FedEx extra hours offering and giving our customers access to a multitude of FedEx drop-off and pick up services, such as last week's announcement with Dollar General.","These are just a few examples of the ways we continue to flex our operations and network to respond to our customers. Brie will cover these capabilities among others in more detail. It is clear that we are all in on e-commerce. This commitment is illustrated by a number of key strategic initiatives well underway in our operating units.","Just last month, we announced a number of innovative solutions for our FedEx Ground network. This includes seven day a week residential delivery, rapidly integrating FedEx SmartPost volume into standard ground operations, and enhancing network capabilities around large package handling.","These changes directly address some of the key challenges inherent with e-commerce namely, increasing consumer expectations and managing the cost for residential delivery. Bringing the SmartPost volume into the ground network allows us to improve density and efficiency in the Last Mile deliveries.","It is significant that we are engineering and enhancing the Ground network in such a way that it'll be more cost effective to deliver millions of residential packages a day directly by FedEx Ground. In fact, we expect FedEx Ground to become the low cost Last Mile provider in the industry. ","The recent Ground announcement should be particularly exciting to online consumers who purchase large items like furniture, TVs and kayaks [ph] with a click of a button. We expect to have a large package operation in nearly 40 Ground facilities prior to our peak season. The vast majority of these are existing facilities, and this approach minimizes CapEx and enables us to focus on placing large package handling in the more strategic locations, such as near ports and railroads. ","Not one element of this transformation will be possible without the investments that FedEx Ground has been making and continues to make in technology. Advancements in loading, sorting and scanning technologies will provide near real time data to help optimize operations with maximizing the use of rail, improving delivery density and increasing the efficiency of handling all packages, no matter the size.","These types of technological enhancement and state of the art tools are true differentiators and are being implemented all across the FedEx operations, not just FedEx Ground. FedEx Freight, for example is in the midst of modernizing an industry that has been historically paper based. Technology advancements like advanced forklift computers, electronic shipping labels, and advanced driver assist systems allows for team members to work smarter, safer and more efficiently. This evolution of automation sets us up continued long-term success.","With FedEx Express we are implementing initiatives focused on lowering our cost to serve in the U.S. This includes rightsizing the network as we prepare for future growth. to accommodate this growth we have launched multi-year hub modernization efforts at two of our largest Express hubs Memphis and Indi, these investments will enable Express to handle more volume more efficiently.","Internationally, the global trade picture is less than ideal, but we are confident in our long-term position. We are rapidly moving forward with the integration of TNT, as expected we began FY 2020 with a global sales force that is 98% integrated positioning us with a single phase to our customers in nearly every market worldwide. We have recently completed on schedule the rollout of our capabilities to inject legacy FedEx Express intra-European shipments into the TNT European road network. We expect to be substantially complete with the operational integration by the end of fiscal year 2020. This will allow interoperability between the TNT and legacy Express networks and in turn result in faster service for customers at a lower cost.","Beyond fiscal year 2020, our work will continue with key initiatives including customer migration, air network integration and product rationalization. The various areas I have touched on today position FedEx to be future ready, we are focused on the long-term and am humbled by the ongoing commitment, dedication and innovation by our more than 450,000 team members around the world.","Now, I'll turn it over to Brie to provide more details on our macro view, revenue quality and additional growth initiatives. Brie?","Brie Carere","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. I will open with our economic update and outlook and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and our growth priorities. Overall U.S. economic growth is holding up well with real GDP growing 3.1% in the first quarter of calendar year 2019. However, the industrial sector has suffered from an inventory build out and increased trade tensions, through May manufacturing output was 1.5% off its December peak.","For calendar year 2019, we expect global economic growth to moderate as the developed world see slower growth in both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets. We expect services to continue to underpin global GDP growth. Global trade has slowed as trade frictions have exerted a negative impact on sentiment and of course the manufacturing sector. As the Chinese economy has continued to decelerate this has also impacted other Asian markets export performance.","China's exports, which grew almost 10% in 2018 have fairly grown this year amid heightened trade tensions with United States. Outlook for the European economy remain slow due to a number of sector and country specific factors such as disruption in the automated factoring sector, social tensions, policy uncertainty, as well as uncertainty related to Brexit.","In Germany and Italy which are two important markets for us manufacturing output, which turned negative in November continued to decline with April manufacturing output down 3.5% and 1.9% year-over-year in Germany and Italy, respectively.","As we have stressed before tariffs are counterproductive to efforts that encourage business growth and expand global trade. Thankfully, however, we have a large and flexible global network that allows us to adjust and meet our customers' needs when trade issues present challenges in certain markets.","As I mentioned on the last call, we remain laser focus on three key areas international, e-commerce and small business. Despite macroeconomic headwinds that I just covered, our international commercial team is poised for growth. Sales integration as Raj has mentioned is essentially complete. Our European network is more reliable and faster than it has ever been. We have simplified our pricing structure and open the valve for e-commerce within Europe. We have also created new pricing programs for our Asian team to sell into Europe, as well as from Europe into Asia, this is the largest trade lane in the world.","E-commerce continues to be a driving force of total U.S. domestic market growth. We are building our portfolio, networking capacity to best serve thousands of retailers in this space and we continue to differentiate for example, with the launch of the FedEx seven day service. In 2020 FedEx Ground will deliver seven days a week year round for 80% of U.S. GDP. ","This is truly a transformational move that builds upon the largest global commerce transportation network in the world to further serve the growing e-commerce markets. We are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 25% of the lanes. This move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share.","With the growth of e-commerce and consumer demand for flexible, safe and convenient delivery options FedEx also provide unmatched access and create cost saving opportunities for customers. The recently announced alliance with Dollar General will provide access to FedEx services in places that customers have told us are very convenient in their daily lives.","The alliance will provide more than 8,000 additional locations for customers to hold packages for pickup and drop off pre-labeled packages, including of course pre-labeled returns. Further, it will bring FedEx closer to the consumer than we have ever been before within five miles of over 90% of the United States population. ","Once the Dollar General rollout is complete the number of retail locations providing staffed FedEx shipping will grow to over 27,000. We are incredibly excited that the access to FedEx service continues to improve especially for e-commerce recipients in more rural, less populated areas of the United States. ","This is a tremendous achievement, not just in increasing access, but also in creating cost saving opportunities for our customers and for FedEx. For instance, by choosing to ship packages directly to convenient FedEx retail locations, merchants can reduce costs of residential delivery surcharges. Delivery to our retail location eliminates weather related damage or porch stuff, helping to reduce customer service and replacement costs for retailers.","And for returns drop off at our retail locations result in higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency making FedEx even more competitive in the returns market. We have a great returns growth opportunity that our competitive retail network now opens up for us.","Across all our priorities, we continue to be very focused on revenue management. While we see a rational pricing market, e-commerce will continue to put pressure on yields with lighter packages moving shorter distances. It is important to note that contrary to the erroneous and misinformed reporting in the Wall Street Journal on June 23rd, FedEx has made no recent pricing changes -- from no pricing changes to our strategy. And we have certainly made no changes related to any one customer.","In fact at Express, we have experienced strong growth from small and medium customers using our FedEx Express two day product, following a strategic pricing change we made last year, and we anticipate the growth of this successful product to continue in FY 2020. We are confident that our strategies will allow us to grow global volumes and revenues profitably.","Now, let me turn the call over to Alan for his remarks. Alan?","Alan Graf","Thank you, Brie and good afternoon, everyone. FedEx Express fourth quarter operating income declined as weakness in global trade and industrial production drove a decline in our international prior revenue. Year-over-year comparisons were also impacted by an $85 million gain on the sale of a non-core business of TNT Express last year. To mitigate the weakness we have undertaken several immediate cost containment actions including significant reductions of variable incentive compensation, limiting hiring and discretionary spending, and completing our U.S. voluntary employee buyout program.","Approximately 1,500 FedEx employees have left or will be voluntarily leaving the company via the U.S. employee buyout program by the end of FY 2020. Approximately 85% of those employees departed on May 31, 2019.","We incurred cost of $316 million during the fourth quarter associated with our business realignment activities. These costs related primarily to severance for employees who accepted voluntary buyouts. Business realignment activities, including the voluntary employee buyout are expected to benefit FY 2020 by approximately $240 million. By eliminating open positions, we expect to achieve our savings goal using less severance than we originally forecasted.","TNT integration expenses were $84 million for the fourth quarter and $388 million for FY 2019. As you heard from Raj, we are continuing to make good progress with our integration activities.","At FedEx Ground, we continue to see strong e-commerce volume growth in the fourth quarter. However, FedEx Ground income and margins were negatively impacted by increased purchase transportation rates and the January launch of year-round six-day per week operations. FedEx Freight closed the year with another strong quarter despite weakening industrial production, revenue per shipment increased 4%, operating income increased 15% and operating margin improved to 9.9%. ","Below the line our non-cash mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment of a net $3.9 billion loss was driven by a substantially lower discount rate, which contributed $1.8 billion to the loss, changes in actuarial assumptions which significantly increased the liability and lower-than-expected asset returns. FY 2019 capital expenditures totaled $5.5 million.","For fiscal 2020, we are targeting a mid-single digit percentage decrease in adjusted earnings per share. Our performance has been negatively affected by continued weakness in global trade and industrial production, as well as the near-term impact of certain strategic decisions we have made to sustain our leading position in a changing marketplace. ","At FedEx Express, we expect earnings to be down in FY 2020 due to weakness in international priority revenue and ongoing shift to lower yielding services. Our strategic decision to not renew the FedEx Express U.S. domestic contract with Amazon will also be a near-term headwind, which we expect to reverse to a positive in FY 2021, as we replace the lost volume and optimize the network. Additionally, we do not expect a significant benefit from the fuel surcharge table changes in FY 2019 repeat and FY 2020. ","FedEx Express will continue to implement actions to reduce cost to serve, improve efficiencies and adjusted to global network to match anticipated demand. While we expect to make significant progress on TNT integration activities in FY 2020, integration work will continue into FY 2021. We expect to incur approximately $350 million of integration expenses in FY 2020 and $1.7 billion in total through FY 2021.","At FedEx Ground, we expect volume and revenue growth to remain very strong in FY 2020. However, operating margins will face headwinds from higher operating costs associated with expanding FedEx Ground\u2019s delivery schedule, improving our capabilities for large packages and other investments to significantly improve efficiency and safety as Raj mentioned.","At FedEx Freight, we expect continued to improve performance, as we remain focused on improving revenue quality, while implementing technology solutions that will drive efficiency and further differentiate us in the LTL market. ","Our FY 2020 effective tax rate prior to year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments is expected to increase to 23% to 25% and will likely vary from quarter-to-quarter. And in addition, our tax rate is very sensitive to international income, which may cause the rate to vary from that range. FY 2020 capital spending is expected to be $5.9 billion. These expenditures will include FedEx Express investments in aircraft and hub modernization, FedEx Ground investments that increase our efficiency in handling large packages and investments in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks and improve our competitiveness. ","All of these targets assume moderate U.S. economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. A further ramping in anti-trade measures and or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business.","As I mentioned earlier, a substantial decline in this account rates, changes in actuarial assumptions and lower-than-expected asset returns negatively impacted our FY 2019 mark-to-market adjustment. With that our U.S. qualified pension plan funded status declined to approximately 90%. While we are not required to make a pension contribution in FY 2020, we are expecting to contribute $1 billion.","Also, we have funded large increases in our dividend and significant share repurchase over the last several years. Our stock buyback level is expected to be significantly lower in FY 2020 and our dividend remains at $0.65 per quarter.","In conclusion, management is focused on improving our near-term performance, while also position FedEx for long-term success. While we are adjusting cost to mitigate macro uncertainties and address the growth of e-commerce, we will continue to invest in areas that expand our capabilities and improve our long-term efficiencies. We are confident that these investments will drive long-term earnings growth and improve margins, cash flows and return. ","Now, let me turn the call back over to Fred to introduce the topic Mark Allen is going to discuss.","Fred Smith","Thank you, Alan. First before I do that, let me take a point of personal privilege and mention something in the Wall Street Journal article yesterday, which I'm uniquely qualified to speak to. And it's the statement that I started the Express unit four decades ago to ferry shipments like legal documents and medical supplies over long distances. Facts of the matter are that when FedEx began operations, it was specifically prohibited for private carriers to move documents of any type that was only permitted a number of years later when there were relaxation of the private express statutes in order to facilitate the fast movements of legal and financial documents.","And rather than medical supplies, the company was basically put together to pick up, transport and deliver first overnight from any address in U.S. to any other address in the United States technology packages, which was the basic market that we were serving. Of course, we then added two day Express, we expanded internationally, added pallets and of course today we pick up and transport millions of items in the Express business on a far larger scale at a far, far lower price.","The biggest issue on a go forward basis and the article goes on to say that the Express unit wasn\u2019t built for e-commerce, the reality is it's perfectly built for e-commerce with the exception that we have to address. As we've said on several of the remarks here, including mine that we have to be very efficient in delivering to residential or making residential deliveries, which are an increasing part of the traffic moving through both the Ground and the Express network.","So with that clarification, let me turn now to the subject of the lawsuit that we filed yesterday. There has been a considerable amount of miss reporting on this as well. Number one, as that is related to the Huawei issue where we miss routed and then apologize for two packages and returned to the shipper erroneously a third. The Huawei packages were only peripherally involved in this lawsuit that we filed. And in fact, it goes back many, many years, which is in the lawsuit itself and it concerns not contraband, which many people have confused. The lawsuit is as concerning. It concerns important export controls as administered by the Department of Commerce.","So we work very hard with all kinds of law enforcement agency, as does the Postal Service and UPS, keep certain types of items out of our networks. Illegal drugs, unlicensed firearms, you could go down the list, you can go and look at the prohibited items on our website, the Postal Service. ","This is not about prohibited items and contraband, it is about regulations that the Department of Commerce administrators, which prohibit entities meaning companies or individuals from exporting or importing, and that's quite different. And in many cases, they're either prohibited completely, or they are restricted to various destinations or to various commodities or certain contents.","In turn that requires a common carrier like FedEx when one of these entities is put on the list to in essence, certify, and in fact, get a certificate from the shipper that basically wants what's in the package or in the shipment. And that's the issue that we're dealing with here. I note that Secretary Ross, who I've known for four decades and respect and like a lot I'm pain by the fact that they issued a statement that disagrees with our position in the litigation. But as we told the Department of Commerce yesterday, we certainly understand their job and their implementation of the trade policy of the administration, this lawsuit doesn't speak to that at all. It speaks to the issues that our general counsel will now tell you about. And after his remarks, we won't have any further comments on this as will let the process play out in the Court. So Mark Allen, our General Counsel will make a statement.","Mark Allen ","The action that we filed yesterday in the Federal District Court in DC request that the government be permanently enjoined from enforcing the export administration regulations against FedEx in circumstances where we have no actual knowledge that the contents of a shipment are subject to the EARs. The BIS takes the position that a common carrier like FedEx can be held liable for shipments that do not comply with the Export Administration Regulations without requiring any evidence that the carrier had any actual knowledge of an apparent violation.","We believe very strongly that the imposition of this sort of strict liability is a clear violation of our constitutional due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. We cannot know the contents of the 15 million packages we handle daily and whether those contents comply with the complex EARs. By requiring us to police the contents of packages moving through our global network, the government is placing an unreasonable burden on a common carrier. ","We have reached out to commerce to let them know of our commitment to compliance. However, we hope to reach an agreement on a common sense way forward. That would be creating a safe harbor that essentially means if we have no knowledge of an apparent violation, the BIS will not come after us.","Fred Smith","So now, we will take your questions and probably have soon teed up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. ","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good afternoon. So you mentioned 2020 is a transition year for earnings and considering the bump in CapEx, clearly it\u2019s going to be difficult for you guys to generate cash this year. So, I guess, do you expect any positive cash flow and could you help us think through the longer term cash generation of the business as you think about 2021 and 2022? Thank you.","Alan Graf","Allison, this is Alan. Yes, I do expect improve free cash flow in FY 2020. And as far as it being a transitional year, I think to explain it about as well as we could I look for past that I can't predict what's going to happen with trade, tariffs, China, G20 and Brexit. So if you\u2019ll just step that aside that turns out well or decent. ","We got a lot of good guys in 2021 we will have seven day ground operation running at full speed. We\u2019ll have the benefits from the full TNT interoperability, we\u2019ll have lower U.S. FedEx Express rural and residential cost, we\u2019ll have unbelievable improvement in Ground productivity and growth and we\u2019ll have continued freight growth and improved productivity.","So I think once we get through 2020 we are going to be in fantastic shape with the global macro paying it over. As to our $5.9 billion, the company wants to spend upwards of seven. We worked very hard to push up projects that I think will have good strategic returns, but a lot of really good things didn\u2019t make the cut. We have a lot of opportunities here particularly on the cost side and we're going to attack them and grow. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee ","Hey, thanks good afternoon. Yes it looks based on the guidance that you are calling for Express to be down from a profit perspective, maybe double digits, wanted to get a sense if you could maybe break out some of the crosscurrents from trade in the macro and sort of what that impact might be on the core business and try to separate that out from some of the things you are doing strategically with delivery as well as some of the late-night pickups and maybe some of the strategic decisions you\u2019ve made around the customer. Anyway you can kind of parse out some of that detailed in sort of that guided weakness in Express would be helpful?","Alan Graf","Chris, Alan again. What we're looking at right now, as I just talked about in our fourth quarter at Express where we had international priority revenues actually down that's hard to recover from in a very short period of time. Again, I don't know what's going to play out here on trade and tariff, so there could be some upside for that, but at the moment I\u2019m not seeing that.","Our load factors coming out of Asia really aren\u2019t bad, but the yields aren\u2019t that good and could be better. So I think the biggest issue is the macro. On the as far as what's going on with Express in the U.S. is doing fine. I mean, we had a great growth rate in our deferred traffic, which we went after intentionally and we're going to get our cost structure in shape to improve the profitability of Express through that, as well. So really it's the macro that's the biggest hangover for what we're looking at for FY 2020.","Operator","And next, we will go to Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for the time. Could to provide some more details around the steps that you're taking to in your word right size your operations to better handle e-commerce, do you foresee perhaps further changes in the business model in an effort to gain these efficiency such as more closely integrating your Ground and Express operations? Thank you.","Fred Smith","I don't recall who said right size, did you Raj, optimize. Well, this is Smith here, I said in my remarks that we made a number of announcements, I don't think anybody on this phone call knew a month ago that FedEx was going to announce seven day a week service, $8,000 general locations, in sourcing 2 million SmartPost packages, building a number of large package and access to exploit that business in ground and then all the other things that Raj and Brie mentioned to you.","So please recall in my remarks I basically said stay tuned that we\u2019ll be telling you some other things during this fiscal year. So we understand the issues involved in e-commerce and residential delivery and Raj made the point specifically, we will be the low cost producer in the e-commerce space for residential deliveries. We're quite confident of that from many perspectives, but we\u2019re not prepared to tell you some of these other moves any more than we were prepared to tell you months ago about the things that I just listed off. But there will be other things that we will announce during FY 2020 in this regard you can count on it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. ","Scott Group","Thanks. Afternoon, So Alan, is there any way you can help us think about maybe the quarterly cadences of earnings just obviously we got some week trends right now, but then really though incentive comps in the second half of the year, any help there? And then, maybe if I just following up on that big picture are there reasons why we could potentially consolidate Ground and Express networks from a delivery standpoint and then any object you can give us on the international buyout potential?","Alan Graf","That\u2019s was three, Scott. So look as the cadence the tax rate is going to be really spotty. I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of assumptions that we have to prove and get through, we\u2019re still looking at all of these pages of interpretations and regs that are coming out left and right. We\u2019re dealing with B, we are dealing with GILTI, you've probably heard this from everybody that you follow international is extremely complex. So tax rate is going to be a factor in our quarter-to-quarter numbers, don\u2019t be surprised by that. ","Secondarily, again, I just can't tell you what's going to happen from the global economic standpoint, so that piece of it, the cadence is going be the cadence it\u2019s a little bit out of our control, we will manage to it. But we don\u2019t want to do anything stupid and then not have the capacity that we need in the right place. So we are watching that extremely carefully.","You asked the Ground, they are going to have a great year. I mean, they really are, they are going to grow, they are going to grow fast and if we can hold margins or get closer to holding margins on this growth with all the expansion and all the investments that they're doing and improving productivity, they are going to be ready to roll in 2021,they are going to have a very consistent year, so that\u2019s about all I can tell you.","The other thing is that people forget that there is a reason that Express has a two days service it\u2019s called distance, when we need an airplane, we need an airplane, the customer really decides which network makes the delivery. I think we've explained this over and over and over again on the margin yes, there's always opportunities. But for the most part we got to fly it when we have to fly it, but the customer can make that decision.","Operator","Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank has our next question.","Amit Mehrotra","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Alan you made the comment, I think in response to Allison's question that free cash flow would be better in fiscal 2020. I'm wondering, if you could just help put a finer point on that based on the macro assumptions that the company has made. And related to that, the billion dollar pension contribution, the voluntary pension contribution, I would imagine that that would be funded with new debt given the offsetting cash savings from the PBGC insurance premiums. And then, just related to that if you can discuss the incremental costs in fiscal 2020 associated with the seven day delivery. Thanks so much.","Alan Graf","Well, there'll be some incremental costs associated with some of the delivery, of course. We've been incurring them, and we will continue to incur them. But that -- now that we've gone to six day, the seven day leap is not nearly as significant. So those won't be material. But they probably will likely be a headwind. But I have to say, what I'm hearing from my team is that the customers are lining up to get to seven day, and we're going to do it very efficiently. And I think we'll be able to start it in a very good way. So, again, I'm excited about what's happening in that regard.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Ross with Stifel.","David Ross","Yes, good afternoon. Just back on the TNT integration expenses, the total cost of $1.7 billion is about double what it initially was. Can you just remind us what that additional expense is for and is there a difference between network integration, which you said is going to be completed in the next year, and network improvement or upgrades that need to be made to the TNT system?","Alan Graf","Hey, David, it's Alan again. Not double. I will tell you a couple of things. One is that we originally gave you a $400 million number about not [indiscernible]. That's an old number that's never been updated. But it continues to be a problem for us in terms of integration as we have to basically rebuild a system that TNT had and then integrate it with the network that we've got on the purple side. And it's cost us a lot more money and slowed it down. And it's made it more complex.","The good news on that side is that we -- the interoperability will be done by the end of the fiscal year. And that's when we can start really harvesting the benefits of that low cost road network and flow to Express packages through it seamlessly without all kinds of double handling and double packaging and everything else. I\u2019ll let Raj add to this.","Raj Subramaniam","Yes, I\u2019ll just say that there has been tremendous momentum in the last -- literally in the last few months on the TNT integration. We are -- we have the vision of interoperability by end up fiscal year 2020 with and ultimately one network for air, and one network for ground. It's a lot of value to be had here. But what I want to say here is that we are waiting to create value for the customers because the customer value has been created as we speak, we are speeding up lanes, and our service levels are very good and the demand is strong. So, I think we made a lot of progress and there is significant value in this investment and it'll come to bear fiscal 2021 onwards.","Operator","And next we'll go to David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hey a question for you, Fred or Raj on the portfolio. Obviously, the expansion into the virtual kind of retail footprint with the partnerships with Dollar General things like that. Is there a point where you maybe look at the portfolio and say, why do we still have the services business? Do you need that retail footprint? Do you ever get to a point where you kind of rethink the composition of that part of the business?","Raj Subramaniam","I guess you're asking about the FedEx Office, I think, it plays a very important role as part of our retail network, especially as we move forward on e-commerce, some of the premium value added services on hold a location plus return services are several things that we process to the FedEx Office that\u2019s unique and differentiated. And the value is going to get even better as the e-commerce trends increase. I don't know Brie if you want to add anything more to that.","Brie Carere","Yes, the only thing that I will add is obviously we're very excited about the expansion of our onsite retail partnerships with Walgreens and with Dollar General. The FedEx Office retail locations bring in some of our most profitable small and medium business because the experience they get when they are shipping internationally when they were shipping and they want the peace of mind of proper packaging. That is absolutely just stellar experience and those employees just deliver a great experience. So we're very committed to that element of the portfolio.","Raj Subramaniam","Yes. And don\u2019t forget these FedEx office locations, the size of this FedEx offices are substantial and is an excellent place to conduct e-commerce. And as Brie pointed out the most profitable packages for the FedEx system comes to the FedEx office network.","Alan Graf","And we're expanding inside Walmart stores, which is becoming a great partnership and Brie, thanks for mentioning profitability I loved it.","Operator","Our next question will comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. ","Brandon Oglenski","Good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my questions. And Mr. Smith I really submit this question humbly as an analyst that never run a business, but I guess you know at what point do we question the scale of the Express networks because we've seen decade after decade of low returns, low margins and peak economic activity that can\u2019t put in a pretty good return, but still never really crossing that threshold of covering the cost of capital. And on the call today just seems like the strategy is the same put more capital in optimize, but not right size. So I guess why not a more radical look at the business I think someone suggest to look at integrating portions of Express or Ground or maybe even going more aggressively just on the overall footprint of the business. Can you talk to that please?","Fred Smith","Did you ask me the same question in the last analyst call, or somebody else asked me a similar question. But look, the only way I can respond to that is obviously the plans and the programs we put in place were designed to create superior returns. We didn't just decide to do it for the hell of it and it reminds me a little bit about that old adage of Mike Tyson that everybody is got a plan till they get hit in the mouth.","So one of the things that always amuses me about watching a lot of things that are written about FedEx and so forth. The competition has a vote and the economy has a vote, so clearly we\u2019ve been very disappointed over the last few years with the assumptions that we made on the growth in international trade, particularly with the Trump administration. The United States policy since 1934 with Roosevelt and the Secretary of State Cordell Hull was to expand international trade. ","And now we have a huge dispute where the United States is basically become protectionist defined as I will make everything I need in my own borders. I don't need to import things and quite frankly don't particularly need to export them, despite the fact that 95% of the world\u2019s population is outside the United States. So we have become a protectionist country. We don't agree with the Chinese position on trade either and been very vocal about that, which is mercantilist. I would like to sell to you, but I won't buy from you on a reciprocal basis.","So your question implies that we have said around and you said quote for decades. We don't look at the business as a single segment, we\u2019ve said that over and over again, it all be constructed and to some degree I sort of added in that today by making an exception saying we expected Freight and Ground to have earnings increases and margin increases in Freight and hopefully any compression in Ground due to the expansion will be very small.","So clearly as we go forward and things change, if we don't resume any kind of international growth we would change our approach to the business. We don't have any sacred cows here, but you also have to remember in the Express business as Alan said, our domestic Express business is doing fine, it\u2019s not the issue, it\u2019s the international business that\u2019s having a problem for the reasons that Brie and now I am saying to you. Good news is that if traffic and yields materialize, the conversion rate to profitability is probably in the neighborhood of 60%, because it\u2019s a network where the incremental volume goes to the bottom line faster than any of our other activity.","In the case of TNT, I have to say I've been amazed not just with the people who follow FedEx in this industry, with the amazing disinterest and the NotPetya attack. It was the largest single attack by a state-sponsored entity in history of the world. It has put the Ukraine on its knees. The only reason that it was less of a factor to us than it was, was because of the fantastic work of our IT team that went and remediated it, had it not been that TNT had been a subsidiary of FedEx, the company would've been bankrupt. It would have just gone out of business. ","So clearly we should of sat and waited, knowing not NotPetya was coming, we could have picked up the pieces. It would've been a lot easier on us. So I think I\u2019m going to ask Rob Carter, our CIO to just give you a bit of color which he was giving me the other day about the NotPetya account to my knowledge, the only in-depth article that's ever been written by that I think was in wired magazine. And when you read that it's like Oh My God this is one of the most underreported stories in history.","So to get to your point, of course, we want to make money in these networks and we will engineer and modify them to the extent that we need to, but you got to remember those two things. The anticipation of continued embrace of free trade, which was our assumption on building a lot of the stuff and then not assuming the NotPetya things are the two exogenous factors that we\u2019ve been dealing with. So Rob you want to comment on this.","Rob Carter","This attack was weapons grade attack by Russia on Ukraine that utilize cyber tools that were built by the NSA and the U.S. government, a group called Shadow Broker [ph] stole those tools and they were turned back on the Ukraine and the devastation in the Ukraine just hasn't properly been reported. All the airports were down, all the trains were down, hospital systems were lost, the monitoring systems in Chernobyl that monitor what is the most infamous nuclear plant in the world were lost.","If you looked at pictures that are on the Internet of the Kyiv Airport every single screen showing the red screen of death every point of sale terminal in the big grocery stores showing the same thing, every ATM machine down in the country. This was an amazing attack and we are thankful that our teams were certainly able to stop it at the borders of TNT it didn\u2019t impact the FedEx enterprise. But the devastation in the TNT technology state was considerable to say the least.","The good news for today is that the state is running significantly better than it ever has with high degrees of reliability that are positively impacting service levels for TNT and the integrated networks that are being put in place now. But Fred's right this was a devastating attack for a nation state that couldn't defend itself and businesses like ours and many others were impacted as well.","Alan Graf","Brandon, this is Alan. I just want to -- since the question is an important one, I just feel like I need to weigh in as a CFO. What you just -- the question you asked we talk about all the time, we talk at the board level, we talked about our SMCs, let me just add two things. In fourth quarter a year ago, we were almost there. We had Express running on all cylinders. And that was without TNT providing anything but a drag. So I know we can do it. I know we will do it, I\u2019m disappointed that we haven't done it, but I believe strongly that when we get the interoperability up and we get any kind of global trade environment that's reasonable that we will be successful with our international Express.","Operator","Our next question will come from Helane Becker with Cowen. ","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. I appreciate the time. Fred, what happened to the Guangzhou hub in this whole China, U.S trade situation if anything?","Fred Smith","Well, there is a tremendous trade dispute going on between China and the United States as is reported almost hourly on the business TV stations. But we've been a good corporate citizen in China for decades. And we are completely dedicated to compliance in China. And we have expressed that to them and reinforced it. So they audit us in Guangzhou and many other locations. And probably there have been an increase in audits as a result of this to some degree. But we've cooperated fully with the China State Postal Bureau and their investigation of the two miss routed packages and the erroneously returned package.","Again, we apologize to the customers, they never left our possessions, we offered to make things right, but that has nothing to do with China or Huawei. It has everything to do with the purple promise. We\u2019d have done that for any customer. So our Guangzhou hub is a huge part of the economy of the Pearl River Basin. And so we hope there's not going to be any further deterioration in U.S., China trade relations.","Let me say again, just because it's important for this audience to know about this request that we made of the DC Circuit Court on these export regulations, which really led us to do that at the end of the day wasn't Huawei at all, it was on last Friday, there were five new entities added with these extraordinarily opaque requirements. And contrary what is hear in the media, we don't have to be complicit in this. It's strict liability. ","If you make a mistake, if the Department of Commerce, BIS, which stands for Bureau of Industry and Security, they are empowered under their regulations, not we think based on congressional law, but on their own regulation. You find us or any other common carrier, if what what's been represented in that shipment, even though we have a certificate saying that it complies, $250,000 per package.","So I don't think that's what they intended. And as Mark said, hopefully we're going to deal with them. But that is separate and distinct from the Huawei situation, which was three packages out of a 15 million package per day. So it's very difficult these days to keep this in perspective. But we've tried to do so and we\u2019ve got a great team in China, Karen Reddington, our President and Eddy Chan, who runs China for us and our government affairs people. So hopefully we don't have any issues there, certainly hadn\u2019t been any operational issues to speak up.","Operator","The next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.","Bascome Majors","Yes, thanks for taking my question here. Alan, I was curious if you could tell us how much incentive comp helped the results in 2019 on absolute basis? I know it was $350 million through the first two quarters of the year. And how much would a target level be for that to fully come back? And how much or how close to that target are you budgeting into fiscal 2020 outlook? Thanks.","Alan Graf","Hey, Bascome. We're going to have an 8-K in July. I don't think that's too much of a strategic question. The AIC that we are forecasting for FY 2020 is in the guidance I gave you. And why don't we just leave it at that and follow up with IR later.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Hey, good afternoon. You noted the profit growth at Ground incorporated the startup for Sunday delivery and would still be up. Given the move of retailers for more next day delivery from Walmart target to Amazon, do you see a larger shift going from Express -- I'm sorry, from Ground to Express packages and how does that change your dynamic and cost structure?","Raj Subramaniam","So, this is Raj. Let me -- the reason we have now a full portfolio of services on transportation and other e-commerce services is to cater to all the needs of retailers and e-tailers as we go forward here. So to your question, when Walmart talked overnight for Walmart while we are the service provider for that and we have a lot of overnight volume for that. If you need extra hours for target we provide that, if we need a local zone one ground delivery we have that service as well.","So my point here is that we have now a full portfolio of e-commerce delivery services along with technology and returns and more to come as the Chairman talked about it is the most robust in the marketplace. So it's really putting together the whole picture that we are trying to do here.","Alan Graf","Hey Ken, Alan. What Ground is working on and doing a great job of is lowering their cost structure dramatically, we wouldn't be taking all the SmartPost packages into our own network if it wasn't the fact that we can do it for a lower cost than the postage. The postage is going to keep going up we're driving our cost down. So, that's an important phenomenon for you to understand. Secondarily again, the customer decides time and distance is how we decide, which network it goes into Ground swung its assets it\u2019s double turning, it\u2019s doing all kinds of things, but it can't make a really late in the evening pickup for next day delivery or two-day delivery of any kind distance and that's when it goes to Express.","So as Raj was explaining to you. We've got networks to provide whatever the customer wants. And that's important thing, but I don't want today to go by that people understanding Ground is significantly lowering its unit cost and doing it very rapidly.","Operator","And next we will go to Tom Wadewitz from UBS. ","Tom Wadewitz","Good evening, thank you for the question. Sticking on that topic, I guess, perhaps you could offer more color on what some of the actions are to significantly lower the cost structure in Ground. I guess my intuition is that in transportation density drives cost and it seems like in the all-in on e-commerce you are doing a number of things that will help grow the business, but could drive some dilution in your density just more B2C packages. So just wondering if you could help us understand the offsets to some of the margin pressure and perhaps a little more on what you're saying Alan in terms of really significantly lowering the cost structure in Ground?","Alan Graf","I got this one, of course it\u2019s density and as fast as Ground is growing, as fast as the packages are coming to and the fact that we're swinging the assets more and with the technology and engineering expertise that we have, which is world class. We can handle a whole lot more traffic, at a lot lower unit cost and that's a great place to be. All by the way as I want to iterate Ground is faster on 25% on lanes net, sometimes we get compared to over the peak season about how well we do versus the competition, everybody forgets, they are holding us to our own standards, not what all the competition does that makes us one, two or three days faster during peak season. So I think we are in great place and that\u2019s how we're doing it.","Operator","And that does conclude our question and answer session today. And I would like to turn it over to Mickey Foster for closing remarks. ","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation's fourth quarter earnings conference call.

And now our chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Fred Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. FedEx had a good quarter, despite higher fuel costs and one fewer operating day. Growth in overall customer demand for our wide range of global transportation solutions drove improved earnings.","FedEx Ground reported another outstanding quarter, as average daily volume grew 11%. FedEx Express is skillfully executing its profit improvement plans. As part of this, earlier this month, FedEx Express took delivery of its first new Boeing 767 300 freighter, which uses about 30% less fuel and offers at least a 20% operating cost over the MD-10 it replaces.","We\u2019re reaffirming our forecast for full year\u2019s earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% over FY13\u2019s adjusted results. We believe FedEx is well-positioned for continued growth and success as customers around the world realize the full value of our portfolio of solutions.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his views on the economy, and then to Alan Graf for details on the financial results. Mike?","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred. The FedEx economic forecast calls for continued moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar year \u201913, which is down 0.4 of a point versus last quarter, and 2.5% for calendar \u201914, which represents no change versus the last quarter.","For industrial production, we expect growth of 2.4% in calendar \u201913, again down 0.4 versus last quarter, and 3.4% in calendar \u201914, which is down 0.1 versus last quarter. It\u2019s important to note that historical data revisions account for most of the reduction in the calendar year \u201813 growth rates.","Policy risk remains high, but there are signs of improvement in Europe and China. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2% for calendar \u201913, down 0.3 versus last quarter, and 2.9% for calendar \u201914, down 0.1 versus last quarter.","Turning to yield per package, in the domestic express segment, excluding the impact of fuel, year over year package yield increased 2.7%. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements followed by increased weight per package and product mix.","The ground packaging yield increased 2.2%, excluding the impact of fuel. The year over year increase was driven by rate and discount improvements, an increase in extra services charges, and product mix.","In the international express segment, export, excluding fuel, International Export Express package yield declined 2.1% year over year due to changes to rate and discount and weight.","And finally, in the freight segment, or the LTL segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight increased 1.1% year over year. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount changes and shipment class.","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. We had a good quarter. Revenues and earnings increased, driven by the solid performances in all of our transportation segments. Operating income grew 7% year over year, primarily from improved profitability at Express, higher volumes and increased yields at Ground, and improved performance at Freight.","Our margin improved 30 basis points versus last year to 7.2%, despite significant headwinds from the fuel surcharge timing lag, as well as one fewer operating day. Offsetting those headwinds for the quarter were benefits from lower aircraft maintenance and salaries and wages expense.","For Express, quarter one operating income grew 14%, and operating margin improved 50 basis points year over year, despite the significant negative impact of net fuel and one fewer operating day. The improvement was driven by stronger US-based business performance, lower pension expense, and the continued monetization of the company\u2019s aircraft fleet, which helped to drive maintenance costs lower. These were partially offset by higher related depreciation expense.","Turning to Ground, operating income grew 5% year over year, despite the negative impact of fuel. Higher network expansion costs were also incurred, as we continue to invest heavily in the growing Ground and Smart Post businesses at very high ROIC. The improvement in Ground was driven by higher volumes, despite one fewer operating day, and higher revenue per package.","Freight\u2019s operating income increased slightly, despite one fewer operating day year over year. Higher weight per shipment, LTL yields, and average daily LTL shipments improved income at Freight. Freight continued to optimize the line haul network by increasing utilization of lower-cost rail over the quarter. Now at 17% of total line haul miles.","As for the outlook, based on the economic conditions that Mike talked about, we reaffirm our FY14 earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% from the FY13 adjusted results. Our outlook depends on stable fuel prices. Fuel price volatility impacts the timing of our fuel surcharge levels in relation to fuel expense and ultimately demand for our services.","As part of our profit improvement program, we are continuing to evaluate further cost reduction actions to continue to improve our results at Express and to ensure that we achieve our $1.6 billion profit improvement goal at Express by the end of FY16.","With regard to the voluntary buyout program, as of August 31, approximately 45% of the 3,600 employees that have accepted the voluntary buyout have vacated their positions. The additional 55% will depart throughout the remainder of FY14, with approximately 25% remaining until May 31, 2014. Total SG&A savings from our profit improvement program is expected to be $600 million on an annual basis, by the end of FY16.","Now we\u2019ll open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","I wanted to ask about the capacity side in the International Express business. Obviously margins are a lot better than expected on the Express side this quarter, and I know that\u2019s due to a lot of what you\u2019ve got going on on the domestic side as well. But wanted to dig in and see how the progress has been going in terms of the third party line haul initiative, and where you guys are at in terms of frequencies on export flights out of Asia.","Dave Bronczek ","You\u2019re right, we adjusted for the second quarter in a row now. Last quarter, in April, and this quarter, in July, we reduced some of our global capacity coming out of Asia, which you saw in some of our numbers in terms of fuel usage and fuel in general.","That being said, our International Economy volume continues to grow at a rapid rate. It was up 15%. I think it\u2019s been in the teens now for several quarters in a row. So we\u2019re actually putting those packages, and that network, into the right system form now, that is actually benefitting us across the world.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Ross of Stifel Investments.","Bruce Chan - Stifel Nicolaus ","It\u2019s actually Bruce Chan on for David Ross. I\u2019m just curious, on the trade network side, we\u2019ve heard from some of the other forwarders out there that trans-Pac volumes have been kind of blah, with soft summer volumes and limited optimism for 2014. I\u2019m wondering if your outlook is the same, or if you\u2019re expecting something a little bit rosier, and if rosier, is that because you\u2019re taking share, whether price related or product offering related?","Dave Bronczek ","We\u2019re toggling our traffic back and forth between Express and FTN, so FTN is performing very well. I think the volumes are slightly higher. The yields are a little bit weaker. I think that\u2019s the case across the world, but it\u2019s performing exactly like we had planned it to, so our FTN organization is doing a terrific job, great service, and moving the lower-yielding international economy into their network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford of Baird.","Benjamin Hartford - Robert W. Baird ","I guess if we could just tie that all together, could you give us a sense, Dave, maybe where you believe the network is in relation to needing to divert lower yielding freight off of your aircraft into third-party capacity? Do you feel like you\u2019ve gotten out in front of this trade down phenomenon that\u2019s been discussed a lot? Do you still feel like there\u2019s incremental progress to be made in terms of putting the lower yielding packages onto the appropriate modes? Can you provide some perspective there?","Dave Bronczek ","It\u2019s a great question. We feel very good about where we are. We have not affected service whatsoever. We have the world-class service around the globe. We\u2019ve adjusted the capacity, moving the right traffic in the right network. We have more upside opportunity to keep growing our International Economy more financially favorably now, whereas in the past we used to cap that traffic. So we have a great network now for International Priority, all around the world. We have more upside there; we have more upside in International Economy as well. It\u2019s been a terrific shift for us to match what\u2019s happening in the global economy.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning, it's [Scott] [ph] in for Chris. My question pertains to Ground margins. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of some of the individual headwinds that you faced during the quarter, the higher network expansion costs, fuel surcharge, and one less operating day, and what those effects were on margins.","Henry Maier ","Virtually of the year over year change in margin was due to fuel. And as Alan pointed out, operating income was impacted by fuel and one less operating day. Network expansion costs, at this point in time, are really for capacity, and part of our anticipation of peak buildup.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","Alan, a question for you on the SG&A. I think you mentioned you\u2019re now expecting $600 million of savings. I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding it right. Is that comparable with the $500 million you initially laid out at the analyst day over a year ago? And then can you give some color on when we should expect to see that? When I look at labor savings this quarter, and I back out pension, we don\u2019t really see any signs of the headcount reductions, and is that a timing issue or are there any offsets there we should think about?","Alan Graf ","You asked several questions in there, so let me do my best. First, on the tactical one, we made acquisitions last year that are year over year, and on your last question, that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing there. Yes, the $600 million is comparable to the $500 million. We are actually well ahead of our cost goals that we outlined 11 months ago, and I feel very comfortable about where we are on the cost side. And we\u2019ll continue to work that hard.","We have great productivity improvement programs going on in other places as well, aside from labor, notably AOD productivity, and you\u2019re seeing that in our maintenance expense at Express. We have some additional opportunities in strategic sourcing that we\u2019re going to be tacking that I think are going to help us reach our goal.  ","Now, having said that, to your strategic question, the world looks a lot different today than it did 11 months ago, when we gave you the very specific five buckets about how we were going to improve at Express. So after you listen to what Mike said about \u201913 and \u201814\u2019s economic outlook, I think that we\u2019re going to have a little bit more pressure on our base erosion at Express that we\u2019ve got to, as Dave talked about, match lift to load, if you will.","So we\u2019re aggressively doing that. That may mean that we have to get to the 1.6 a little bit differently than what we described to you, and it may mean that we will be more back end loaded towards the second half of \u201915 and \u201916 as we start really driving the leverage of the things that we\u2019re doing. But we\u2019re committed to the 1.6, and we\u2019ll have that by the end of FY16, and I feel comfortable by saying that in today\u2019s environment.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Following on the international side, I just want to understand, on the trade down effect, are you taking further steps? And to Alan\u2019s point there, are you now looking to get some of those cost savings internationally? I think you talked about originally maybe moving some of these cost programs into the international bucket. And have you started to look at that on the cost side?","Alan Graf","I thank you for the question, because again I want to stress that as a strategy from FedEx Corporation, we are embracing International economy. And we like these growth rates. And we believe very strongly that we can make the shift that the customers are making while still growing the premium service of IP. It will just be at a slower growth rate than we had anticipated 11 months ago. But the IE network is coming in place very nicely, and we\u2019re going to continue to work on that and I feel pretty comfortable that we\u2019ll make this strategic change. And I\u2019ll let Dave give you some more detail.","Dave Bronczek ","That\u2019s right, Alan. You saw in the numbers our flight hours were down significantly and our fuel usage was down significantly, and that\u2019s on our own backbone network. And as we expand our International Economy traffic into other networks, that\u2019s actually a very positive thing for us on both sides of the financial equation for Express. So we are embracing the economy service. In those traffic cohorts there\u2019s a lot more upside there. We\u2019ve capped it in the past.","Operator","We\u2019re going to take our next question from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays ","I guess I want to focus for a third question here on cost. For the first time, we actually saw Express quarterly costs ex-fuel come down, although slightly. Should we expect that to accelerate throughout fiscal \u201914 and into \u201915? And Alan, are those cost cuts just becoming a little bit more challenging to derive? Is that why you\u2019re saying it might be a little bit more back end loaded to achieve that 75% of $1.6 billion next year?","Alan Graf","Again, acquisitions that are now fully in our P&L are kind of masking what we\u2019re doing in terms of bending our costs down. And I think I also mentioned to you about we still have over half the people that are still working here through the first quarter from our voluntary buyout program, which a year from now they\u2019ll all have left and we will be able to see a much bigger number at Express directly and from the chargeback that Express gets from services. So I think that\u2019s the macro answer to your question. Dave has a lot of specific productivity things going on, so I\u2019ll turn it over to him.","Dave Bronczek ","We\u2019ve hardened all of our expense programs. They\u2019re all working exactly as we would like them to work. That\u2019s what we told you. In fact, I guess it was the question before, it\u2019s actually all around the world on our expense targets and performance there. So with the exception of acquisitions that have added a layer of expense, and revenue quite frankly, and without the impact of fuel this quarter that was significant for Express, our operating profit improving 14% is right in line with what we\u2019ve planned to achieve and are achieving.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs","We\u2019ve noticed that the cash flows continue to build up nicely, and you\u2019re now looking at about $5 billion in the quarter. Can you give us a little bit of guidance as to how we should be thinking about capital allocation with regard to, perhaps, your longer term plan for capex? And as we think about modeling, do we want to think about modeling capex as some sort of ratio as a percentage of fixed assets, or revenue? And then within that component, what percent do you think is more for replacement as opposed to the growth side of the capex?","Alan Graf ","Our capex strategy has changed over time, as we are now focused on replacement and modernization of the aircraft fleet at Express, which is driving, and you\u2019re already seeing it. Notice the last two fiscal years, in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ve significantly reduced, and we\u2019ve retired a number of planes, we\u2019ve shortened the depreciable lives, which of course is a headwind for Dave\u2019s segment. But it\u2019s for replacement capital, which is much more efficient, and with fuel prices where they are - you know, jet\u2019s at $3 - it\u2019s absolutely mandatory that we continue to do that if we\u2019re going to hit our $1.6 billion goal.","We want to put as much money as we possibly can into Ground, because it\u2019s going to continue to grow. It\u2019s very high ROIC. Ground\u2019s margins are going to stay in the 17% to 19% range, and we\u2019re going to continue to take market share. Freight, they\u2019ve done a great job of continuing to tweak their operating model a lot more on rail. We expect freight to grow, and so we\u2019ll invest there as well.","As to capital allocation, we continue to talk about that as the strategic level all the time, and we don\u2019t have anything to say about capital allocation today, and we\u2019ll keep you posted.","Operator","We\u2019re going to take our next question from Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie ","Alan, maybe if you could give us some more color on the different buckets outside of the SG&A, how you get to that $1.6 billion number. I know things have changed around a little bit, but could you give us any more sense on what the size of the other buckets look like?","Alan Graf ","Well, we\u2019re only one quarter into a 12-quarter program. I was just trying to point out that we have to manage the business as well, and things change, and we\u2019re doing that. So whereas we were looking at a different revenue outlook for International Express 11 months ago, components have changed. There will be much more IE in the future than we had anticipated, and probably less IP, although it will continue to grow. So we have to change our cost structure more than we thought. So you might see a little bit more on the cost side of the equation, and a little bit less on the revenue benefit side of the equation.","Dave Bronczek ","And these are the buckets that we\u2019ve gone over before, but just so you can put them down, domestic transformation, or domestic cost network, if you will; international profit improvement across the world; fleet modernization; efficiency of staff functions and the process therein - of course, targeting profitable yields and revenue growth.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer ","In Ground, you\u2019ve spoken about building out capacity and spending a bit more on capex this year. Can you give us a progress report, an update, on what\u2019s going on there? You mentioned some buildout for the holidays. Also, is there any work there to strategically capitalize on etailer strategies, expanding distribution networks?","Henry Maier ","There were a lot of questions there, so I hope I get them all. First of all, 90% of the capital expense is to expand our capacity for growth. And the large elements of these expenditures are new hubs, building expansions and relocations, material handling, and rolling stock. So we are very disciplined, as I\u2019ve said in the past, about adding capital. We try to handle peaks in volume with operating expense instead of capital, and we generally put together a five to seven year plan based on our forecast as to how we intend to expand the network.","Now, clearly our volume is being driven by ecommerce. I think Mike has said in the past it\u2019s growing 5-6 times the rate of brick and mortar. I would tell you that we believe that we are uniquely positioned to compete in this space. We have FedEx Home Delivery for customers that desire high-touch, high value transportation services for their residential deliveries.","FedEx Home Delivery offers extra services, including day-definite service, appointment service, and evening delivery, in addition to signature options. And then we have FedEx Smart Post, which is uniquely positioned to offer a low-cost option for customers who would like to offer free shipping to their customers. And we do this with final mile delivery by the USPS. So we think that we\u2019re uniquely positioned in the marketplace to capture our fair share of ecommerce.","Operator","We\u2019re going to take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens ","Just had a quick question on the tech product launches that are planned here in the second half of 2013. Can you just give us some color on what you think that will do to overall industry capacity, and maybe what\u2019s baked into your guidance from a volume and rate perspective?","Mike Glenn ","Obviously we\u2019ll see some tech launches this week. There have been changes in the way that tech products are moved into the marketplace. A lot more staging of inventory going on the international front as opposed to using expedited from door to door. So we have seen some changes in that regard in terms of how product is moved to the U.S. and put into inventory.","We will certainly benefit from that, with these launches. Probably a greater benefit in the domestic system, although it is a short burst. So even though it\u2019s a lot of traffic in a very short period of time, you don\u2019t see the long tail of that that potentially you\u2019ve seen in the past, although certainly we\u2019ll benefit from accessories and other things that come on the back end of these tech launches.","Operator","We\u2019re going to take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff Kauffman - Buckingham Research ","You did take down modestly your U.S. and global forecast. I know you mentioned, Fred, that it was related to some changes in the makeups of these growth objectives. But in terms of your own outlook, you spent a little less capex than we were looking for. What are your thoughts on your capital budget for this year, and what is changing in your own forecast where you\u2019re maintaining your forward guidance in the face of lower global growth?","Mike Glenn ","Let me clarify. On the current year \u201913 economic outlook I mentioned that it\u2019s historical data revisions that are really driving the bulk of the reduction in our calendar year \u201913 growth rates. Obviously as GDP numbers are updated, which takes some time, we build that back into the historical trend, and that affects the forecast going forward. So really not as much material change in the fundamentals of the business, as opposed to just historical data revisions on the economic forecast. And I\u2019ll let Alan handle the second part.","Alan Graf","We\u2019re not changing our capital spending plans for this year. As I said, we want to continue to invest heavily in Ground, and we want to continue to do the fleet replacement at Express. As we look at \u201915 and \u201916, as part of the profit improvement program and other things, there may be a possibility that we will slide some of that further out depending on how the economy goes.","And we\u2019ll just have to see. We have some flexibility to do that, but I think $4 billion is the right number for us this year. If we can sort of hold that level for a while, as revenues grow, then we\u2019ll get a better capex to revenue ratio. I\u2019m not making any \u201915 commitments yet, because we\u2019re going to have to wait and see what the outlook looks like, but I can tell you the 767s, the first 25 of them, are just beautiful from a return and operating profit improvement standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William Greene - Morgan Stanley ","Mike, can you remind us, on the GRI in Express, how much of the business does that cover? And also, does it include dim weight pricing changes? Because it seems like that\u2019s been quite effective for pricing in the past.","Mike Glenn ","Well, that\u2019s been one of our key strategies, to substantially increase the amount of parcel traffic that is covered by the GRI. And we\u2019ve done a terrific job over the last three to four years. That\u2019s been a key component of our revenue management program. So well over half the traffic is now impacted.","We certainly have contracts that still are in place today that are locked into a GRI, and it\u2019s based upon the contract term and not the annual GRI. But our sales team and our pricing science team have done a phenomenal job of working with customers to get them on an annual rate increase. So we\u2019re very pleased with that.","We did not make any changes to the dimensional weight that we put in place several years ago. That\u2019s the last time we made the change. But that clearly has benefited the company, that strategic change we made several years ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry - Credit Suisse ","I was wondering if you could quantify what the overall fuel lag headwind was during the quarter, and if we should be expecting a similar impact in Q2.","Alan Graf ","While we don\u2019t give specific numbers, I can tell you it was significant. If you just think about how the fuel prices ran up towards the end of the quarter, and our fuel surcharge lags by six weeks, it\u2019s pretty evident that we were paying a lot higher for jet fuel and not able to pass along the surcharge.","As to Q2 and the rest of the year, I wish I could tell you. It\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s a big wildcard on a quarter to quarter basis, is what happens with, particularly, jet fuel prices, but also with diesel and vehicle fuel. But particularly jet fuel prices.","If the global political environment calms down a little bit, and the price of crude declines and jet fuel follows it, then that would be beneficial to us in the second quarter, but I can\u2019t predict it. So we just have the six-week lag, and we just have to deal with it. Over time it evens out, but it sure does cause volatility.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","I wanted to follow up on one of the topics, Dave Bronczek, that you talked about a little bit earlier on the shift into IE traffic, and I guess how that relates to trade down. So your comments were pretty optimistic, that you\u2019re making good progress. And I just wanted to get a sense is that something that you\u2019re optimistic because you\u2019re going to see this change, but you\u2019re early in the change in terms of shifting that traffic? Or have you just executed this maybe quicker than we would have anticipated, and you\u2019d say, hey, 50% of our IE traffic is already in commercial lift, and that trade down headwind that we\u2019ve been concerned about really wasn\u2019t that big of an issue in the quarter. So I guess some further perspective on the trade down and shift of IE traffic would be great.","Dave Bronczek ","Great question. We\u2019ve actually been looking at this issue, planning for it. As you know, we\u2019ve talked about it for several quarters. Our team has executed this flawlessly. It\u2019s been terrific for our customers and for our network, of course. I think you\u2019re going to see, going forward, that we think we have more opportunity in the International Economy side. We used to capital that International Economy traffic in our existing line haul network. And going forward, there\u2019s an opportunity to grow that and grow it successfully. So I think the answer to your question, we\u2019ve planned it now for several quarters. We\u2019ve executed it flawlessly, and we\u2019re very excited about where we are. Mike?","Mike Glenn ","I just would add one point. I think one of the keys to success that we\u2019ve had is the terrific collaboration between our sales team and the Express operating unit, in terms of getting customers into the right network. And we\u2019re early in that process, but I\u2019m extremely happy with the results in terms of how we\u2019ve been able to collaborate here to get to the right solution for our customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar ","I noticed a pretty strong 16% growth in international domestic volume. Is this organic, or mostly from folding in acquisitions? And I guess related, could you comment on international regions where you\u2019ve seen particular strength?","Dave Bronczek","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s from both, actually, acquisitions and our organic European plan. The organic plan has performed outstandingly well. I\u2019d like to thank and congratulate our team over there. We\u2019ve opened 87 stations in the last 18 months, and the service has been terrific. So with the incremental acquisitions we\u2019ve added, that\u2019s where you\u2019ve seen the domestic international volume up 16%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets ","You talk are looking at international economy, and Alan, I think you talked about maybe a little more base erosion in Express. So how would you characterize where we stand today with the customer trade down? Is it the same as it was a year ago? Has it accelerated? And maybe it sounds like you guys are embracing it more. So maybe if you could compare where we are today to where we were a year ago.","Dave Bronczek ","I think the bigger issue is we\u2019re dealing with a new normal. We\u2019ve seen a lot of the trade down already from customers that have made the change to deferred services. I think we\u2019re now talking about more of a growth story going forward in terms of the mix of growth than we are the trade down story. So this is a terrific opportunity for us, and we plan to take advantage of that opportunity with our networks.","Alan Graf ","If you think about the aviation and fuel and energy intensity of an international movement, and the time differential between priority and economy, given how high fuel prices are, you can understand why customers are trading down, because they get significantly better price, and they give up a couple of days. That\u2019s much more difficult to manage in the short term than what we\u2019ve been managing in the U.S. between Express, Express Deferred, and Ground, which we now have right about in the right place. As you notice, U.S. domestic did fine in the quarter on its revenue growth.","So I\u2019ve got to say, hats off to the sales and marketing team for grappling with this and handling this and how swift these changes occurred. And our pricing, I think, is right. It\u2019s just going to take us a little bit longer than we\u2019d hoped to get this perfectly balanced. And Dave can give you some tactical information.","Dave Bronczek ","Again, Mike mentioned it before. For example, on the high tech [unintelligible], these big releases, in the past I would have had to have added extra sections of flying. Now we\u2019ve moved it into our FTN network, and it\u2019s very consistent, it\u2019s very reliable, and we move it into our networks in the United States in freight and ground. It\u2019s a perfect portfolio play for us now, and the cost and profit implications are much greater. So I think yes, we\u2019ve embraced it, and I think it\u2019s a big opportunity going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Just a couple followups on the International Economy thing. First, Dave, did you just say that the International Economy product was coming into the ground or freight networks, as opposed to the express networks? Just as a clarification on the last comment? I just wasn\u2019t sure I heard that correctly.","Dave Bronczek ","The international freight that I\u2019m talking about, coming out of Asia and around the world, is just moving in a different network, in our FTN network. We move it around the world, instead of our FedEx purple tails. When traffic gets into the United States, we look at the service requirements the customers want, and if we can, we move it into ground, we move it into freight, we move it at express.","Fred Smith ","Let me try to say a couple of things here to clarify some of the things that we\u2019ve been commenting on. In the main, express traffic, whether it\u2019s package or light freight, is smaller and lighter than the type of traffic that\u2019s handled in the FTN network.","So these big bulk shipments coincident with product releases by the high tech folks are very difficult to handle, because they\u2019re lumpy and they have expectations of very low yields. So that\u2019s the type of movement that Dave is talking about FTN moving and then putting into the ground and freight movement.","The day to day express movement, whether it\u2019s priority or economy, is picked up and transported by the Express unit, and it\u2019s moved in the right network. And as Dave said, on the line haul side, depending on what the customer wants, it\u2019s toggled between express and FTN, depending on the nature of the traffic.","You certainly cannot fly an owned airplane at today\u2019s yields in the general commodity freight network. Now, you can say I\u2019m making money in my underbellies, if you\u2019re a combination carrier, but at today\u2019s yields, it\u2019s almost too costly to cover the direct operating expenses, much less the capital expenses for some of these operations.","So the market has changed, and as Dave and Mike have said, and I said at the last conference call, it\u2019s important that you recognize that the International Economy Express is a growth sector. Dave said it\u2019s growing 15%. So we\u2019ve embraced that, and the strategy we put in place over the last year and which our people have executed is terrific, and it\u2019s a perfect complement to this heavier traffic that FTN carries, an awful lot of which goes on the ocean. And that is inserted into the ground and freight networks when we get into the United States.","So I think there\u2019s a little bit of misunderstanding about the demographics of the traffic, as well as the nomenclature of the traffic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Jacoby with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Jacoby - Goldman Sachs ","Regarding future aircraft purchases, can you maybe tell us a little bit more about where you guys stand with respect to leasing versus purchasing the aircraft? I know you said a few years back that you were probably leaning more towards putting those aircraft on balance sheet, now that you guys are pretty well positioned in the investment grade world.","Alan Graf ","Pretty shortly, everything\u2019s going on balance sheet, whether it\u2019s leased or not, so that\u2019s not why we leased airplanes in the past. We\u2019re going to own airplanes going forward, because we are a full effective tax payer, and we can use those benefits. And one of the reasons we accelerated our capital the last couple of years was in fact to take advantage of the 100% and 50% bonus depreciation.","Dave Bronczek ","We haven\u2019t leased an airplane in years, 2000, Mickey just informed me.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay [unintelligible] with [unintelligible].","Jay [unintelligible] with [unintelligible]","Looking at your International Express regional market position, you have an outstanding position in the Americas and Asia, but a weaker position in Europe. Does that lack of balance hurt margins, and how could you strengthen your presence in Europe?","Mike Glenn ","The comment I made earlier, and I think I talked about it before, our organic European expansion is adding a very nice layer of growth and cost improvement in Europe and traffic coming in from around the world into Europe. So we are working hard to be more balanced - I think that\u2019s your point - but we\u2019ve seen tremendous results in our plans. We\u2019ve had it now in place for 18 months, and we plan to expand that going forward into the next fiscal year.","Alan Graf ","Just to remind you, in the last 12 months, we\u2019ve bought companies in Poland, France, and South Africa.","Fred Smith ","And a couple of years ago, we made a great acquisition in the United Kingdom, and FedEx U.K. is a terrific operation now.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Campbell with Thompson Davis & Company.","David Campbell - Thompson Davis & Company ","The forecasts for fiscal \u201914 are partially based on so-called stable fuel prices. Does that mean stable relative to the prices in August? Stable to what?","Alan Graf ","It means that there\u2019s no volatility in them from where we are, because of the lag time between the surcharge and the cost of the fuel, which I think I talked about earlier.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin Yagerman - Deutsche Bank ","I don\u2019t know if I missed it or not, but I didn\u2019t hear the change in frequencies out of Asian when I\u2019d asked that with Dave earlier. And then I wanted to ask about the GRI, following up on Bill Greene\u2019s question. The other thing that we didn\u2019t see this year is a change in the fuel surcharge alongside a GRI with Express, so I was kind of curious if you guys feel like that may not be needed anymore, or if that\u2019s something that you just decided not to do this year, if that wasn\u2019t something that you disclosed in the release.","Dave Bronczek ","On your first point, it was my first comments that I made. We actually adjusted our global network coming out of Asia this quarter, similarly to what we did last quarter. So yes, you\u2019re right, we adjusted Asia down.","Mike Glenn ","We began in 2005 to institute higher base rate increases while reducing the fuel surcharge, as you noted. The strategy there was to help ensure that the fuel surcharge index was properly aligned to fuel prices, and it also gave customers more predictability, because if the base rates have been adjusted to account for some of the fuel surcharge, obviously it doesn\u2019t have the volatility that it would have if it were sitting in the fuel surcharge.","We believe that the index as it sits today, and has been in place since last January, is appropriate for the current environment, although obviously we\u2019ll reevaluate that each year as part of the GRI and will determine next year as to whether we need to go back to the prior practice or continue with what we did this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Trahan ","I wanted to ask one on ground. How much of the margin pressure at ground is fuel and how much is kind of the capex rollout? And as we think about that capex spend, is this kind of one year that sets you up for four or five years of growth? Or are we at the point where you\u2019re going to have big capex increases in ground every year for a while?","Henry Maier ","As I said before, virtually all of the margin impact in the first quarter year over year is due to unfavorable fuel. Concerning capex, we\u2019ve put together five, six year forecasts on our capital needs based on our growth and where we see we\u2019re going to be constrained in the network. I\u2019ll say again that we are very disciplined about where we add capital. We try to avoid adding capital for peaks in business as best we can. We tend to handle those with operating cost. And I think that\u2019s probably the answer to your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek [Rabee] with Raymond James.","Derek [Rabee] - Raymond James","I wanted to look at the freight division if I could, and maybe some commentary there on how demand trended throughout the quarter, and then how it\u2019s shaping up so far in September.","Alan Graf ","Again, we\u2019re pleased with our momentum as we had good balance between yield, weight per shipment, and volume. A few network adjustments during the quarter, and again there will be one less business day. So we were pleased with our progress in the quarter, and again, the operations team is doing a really nice job on the efficiencies to balance off that one less day. But good balance overall, and a focus on good balance yield.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Dave Ross with Stifel Investments.","Bruce Chan - Stifel Nicolaus ","I just wanted to switch gears a little bit to talk about Smart Post. Underlying postal rates there went up a little bit, and foreseeably are going to continue to do so. At what point do you guys plan on shifting some of that volume onto maybe your own fleet? Or are you going to continue to pass rates through and keep things as they are?","Henry Maier ","We have the ability through our contracts to pass through postal increases. We are always impacted, though, by the timing and customer mix in terms of how quickly we can realize that. And decisions to switch between networks are largely customer decisions. We don\u2019t drive that.","Bill Logue","I\u2019ve got a question here that came in on the internet from William Flynn. \u201cWhat are the opportunities for increasing leverage gains in freight? It seems as if you\u2019re taking advantage of investments in equipment in the form of lower maintenance cost, but these are being offset by increased PT cost, purchase transportation costs. So how should we think about the dynamics in freight going forward?\u201d","Good question. Again, we\u2019ve made some good investments in our fleets over the last three years. Purchase transportation right now, rates are up, moving, as we move more to the rail. So a combination of moving to the rail, price increases in the purchase transportation, but again seeing the offsetting benefit in our line haul. So again, we will keep investing in our fleet, obviously making sure we have appropriate equipment running at good efficiencies.","But again, purchase transportation will always be a supplement to our line haul. And again, our objective there is a combination, because rail comes in the purchase transportation bucket. So again, line haul, as we all know, is a key objective to improve that for the organization, and again, a rate benefit for leverage going forward for our business.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question and answer session.

And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Fred Smith","Good morning and welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. FedEx Corporation is performing solidly given somewhat weaker than expected global economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade. Our profit improvement plan is on track and delivering impressive results. Well done to the Express Team.","FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight have several anomalies in the first quarter, which will be discussed by Alan Graf and the OpCo CEOs during their presentation. Overall, FedEx service levels are excellent, our culture remains strong, and our balance sheet is solid.","We remain confident FedEx is well-positioned to deliver long-term value for customers, shareowners, and team members in FY \u201816 and beyond. As we said in the past and reiterate today, we are confident we can continue to increase margins, earnings per share, cash flow, and returns on invested capital in the years to come.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the program over to Mike Glenn, who will talk about the economic outlook, and he'll be followed by Alan Graf in his comments on the quarter.","Mike Glenn","Thanks Fred. I'll open with our economic outlook and then discuss our yield in each segment along with the pricing actions that we announced yesterday. We see moderate economic growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP forecast is 2.5% for calendar \u201815 and 2.8% for calendar \u201816 led by gains in consumer spending in the near-term.","We expect industrial production growth of 1.6% in calendar \u201815 and 2.6% next year. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.5% for calendar \u201815 and 2.9% for calendar \u201816. The IP forecast of 1.6% of calendar \u201815 is 60 basis points below our June estimate. Weather, foreclosures, lower oil CapEx, and weak export from the strong dollar slowed production early in the year. Due to the strong imports, we saw and inventory buildup in the first half of calendar \u201915, which will be a drag on IP in the near-term.","Now let me make a couple of comments on the company's yield performance in each segment. In the domestic Express sector, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year yield per package grew 2.4% primarily due to rates and discounts. Excluding the impact of fuel and comparing the year-over-year yield on a gross basis for SmartPost, ground yield per package including SmartPost increased 5.5% driven primarily by changes in dimensional weight rating, extra services, and SmartPost customer mix.","In the international export segment, excluding fuel, international export express package yield decreased 1.3%, primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which outweighed the positive impact of weight, rate, and discount changes. If you exclude fuel and exchange rate impact, IP base yield was up 4% and IE yield was up 4%.","In the Freight segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 3.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by rate and discount and shipment class. As we announced yesterday, we\u2019ll be raising rates at FedEx Express, Ground, and Freight by an average of 4.9% on January 4, 2016.","In addition to the rate changes, FedEx is also increasing surcharges for unauthorized packages in the FedEx Ground network that exceed the size and weight limits as outlined in the FedEx service guide, and we\u2019re also updating certain fuel surcharge tables at FedEx Express and Ground effective November 2, 2015.","We\u2019re also well-prepared for what we expect to be another record peak holiday season, and I'll note that we\u2019re not slowing or adjusting our service commitments heading into peak. We\u2019ve been closely working with our customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and we stand ready to deliver.","We expect to add more than 55,000 seasonal positions throughout the network that help the holidays arrive this year. Based upon our growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal workers will have an opportunity to continue working with us after the holidays.","And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Our first quarter EPS was $2.42 compared to an adjusted $2.12 last year, and we achieved a 9.3% operating margin. Our results increased due to significantly higher operating income at Express, star of our portfolio, the benefit of one additional operating day at all of our transportation segments, and the continued positive impacts from our profit improvement program.","These factors were partially offset by higher incentive compensation accruals, higher self-insurance and operating costs at Ground, and lower than anticipated volumes at Freight. The corporate net impact of fuel was also slightly negative year-over-year.","Looking at Express, revenues declined 4% in the first quarter due to the negative impact of lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates, partially offset by U.S. domestic base yield and volume growth and international export base yield growth. U.S. domestic average daily volumes increased 1% as both our deferred and overnight services offerings grew. International Priority volume declined 5% while International Economy grew 4%.","Despite the lower revenues, Express operating income increased 45% and operating margin grew 280 basis points year-over-year. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher international export in U.S. domestic base yield growth, the benefit from one additional operating day, and lower international expenses due to currency exchange rates. Our profit improvement initiatives for revenue quality and expense constraints are working and are on track.","Taking a quick look at TNT, the cost related to the pending acquisition of TNT Express were immaterial for the quarter. We are making timely progress on the necessary regulatory steps required. We have started the planning for the integration of TNT and Express after completion of the acquisition.","This planning includes addressing the issues that must be ready for day one implementation such as financial reporting, treasury, compliance, and governance as well as the planning for the longer-term aspects of the integration. Our integration plans currently assume that the acquisition will close in the first half of calendar 2016.","Turning to Ground. Revenues increased 29%. Due to the inclusion of GENCO revenue, ground yield and volume growth, and also the recording of SmartPost revenues on a gross basis versus the previous net treatment. Regarding the June 1 change in how we report SmartPost revenue, $240 million of the revenue increase year-over-year resulted from reporting SmartPost on a gross basis.","Average daily volume increased 4%, primarily due to continued growth in our Home Delivery service. Ground\u2019s first quarter operating margin was 4.4 percentage points lower, primarily due to increased self-insurance reserves, which was 1.7% impact, the inclusion of GENCO results, which is a 1.3% impact, and the change in SmartPost revenue reporting , which is a 1.1% impact. Most of these are one-time in nature, although the inclusion of GENCO results will remain for the next 18 to 24 months depressed due to integration cost.","Looking at Freight, operating results declined in the first quarter as salaries and employee benefits expense outpaced lower than anticipated volume. Salaries and employee benefits increased 10% from pay initiatives and increase staffing levels to handle higher than realized shipments.","Looking at CapEx, our spending forecast for the fiscal year remains $4.6 billion. Capital expenditures were higher year-over-year this quarter primarily due to increased spending to modernize aircraft at Express. Aircraft-related equipment purchases included delivery of five Boeing 767-300 Freighters and one Boeing 777 Freighter.","We are continuing to invest in our Ground facilities more this year than last as we expand the network. And this will be our peak year for investment at Ground for the next several years. At Freight, we are modernizing our truck fleet, adding new vehicles with many new safety features.","Now turning to our Outlook, based on economic environment that Mike talked about, we project adjusted earnings to be $10.40 to $10.90 per diluted share for FY \u201816 before year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments, driven by continued improvement in base pricing, volume growth and benefits from our profit improvement program.","I should note although we are trimming our outlook from June slightly, we still are looking at the midpoint of the range being 19% higher than what we achieved last year in terms of earnings per share. Our new FY \u201816 Outlook is modestly lower than our initial forecast due primarily to higher than expected self-insurance reserves and operating costs at FedEx Ground and lower than planned volumes in yields at Freight.","We still expect strong earnings growth this year and we remain focused on executing our profit improvement program, leveraging e-commerce growth and enhancing our revenue quality. Our expectations for earnings growth in the second quarter and the remainder of FY \u201816 are dependent on key external factors, including fuel prices and the pace of growth in the global economy, particularly in U.S. industrial production as Mike discussed.","This outlook does not include any operating results nor integration planning and acquisition -- acquisition-related expenses for TNT Express for quarters two through four. As of August 31, 2015, we have 11.1 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current authorization. And we plan to continue buying back shares.","This point I'm going to turn the program over to Dave Bronczek, who has the first question from Art Hatfield.","David Bronczek","Thanks Alan. And this question is from Art Hatfield, Raymond James. With all the discussion of our perceived or real slowdown in China for some time now and recent news from the Chinese Finance Minister that the new normal of 7% GDP growth may last four to five years. I was hoping to get your thoughts on your Trans-Pacific Express capacity going forward after last reducing flight frequency by two back in late fiscal 2013?","Thanks for the question, Art. Actually our lanes are balanced around the world and including the Pacific and I think your question if you can go back and look at several quarters ago, we've actually adjusted our network two quarters ago on the Pacific. So it actually wasn't the last time we did in 2013.","So right now we are very pleased with our capacity fits for the volumes in the Asia Pacific network and around the world. A lot of the traffic that we are handling now in FTN is also benefiting at FedEx Express in our profit improvement. So to answer your question, we\u2019re very happy with our balanced lanes and course, for FedEx Express, a lot of our business coming out of China are multinational companies in the main.","Mike Glenn","At this time, we will open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first today to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the LTL side, I wanted to get your initial impressions of the recent M&A activity that we've seen and whether you see further consolidation or change in industry dynamics?","Mike Glenn","Thanks Allison. Just based on the recent activity, I would say that the market is right for that, but Con-way just was acquired by XPO. We understand what it takes to integrate a rather large acquisition like that, so we have to stay focused on our strategy and execute what we're doing, that's exactly what we\u2019ll do.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Rob Salmon","Thanks for taking the question and congrats at the strong results over at Express. If I could shift the discussion a little bit to Ground here, understood the impact on the self-insurance reserve. It sounded like, Alan, that was about 170 basis points. With regard to the margins, you'd also called out in the press release some headwinds related to handling some kind of oversized traffic in the network.","Can you give us a sense of how big a headwind that was and how quickly you expect to be able to kind of offset that the higher costs associated with that traffic either through the announcement yesterday about the increases there, and perhaps an update related to any costs incurred for the integration of SmartPost into the Ground as part of the planning to potentially increase economic profit looking forward?","Mike Glenn","Rob, I\u2019ll start, this is Mike Glenn. I\u2019ll start with talking about oversized and unauthorized packaging. The change that we announced yesterday targeted specifically unauthorized packages, and those are packages where the dimensions and\/or weight exceed those as specified in the FedEx service guide. If you would look at one of these packages, you would more likely to expect it to travel in an LTL network. It is up to FedEx Ground as to whether we accept these packages, but we felt the change was needed in the price or the surcharge if we elected to do so.","The second category is oversized packages, and those are packages that have specifications that are within our current service guide features of service, but happen to be longer or heavier than a typical package. Those carry a separate surcharge with the dramatic shift in e-commerce, where more and more e-commerce companies are electing to ship those packages through networks like ours rather than handle them in the store.","We\u2019ve seen an increase in those types of packages. We are working with those individual customers that are driving that change, at least the ones that are having the biggest impact and obviously, we always look at pricing opportunities to mitigate that where needed. So overall, we do an excellent job of handling those packages in our network, but it\u2019s obviously something we will continue to monitor.","Henry Maier","Hey, Rob, this is Henry Maier. Thanks for the question. We announced on the last call that we are merging SmartPost into Ground. I would remind everybody that that\u2019s a multi-year initiative that offers a number of potential services and savings benefits. From a service perspective, we will be able to maximize the use of both Ground and SmartPost facilities to ensure carrier service year around, especially during peak. And additionally, the integrated network will enable more efficient use of our network and linehaul assets throughout the year.","We also announced the change to the introduction of a new software program, which will allow us to combine packages in the SmartPost and home delivery networks destined to the same residential address on the same day. That makes a significant difference in our operating expense going forward, because the operating expense of that incremental package is significantly less than putting it into the postal network. So, we are well down the path of implementing this, but it\u2019s going to take a couple of years to integrate all the SmartPost hubs with Ground.","Operator","We will take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I had two questions on the Ground side. In terms of the self-insurance approvals, how should we think about sort of that lasting as we move throughout fiscal 2016, I guess? So the question is when does it start to roll off and you start to see the sort of margin performance come through underneath that? And then just also on GENCO, trying to understand, the 18 to 24 months is sort of an integration. It seems a bit longer that I think the last time we talked about this. Just want to get a rough sense, will we see benefit to GENCO as we go through the peak season this year, or is it something we need to wait until fiscal \u201917 to see some benefit from it? Thanks.","Mike Glenn","Thanks, Chris. Well, first of all, on the self-insurance reserve, we believe where we need to be right now. I think you have to understand on here that one of the drivers of that is our business is growing. We drive more miles. We put more trucks on the road, and there is an accrual based on the number of miles we drive. It\u2019s also largely a backward looking event from an accounting standpoint. In terms of GENCO, I would say GENCO has exceeded our expectations today.","We are well on track to get the integration implemented as quickly as possible. There are a number of benefits that come with the GENCO acquisition, namely the ability to sell additional value to customers. GENCO provides us with some capabilities that customers value highly and frankly, FedEx doesn\u2019t provide, so going through time that will certainly pay dividends. As Alan said, we expect this to be pretty much concluded by the end of 18 months. I don\u2019t know what more color I can give you than that.","Alan Graf","Hey, Chris. This is Alan. Let me add a little bit to that. First of all, as you well know, the GENCO business itself is very good but it is not a high-teens operating margin business. For just by definition that\u2019s going to lower Ground segment\u2019s operating margin even after integration. That\u2019s number one. And for us, we intend to grow. It\u2019s performing much better than I had anticipated. We are very proud of it, of what\u2019s happening. We are getting a lot of cross-selling already, taking over a lot of the transportation that we didn\u2019t used to have from them. So it\u2019s very beneficial but again, it doesn\u2019t have the same margins as the high-teens the Ground has.","Operator","We will take our next question from Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","Thanks very much for your time. I wanted to ask just a follow-on with regard to that SmartPost Ground merger. I don\u2019t recall hearing any such cost number. Will this merger actually impact costs and can you sort of quantify that to a certain extent for us?","Mike Glenn","Yeah, Tom. The costs are going to be significantly lower. This was why we did it. I\u2019m not willing to put a range around that on this call. But as you can imagine, if we combine a SmartPost package with a home delivery package on the same day and deliver them on one vehicle instead of one being delivered on a HV vehicle and the other being delivered through the postal service, there is fairly significant operating expense savings to that. In addition, the ability to maximize the use of SmartPost assets and Ground assets, particularly at peak provide us with significant opportunities to reduce our operating expense going forward.","Operator","We will take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate Brochmann","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. In regards to peak and the opportunities, you said that\u2019s kind of shaping up well and obviously the manufacturing and industrial side of the economy feels little bit weak. The consumer side feels little bit stronger. Can you provide a little bit more color in terms of some of your customer discussions, heading into peak in terms of giving you the confidence of how that\u2019s shaping up better in terms of having another record?","Mike Glenn","Well, the best indicator I can give you -- this is Mike Glenn. The best indicator I can give you is the challenges that we have with capacity management. We are working very closely with customers to make sure we understand their forecast, where necessary we will have to put some caps in place as we have to do every year and we see nothing different in that regard and customers are requesting more capacity not less. So, we view that as a good sign and that\u2019s why we think we are well positioned for another record peak.","Operator","We will take our next question from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi guys and thank you for the time. To Alan, I just wanted to ask you about the pilot contract if you don\u2019t mind. Looks like it\u2019s ratified a 10% increase this year and then through the year increasing, so that by 2020, it\u2019s a 17% increase over \u201915 rates. So an A and B, one, when do we hear from the pilots that whether it\u2019s ratified into, are these cost increases included in your current guidance and three, does it address the Cadillac health plan costs that come into effect in 2017? Thanks. I guess just one question.","Alan Graf","It\u2019s all related, Helane. We will take it. I will do the first part and I will give over to Chris Richards for part 2 and if Dave wants to add that\u2019s fine. We think it\u2019s a win-win contract. It is in our outlook for not just this year but our strategic outlook that we always present to our Board in the fall where we, as you know are expecting to continue to grow our earnings, our cash flows and our returns. Nothing\u2019s changed in that regard.","Also, recall that one of the key things that we are doing in Express is modernizing our fleet and the productivity that we get from that modernization is one of the key reasons that despite a significantly different economic outlook today, then when we talked about our profit improvement plan in October of 2012, we saw Express\u2019s results. An incredible increase in earnings with a decline in revenue, that\u2019s only possible because of our cost management. And with that, let me turn it over to Chris on the specifics and then Dave.","David Bronczek","I will go ahead and comment real quickly because Alan\u2019s right. In our outlook going forward, the pilot contract which we think is fair and balanced and very positive for the pilots, their families, for the company, the shareholders. But it\u2019s very much inclusive of our results in our profit improvement now and going forward and of course the new fleet helps significantly as well. Chris?","Chris Richards","Hello, Helane. It\u2019s Chris Richards. As you think about the pay increases included in the contract, you need to keep in mind that our pilots have not had a pay increase since the agreement became amendable two years ago. So that time period is included in this overall increase, as well as the six year term of the agreement once it\u2019s ratified. So that total number needs to be considered in the context of that timeframe. With respect to the healthcare benefits that are provided in the agreement, we\u2019ve been very pleased that we were able to offer our pilots not only a continuation of our healthcare plan they\u2019ve had in place but two consumer-driven healthcare options, which are identical to those which are provided to our other employees and have been found to be very attractive to those employees at a lower out of pocket rate on a monthly basis than a high care option.","So, we are pleased and expect to see the pilots take advantage of those plans. On your question with respect to Cadillac tax, the agreement does specifically provide for a process, should the Cadillac tax become of impact during the term of this agreement. It does not provide that the company will pay some particular portion of that, but has a process that will be used between the company and the union, should that come into play at the appropriate time. Given the uncertainty in sort of approach on the Cadillac tax nationwide, I have to tell you I expect there to be a lot of conversations and a lot of discussion about what\u2019s actually going to happen before the tax goes into effect in 2018. And this agreement specifically allows the flexibility for FedEx and the pilots to take advantage of whatever benefits might come from those larger national discussions.","Operator","We will go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. So I wanted to ask another one on Ground. I understand there is noise in the quarter. But if I take a step back, we\u2019re not seeing the same kind of market share growth the past couple quarters that we saw for a long time. And now, again, I understand some one-time stuff, but the margins are not what people were hoping for.","I want to understand if something has changed here from -- has the competitive environment changed with either UPS or the Post Office or just the nature of the business with e-commerce? Is that changing kind of the margin profile of Ground? And do we need to reset expectations here? Or maybe do you think that that\u2019s all right, and we should get back to margin expansion and real earnings growth at Ground next quarter or near term?","Mike Glenn","Scott, this is Mike Glenn. I will start and then I will turn it over to Henry. Regarding growth, I think overall we\u2019re generally pleased with the growth at FedEx Ground. It\u2019s essentially in line with our expectations. We have seen a bit of a shift in terms of the type of growth with more growth being driven by e-commerce.","I should point out that the industrial production forecast that I noted earlier as well as the manufacturing indexes that have been published, obviously those are not great signals for the commercial side of Ground and Ground is impacted by those numbers. So that\u2019s a contributor. And we\u2019ve also seen stronger growth coming from e-commerce. So we\u2019ve seen a bit of a mix shift. But overall, growth I would say is essentially in line with our expectations.","Henry Maier","Scott, let me address margins. And let me also acknowledge upfront that with all the moving parts at Ground over the last couple quarters, we haven\u2019t exactly made it very easy for your folks to do what you have to do.","So let me reinforce a couple things. First of all, our business is changing rapidly. E-commerce is clearly changing the dynamics of the industry. And it\u2019s driving credible growth. That\u2019s a good thing. I think we\u2019re best positioned to benefit from an e-commerce economy.","We make decisions at this company for the long term. We don\u2019t make them for the week. We don\u2019t make them for the month. We don\u2019t make them for the quarter. And in some cases, we don\u2019t even make them for the year. But we look for long-term profitable sustainable growth.","And I believe we are focused on all the right things for today and the future. I think some of the noise we are seeing in here is a number of one-time events, but there are also costs in here that are reflective of higher employee expenses, expenses year-over-year mainly driven by higher annual incentive comp accruals.","There are also higher operating expenses that are driven by the network expansion we\u2019ve been going through the last couple years, mainly in the form of higher rents and depreciation. In terms of ad, that\u2019s a fixed cost. Those should level out through time as these new facilities come online and we bring the volume on and fill them.","But I will tell you that nobody is more confident about the future of FedEx Ground than I am. I believe that we will continue to gain market share to grow profitably and provide the fastest and most reliable service in the industry. And our management team at Ground is committed to high-teens margins. We just have to get through some of these changes we\u2019ve made and we\u2019ve made some significant ones. But I\u2019m confident we have a plan to do that.","Operator","We will go next to Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I think FedEx is off the thought of as a global economic bellwether, but the majority of the revenue and operating income really does get generated domestically with a lot of that tied to the consumer.","So just hoping maybe you can give us your thoughts just on consumer consumption as it relates to peak and beyond and how much of the business is really consumer versus industrial dependent perhaps by segment?","And then on the international side, maybe some breakdown you can give us about the Asia and maybe China exposure, because I think that\u2019s a lot less than some people might think?","Mike Glenn","Kelly, this is Michael. And I will start talking about the consumer impact and then I will turn it over to Dave Bronczek to talk about China. I would first say that while e-commerce and specifically consumer-related transactions get to headlines these days, the bulk of our business is still business-to-business related on a global basis.","Residential deliveries certainly are increasing and are being driven in large part by e-commerce. They now -- residential traffic now represents about half of the volume and the network in the U.S. That\u2019s skewed a bit by SmartPost, which is essentially all residential deliveries.","So you kind of have to back that out and the numbers in the Express and Ground network are somewhat lower than that. But again e-commerce is a growth driver, but the bulk of our business both in the U.S. and around the world is still business-to-business. And I think it\u2019s important to remember that.","Now I turn it over to Dave.","David Bronczek","That\u2019s right, Mike. And Kelly, you are right, it is business-to-business for us. China is a big marketplace for us, but its multinational companies around the world and they are big account, big multinational companies. So the impact for us is not very great, you are right. And that\u2019s why our yields actually went up across the board and actually for all of international. So thanks for the question, Kelly.","Operator","We will take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good morning. Just looking at your commentary on the LTL slowdown, how much worse do you see this market? Do you presume this is spreading to other parts of the business? I guess I am asking do you see this as a leading or lagging part of the economy and within your business and then also talk to your profit weakness at Freight if this was company specific or the industry.","Mike Glenn","Well, this is Mike Glenn again. I will start out talking about the LTL and then I will let Mike Ducker have any comments that he might want to add. I think it\u2019s important to note that the LTL industry is very closely tied to industrial production. So when you see a 60 basis point drop in our industrial production forecast, it\u2019s not surprising that we would see an impact on volumes. And I would say not only FedEx, but the industry as a whole.","I certainly hope we\u2019ve kind of seen the worst of that and that we\u2019re looking certainly forward at a more positive outlook. I think we\u2019ve baked in what we\u2019ve seen. So I think that\u2019s a positive. I would also say in terms of it creeping into other segments of the business, it certainly had some impact on commercial Ground as I noted in response to the last question. So those are the two areas that I think have been most impacted by the lower industrial production forecast and the manufacturing numbers that we\u2019ve referenced today.","We are quite confident going forward in our ability to achieve our goals at FedEx Freight. Our sales team is working very closely with the operations folks down at the local level and we have seen strong volume growth in FedEx Freight in key segments like small and midsize businesses.","It\u2019s also important to note that some of the softness in the FedEx Freight segment was due to some pricing decisions that we made in headhaul lanes to balance the network. So some of this I would say is self-induced and we did it for the right reasons, and some of this is obviously the IP forecast and related issues. So again, we are confident where we sit today and our ability to deliver results going forward.","Fred Smith","We have three questions from the internet. We will start with Henry.","Henry Maier","Yes. This question is from Rick Paterson at Topeka Capital Markets. How should we interpret your comment that Ground investment will peak this year and then subside in context to volumes? Do you expect volume growth at Ground to further decelerate or stagnant going forward?","Well, my comment about peak investment or CapEx peaking this year really has nothing to do with volume and has everything to do with the fact that we made some decisions in the 2009-2010 period with respect to adding capacity in a very bad economy that put us in a position where we actually got a little bit behind on capacity with the growth in e-commerce.","We have three major hub projects that will come online in FY'16, which is driving much of the peak in CapEx. And I remind everybody on the call that 100% of our hubs are highly automated. And we are moving to a network footprint where more and more of our stations are fully automated too.","So this year, I\u2019d call it sort of laughingly this is the pig in the python here in terms of these projects, because it is almost unprecedented that we will bring three major hubs online in the same year. In addition to that, we have a big pretty project list around automated stations.","For the benefit of the folks on the call, we get some significant advantages out of automated stations. We are able to load more points direct and bypass hubs, less handlings occur but when less handlings occur, obviously the lower incidence of loss or damage.","We reduced linehaul expense because we\u2019re going point-to-point as opposed to going to a hub and rehandling and reloading those packages. And we\u2019re going to be pretty close to 10% of the network stations being automated by the end of FY \u201816. So, my comment about CapEx dropping 30% to 35% is more a recognition that after this year, we will be in a more normal capital expenditure pattern. We will be ahead of the curve with respect to having network capacity to meet our planned growth. And we think going forward, we\u2019re in a pretty good place in terms of having our CapEx be a little bit more predictable.","David Bronczek","Okay. This is Dave Bronczek. Question came from Ben Hartford, Baird. To what degree, have you already had to take incremental cost reductions during FY \u201816 to address the economic uncertainty in Asia and other emerging markets in recent months to ensure the Express profit improvement program remains on track?","It\u2019s a great question. Our network around the world are base powerful network we have in place is balanced around the world. We adjusted our networks several quarters ago. So right now, we have a very flexible network that when the volumes go up, we can add cost. When the volumes go down, we take out cost, which is why we've done so well in our profit improvement program. And a lot of the improvement has come from our international part of the business for exactly that reason so we\u2019re balanced. We've made these adjustments quarters ago in anticipation of this and so we\u2019re in good shape.","Mike Glenn","Yes. The question from Ben Hartford at Baird, given the softer U.S. industrial production environment, do you think a 10% plus freight margin is attainable on a full year basis? If so, what is the pathway to such a target? Yes, Ben, we believe that a 10 plus percent freight margin is attainable on a full year basis. As has been said in the press release and some comments as one, there were several issues in the quarter.","First, we staff for a certain volume levels and those volumes were less than expected and what has typically being a pretty busy quarter. So staff size too large for volume. We were impacted by two other areas on the volume side. Some of the heavier shipments, which migrated from truckload to LTL, when capacity tightened as the consequence of the West Coast port strike, have migrated back to truckload. There is still tight capacity in the LTL sector.","And then energy, the energy sector, many of our shippers in that sector have experienced traffic declines. We had several one-time events that affected our quarter that should not be repeated. And we see the pricing environment and the overall market environment still rational.","Alan Graf","I don\u2019t want you to interpret that as 10% is our goal at freight. That is the absolute minimum bottom of the range. We should have freight margins in the teens.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thank you and good morning. Going back to few questions ago, you were addressing, obviously at the lower economic out, the forecast of IT domestically. Specifically to the Ground segment, could you address how B2B trended throughout the quarter? And if it -- in fact your tempering of the guidance range for the year, is can be attributed beyond say, LTL to the industrial portion of commercial ground interaction on a go-forward basis here in the year? Thanks.","Mike Ducker","Scott, this is Mike. As you know, we report Ground as the segment. So, I\u2019m not going to get into talking about specific growth rates and SmartPost versus home versus commercial. But I will go back and say that industrial production and manufacturing numbers have had an impact on commercial ground traffic. So it\u2019s a little below where we had hope for, but overall traffic levels are fairly consistent with our expectations.","Fred Smith","And this is Fred Smith. Let me just make one comment here. It seems to me that people were sort of missing about the lower guidance. Had we not had the self-insurance reserve increase, we wouldn\u2019t have adjusted the guidance down by 2% and we would have quote \u2018beat the quarter\u2019, because we don\u2019t make quarterly estimates, you folks do. So the whole thing about the quarter is one issue and so self-insurance reserve. All the rest of the stuff is just noise and various issues when inside the operating company, so it's important that you focus on that one issue.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Great. Thank you for the question. You\u2019ve been asked a lot about the Ground margin so. But it seems to me like that\u2019s pretty important topic for the call today. I know you had the self insurance and Fred, you just said that that\u2019s unusual but it\u2019s the second quarter in a row that being unusual and I don't -- I mean I guess you're confident that it won't be a third. What about contractor issues? There is a lot of noise about contractors these days. The labor market has tightened somewhat, so potentially maybe your contractor costs were up.","Or it\u2019s just -- are there other factors in the broader cost drivers for Ground that we ought to be considering in view of the effective Ground margin. And I guess related to that, when do you think we\u2019ll really see Ground operating income grow again because it\u2019s an uncharacteristic fashion. We just haven\u2019t seen strong Ground operating income growth for a while.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. Alan answered the first part of your question and Henry answered the second part of the question. So, we\u2019re not going to go over the Ground again.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping -- you discussed the balance of volume in the IP lanes. I know that with the decline in IP, you're seeing, I\u2019m guessing with the decline of IP, you\u2019re seeing the balance of volume and the trends of landing a Trans-Pacific deteriorate. If that's true, or is it improving, given the strength of dollar, if that\u2019s true, how much is the underlying improvement in Express margins being understated as a result?","Mike Glenn","Well, the answer to your question is the Trans-Pacific lanes are balanced. Our Transatlantic, actually, we\u2019re getting a lot more traffic out of Europe because of the currency more than we have anticipated and quite frankly that\u2019s actually been positive for us. So, I think around the world, Donald that we are in very good shape. We have a very flexible network now. We've moved the right traffic into the right networks. FTN\u2019s doing a great job for us as well and some of our other partner, so around the world you're probably right. We have a lot of upside to the Express profitability in the international part of the world.","Alan Graf","Donald, this is Alan. As you know, our InterContinental business is about far our most profitable. We've always had issues in Europe. We\u2019re solving that with the TNT Express acquisition. So, we\u2019re pretty pleased with where we are and where we\u2019re headed and I can\u2019t wait to talk about TNT once we get it in the fall.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Well, good morning, everyone. And Fred, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lost on folks here that you\u2019re earnings are up 14% in this environment. You\u2019re still guiding for close to 19% growth. So it\u2019s just about the incrementals from here. I would just comment on that as well. But my question is really for Christine Richards. We\u2019ve seen this NLRB ruling on the Browning-Ferris Industries come out.","And apparently, they are taking a more aggressive stance on joint employment, as well as you\u2019ve had a lot of disclosure around what's going on with your Kansas ground contractor case as well, which went to the Supreme Court I guess. The Seventh Circuit federal court and the MDL has made some orders there too. So can you talk to both and that\u2019s in NLRB. Does it really have jurisdiction over how you can define employee and player relationships at the state level? Where does the federal versus state issue come into play here?","Chris Richards","Well, give it a go. The NLRB has jurisdiction over the tests that are applicable with respect to when and how employees can choose to be represented by labor unions. And I have to say the recent actions by the NLRB are concerned and should be of concern to every business in America, whether it's a large business or small business.","The BFI decision if it stands will discourage companies from contracting with many small and minority owned businesses. And these are the businesses that are the very heart of the U.S. economy.","Add to this, the NLRB challenge to the franchise model that is used by McDonald's and any number of other companies and has been in place for decades, harms primarily the franchisees. Those persons and companies that have bought businesses and are operating them as a part of their plan to achieve the American dream. These rulings will ultimately reduce the value of those franchises.","I mean franchising has being a successful model for many small and minority-owned businesses for decades and this action should be seen for what it is. It\u2019s an assault on small businesses and basically on decades of valid contract law in the U.S.","Now that being said, the current NLRB decisions are not going to significantly have a direct impact on state law, because as you know from following the issues not only with Ground but with other companies, the states individually apply their tests with respect to certain statutes that they have in place. And as you note, we have been aggressively working on our defense of the contractor model at Ground.","Couple things, we are currently still engaged the Seventh Circuit with the 19 remaining cases after they rendered a decision on the Kansas case. We expect those cases to be briefed and determined individually as we go forward. So we're looking at additional time and effort there.","We also have had mixed results in some other jurisdiction. The Eleventh Circuit, which took the appeal of the MDL decision, remanded that case for trial by jury on the classification issue and we expect to prove as we did in Washington State that the businesses that operate for FedEx Ground are businesses. And we are pleased to have the opportunity to do that.","On the other hand, we've had some recent good news in connection with case pending in Massachusetts, where the First Circuit overturned another decision and found that the Federal Aviation Authorization Act preempted state regulations with respect to the situation. And in fact, a decision that had been adverse to Ground has now been sent back for entry of an order positive to Ground.","So two things, you should expect the continuation of our efforts as we defend the Ground operating process. And the other thing you should expect is a real increase across the board in this country on joint employment challenges.","And the ramifications of holding one business responsible for the actions or inactions of another business with which they have a contract are very broad. And I hope that rational minds will quickly conclude that this is not a fair interpretation of the law. But I think you are going to see a lot more litigation in that area and the ramifications are way broader than FedEx.","Fred Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me jus make one broader point here. I think most of the people on the call know this. All of the litigation that Christine was talking about is really in the rearview mirror. I mean, we bought RPS years ago which was built on a very innovative model that gave people areas as an independent contractor; you could build your business. I met with one the other day. I just did my heart good.","He started off with one truck. Now he\u2019s got 23 trucks, he\u2019s got a house and lake house. And we had to in relation to the litigation and the state laws, which were essentially directed at contractors that were performing work for builders that have created this lawsuit of cottage industry here and now of course it being reflected in the Uber litigation and so forth, we moved years ago away from being able to give somebody that kind of an opportunity.","So today we only contract with incorporated businesses. We audit them to make sure that they are paying their taxes and doing all other things. And I think unfortunately, it's eliminated a great opportunity for young people to build the business. But litigation Chris is talking about has no relation whatsoever to the business model that FedEx Ground has today.","So it's just managing these things. And we won this case at the MDL litigation and then it went back to California in the Ninth Circuit at an adverse ruling and we settled the case and moved on. So it's important to recognize that litigation that you are talking about not the NLRB ruling is essentially a model that no longer exists at Ground.","Mike Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. I\u2019ve got an email question from Matt Troy from Nomura Securities International. Given retailers willingness to explore creative promotional activities, such as the shipping promotions during the middle of the year, are you having conversations with larger retail customers about potential activities to shift or smooth demand in and around the December peak holiday season?","The answer of the question is, yes. I would say that many retailers are attempting to do that. That's why it\u2019s more difficult to actually forecast what the peak day is going to be. It was fairly predictable in years past. I think based upon our experience last year, it\u2019s certainly more challenging in that regard. We are still dealing with capacity constraints in our 7 to 10 day period during peak season. We will continue to work with the retailers and e-tailers in an effort to try to shift that demand.","But a lot of that\u2019s consumer-driven. And I think there is a recognition that it\u2019s going to have to occur at some point over time simply due to capacity constraints. But like anything in this regard, it takes longer to implement than you'd like to see.","Alan Graf","This is Alan. Before we sign off, I just felt compelled that I want to talk about Ground just for a second here. Don't get confused between operating margin versus earnings and cash flow. So the SmartPost change to gross revenue is simply math, and that reduces long-term margins just because of the math because we\u2019ve higher revenue with the same amount of earnings.","GENCO is a great addition for us in terms of operating earnings, operating profit and cash flow generation, the high ROIC. But if business has a lower margin than the Ground business itself, that's also math reduces the margin, but it improves earnings and cash flow. As Fred mentioned, the self-insurance reserves, although we\u2019ve had two quarters in a row, we had a pretty bad month of May. We don't expect that to repeat. We\u2019re improving our safety record at Ground. And so it's a one-time hit that won't be repeated.","So you can look for us to continue to improve from where we are at Ground through the rest of '16 and beyond. But our margin position will be lower because of SmartPost and GENCO. Earnings and cash flows however will continue to improve as we start to reap the benefits of these CapEx investments and productivity improvements and be able to handle, take linehaul miles out, go more direct, and continue to improve our technology, we will be improving those. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

Welcome to our discussion of third quarter earnings first and most importantly by far we are very thankful that with no serious injuries from the package that was detonated earlier with our San Antonio, FedEx Ground Facility. FedEx has provided law enforcement extensive evidence from our advanced technology security systems, design to protect the safety of our team mates, our customers and the communities we serve. We continue to do assist authorities.","Now moving to the businesses hand and specifically turning to the earnings, execution of long-term growth strategies, customer demand for the unique value of our broad portfolio of solutions and healthy growth in the global economy are driving our performance. We expect strong operating performance in that regard during the fourth quarter in each of our transportation segments and remain confident. We will improve the operating income at the Express segment by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 versus fiscal 2017.","We remain committed and optimistic about growing earnings, cash flows, returns and margins. Economic growth around the world remained broadly based and we expect U.S tax reform to continue to increase economic growth and investment. FedEx is concerned about the prospect of increased protectionist tariffs as history is shown repeatedly that protectionism is counterproductive to economic growth. The better approach is to encourage open markets and free exchange of products and services and to reduce barriers to trade.","Congratulations to our team members around the world for another outstanding peak season, with record volumes and high service level. TNT integration efforts are accelerating and we are well positioned for profitable long-term growth due to investments in our network and people such as our recent commitment to $3.2 billion in wage increases, bonuses, pension funding and expanded U.S capital investment. FedEx is proud to be in the top 10 companies in Fortune magazine's world most admired lives and among its best companies to work for. We believe this reflects our team members' dedication through our purple promise, which states simply, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","Now let me turn the call over to my colleagues for their insight, first up Alan Graf. Alan?","Alan Graf","Thank you, Fred. We included additional information in today's earnings release and I will provide additional detail during my discussion today about our third quarter due to unusually complex operating results and the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or TCJA. We will also provide additional details today regarding our expected fourth quarter financial performance, given the complexities of the TCJA and third quarter results in order to help you understand the underlying performance of our businesses.","Our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter, was $3.72 up 62% from the adjusted $2.30 last year, primarily due to benefits from the TCJA. Operating income increased slightly year-over-year to 1.11 billion, with higher base rates of each of our transportation segments, increase volumes in Ground and Freight and a favorable net impact from fuel. These improved results were impacted by the timing of significantly higher variable compensation accruals which were up 140 million in third-quarter. Variable compensation increased year-over-year due to sharing some of the benefits of U.S tax reform with employees as we announced on January 26th.","Our improved outlook for FY '18 and the timing of recognizing expansion in FY '18 compared FY '17. Results were also impacted by higher peak-related costs that Express an adverse weather. Before I talk about the operating results for the segment, I\u2019d like to mention the tax benefits in our gap results and say we\u2019re significant this quarter we recorded benefit of 1.53 billion from the TCJA that this primarily includes a provisional benefit of 1.15 billion from the re-measurement of the Company's net U.S deferred tax liability for lower tax rate, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings.","A benefit of approximately 200 million from an incremental pension contribution made in February and deductible against the Company's prior year taxes at 35% and a benefit of approximately 170 million attributable to the phase in of the reduced tax rate applied to the Company's year-to-date earnings. Contribution to our U.S. pension plans of 1.5 billion was debt financed. Our U.S. pension plans are currently fully funded. While the funding shows up on the financial statements as a reduction in operating cash flow it provide a tremendous immediate returns in terms of tax savings as well as lower PBGC premiums versus funding the plan at a later date.","Turning to our segments and beginning with Express. Service levels of Express were excellent during peak; however, costs were impacted by lower-than-expected volumes during the first part of December and higher peak -related costs. For Express, operating income for the quarter primarily reflected by an estimated net negative impact of approximately $170 million year-over-year on the factors outlined in the release and listed on the slide.","Ground\u2019s operating income improved 23% to 634 million due to strong revenue growth and ongoing cost management partially offset by increased purchased transportation, seasonal staffing and network expansion costs, as well as higher variable compensation accruals. Ground margins increased 110 basis points to 12.1%. During peak record volume was delivered with exceptional service around highly automated and flexible network. We believe Ground results will continue to improve.","Freights operating income increased 34% to 55 million, primarily due to higher LTL revenue per shipment, partially offset by higher variable compensation accruals. Freights continued efforts to better balance volume, pricing and capacity are paying off. We are also benefiting from an improving U.S. industrial economy.","The adjusted earnings forecast for FedEx Corporation is now $15 to $15.40 per diluted share for FY '18. We expect Q4 operating profits to be up year-over-year for the Corporation and in all of our transportation segments. Our forecast for Q4\u2019s adjusted operating margin is 11% to 11.8%, for FedEx Corporation. As Fred mentioned, we remain committed to our target of 1.2 billion to 1.5 billion in additional operating profit for the FedEx Express segment in FY '20 versus FY '17, which includes TNT synergies, as well as base business and other operational improvements across the global FedEx Express network. This target assumes current accounting rules and tax laws.","All of our forecasts assume moderate economic growth before year end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments, and exclude expenses related to the TNT integrations. Our FY '18 forecast also excludes the estimate of the re-measurement of the Company's net U.S. deferred tax liability and certain first quarter FedEx Trade Networks legal matters. On March 1st, we realigned our specialty logistics and e-commerce solutions in a new organizational structure under FedEx Trade Networks in the Express segment.","The realignment improves our ability to deliver the capabilities of our specialty companies to customers. This realignment will benefit Ground and Freight margins and will negatively impact Express margins starting in Q4. As we announced in January from the enactment of the TCJA, we are advancing our 2018 annual pay increases for certain U.S. hourly workers by six months to April 1st from the normal October day, which will have an impact in our year-over-year salaries and wage expenses beginning in Q4.","Our capital spending forecast for FY \u201918 in now 5.8 billion down 100 million from the prior forecast due to lower projected capital spending at Ground. As we mentioned last quarter, we are optimizing CapEx to capture the benefits of 100% expensing to further grow and improve the business plans were underway to modernize our Indianapolis hub for Express, which is expected to cost 1.5 billion. We are also planning to modernize our Memphis hub for Express which is estimated to exceed $1 billion. Both of these projects will spend multiple years. These hub modernizations will bring substantial improvements and operational efficiency and reliability.","For example, the Memphis project includes construction of the large new store facility with state-of-the-art store systems, construction of the bulk truckload building and a new area to improve handling of oversized shipments that continue to increase with the growth in e-commerce. During the quarter, Express entered into an agreement with Boeing to accelerate and delivery of one 777 Freighter Aircraft to FY \u201919 and through to FY \u201920, we will announce our FY \u201919 CapEx forecast in June.","Since our tax rates are fluctuating more than usual this year, I would like to provide some guidance for our estimated effective tax rates. All this guidance assumes no material impacts from future TCJA guidance or interpretation. Our adjusted FY effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%. The lower ETR range is due to the benefits from the TCJA combined with anticipated foreign tax benefits from our international and corporate structure. This range does not includes any impact from the items excluded from our FY '18 adjusted EPS forecast.","In FY \u201919, the TCJA lower corporate rate of 21% will fully phase in along with other tax cost also in acted as part of the new law, while we are still in the very complex modeling stage estimating these tax cost as we build our business plan we currently expect our FY \u201919 ETR to be in the range of 25% to 26% excluding impact from MTM or mark-to-market pension accounting. The effective tax rate range for FY \u201919 is expected to be higher due to tax benefits this year that will not reoccur in FY \u201919. To sum it up we are expecting a great finish for the year we are meeting our profitability goals our investments are paying off and our outlook is bright.","Now, I will turn the call over to Raj to talk about the success we are having with our revenue quality initiatives. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Thanks Alan. I will open with our economic update and outlook and discuss our revenue performance and business conditions in each segment and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and enhancements to the FedEx portfolio. We continue to see broad base growth in the global economy. In the U.S., tax reform is improving investment incentives and disposable incomes by measures of consumer and business sentiment are at the highest levels in years. As a result, our 2018 U.S. GDP forecast is a half point higher than last quarter.","Internationally, trade and production growth are supporting solid momentum in the global economy. Last year's rebound in trade drove the best air cargo growth since 2010 with freight demand growing over three times faster than world GDP. Demand and outpace capacity addition for \u201917 straight month.","The next few slides show details of revenue, volume and yield performance by transportation segment. It is clear our pricing strategies that allow us to grow volumes increase yields across the portfolio show continued success. For our U.S domestic Express business, both revenue and yield increased 5%. Excluding the impact of fuel yield per package increased 3% due to our continued focus on revenue quality. FedEx international export package revenue increased double-digit to 10% year-over-year in Q3, primarily due to yield increase of 9% including fuel and exchange rate impact yields increase 2%.","Ground segment revenue also saw a double digit increase at 11% in Q3 with volume and yield each up 6% as e-commerce continues to drive growth. Excluding fuel yield per package increased 5%. At FedEx Freight, LTL revenue per shipment increased 8%, mainly driven by our revenue quality efforts. Excluding fuel, LTL revenue per shipment was up 6%.","Let me now discuss some exciting new enhancements that we have the FedEx portfolio. As we announced earlier today we\u2019re going to increase our retail network footprint through the expansion of FedEx office location inside Walmart stores. We anticipate adding 500 office locations over the next two years. The strategic initiative between FedEx office and Walmart wrinkle brand even closer to busy consumers who are looking for reliable options for packing, shipping and receiving packages.","Another new offering that is launched this month is FedEx Returns Technology. This is a solution that provides e-tailers with increased visibility, flexibility and efficiency around returns management. And for consumers, it enables simple and early credit for the returns at FedEx office locations as determined by their merchants.","FedEx experienced record breaking volumes through our global network during the peak season much of that driven by growing in e-commerce shipments at FedEx Ground. This was the first peak season that we have more than 10,000 FedEx whole locations including FedEx office and well-known retailers such as Walgreens. We are pleased with how the retail network performed and expect this extensive convenience network to be a key part of e-commerce deliveries in the future.","The approach we took on our peek pricing strategy of not applying a broad additional peak residential surcharge to all consumers or customers help us gain significant business in the small and medium customers segments. We\u2019re proud of the strong service levels we provided to our customers during this record peak, and we are excited about the portfolio expansions that are rolling out. We will continue to innovate to provide our customers with great service and value.","Let me now turn the call over to David Bronczek for his remarks. Dave.","Dave Bronczek","Thank you, Raj, and good afternoon to everyone. We are proud to report improved adjusted results at FedEx. We are especially pleased with the results of FedEx Ground where we have improved our operating margin. FedEx Ground segment achieved double-digit percent growth in revenue and operating income receiving benefits from ongoing cost management effort and improved revenue quality through a balanced approach of volume and yield growth. We are also reducing our long-term CapEx plans better match capacity expansions with pricing and volume growth. And as Alan has already talked about FedEx Ground having a great year, we expect the fourth quarter segment operating margin at Ground of 17% to 17.5%.","FedEx Express segment revenue growth of 9% was driven by our international business despite the lingering impact of the cyber attack. We continue to see a runway for opportunity in international for years to come. As Alan has said, Express had six factors that primarily affected profitability in the third quarter, but we expect the Express segment adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 9.9% to 10.4%.","The underlying fundamentals of the business remain strong with higher base rates across the board and volume growth in both international and United States. As mentioned previously, we remain committed to our target of $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion in additional operating profit for the FedEx Express segment in FY '20 versus FY '17.","I also want to provide an update on our TNT integration. As you know, this was the most significant acquisition in our company's history and dramatically improves our global capabilities and competitive posture. I'm happy to say that at TNT, we are seeing strong service levels and the integration is accelerating.","A key element of our acceleration plan was to enable the flow of packages between the legacy TNT and FedEx systems prior to full integration. This allows us to direct volumes to the highest service but the lowest-cost networks. This capability is expected to be in place by May 31st of this year. We are accelerating the migration of the FedEx clearance operations and systems as well, retiring dozens of legacy TNT applications.","Our investments in strengthening the IT environment continue on an accelerated pace. We have made significant investments to improve TNT information security posture and we\u2019ll continue to do so. The integration of our global sales force originally expected to be complete in fiscal 2020 is now scheduled to be complete one full year early. During the third quarter, we accelerated the launch of customer migration activities in Europe and Asia by more than one full year.","Now FedEx Freight continues to show improvement in revenue and profitability. As our pricing strategies drive revenue growth while investments in the network improve safety, efficiency and lower our costs.","As I said just last quarter, we expect these improvements to continue. FedEx Freight is indeed having its best year in over a decade and we expect the Freight segment will finish the year with an 8% to 9% operating margin in the fourth quarter. Across the Corporation we're making progress or improving our margins, our cash flows, returns and earnings-per-share. We expect every segment will have year-over-year increases in operating income in the fourth quarter.","And with that, we will now turn it over for your submitted questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","A - Mickey Foster","Thanks you, Dave. We have several questions on the marketing front, which I'll ask Raj to answer. One, how important our FedEx fulfillment, FedEx supply chain and other logistics offerings is long-term strategy at FedEx? How attractive are contract, logistics end markets versus traditional carrier business that's from Brandon Belinsky of Barclays. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Our strategy is to really offer value-added services to our customers as the result in more volume through all our core transportation networks, and as Alan pointed out, we have recently completed a reorganization that allows us to offer a portfolio of solutions in a more seamless manner to our customers. And I also want to point out here that this is particularly important to our profitable as small and medium customers segment as they expand their e-commerce offerings.","Fred Smith","Our next question on marketing is from Ken Hoexter of BOA Merrill Lynch. Raj, also on postal commissions rule making hearing process and potential impact to industry rates?","Raj Subramaniam","Ken, FedEx is not participating in the PRC docket, but we expect to file rolling to be issued this year. However, we continue to monitor PRC regulatory developments with a review the pricing aspect of it, and we totally believe that over the cost of last mile delivery we will continue to go up in the years ahead.","Fred Smith","From Matthew Reustle, Goldman Sachs. Can you talk about your views on the future of consumer delivery? Do you think solutions such as FedEx onsite can represent a material percentage of the market relative to residential delivery?","Raj Subramaniam","Matt, we don\u2019t view onsite in terms of percentage of residential market rather we would think it is the matter of customer convenience. What we know from the e-commerce demand as you can see this increase, those increasing demand from consumers to have convenient options where they can reliably receive their packages. In this context, we are very excited about the rollout of our FedEx onsite program. As I mentioned earlier, we have more than 10,000 FedEx onsite locations in the U.S. including FedEx office and we are dramatically increased our presence with Walgreen adding more than 8,000 locations in the last year alone.","And we are very happy with the performance of this network so far. So let me add one other point. Technology solutions are also going to be critical in this regard I mean that why we are very excited about the fact that our FedEx delivery manager user base continues to grow significantly. Ultimately the combination of these things including our retail network or technology these things will result in win, win, win solutions for our shipper for our consumer and for FedEx.","Fred Smith","And I think I\u2019m correct, the 2,000s Rite Aid at Walgreen acquired assume as they are rebranded and putting in the Walgreen system would be 2,000 additional onsite locations. Correct?","Raj Subramaniam","Yes, so they will get added in the next few months here.","Fred Smith","Let me gave Raj a breather and ask Dave Bronczek to answer a follow on question from Matthew Reustle. Where is competition most peers across your business segments today and as investments the only solution to offset this competition?","Dave Bronczek","Off course, we face competition across the globe all the time throughout our whole portfolio. The pricing environment is generally rational around the world, right news. We have made significant investments in people, our technology off course facilities over many years and it's paid off by creating large highly flexible and the most automated transportation network in the industry. These long term investments have differentiated FedEx from our competition, but we also have something else to differentiate us. It's our people and it's our culture, so thanks for the question Mathew.","Fred Smith","So, we have a question here on trade protectionism from Benjamin Hartford, which, I\u2019m going to ask Raj to answer more fully. But I would like to do two things before I turn it over to Raj. I\u2019m reasonably certain everybody is listening to this call, has some sort of electronic device in your hand a phone or an iPad or one sort or another. Go to your Google button. I mean, DEF meaning definition and then put in the word tariff for T-A-R-I-F-F by this table do it to. Once, you read Google dictionary there where it is, tariff, a tax or duty to be paid on a particular class or imports or exports.","So make no mistake about it. The great benefits that Alan talked about due to the tax reform bill to some degree will be offset by increased taxes due to tariffs and if we have for national defense needs bigger aluminum or specialty steel requirement, we would suggest its FedEx as those would be bought by the government same way we buy F-35 Fighters or M1A paying respectfully.","On the overall trading front, I'd like to give you a couple of numbers here that probably will surprise you. Our trade deficit in total goods and services 10 years ago was 4.9% of GDP, is now 2.9%, it's down by two percentage points of GDP for a couple major reasons. The first of which is fantastic technologies that are being employed in our oil and gas sector now, is called fracking which is reduced our dependence on imported petroleum very strategic in a law that of petroleum come from unstable and unfriendly parts of the world, owned by national oil companies of governments and aren't necessarily friendly to the West. And the second region that is gone down is that our trade surplus and services of which FedEx is a major component has gone up almost $300 billion over that 10 year period.","So as I mentioned in my opening remarks and why I brought these two facts up. The correct way to go here is to deal with China on the issues with China, but overall it\u2019s the lower trade barriers and the lower tariffs around the world, not to engage in less trade. At any case, Benjamin wants to talk about freight protectionism and more specific detail and ask to strength in the global air freight market largely increasingly trade protectionist tone from develop markets in recent months. One, are there any immediate thoughts on the direct impact of trade from the recently announced U.S steel and aluminum tariffs? And two, have you seen the shipper behavior change in relation to supply chain design, given the risk of reduce trade openness globally? Raj","Rob Carter","So Ben, we\u2019ve not seen any quantifiable shipper behavior change based on the recent development in U.S trade policy. As I mentioned earlier, rebound in trade in 2017 drove the best air cargo growth since 2010. With all that being said as the Chairman just mentioned, we do continue to advocate against any move towards protectionist trade policies that could slow economic growth and undermine any -- undermine all the positive impacts from the tax reform legislation.","Fred Smith","Okay, let\u2019s move on to some questions about Express. What are you doing now to prepare for peak that\u2019s different from what you've done in the past? We\u2019ll start with Dave Bronczek and then David Cunningham will amplify.","Dave Bronczek","Obviously, we\u2019re very proud of our peak this year and we\u2019ve been for many-many years, and I am going to make some general statements here, but I am going to have David Cunningham at Express, Henry Maier at Ground, and Mike Ducker at Freight, give a little bit more color to the answer but, generally speaking we conduct our formal reviews of our peak performance, really immediately after peak, which informs our actions for our coming years with our customers and with our employees going forward.","We are fully leveraging our big data -- we have a lot of data of course, in the artificial intelligence we have and we ensure we develop plans and optimizes our customers' volumes, our capacities and our service. In this regard a big part of our success is the strong alignment of Don Colleran that leads our great sales and solutions team with our customers. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our peak performance. We\u2019ve said it before. I\u2019ll say it again, it\u2019s what we are pride ourselves on is our relationship with our customers and our service.","And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to David Cunningham to talk about Express.","David Cunningham","Thanks, Dave. I want to congratulate the Express team on the best peak service ever. In this age of e-commerce, our peak continues to evolve as the customers use both Express and our great Ground company to meet shipping needs. As Dave said, we saw our customers stay in the ground system longer this year. This resulted in lower peak volumes at Express and a more concentrated surge in a few days just before Christmas. Our peak planning is already underway and we\u2019ll take the key learnings and dial that into next year\u2019s plans to ensure great service, but improve efficiency and productivity.","Henry Maier","This is Henry Maier. I could not be prouder FedEx Ground teams performance this peak. Flawless execution in every aspect of the operation drove record holiday service performance. Which I might add, was greatly appreciated by shippers and holiday shoppers everywhere. In spite of record breaking volumes more than 54 million packages were delivered at least one day early. This stellar service performance was due to a number of factors. One, planning that started in January and included close coordination with customers every step of the way. Two, the network investments we've made over the last few years, resulting in the whole -- the most highly automated Ground network in North America, if not the world. Three, excellent recruiting, staffing, and employee training, leading up to the holidays. And four, the entrepreneurial real-time local decision-making with contracted service providers, which resulted in millions of outstanding customer experiences.","Mike Ducker","This is Mike Ducker. Let me just add a couple of brief comments. First of all, congratulations to the FedEx Freight team who had a tremendous peak season as well. As you know, it occurs a little bit earlier than does Ground or Express and as a result of that we were able to provide some support for our other operating companies during that critical time of the year adding to the overall performance of peak season so very pleased and again congrats to our team for the job well done.","Fred Smith","The next question is how is recently open Shanghai hub been performing and by the way if I didn\u2019t give credit who asked the question about peak it was David Ross of Stifel he may have said it but just today the Cunningham house that recently open Shanghai hub been performing you called out the hub as a coal change turn what trends are you seeing in the healthcare industry and the region does this limit the amount of e-commerce demand the hub can handle this is from Helene Becker of Cowen?","David Cunningham","Well, the Shanghai hub is a fantastic modern automated facility with all of our latest technology the hubs are 134,000 square meter facility handling 66 flights like a process 36,000 packages and documents for our healthcare is an important value-added sector for FedEx and the coal chain capability of temperature control storage ranging from minus 22 to 25 degree siliceous is the key part of all of our new facilities.","Fred Smith","Also to you Dave what cost in network efficiencies do you anticipate gaining through the completion of the modernization and expansion project at your Memphis and the Minneapolis Express hubs? That's from Jack Atkins of Stephens. And a related question from Jerome Nathan of Daiwa, where are some of the opportunities you are seeing that automated increase capacity utilization at your Express facility?","David Cunningham","The investments in our Memphis and Indy hubs will modernize and automate these key facilities, big data and our real time ability to mind and improve efficiency and productivity of these facilities by directing packages most efficiently through the hubs. As Alan mentioned at Memphis where we'll have a new bulk truckload facility and oversize shipment handling capability plus automated sorting and secondary sorting capabilities.","At Indy, we're increasing the box stored capacity from 111,000 packages to 147,000 packages per hour. We're putting in a small package short system of a 150,000 packages per hour and we will have increase international store capacity as well. These facilities will improve the reliability of our networks lower cost improve safety for better place to work for the 1,000s of team members to work in these operations.","Fred Smith","So Dave the last pre-submitted Express question in light of the strong demand environment in international export. Could you please update us on your progress managing capacity? Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","David Cunningham","Commercial line haul continues to play an important role as we develop solutions to facilitate international growth ensuring we move the right traffic in the right network which enables us the growth of our priority products on the purple tail network by partnering with commercial carriers across various international gateways we are able to avoid flying empty space where we experienced in balanced trade flows such as the trans-Pacific eastbound lane. So we are experiencing constraints on some lanes we are constantly working to balance and right sizing network when compensatory revenue.","Fred Smith","Let\u2019s turn to Ground now the one from Benjamin Hartford of Baird. Henry, do you still view mid teens is an appropriate segment EBIT margin target? If so, what is a reasonable timeline for achieving such a level, northeaster notwithstanding, and we're in the midst of the fourth when I guess. I mean I would say about too much about the target here as we announce this. I think the rate funny a side, how much of the incremental improvement in current levels is predicated internal opportunities versus external healthy is a peer pricing growth over the macro? Henry.","Henry Maier","Let me say I agree with Fred. Mother Nature here is not being too helpful for us in this business right now. Listen, I mean most of this is coming from the macro. Our business continues to be driven by strong volume and revenue growth, largely due to e-commerce. As I said before we believe our investments in what is today one of the most highly automated networks and North America, if not the world will continue to drive margin improvement as well as industry-leading service and our focus at this point in time is on maximizing utilization of those assets we've invested in and managing our existing capacity driving reduce CapEx.","Fred Smith","So, we move now to Freight, Kevin Sterling of Seaport Global. Are you seeing any spillover of TL Freight into LTL given the tightness we\u2019re seeing in the truckload market? Mike Ducker?","Mike Ducker","Kevin, thank you. First of all the LTL volumes have been very strong, including good contractual renewals, our team is handling quite well. Truckload shipments 10,000 pounds will typically account for less than 2% of our total shipments and while there's been some tonnage growth it still remain a small share of our total tonnage, and we also have an excellent transportation management team assembled to monitoring in state takes steps to manage truckload volume, if that becomes necessary.","Fred Smith","So Mike, our rail service issues impacting your economy LTL offering? And that\u2019s also from Kevin.","Mike Ducker","Kevin, as you well know, we have a very service sensitive product, therefore we think it's really important to negotiate contracts with good service quality, in them and we\u2019ve done that with all of our key rail providers. Those providers are doing a great job for us as our rail on-time service levels have actually including overall, during the third quarter, and I think my partner, Henry at Ground has experienced similar strong service levels from our rail provider.","Henry Maier","Yes, we've had great service, not seen anything.","Fred Smith","So, this next question for Freight also. This question comes from David Vernon of Bernstein. In the past, FedEx has discussed Deming LTL Freight shipments. What is the status of those efforts? And what upside potential does the Company see on that front? Mike.","Mike Ducker","Thanks, David. We currently have about 90 dimensional standards and will soon be adding additional devices in many of Fred your service and across the network, those devices serve dual-purpose first of all they allow us to capture incremental revenue on shipments that are density based commodities. And secondarily, we capture information for costing system, so that we can more accurately develop pricing for our customers.","Fred Smith","And finally for Freight, how much volume, can the FedEx Freight network handle without significant real estate growth? And next from David Ross of Stifel.","Mike Ducker","First of all let me give a shout out to our planning teams, who have really done an excellent job in planning capacity in our network. We continue to make investments in the facility network and plan for the future; we add capacity by strategically by market. For example, we just open two new facilities in the Chicago land market this January that added over 400 additional doors in the market, bringing total doors in the area to 1,500. So we\u2019re also investing in technology to improve the throughput in all the facilities that will provide additional capacity as well.","Fred Smith","Now, we had a number of pre-submitted questions, which we did not answer because they were covered in the press release itself or in the comments that were made by Alan, Raj and Dave. But we do have one technology question, which I\u2019ll ask Rob Carter to answer before we turn to some of the questions that have come in since the call began. And that is, how well blockchain and use of cloud IT impact FedEx revenues and expenses? When will FedEx see this affect? And this is from David Campbell of Thompson Davis. Rob?","Rob Carter","First, as a reminder, I want to point you back to last quarter\u2019s call where we discussed points around blockchain and our charter involvement with the blockchain in transportation alliance otherwise known as BiTA, as well as the Blockchain Research Institute. You can find those discussions in a little bit more detail on fedex.com from last quarter. Of note though, Fred and I will be joining Don Tapscott at Consensus, which is the blockchain preeminent conference in New York City in May. We\u2019ll much more -- in a much more detailed fashion discuss blockchain initiatives. And how blockchain can impact so much about our business going forward? And you may want to look at that.","With regard to cloud, our IT modernization initiatives are relentlessly focused on cloud technology. While technology offers significant advantages for business agility and cost, things like the ability to tap into elastic capacity, which allows us to provide compute capacity that grows with our peak seasons and our peak times in cloud environments, improved security, improved performance and scalability due to the modernization of these applications really horrific capabilities, and equally is important the proximity that cloud computing environments provide to our customers and our operations around the world. So the answer is, yes, we\u2019re leaning heavily into cloud technology with all of our IT modernization initiative.","Fred Smith","From Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Capital expenditures in FY 2019 and 2020, as there\u2019re offsets to the additional aircraft deliveries in FY \u201919 and \u201820 in terms of total CapEx budget? Or should we add these to the $5.8 billion in FY 2018 in order to estimate the ballpark CapEx spend in FY '19 and \u201920? CapEx spend in Ground likely be higher or lower in FY '19 and \u201820 compared to FY \u201918? Alan?","Alan Graf","We have a varied assortment of CapEx pension tax rate and cash flow questions and I\u2019m going to try to answer in two minutes. First of all remember that going forward we just made this huge pension contribution and as I said we\u2019re fully funded. So I don\u2019t believe at this point with the facts that I have today that we\u2019re going to need to make a big pension contributions going forward not that we might elect to depending on circumstances but we don\u2019t believe that\u2019s going to be an issue.","Obviously with the 100% expensing continuing and with the lower rate and improved off-shore earnings, our cash tax rate is going to continue to remain low for the forcible future. And we are going to have stronger earnings to all of those supports higher cash flows. As for CapEx, it\u2019s really too early to talk about FY \u201920 although I will say we do have a few increased aircraft deliveries schedule at Express for 20, which might have Express as bumped up.","But we have projects at every single obstacle right now with great engineering and finance teams working together with the ops teams, we make our assets sweat more in the case of Express for example, we can use passenger ballets to augment our international capabilities. At Ground, we are going to see I think going forward reduce CapEx at ground as we look at a better ways to build out the network and still support the growth that we are anticipating that actually given lower cost.","Same at Freight, going forward, I don\u2019t think we are going to be needing to add as many doors for shipment as we have done in the past because of the great engineering work that\u2019s going on there, and lot of these we will talk about later on in the next several months as we go forward, but as I said, I would talk about FY '19 in June. I would just say this I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be much different at all than '18 is going to be. And as I said 20 might have a pick-up because of aircraft delivery. So from a cash flow standpoint, I think we are in fantastic condition.","Fred Smith","So Tom added another question here, which I think we need to answer. Incentive compensation likely to be a significant year-over-year headwind to EPS and FY for fourth quarter FY \u201918 somewhere magnitude to the headwind and in third quarter, Tom, I think that nature of the question indicates a bit of a misunderstanding about this. AICs now will be a headwind in the fourth quarter because and the weather will just stop the four quarters are gangbusters and because of all the noise that\u2019s why, we gave you this onetime special deal of showing you what the anticipated segment margins are going to be in the fourth quarter.","So what happened here is when tax reform took place and we felt that was appropriate to do all of the things that we have described to you. What that required us to do is to pick up AIC which had been reduced because of NotPetya, and then it was put back in the third quarter for the Company as a whole and off course especially effected the FedEx Express rate. So on a go forward basis it\u2019s baked in and the fourth quarter you can do the math with the range for the year that Alan gave you it\u2019s going to be in the numbers and the quarter should be quite good year-over-year for all of the segments.","Again, I will give the caveat because if we are in the midst of some sort of weather system where the northeast or it's going to July, that\u2019s a different matter, but we\u2019re fairly confident that they will be at the end of that. Now, there is question from Jeff Kaufman of Tahoe ventures about electric vehicles for commercial trucks and the OEM following suit. What\u2019s FedEx view on the emerging green technologies and where is the Company in terms of adoption and commitment to green technologies? Does FedEx believe these technologies are ready to meet company's needs?","First of all, I would recommend to you Jeff that you go on our website and read FedEx's social responsibility report, which shows our enormous efforts in terms of environmental efficiency in many, many different areas. And specifically to the issue of the commercial trucks, I\u2019m going to ask Mike Ducker, if you'd just comment on that for a second.","Mike Ducker","Yes and as a matter fact, this company has long been known for its innovations. So we\u2019re on the waiting edge of many of these technologies and we believe that the faster adoption of those will greatly improve efficiency and customer experience in the trucking industry. So were heavily invested in our safety systems and artificial intelligence with many companies that are using advanced drivers systems that include turning Telematics and many other features.","So we're working hard on the new technologies that are coming out to adopt and use the advantages that they provide for our system. Tesla as a matter of fact soon to be announced that we will be purchasing some Tesla electric vehicles in the near future. Small order, but we think they will have great benefit in our system were testing them in the near future as soon as we can get them off the line.","Fred Smith","So here is a couple of related questions, I\u2019m willing to pass on to Dave Bronczek and David Cunningham, I\u2019ll give you overarching comments first, from Todd Fowler of KeyBanc. Please discuss what drove the decline in international and U.S domestic volumes within Express segment in the quarter? How important is volume growth in achieving FY 2020 profit improvement plan?","The second is from Jack Atkins of Stevens. To what degree was the June cyber attack at TNT negatively impact 3Q results? I guess it did negatively impact 3Q results at Express and would you expecting the lingering impact in the fourth quarter. Now, I think the question from Todd and Jack and I\u2019m going to ask again Dave and David Cunningham to amplify this, reflects a bit of a misunderstanding here and that please recall that when we started this year, we told you that we were no longer going to be talking about Express and TNT.","So the numbers that are in the Express segment now are the combination of the two. So the reality is the FedEx Express volumes are growing, but the TNT volumes were adversely affected by NotPetya, and we are now going back up to two to where we would have been had this attack not happening. And let me again give enormous thanks to our sales, our customer service, and particularly our IT professionals that did the most unbelievable job of recovering from this attack which the which the U.S. government now says was a government or government sanctioned attack on the Ukraine and TNT was just a side victim of it.","So, the fourth quarter will I think began to show these in a more granular fashioned, but it\u2019s we're not seeing a decline in Express traffic in the fourth quarter. We will have recovered most of the NotPetya volume from TNT now. Put some meat on the turkey.","Dave Bronczek","Yes, this is Dave. Freights are 100% right. The reason that actually we went through all of these detail we did in the fourth quarter along with all the reasons that Alan talked about in the tax reform still is to give you an idea of where the fourth quarter is forecasted to be which is significantly different and better than the Q3 numbers. In my comments I said that they could run up to potentially 10.4% operating profit margin at Express that\u2019s actually very strong revenue across all other Express so reasonably put in Q3 and put in the six items that effected Q3 by falling away was the variable comp and so on it was because of the reason that you just suggested that we talk about Q4 and its very strong in Q4. David?","David Cunningham","Yes, I just had a couple of comments to look for Dave just have I think first thing you got to remember is that the effects in Q3 were mostly one-off type of effects. Q4 ends up being a seasonally strong quarter and we\u2019ve already told you what that\u2019s going to be. Our TNT network was fully restored and back to business as usual as of the end of 2017. The recovery of the business over the last five months has been remarkable and given the value preposition of the TNT road network our Freight volumes have been strong and we are experiencing solid growth in these products. The cyber attack continues to had a lingering effect in the third quarter and our existing customer base has not fully restored all volumes as they continue to gain confidence in our ability to provide service and recovery of our business our outstanding performance during peak is evidence of the strength of our network and our recovery and our sales teams are leveraging this in the fourth quarter and growing and winning business.","Fred Smith","Okay, question from Ken Hoexter BOA Merrill Lynch. In this robust growth, e-commerce market, why were deferred volumes up only, only a 10th of percentage on 1% growth comp and yields negative? Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Ken. I believe you are talking about the differed in Express and really our volumes are impacted by the way we managed one large customer whose volume was at forecasted levels look at the base volume grows underlying basis especially in the small and medium customer segments we saw a very robust growth and by the way don\u2019t forget the strong growth we saw in the ground segment which also carries e-commerce traffic.","Fred Smith","Here is one from Scott Group, Wolfe Research. Now that Express includes GenCo and Custom Critical, do you plan to update your Express long term guidance?","Scott, we did. We told you that we intend to increase our Express earnings from FY '17 to FY \u201920 by $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. So it hopes that clarifies it.","A question from Christian Wetherbee of Citi, how much of the year-over-year ground margin expansion expected in FY 4Q as is driven by reclassification? How much of this from core improvements? Henry?","Henry Maier","Core improvements represent about 100 basis points margin.","Fred Smith","Here is one again about Express 3Q and 4Q. I hope I explained that six items with a big part of it was variable compensation when we decided to positive tax act, as Alan described to you, increase wages for hourly teammates and we had the benefit of the tax bill and so obviously we\u2019re not going to penalize our participants in our AIC program, which are thousands of our frontline managers. It required a refunding if you will of the AIC in the third quarter. So the fourth quarter it's essentially normalized. Ravi Shanker what was the strategic rationale for putting FedEx office locations or FedEx Walmart locations whether strategic rationale Ravi is because they will make us more money, but the broader point you may want to serve for customer pickup and drop-off are also served as Omni-channel service points. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Ravi, I think the strategic initiative that we have with Walmart goes up on a shared goal of providing customer convenience and value. That's really makes lot of us can save time and money as Chairman talked about. As I mentioned earlier this is an opportunity to serve our consumers who want, we\u2019re seeking secure reliable options for packing shipping and receiving packages.","Fred Smith","So Scott Schneeberger would ask a similar issue about the financial impact of adding FedEx office 500 Walmart stores. I think that obviously as a bow wave of small proportion when you open these things. But remember we said in our press release. If you read it, we tested these at 47 locations. We have a rapid paybacks. So this is going to be inconsequential on the expense side in the near term and I think quite a important channel for us in our retail and customer convenience channel in the next several years. After the opening expenses are in essence covered, but they're not significant in the scheme of the Company the size. And we got three questions from Brian Ossenbeck, Matthew Troy and Allison Landry about DHL's launch of their new service. So I'll ask Raj and Dave if they want to comment on that and then I'll turn the floor back over to Mickey and we've exhausted all of your question? Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","So Brian, Matt, Ellison thank you for your question. We don't comment on specific competitive strategies, but there are multiple new test in pilots were companies are considering variations of crowd sourcing or other options for last mile delivery. As you know e-commerce increasing demand for last mile delivery but operational cost safety and brand considerations of final mile delivery that need to be factored into the ultimate potential of any new offering. Now FedEx has unique capabilities regarding, we will continue to work with retailers to provide a differentiated value preposition and ultimately as superior service to the end consumer.","Fred Smith","Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Yes, the only thing I would add because Raj is off course right I mean we focus here at FedEx on our customers and our strategic value preposition, and I would direct you to our dream video that\u2019s out there we have it out there and so you should take a look at that. I think it\u2019s very self explanatory. That\u2019s how we feel about our business and everybody else\u2019s that we can be with.","Fred Smith","Yes, I think that\u2019s a wonderful way to end up before I turn it back to Mickey. I'd urge all of you who've not done, the FedEx e-commerce video at fedex.com\/dream it's 2.37 seconds long and it could can tell you in that 2.37 seconds, what it would take us an hour to tell you. So, thank you for your participation and Mickey close it out.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation's third quarter earnings conference call.

Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corp. Please go ahead, sir.","Mickey Foster","Good morning, and welcome to FedEx Corp.'s Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. I'd like to start by saying that we're planning an Investors and Lenders Meeting this fall in New York City. So please save the afternoon of Monday, October 28, for this event. We will have more details in the next few months.","The third quarter earnings release and our statistical book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being broadcast from our website, and the replay and podcast will be available for about 1 year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media. During our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to 1 question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. [Operator Instructions] Preference will be given to inquiries of a long-term strategic nature.","I want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corp. desires to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Frederick W. Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013. While FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight posted solid financial results, the third quarter was very challenging for FedEx Express due to continued weakness in international airfreight markets, pressure on yields due to industry overcapacity and customers selecting less expensive and a slower transit in international services.","In response, as Dave Bronczek will tell you after Alan Graf's remarks, beginning April 1, FedEx Express will decrease capacity to and from Asia and will aggressively manage traffic flows to place lower-yielding traffic in lower-cost networks. We're assessing how these actions may allow FedEx Express to accelerate the retirement of more of its older, less efficient aircraft as part of our fleet modernization program done several years ago. We remain focused on our strategic cost-reduction programs, which are ramping up and on target. FedEx has a long successful history of flexing our networks to meet market conditions, and I'm confident the strategic profit improvement program we are implementing, as well as additional actions we are taking at FedEx Express, will increase margins, improve cash flows and strengthen our competitiveness over time.","I'd like to congratulate FedEx team members around the globe for once again making FedEx 1 of the 10 most admired companies in the world according to a survey last month by Fortune Magazine. This honor and others our team has received reflect the outstanding reputation they've earned through their commitment to our Purple Promise, which says simply, \"I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.\"","Before I turn the microphone over to Mike Glenn for his comments on the economy, and then Alan Graf for financial perspective and as I mentioned, Dave Bronczek on the Express issues, I'd like to recognize and thank Dave Rebholz who is participating in his final earnings call as President and CEO of FedEx Ground. Dave is retiring on May 31 after 37 years of service to FedEx. He spent more than 30 years with FedEx Express, and during the last 7 years has been largely responsible for the incredible success and growth of FedEx Ground.","Dave, on behalf of the entire FedEx team, thank you for your leadership, your friendship and your wise counsel as a member of our strategic management committee during these many years, and best wishes for your well-deserved retirement.","Now Mike Glenn.","T. Michael Glenn","Thank you, Fred. On the economic front, our forecast calls for modest growth in the global economy. Historic revisions and incoming data since our last earnings call led us to adjust our GDP and industrial production numbers. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2% in calendar '13 and 2.5% in calendar '14. For industrial production, we expect growth of 3% in calendar '13 and 3.5% in calendar '14.","Housing and auto markets have shown improvement, e-commerce experienced mid-teen growth rates and we've seen some inventory restocking taking place in the near term. Our global GDP forecast calls for 2.3% growth in calendar '13 and 3% in calendar '14. The calendar '13 outlook certainly remains uncertain due mainly to policy issues in the U.S., Europe and China.","Now turning to yield commentary. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express Domestic package yields increased 2.1%. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements, followed by increased weight per package. FedEx Ground yield increased 1.9%, excluding the impact of fuel, with the year-over-year increase driven by rate and discount improvements and an increase in extra services charges. Excluding the impact of fuel, International Express packages -- package yield declined 3% year-over-year due to changes in product mix, which were referenced earlier, rate and discount and weight changes. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, FedEx Freight yield per hundredweight increased 1.7% year-over-year, with the increase primarily driven by rate and discount changes.","And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan B. Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.23 excludes $46 million in costs for business realignment activities, primarily from the voluntary buyout program that we outlined in our profit improvement plan.","As Fred noted, Ground and Freight continue to post steady results. However, our lower-than-expected results for the quarter and reduced full year earnings outlook were driven by third quarter international revenues at Express declining approximately $100 million versus our prior forecast, primarily due to accelerating customer preference for lower-yielding international services, lower rate per pound and weight per shipment. Profitability was also impacted this year by 1 fewer operating day at Express and Ground and 2 fewer days at Freight.","Now let's take a look at the segment results for the quarter. Starting with Ground, Ground continued its solid performance with a 17% operating margin. Average daily volume at Ground increased 10% from growth in our Home Delivery service and increases in our commercial business. Meanwhile, SmartPost volumes grew 26% through growth in e-commerce.","Operating income increased slightly, while operating margin was lower as the benefit of higher volume and revenue per package was mostly offset by higher purchase transportation, a favorable self-insurance adjustment in the prior year, higher network expansion costs, 1 fewer operating day as I mentioned earlier and intercompany charges of $9 million associated with the business realignment program. Onetime items, such as insurance benefit and the realignment costs, drove the majority of the difference in margin year-over-year.","Freight continues to leverage the benefits of an integrated network. Freight's operating results improved with LTL yield growth and increased average daily LTL shipments, along with ongoing improvements in operational efficiencies. This is the first positive profit in the third quarter for Freight since 2008. Freight's profitability for the quarter improved despite 17% higher depreciation and amortization expense from continued investment in transportation equipment and technology. As a result of our higher utilization of rail and other fuel efficiency improvements, Freight's fuel costs were 5% lower year-over-year.","Turning to Express. Our results for Express reflect a significant decline in profitability due to the ongoing shifts in demand to lower-yielding international services, a trend that has continued to accelerate this year versus our previous expectations. Results were also impacted by lower international yields as lower rate per pound, lower weight per shipment and lower fuel surcharges have all impacted yields for international. Given the persistence of this trend, additional cost-cutting actions are underway for the linehaul network, which represents a significant part of our cost to provide our international services.","We are reducing our Trans-Pacific capacity on April 1. Flight hour reductions will lead to savings in fuel, crew and maintenance costs. We will align our global networks to better match yields with the appropriate cost to serve network, taking advantage of the increased capabilities at FedEx Trade Networks. Some of the actions we are evaluating may involve temporarily or permanently grounding older, less efficient aircraft, which could result in asset impairment or other charges in future periods. And Dave Bronczek will have more to say about this when I conclude my remarks.","I'd like to now look at our profitability improvement programs and our outlook. In addition to taking actions to reduce our network costs at Express due to the recent trends, we are also continuing to implement our profit improvement plan for the corporation as discussed at our October Investors and Lenders Meeting. As part of our plan, in Q3, we began implementing our voluntary buyout for eligible U.S.-based employees. Certain officers and managing directors accepted the voluntary buyout as we adjust our leadership team to our new organizational structure. In mid-February, eligible U.S. employees were offered voluntary buyouts with a deadline of April 1 to accept. Employees that accept the buyout will be scheduled to vacate their positions in phases to ensure a smooth transition and maintain service levels to our customers. Employees in the first phase will leave on May 31, and we expect all employees who accept the buyout to vacate their positions by the end of FY '14.","The pretax costs of the voluntary buyout program will be approximately $450 million to $550 million in FY '13. Actual costs will depend on employee acceptance rates. Costs of the voluntary program will be recognized when eligible employees who accept their offers, predominantly in Q4 of FY '13. Additional costs will be incurred beyond FY '13 primarily related to facility optimization and professional fees associated with our ongoing IT transformation projects.","While the estimated range for the FY '13 cost of the voluntary buyout program is approximately $100 million lower than our previous forecast, we still expect the same savings from our business realignment activities. The estimated range is lower due to facility closures that we originally expected in late FY '13, which will now occur in FY '14. Also, significantly deferred hiring of open positions reduced our need to offer voluntary buyouts in some cases.","Other ongoing profit improvement initiatives for Express include aircraft modernization, pickup and delivery productivity, aircraft maintenance processes, fuel consumption best practices and further facilities rationalization. In addition to continued profit improvements in the base businesses at Ground and Freight, our profit improvement programs are targeting annual profitability improvement at FedEx Express of $1.6 billion by the end of FY '16 from the full year FY '13 results.","Looking ahead, based on the economic outlook that Mike discussed, we project diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $2.10 for the fourth quarter and $6 to $6.20 for FY '13. Both of these ranges do not include charges related to the company's business realignment. All the profit improvement initiatives discussed are expected to increase margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Dave Bronczek, who will discuss Express in more detail.","David J. Bronczek","Thank you, Alan and Fred and Mike, and I'm going to talk about something they all talked about. And basically, to start off with, I wanted to say that at Express, the $1.6 billion that we gave you at the Investors and Lenders Meeting in October is well on-track. We told you that 75% of that benefit would accrue in FY '15. That's still the case and in fact, in some categories, we're exceeding even those estimates.","I'd also wanted to stop and say that in our domestic business, we're performing actually very well. Our average daily volume this quarter was up 1%. Domestic yields that Mike Glenn pointed out was up 2.1%. Domestic U.S. freight was up 3%, and domestic U.S. yields in Freight was up 3%. So our business in the United States Domestic Express is performing very well.","The international business and the international trends is what I'm going to talk about for the remaining of my time, and those trends have shifted. The marketplace have shifted this quarter. And to show you how much it shifted, the revenue this quarter in IP, International Priority, was down 4%. Revenue was down in International Priority Freight by 13%. Yields for international exports were down 3%, and overall IP freight yields were down 1%. So we have a yield issue that exaggerated itself this quarter over last quarter.","The other issue that we're dealing with is actually something you would think was a good problem for us to have. Total international export volume was up 4%. That, however, was driven by a 12% growth in deferred international export traffic, mainly led out of Asia and Europe. So we had a lot of freight, a lot of freight on our planes, our high-load factors, quite frankly, were driven by the deferred traffic. So we had lower yields, we had more traffic, higher pounds, all in deferred traffic. So what Fred and Alan have said is we started in November actually to start moving our linehaul network down and tweaking some of our network around the world. We're big enough to move our network around, and I'm going to talk about that in a minute here, with actually -- without affecting service to our customers.","So in November, we began the process. April 1, we're moving our Trans-Pacific linehaul capacity down because we have markets that have multiple aircraft in them. We're going to be forcing a higher-yielding revenue component into our planes while we're reducing our costs, moving some of that lower-yielding deferred international economy freight into lower-cost networks, primarily our FedEx Trade Networks network in our own deferred network and by doing so, we'll actually improve the overall yields into our network that is actually going to be reducing its costs and that's the beginning of our outlook for our international linehaul. That starts April 1.","Beyond that, we're looking at the rest of our global linehaul that also has multiple airplanes in multiple markets that we can actually force the revenue yield and quality of the revenue into our existing network while reducing our costs. So as Alan and Fred both pointed out, we're going to take this opportunity off of the third quarter market shift to look at our fleets. And in fact, if we have some of our airplanes that are inefficient for fuel and maintenance and determine throughout the quarter if we have some airplanes that we can retire.","Going back to the issue at hand, Q3's performance on international revenue driven by yields was the issue. We actually had more volume. So we're resetting the Express capacity. We're resetting the revenue forecasting. And going forward, we're actually going to take a very hard look at all of our expenses at international, but the main expense for international is our global linehaul. Q3 to Q4, Q4 is significantly improved over Q3. So in Alan's guidance and in his outlook, you'll have an Express Q4 performance that's significantly better than Q3.","Mickey Foster","Okay. We're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Tom Wadewitz.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So a lot of things going on in international. I wondered if you could give a sense of why -- what you think is happening in the market, whether this is a shipper-driven effect in terms of the trade down and some of the weakness, and if you see that continuing and becoming more of an issue. Is it somewhat of a competitive issue where -- I think UPS had announced that they're doing -- starting to offer an, I guess, an IP freight-type of a product, where I don't think they've had that specific product in the past. And I think DHL's been aggressive. But how do you think about what's really driving the issues in international and how they might play out going forward if they get any better, or if it's just a challenge that persists?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, this is Fred Smith speaking, and let me make a comment or 2 and then Dave, put some color on it. I'd like to refer you back to a speech I gave in May. I mentioned this in the last quarterly call, I believe. It's on our investor website. And while I was the spokesman of the speech, obviously, it reflects FedEx's belief about the trends in international trade and international transportation. And I would urge you, if you're interested in this matter in-depth, to read that presentation because it lays out what has gone on in the international trading arena. And the reality is that the American consumer drove international trade for a long period of time and brought Europe back after World War II and helped bring China into the current fantastic economic powerhouse it is. But policy decisions and the cost of fuel have radically changed the international trading situation. So last year, you had a reduction of international airfreight in its broadest sense. Again, I refer you to The Wing's Club speech, of about 1.9% in terms of revenue freight kilometers as it's measured, and you had about 1.9% increase in C-freight measured by TEUs or 20-foot equivalent units. So trade has contracted relative to where it was before 2008, and the cost of fuel is such, along with the increasing cost in China, that these markets have been constrained. At the same time, you have a lot of capacity that's come into the market. So I think the bottom line is we got a little bit ahead of our skis, and we had more capacity out there into the heavier, more cost-sensitive airfreight market, and that's what Dave is doing is adjusting our capacity back so it's really focused more on the International Priority where our network is quite unique and has a competitive advantage. Dave?","David J. Bronczek","That's exactly right, Fred. I think you -- if you look at the market, you can see that it's overcapacity. And because of that overcapacity, people are looking for a market shift in their pricing. And the issue for us isn't that we don't have enough volume. We have too much volume in the wrong product in the wrong network. As I mentioned before, our overall growth in deferred was 12% and quite frankly, that's only because we had to cap it because our planes coming out of Asia were full, full of the wrong type of products. So we're moving the traffic into a lower-cost network. We're opening up our Express freighters for truly IP, International Priority, traffic and we're bringing down our cost of the capacity. So when you look at the marketplace, it's shifted right now. Until the marketplace corrects itself on the overcapacity, we're taking the lead for our business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Justin B. Yagerman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to get, I guess, a little bit more on this international side and try to figure out what's changing on the margin here. I mean, it makes a lot of sense to move to third-party linehaul in some of this business because of the margin differential. Is it the weakness because of overcapacity more in the air cargo market versus the parcel market that's actually taking place with all the wide-body deliveries that have happened and that are scheduled to happen? And then when you take a look at your fleet, should we expect, when you balance out deliveries and retirements on a go-forward basis, that we'll see a net decrease in FedEx's fleet capacity? And I guess the third part of that is, what does that imply for CapEx on a go-forward basis? So, I know a lot of pieces there, but trying to figure out if it's air cargo versus parcel, what the net impact is to FedEx's fleet and then how does that impact your capital plans on a go-forward basis?","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. I'm going to turn it over to Dave about the fleet, and then he and Alan can talk about the go-forward CapEx. It is the air cargo market, and the air cargo market is, as I mentioned a moment ago, has been adversely affected by lower economic growth around the world caused by the policy choices that are now reflected in the European situation, relatively low growth in the United States and China situation. So the International Express business is still growing, the door-to-door part of the business. And these aren't new things. They just perhaps have accelerated a little bit because of this overcapacity situation. And over the last couple of years, Dave Bronczek has done a great job of readjusting our deliveries of capacity, pushing off 777s and bringing in the 767s which have an immediate accretive effect in the domestic system. So they're so much more fuel-efficient than the airplanes they were replacing. So I'll let him talk about that and then Alan on CapEx.","David J. Bronczek","Thanks, Fred. That's right, it's the airfreight market. Our IP parcel, we actually grew 2%, which is a good thing. The issue is that we've got this big lane imbalance between Asia and the United States, and it keeps driving itself farther and farther where you would actually have to put on more planes coming back from United States back to Asia. So our goal is to take advantage of our network that's a global network where we have multiple airplanes in some markets, pull them out, force the traffic that's truly IP into our planes, move into the lower-cost network, some of these lower-yielding packages, more lane balance than the network around the world, and we have a lot of opportunities beyond just Asia to the United States. We're looking at Asia to Europe and back and so forth. So when you look at the marketplace, we have a lot of growth in it. It's shifted to deferred because you have overcapacity in the airfreight market. In terms of airplanes, yes, we're looking at ways to -- because of the pull down in the international market there, look at ways to replace or retire, I should say, older, more inefficient -- fuel inefficient maintenance planes sooner.","Alan B. Graf","Justin, this is Alan. 2 points. One, we're already seeing the benefit of flying fewer pounds at higher yields in the fourth quarter guidance that I gave you. That'll continue into '14. So as Dave said, Express' performance in Q4 year-over-year will be a whole lot better than it was in Q3. And there's been a lot of cost cuts that are already been done ahead of schedule. Secondarily, from a CapEx standpoint, recall that Express' aircraft capital expenditures over the next 2 or 3 years are largely replacement. And if anything, we're going to accelerate that because we will be -- if we decide to make some elections to retire airplanes, they'll be the older airplanes that have significantly higher fuel burn, more maintenance, et cetera. So those capital investments we still want to make because they still have a high ROIC. We're not taking but a couple of 777s over the next several years. Most of those have been shoved way back. So whatever we come up with here will be the size of the feet we're going to fly internationally for at least 2 or 3 years.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit -- kind of shifting gears a little bit just away from the Asia\/U.S. kind of lane. But over in Europe, obviously with the big merger that kind of fell through with some of your competitors, how are you thinking about your opportunities there? I mean, what are some of the current trends, and what are your kind of investment outlooks there to kind of take advantage of that growing region?","David J. Bronczek","Well, I -- let me -- this is Dave Bronczek again. Our European organic strategy we put in place about 18 months ago has been performing exceptionally well. We've opened 70 stations in Europe. By the end of this fiscal year, it'll be 87, and that's over a 2-year period of time. The service is great. Volumes are growing. As I mentioned before, Asia and Europe actually led the way for international export, but also in Europe. So we're actually very comfortable with our position in Europe right now. The markets are tough, but we're in a very good position there. Obviously, we don't talk about acquisition opportunities now and we -- for a lot of good reasons, as Fred always talks about. So I just wanted to point out, our European team is doing a great job; very happy with their results.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A lot has been talked about Express. I want to shift over to FedEx Freight for a bit. It was barely profitably in the quarter. So I was wondering, does price need to go up there? Or is density still weak and more terminals need to be closed because the gaps is not being closed with the competition, and the competition's all operating a lot better than FedEx Freight, still a mile away from its former industry-leading operation ratio?","William J. Logue","David, this is Bill Logue. Again, as Alan said, our quarter 3 was our strongest quarter 3 in 5 years, so we're almost profitable in the quarter. The challenging issues that we have in this quarter, obviously, is December, January, February. And the -- we've seen a significant impact from 2 less operating days this year. That had a big impact on our numbers. So again, our overall Q3 from our perspective, again, we saw volume up, we saw yield up and we saw weight up. And so from that perspective, it was a good quarter. We took on some charges from the buyouts and, as Alan mentioned, increased depreciation. So I think from that perspective, our business had a healthy Q3. And if you look forward, we saw productivity in the quarter being very strong as well. So again, our shipments per FTE were up 2%. So from our perspective, we had a good quarter and as we move now into Q4. So Q3, best in 5 years for us, so that was good progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you provide some perspective on -- obviously, you're taking airfreight capacity out of the Asian market, both inbound and outbound. But trends, I guess, into March and the pace of factory activity coming back up online following lunar New Year, we've been hearing some mixed data points as it pertains to that and the trajectory of March airfreight out of Asia at the moment. Could you provide some perspective on that front?","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. We don't provide monthly forecast and projections regarding the business, but I would say that the trends have been stable. We expect those to continue in terms of the shift in the mix of the business. So we don't anticipate any significant changes in the mix of traffic going forward. I think the key for us, as Dave has mentioned several times, is the adjustments we're making to the network that allows us to leverage the global network that we have to improve the profitability in our international segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Dave Rebholz, before we have you head on off for your retirement, I was wondering if I could ask you to just comment a little bit on your thoughts about growth in volumes. Alan read sort of a number of items that affected the margins this quarter, but it is the second quarter we've seen incremental volume growth with margins that didn't go up. So I realize that maybe if we adjust for these things, margins might have been flattish. But I think it's safe to assume that at these kind of margin levels, it's tough to see the margins go up materially from here. So do you think the time has come to sort of slow the volume growth a bit and focus a bit more on yields to sort of get the profit growth instead of just growing the share? How do you think about balancing those 2?","David F. Rebholz","Well, all right. So you understand that the predominant factor was the year-over-year issue of the favorable self-insurance. That is just simply a fact. We continue to grow not only in the second and third quarter, we picked up growth in the fourth quarter. We're very confident and happy about that. I think fundamentally that while margins are unpredictable relative to weather and different issues that affect us, the timing of issues, the fact of the matter is, is that we have a better mousetrap. Our service is absolutely supreme, and customers are coming and talking to us. I think if you talk to my compadre, Mike Glenn, and the person who is going to replace me, who I have incredibly great faith in, Henry Maier, who I hired in the first year that I went up to Ground, for the purpose of replacing me and building the organization and changing it, I don't see any end in sight. Now having said that, all of these issues come down to the fact that we have invested a lot of money. We've done it efficiently and effectively to make sure that our service proposition is greater than the competition. Put that another way, when there are too many people that want to get in the door, you've got to raise your yields. Having said that, we will look at every customer on an individual basis and determine the value proposition that we each share and essentially improve our margins. Putting that aside, I see no risk in the Ground proposition value today. I think we are on the right track. We're moving in the right direction. So I would ask Mike to comment on the yield, but as a matter of fact, I think we're in a very good sweet spot.","T. Michael Glenn","Bill, I appreciate your comment, but I do want to remind you that Ground had 10% growth in the quarter and our yields, excluding the impact of fuel, grew almost 2%. So I think that's very consistent with our strategy to work with our operating companies to find the right balance between volume growth and yield improvement to maximize the profitability. And I would encourage you to look at the long-term trends that we've been able to produce here. And we're very confident in our ability to position the outstanding value proposition we have in the market place, and our sales team is doing a great job at that.","Alan B. Graf","So Bill, this is Alan. Just to answer your question, this company is about driving cash flows, and we are perfectly happy with continuing to grow the top line while we maintain 17% or 18% margins at Ground and have a 27.5% after-tax ROIC.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Alexander Hahn","This is Alex Hahn in for Chris. I just had a question about incremental capacity and investment in Ground. Where do you think that's going? And do you think the network now is in a position to leverage future volume growth?","David F. Rebholz","Well, Alex, the good news about our problem is we constantly have to balance this. The growth in the demand at the right price point, we will invest whatever is appropriate to take on new business. However, we are well-suited moving forward.","Operator","We'll take our next question Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Jeffrey A. Kauffman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I have one question for Dave and one question for Bill. On the international side, it sounds to me like what you're saying is the issue isn't growth; the issue is the wrong assets in the wrong place for the type of business you're seeing. Is that the way to think about it? That's really the whole point of this realignment?","David J. Bronczek","Yes, we have the wrong -- we had high growth in deferred, which is good. As long as we put it in the right network, that makes us more money. And we open up our network that actually is there for the higher-yielding packages, and right now it's being overrun almost by the deferred traffic. So we're moving that traffic off of our Express freighters onto a more -- a lower-cost network, our FTN network, and some of our own deferred flights and opening up the orange network, our priority network at Express for the higher-yielding traffic. So when we do that, we actually force the capacity to go down and force the revenue quality to go up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So a question on the Express side. So the mix shifts seem worse than you were thinking, and you're trying to offset that with more capacity reductions than, I guess, you were initially thinking. Net-net, how should that impact the $1.6 billion of profit improvement over the next few years? And is there a point where if the mix shift continues to accelerate more than you thought where it's just impossible to offset with capacity? And then maybe just separately on the domestic side, first quarter volume growth in Domestic Express in a couple of years, do you think something's changing there and that's sustainable? Or it's just kind of just a one-off quarter on easy comps?","David J. Bronczek","Well, I'll answer both questions. On the $1.6 billion that I gave you in October, off of our FY '13 base, that's all still in place. On the international side, I think I gave you $350 million in that $1.6 billion was on the international piece, that's still in place. We have probably more opportunity to try and beat that, quite frankly, with the way we're looking at our network going forward. In the United States, we're performing very well. The volumes, the yields, we're working with Mike Glenn and his sales team, there's also a component in that $1.6 billion in our U.S. transformation, and that's on plan. And quite frankly, our team's doing a great job there. So we just are adjusting our network right now, and we are big enough to do that and become more profitable there.","Frederick W. Smith","Yes, this is Fred Smith speaking. We've made this point a couple of times on these calls and at the Investor Day back in October. The Express market is going to be around forever. I mean, the growth in Ground is outstanding, and it's a much bigger market in terms of units. But the types of things that go into the Express network, things that require time-certain, long-distance delivery, are going to continue to be a requirement for shippers. It's just the ratio of the Express shipments to the Ground shipments. And I think what you saw in this quarter was sort of a stabilization of the Express-Ground ratio. There's certainly e-commerce driving a lot of traffic for Ground, and some proportion of the e-commerce requires Express delivery, so that's really what you're seeing.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just to follow up on that, Bill, if you look at the profit improvement plan, and you're already talking about cutting more aircraft a quarter after a multi-year kind of program was set, does that mean you'd -- when you look back, you didn't go far enough in terms of adjusting the network? I just want to understand how you think about how you need to reshape that domestic network as you're just about to enter the real part of the SG&A savings and network realignment.","David J. Bronczek","Well, let me be clear. It's really the global network that we're talking about here. We have an opportunity, and I've challenged my team to -- we have some older planes, 727s and some trimotors, that if we could retire them earlier after what I told you before, would be better. But it's really across the world, and it's on a global basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I was wondering, can we talk a little bit about your international domestic operations as well? It looks like -- obviously, you've had a lot of acquisitions there and the comps are impacted by those. But when I look at your purchase transportation at the Express segment, it looks to be growing in-line or maybe even a little bit above the revenue growth in international domestic. Is there any correlation there? And can you talk to the opportunities in those new networks and where the profit targets might be in the future?","David J. Bronczek","Yes, on that purchase transportation line, it looks like it's growing 30%. It's actually in the base growing 2%, only 2%. It's acquisitions and FTN, which is a good thing. Our domestic acquisitions are perfect for our company, and we will start harvesting the returns and the profit opportunities in the very near future going forward. But on the purchase transportation, that 30% growth is in the base, only 2%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Thomas Kim - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","There's obviously been a lot of focus on Asia and Europe, and I was wondering if you could just take some time to elaborate and remind us about the FedEx opportunities, particularly with LatAm given the tremendous airfreight growth we continue to see out of those markets and then perhaps to a certain extent, Middle East?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, Dave can talk about this more in greater detail, but Latin American market is, in fact, growing. We have a great position there, great management team. We made an acquisition in Mexico. We made an acquisition in Brazil. So we're very optimistic about the prospects for Latin America, and we have a good position there. A lot of the airfreight market, the traditional airfreight market in Latin America are perishables, and we have a position in that market to some degree. But as the acquisitions become integrated and turn from an expense to a positive, as Dave told you, we're very optimistic about our Latin American results. Dave -- Dave's got a better focus perhaps on the Middle East, and he can give you some comments on that.","David J. Bronczek","I will, Fred. Thank you. I'll talk about Latin America for a minute, though. Juan Cento's our Head of Latin America. He's a fantastic executive. We acquired 2 terrific companies, one in Mexico, one in Brazil; same cultural fit, same great service, same great market presence, same great customer base. And we're going to see terrific returns when we harvest the profitability there. We had to go through the obvious branding, the IT integration, but we're well on our way there. So you're going to see more very good performance out of Latin America. In the Middle East, of course, in the Middle East, they're performing well. We have another acquisition in India that we lump into our Middle East region. It's actually improving. And some of the linehaul adjustments across the world actually affect India and the Middle East in a positive way.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly A. Dougherty - Macquarie Research","You mentioned being more a return on invested capital focus at Ground. But does that make you -- does that mean then that the 17% to 18% margin level is where things stay as the mix of B2C increases? Or are there some other levels -- levers that you can pull to move those margins higher in Ground, and maybe where do you think they go from here?","David F. Rebholz","Well, there are plenty of levers. I think the capital investment is in exactly the right spot. If you look at our past, it has been consistent, and we've been able to provide a good return as evidenced by our ROIC, as Alan said earlier. There's nothing that is at risk. We are very judicious on how and where we spend money. And we're very judicious about, as I said earlier, the right return from customers that come in the door. So we will spend money when we can make money, end of story.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","A three-part question in Ground. Part number one, could you just recap and assess the holiday season now that we're all the way through and just the positives and negatives that you saw there in the Ground category? Number two, the yield was a little bit lower than anticipated throughout Ground, and just how impactful were higher postal rates in SmartPost? Just how should we think about that going forward? It was kind of addressed earlier, but if you can touch on that. And then lastly, weather impact in the quarter in Ground.","David F. Rebholz","All right. This is Dave. Let's take the weather last. Every year has its own experiences with weather. And clearly, this past year there were some unique circumstances but frankly, we were able to perform effectively. And as evidenced by our contractor remodel, our contractors rose to the occasion. So from a service standpoint, it was great. From a cost standpoint, in any kind of weather situation, no matter what organization you're talking about in transportation, you have a lagging effect. So you might get hit for a week of bad weather. You'll get some recovery as people rebound. So put that aside, that is just simply a nominal issue. In terms of -- so you had a 3-part question, I want to make sure I answer them correctly. So go back to your first question because I want to make sure I have -- all right. The holidays. All right. So what happened in the holiday? The holiday was a great season for us. All of our large customers had exceptional demand. There was clearly demand from the online world that probably had not been experienced historically. That was good for them, and that was good for us. We recovered. We handled the business. We handled at a high level of service. Understand that when demands are high, we're going to spend some extra money to make sure that the customers who do business with us all year long are satisfied with our performance during the 2 weeks. So I think that the retail sector is very healthy. There are some changing dimensions. We are prepared to handle it with our 3 bottom line product portfolios: ground to commercial, ground to home and our SmartPost product portfolio. In terms of SmartPost, the only thing that we were surprised by was the relative rate increase from the Postal Service. We are well positioned to handle those rate increases, and our customers value the product portfolio and we're very well positioned to handle additional growth in that network. And I think our partnership, as their largest customer, puts us in a position to continue to grow.","Alan B. Graf","And Scott, this is Alan. Let me just clarify one thing. You said that the Ground yields were less than anticipated. That's your words. They came in almost exactly where we thought they would be. And a little bit of the margin issue year-over-year is that we had a higher peaking factor in Ground this year, and that's what Dave was referring to, that the higher the peaking factor, the more temporaries and the less productivity that you get when you get to those higher peaking factors. So some of that extra peaking traffic did not carry the same margins in this year's peak as in last year's peak.","T. Michael Glenn","Scott, let me just make one comment about -- as we -- as part of our revenue management process, when we bring on a large customer, especially in the e-commerce segment, we do a lot of work with the operating company to look at not only the impact of the volume and yield in nonpeak season, but how the traffic peaks during peaking season and how it's going to affect the overall profitability of the opportunity. So we do a lot of extensive work to work closely with Ground to make sure that we have a clear understanding of the impact of e-commerce and peaking as it relates to our margin. So a lot of effort there, and I think the Ground company did a phenomenal job in providing outstanding service during peak season.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek Rabe with Raymond James.","Derek Rabe","This Derek Rabe on for Art Hatfield. You were granted licenses to operate a Domestic Express network in 8 cities in China back in September. Can you just talk about customer response to this shift so far and any growth opportunities or speed bumps you have encountered or see going forward? And then also, are there any progress updates toward countrywide access there?","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking, and I'm going to have Dave talk about it in greater detail. We have a very large domestic business in China. I don't know how this kind of has been obscured over the years. We actually serve 400 cities in China, and we got that domestic network by acquiring our joint venture partner some years ago. And the Chinese government passed a different law that requires you to be relicensed under a different part of the China government. So they issued these licenses, and they've assured us that our domestic operation over time will be relicensed, if you will. But in the interim, that domestic business continues to operate and grow, and we're very excited about it because of its unique capabilities. And it's one of those areas that could be lumped into the category that Dave was talking about that will start producing profits in the years to come after having built this network. Dave, you want to add anything on that?","David J. Bronczek","Well, Fred, you said it exactly right, and we have worked with the Chinese government. It's business as usual for us. We do serve 400 cities there in China. We are making great strides there, and we've been in China for a lot of years. So our international business is very big there. Our domestic business is growing there. And we think that in the very near future, this will be very accretive for us, that domestic business in China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","I know we talked a lot about Express, and you talked about managing the traffic flows to place low-yielding traffic in low-cost networks. As I think about the growth in your FedEx Trade Networks, does this mean we could see an even greater focus on the ocean? And would you be looking maybe to drive some of that lower-yielding traffic maybe to water?","David J. Bronczek","Yes, we've had terrific growth in our FedEx Trade Networks organization, and they've done a fabulous job over the last 3 years, almost tripling or quadrupling their growth. That will continue. The customers have a great -- they can track and trace the same, they can use the same sales organization. So the opportunities for us to grow our FTN, our Trade Networks organization, continues to be very big because we started off in a modest organization a couple of years ago. And I think that this opportunity now that presents itself will let customers see how good our service opportunities are at Trade Networks.","T. Michael Glenn","Yes, let me just add that -- I want to make sure we're clear here. The changes that we're talking about in our network are not designed to take traffic out of our airplanes and put it on the ocean. The market will drive the trends in terms of the mix between airfreight and ocean traffic. And we are looking to make sure that we have the right product in the right network to maximize profitability. But as Fred noted earlier, we do see growth in the overall market in the ocean side and some pressure on the air side. But that's a different issue than what we're talking about here in terms of rightsizing the network.","Operator","This does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Managing our operating companies as a portfolio of solutions helped FedEx achieve strong financial and operating results in the quarter, especially given the global economy's continued low growth. Mike Glenn will offer a more detailed look at economic conditions and FedEx revenue growth later in today's call.","We expect FY '17 revenue and earnings to increase driven by volume growth and improved base yields at all our core transportation companies. The integration of TNT Express, which includes more than 200 countries is proceeding smoothly and on schedule. The level of team members' engagement is outstanding and very much appreciated. More than 20 teams are working in operations, customer solutions, personnel, IT, finance, legal, security, and other areas to positively transform FedEx, TNT into a seamless worldwide operation.","Alan Graf will provide a more comprehensive update, including our target, to exit the end of the four-year integration process in fiscal 2020 with annual synergies of $750 million [indiscernible]. The integration process continues. I assure you FedEx will maintain our high levels of customer service across all our operating companies with our commitment to the Purple Promise, which states simply, \u201cI will make every FedEx experience outstanding.\u201d And let me thank hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members in every corner of the globe who do just that every day.","Before I turn the call over to Mike, let me reiterate we are committed to improving margins, earnings per share, cash flows, and returns. Now Mike and then Alan will provide their insights. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn","Thanks, Fred. I'll open with an economic update and outlook and then discuss our performance and business conditions in each segment, including revenue, volume, yield, and provide some commentary on broader industry trends and our plans to what is expected to be another record-breaking holiday shopping season.","On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar '16, 20 basis points lower than our last forecast in the last quarter and 2.3% for calendar '17 led by gains in consumer spending. Our global GDP growth forecast is 2.2% for calendar '16, 10 basis points below last quarter and 2.6% for calendar '17. We expect industrial production to decline 0.7% in calendar '16, 10 basis points lower than last quarter and increase 2.2% next year.","Now I'll review revenue volume and yield trends by segment. U.S. Domestic Express package revenue grew 3% in Q1 driven by growth in both volume and yield. Excluding the impact of fuel, Domestic Express revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year. Package volume grew 1% year-over-year in the quarter driven by strong overnight volume growth. Yield per package increased 1% year over year despite lower fuel surcharges. Excluding [ph] the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express Domestic package yield grew 2.5%, primarily due to rate and discount.","FedEx International Express package revenue decreased 1% year-over-year in Q1 but increased 1% if you exclude the impact of fuel. FedEx international priority volume decreased 1% while international economy volume grew 1%. International export package yield decreased 1%. If you exclude the impact of fuel, international export package yield increased 1.4% primarily driven by the positive impact of rate and discount changes, which outweighed the negative impact of exchange rates.","FedEx Ground revenue increased 12% year-over-year in Q1 and increased 12.6% if you exclude the impact of fuel. This growth was driven by higher ground volume and yield. FedEx Ground average daily volume grew 10% year-over-year in Q1 driven by robust growth in both residential and commercial segments. FedEx Ground package yield increased 2% year-over-year in Q1.","If you exclude the impact of fuel, FedEx Ground yield per package increased 3% year-over-year driven by yield improvements in both Ground and SmartPost segments. FedEx Ground continues to gain revenue market share. In fact, through the end of calendar year 2015, FedEx Ground has gained revenue market share for 17 consecutive years and we are tracking to continue that trend and make it 18 years through the first half of this calendar year.","FedEx Freight revenue increased 4% in Q1 and 5.4% excluding the impact of fuel. Average daily shipments increased 8% year-over-year. The continued strength in shipment volume is driven by our outstanding sales efforts with small and medium customers and reflects the speed, reliability, and choice of priority and economy service for our LTL customers. We also saw increased demand from larger customers during the quarter.","Revenue per LTL shipment declined 4% in Q1 due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and lower weight per shipment. Excluding the impact of the fuel surcharge revenue, revenue per shipment was down 1.7%.","I\u2019d now like to spend a few minutes discussing industry dynamics, including pricing changes and the upcoming peak holiday season. As announced yesterday, we will be raising rates effective January 2, 2017. FedEx Express rates will increase by an average of 3.9%. Rates for FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will increase by an average of 4.9%. We will also change the dimensional weight divisor for FedEx Express and FedEx Ground from 166 to 139.","Our dimensional weight divisor for U.S. domestic and international packages will now be the same after the change is implemented. Beginning in February, we will also be updating the FedEx Express and Ground fuel surcharges weekly as we do with FedEx Freight today. There will be no changes to the fuel surcharge tables. Details of all changes to rates and surcharges are available at fedex.com\/rates2017.","We are deep into planning for what is expected to be another record peak holiday shipping season. The rapid growth of e-commerce has driven significant shifts in demand over the last several years. Last year, we experienced 15% growth in peak season volume and delivered more than 325 million packages.","Beyond just the dramatic rise in volume, there are several other shifting industry dynamics. Holiday promotions and buying patterns have increasingly shifted which has resulted in heavy demand for package delivery on Mondays during the peak. The intensity for demand on Monday has accelerated in recent years, as more and more retail locations have started serving as fulfillment centers for e-commerce orders. We expect each of the four Mondays during the upcoming peak period to be among the busiest in our company's history.","We have also experienced increased demand for transportation of larger and heavier packages. As e-commerce grows, there is demand for online ordering and delivery of everything from large screen TVs to mattresses and trampolines. We've engineered our network\u2019s sortation and delivery capacity for these larger packages, including entire temporary facilities dedicated to the sortation of oversized packages, which will be critically important this upcoming peak season. Beyond oversized packages, we will continue to make investments in technology and facilities that allow us to handle this year-round growth in demand.","We've added to what is already the industry's most technologically advanced ground sortation and delivery network with additional automation in new facilities. In fact, we've added 19 automated stations in four major distribution centers for FedEx Ground since the peak season last year alone. We\u2019ve also added more reliable and efficient aircraft to the FedEx Express fleet over the last year. And while the advanced automation provides us a competitive advantage in sortation and speed, the key to our success during the peak continues to be our people.","Across the FedEx portfolio, we expect to once again add more than 50,000 seasonal positions to help the holidays arrive. Based upon growth expectations and network expansion, many of these seasonal team members will have an opportunity for full-time work at FedEx after the holidays. These investments in people, facilities, aircraft and technology are all made to enable us to provide outstanding service even during the busiest days of the year.","As a further commitment to delivering outstanding service and in recognition of Christmas falling on Sunday this year, we've adjusted some service commitments for shipments tendered the week of Christmas. FedEx Express will be delivering on Saturday, December 24, Christmas Eve, but it is not a service day for FedEx Ground. FedEx Hold at Location is also a delivery option for customers on Christmas Eve.","All service adjustments have already been communicated to customers as part of an extensive planning and collaboration effort to meet customer needs and enable outstanding service across the FedEx portfolio throughout peak.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for your comments, Mike. Thanks to the FedEx team for delivering strong first quarter results. For FedEx Corporation, adjusted EPS climbed 20% to $2.90 per share. Revenues increased 19% to 14.7 billion with the addition of TNT Express. Consolidated adjusted operating margin was 9.3%. We continue to increase profits while investing in the business.","First quarter results improved due to higher operating income at Express, base yields improved and expense growth was constrained and at Ground where volume and yield grew. Offsetting factors include a higher network expansion costs at Ground. These adjusted numbers exclude the integration and restructuring program costs, intangible asset amortization of TNT Express.","Ground volume continued to grow. Segment operating income increased 14% and margin increased to 14.2% due to volume and yield growth and lower self-insurance costs. Headwinds included higher operational costs due to network expansion and higher purchased transportation rates. Comparisons were easier due to higher self-insurance reserves last year. We aren\u2019t expecting that benefit to continue and comparisons for the rest of the year are expected to be more difficult.","Ground\u2019s business continues to grow nicely driven in large part by e-commerce. We believe continued strategic investments will position Ground for long-term profitable growth by increasing capacity and efficiency to better meet the dynamic needs of our customers.","Investments include continued network expansion, integration of commercial and residential networks, including SmartPost, completing transition of our pickup and delivery service providers through a single operating model to add service capacity and operational flexibility, incentives for our small business partners to equip their vehicles with improved safety technology.","Freight\u2019s operating income increased 2% primarily due to higher volumes and a favorable comparison as a result of a charge for a facility closure. These benefits were mostly offset by lower LTL revenue per shipment which also drove a small decline in operating margin. Freight continues to face a difficult macro environment and is working hard to manage costs and increase yields.","Express frankly knocked the ball out of the park in Q1. Adjusted operating income was up 19% and adjusted operating margin grew 140 basis points to 9.7%. Adding to the bottom line in Express were base yield improvement, volume growth and cost management efforts. In addition to its day job, Express with busy integrating TNT.","As a result, integration expenses of 22 million are included in the GAAP results for the FedEx Express segment. FedEx Express continues to manage network capacity to match customer demand, reduce structural costs, modernize its air fleet and drive continued productivity increases.","Beginning this quarter, we are reporting the operating results for FedEx Express and TNT in different segments. In our 10-Q we will provide an overview of the FedEx Express group, which is comprised of the two segments I just mentioned. The presentation of TNT in our financial statements, including purchase price allocation, is preliminary and will likely change in future periods perhaps significantly given the timing and complexity of the acquisition. We plan to complete our purchase price allocation no later than the fourth quarter of FY '17.","We believe the TNT acquisition, the largest acquisition in FedEx\u2019s history, transformed the world's transportation logistics industry rapidly accelerating our European and global growth strategy as one-third of total FedEx Corporation revenue now touches a country outside of the United States. We have a rich history of success in integrating businesses into FedEx and we are doubling down our commitment to the TNT integration in terms of our people and financial resources.","TNT\u2019s 56,000 team members deliver 1 million packages daily in over 200 countries. TNT\u2019s European road network connects more than 40 countries through 19 road hubs and over 540 depots and will substantially enhance our global footprint by leveraging TNT's lower cost road networks in Europe and in the Middle East and Asia as well.","FedEx now has a strong presence in Europe, transportation options from express to economy parcel and freight helping not only our customers in Europe but also around the world shipping into Europe. We have similar and complementary corporate cultures and a common history of superior service value to customers.","We had a seamless and very successful first day when we acquired TNT on May 25. Today is our 119th day of ownership of TNT. Prior to close of the transaction, we invested about a year building an integration plan and we are well positioned for success. Our new senior leadership team is established and all key TNT activities and responsibilities have transitioned to the integrated FedEx senior officer teams.","Hundreds of town halls have occurred across the enterprise in operations, sales, marketing, and other back-office functions. We have strong talent within the TNT legacy organization and team members across both organizations are energized about the combination.","We also have strong cultural alignment across the teams with a focus on our people service profit philosophy. We expect the integration to take four years and significant investments in people, capital and expense. These are network businesses and require a combination of our pickup and delivery operations at a local level for our stations and depots, our ground and air networks and our extensive operational clearance, sales and in back-office IT systems.","The IT investments that will be required are significant given the limited investment in IT at TNT over the last decade. This is also a key enabler of the integration and its benefits. We are bringing together the activities of team members across the globe. These activities and the pace are balanced against continuing to deliver world-class customer experience and a lot of returns for our shareholders.","Prior to acquisition, TNT announced its outlook strategy to double its adjusted operating income and margin percentage by 2018. That profit improvement program includes various initiatives focused on yield management, operational efficiency and productivity as well as customer service. We are focusing on the initiatives and projects within outlook to deliver the greatest benefits balanced with our four-year integration plan.","We are projecting TNT to be dilutive on a GAAP basis in FY '17 due to integration expenses, outlook restructuring expenses and non-cash intangible asset amortization. On an as adjusted basis, excluding non-cash intangible asset amortization, integration expenses and outlook expenses, we expect TNT to be accretive in FY '17 as the TNT outlook restructuring program has already started to lower costs.","We have seen almost immediate benefits as we begin the integration. In the U.S. and Canada, we are transitioning TNT's volume formally handed by third-party carriers into the FedEx portfolio. In late September, we will begin consolidating depots and will begin transitioning customers in October. We will complete the U.S. and Canada transition by the end of fiscal year '17.","In addition, we have realized procurement and sourcing benefits, transitioned four of TNT's third-party delivery partners into the FedEx direct serve operation or moved to a single third-party provider and will launch our initial injection of FedEx volume into five select TNT European road network lanes later in September. We\u2019re off to a very solid start.","We see the combination of these two businesses as transformative and expect significant synergies from the integration. We will drive value from four key areas; optimized pickup and delivery operations, an integrated global express network, improved efficiency of staff functions and processes, and revenue growth.","We plan to optimize pickup and delivery operations by implementing new technology and processes, optimizing the locations of facilities and stations without impacting service and benefiting from the new pickup and delivery efficiencies globally where parcels will utilize a lower cost integrated pickup and delivery network to achieve greater economies of scale.","We plan to form one global express network by developing integrated solutions to track en route parcels and freight and fully integrating our intercontinental airlift network. We will have one global express air network with an optimized line haul and hub strategy that will deliver the best service for our customers and significantly improve our costs.","We plan to improve the efficiency of our staff functions and processes by optimizing our systems and processes, including IT, innovating, transforming and streamlining key support functions such as human resources, legal, security, and finance, achieving meaningful sourcing savings, lowering our effective tax rate over the long term as synergies will drive additional international profits taxed at lower rates and greater efficiency will lead to greater cost savings.","We will grow revenue with a best-in-class service portfolio with one sales team, a single online tool for customer inquiries and invoices, revenue management activities that optimize yield, improve market share and increase profitability. As a result, customers will have access to a broader portfolio of services and will see value proposition improvements.","We remain supremely confident in our initial views of the value of this acquisition and are targeting to exit the end of the four-year integration with annual synergies of $750 million. Similar to our recently completed and successful profit improvement plan at Express, we do not believe that it\u2019s meaningful to give initial year-by-year guidance.","The integration is complex and the timing of integration and restructuring expenses beyond fiscal year '17 are not yet crystallized. How we ultimately get to our target will evolve as market conditions and other factors change. We are highly confident in our target and our goals.","We currently expect the aggregate integration program expense over the four years to be in the range of $700 million to $800 million. Timing and amount of these integration related estimates are subject to change as we implement and adjust our plans as necessary. In FY '18, TNT will be accretive including integration and restructuring costs.","According to our corporate outlook based on the moderate economic forecast that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $11.85 to $12.35 per diluted share for FY '17, which excludes TNT integration, outlook restructuring costs, TNT intangible asset amortization and year-end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments.","We are estimating combined TNT integration and outlook restructuring expenses of about 275 million and TNT related intangible asset amortization about 115 million for FY '17. We\u2019ll expect our FY '17 integration CapEx for TNT to be about $100 million. Again, the timing and amount of these integration related estimates are subject to change as our plans are refined.","Meanwhile, Ground and Freight will continue to be focused on achieving their goals independent of the integration at Express. Our total capital expenditure forecast remains at 5.6 billion in FY '17, including TNT. We anticipate that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our increased capital expenditures in FY '17 which will include spending for network expansion at Ground to support e-commerce growth and the continued aircraft fleet modernization at Express which continues to lower our costs.","Longer term, we would target CapEx 6% to 8% of revenues. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are well positioned to continue to increase corporate earnings, dividends, cash flows, returns and margins.","Now we look forward to answering your strategic questions, and I will turn it back over to Fred.","Frederick W. Smith","Thank you very much, Mike and Alan. I hope that gave the listeners an in-depth understanding of where we are. As you know, we are again soliciting questions over the Internet several calls ago and we have a number of them. Quite frankly, some we\u2019re not going to deal with because they were answered in the in-depth remarks of Mike and Alan. We\u2019ll deal with them on the basis of their strategic interest to the broader listeners on this call. What we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll take two from the Internet and then Mickey will queue up two from the live calls.","So the first question is from David Ross, Stifel. What is the benefit of having the road freight LTL\/groupage business in addition to the packaged business? I presume this talks about TNT in Europe. Might it ultimately just be a small packaged network in Europe?","So let me give you sort of a broad answer and then ask Mike and Dave Bronczek to jump in with any details they\u2019d like to add. First of all, I\u2019m not sure this is known as well as it should be that FedEx Express carries both pallets for express freight and packages and packets. And we are the market leader in the United States with our express freight. There are three services; overnight, two day and then two to three day and that is a very profitable service, and we have different pickup and delivery vehicles optimized for express freight. And obviously we have our packaged delivery vans in the express network, mostly the sprinter sized vans.","And those two streams of traffic come together at our airport and hub locations where the pallets are sorted in one area and the packages and other and then they\u2019re joined together for the line haul. So TNT is very similar in Europe to the way FedEx is organized in the United States that I just mentioned to you. They have terminals which have pallet sortation facilities in one end, package sortation in the other. The main difference is they have had vehicles which do both pallets and larger business-to-business package deliveries.","The attraction of TNT was many-fold but I have to tell you that one of the key attractions was their unduplicated express rate network in Europe. And of course Europe is a high density of population and their ability to move these pallets very fast throughout Western Europe was a tremendous advantage. We have a very extensive express freight capabilities in Brazil, Middle East, Southeast Asia and many other places around the world. So we will definitely continue in the express freight and the package business in the express segment.","Now, let me hasten to add that our express freight business is very different than Mike Ducker\u2019s FedEx Freight unit. Average weight per shipment is almost 4x. The nature of the commodities is quite different. The pricing is quite different and so forth. Similarly, Henry Maier's FedEx Ground is quite different than FedEx Express\u2019 parcel operations. And in Europe there is a very distinct ground parcel sector where there are a number of competitors.","But TNT's aggregate pallet and package business mainly in Europe but around the world was a very attractive feature of that company which let us to have an interest in buying them, and we will be very much continuing to provide international priority freight and international economy freight and intra-European freight and in those other areas and regions I mentioned to you. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn","I\u2019m not sure I can add to that answer.","Frederick W. Smith","You prepped me well.","David J. Bronczek","I\u2019m afraid to answer it any more but this is Dave Bronczek, I\u2019d just add that Fred outlined it very well. Most of you have been to Memphis. In our Memphis hub, there's a whole freight area that you\u2019ve seen. It\u2019s around the world; the same Dubai, the same Hong Kong, the same Brazil and around the world. One of the big advantages of TNT, and Fred\u2019s right that goes unnoticed, is their ability to handle very profitable freight and that's a part of their business that now we\u2019re going to put into our global network of parcels and pallets and it\u2019s been very successful for us. And it\u2019s a nice part of the business that we added with TNT. It\u2019s also part of what we actually viewed when we went to Australia just a month ago.","Fred Smith and I went to visit our colleagues in Australia TNT and our FedEx Express folks in Australia. The combination down there could be very, very powerful for us. We\u2019re looking at a way to make that whole marketplace much more successful, much more profitable and it gives us an opportunity now to leverage one with the other that we didn't have in the past. So to Fred\u2019s point, it's a great part of TNT's new business which is now part of the FedEx business.","Frederick W. Smith","The second question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Could you please compare and contrast major components, FedEx\u2019s e-commerce opportunities in the U.S. and Europe now that TNT is a part of your portfolio? And what are some strategic initiatives you expect to implement to capitalize on growing European e-commerce? Mike Glenn won't you take that and then Dave can jump in.","T. Michael Glenn","Thanks, Fred. Well, first of all, let me say that we believe there's significant opportunity for FedEx both in the U.S. from an e-commerce market perspective as well as in Europe and around the world. Our objective is to build out a robust portfolio of services in Europe and other countries just as we have in the U.S. to include a choice for e-commerce customers in terms of getting their packages delivered in a reliable and efficient manner. That's going to be a significant focus for us as we integrate TNT and we believe the additional density within the European network that TNT will bring to FedEx will allow us to compete on a much more aggressive basis as a result.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, this is Dave again. The jewel in the crown always at TNT was the very best ground road network in all of Europe. It\u2019s great service. They have great people, great cost structure. So with that now in our portfolio around the world, customers have always asked us for a solution for e-commerce to move across the world and mainly into Europe. Now we'll have that opportunity to do that very successfully. Thank you. ","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. Now we\u2019re going to take two questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. FedEx would like to invite questions via email. To email your questions, please use the ir@fedex.com email address and provide your full name and contact information. [Operator Instructions]. We do have our first question from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Thanks and good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on some of the longer-term opportunities with TNT as part of the business. When you think about the $750 million in annual synergy target exiting fiscal 2020, can you help us with some of the buckets Alan? I know you kind of gave us four primary buckets of synergies. Is there any way we can kind of group those there, any one of those buckets seem to be more representative of growth than others? Just want to get a sense of how to think about that? Thank you.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","I think what we have done today, Chris, as far as we\u2019re going to go in this quarter, we are \u2013 on the synergy side, we are in the process of validating the strategic business case that we used when we made the acquisition, and we\u2019ve got some work to go along there. I haven\u2019t seen any surprises or disappointments at this point. I'm very upbeat about where we are in this process with the team that we put together and with the energy that I'm seeing over there. We might be able to give you some more by the time we get to Q3 or Q4 that you're looking for in a little bit more detail, but at present we\u2019ve got that target out there and we\u2019ll be updating you on how we\u2019re progressing towards that as we move forward. But you have to give me a couple more quarters.","I think on the expense side of what we're looking at and particularly in '18, and some of the timing of some of these integration moves that we\u2019re making and some of the restructurings that we\u2019ll be making, we don\u2019t have those firm enough for me to tell you much about fiscal '18 just because of timing issues. But again, later on in the year, not in second quarter but maybe the third quarter call, we\u2019ll be able to I think expand on what we told you today, which I thought was a lot of information that we gave you.","Operator","Our next question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks. Good afternoon. In terms of the TNT, the outlook restructuring costs, it looks like you\u2019re expecting it to be about 75 million in fiscal '17. I was wondering if you could quantify the benefits that you saw during the first quarter and when you think the profit improvement will more than offset the restructuring costs?","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Well, as I said, you can see in the chart and in the appendix that we put out there, TNT\u2019s earnings in the first quarter were fairly small, but we expect to see that improve as we go through the year, and it will be accretive on an as adjusted basis. But we\u2019re not going to start giving different segment outlooks at this point for sure. But like I said, I\u2019m very happy with what I\u2019ve seen. I\u2019m particularly enthused about the people that I\u2019ve met across the organization and just how energized they are, how excited they are to be part of the team that can bring the investment needs and the brand to what they do every day, and we\u2019re as confident as ever about the long-term return.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. Back to the Internet questions that were submitted in advance; Bascome Majors of Susquehanna, how has FedEx been impacted by the significant growth in oversized, overweight residential e-commerce shipments that blur the lines between partial and LTL? Do you see a significant opportunity to grow residential deliveries in your LTL business? So how do you avoid margin pressure from this B2B to B2C mix shift freight? So Mike Glenn, Henry Maier, and Mike Ducker, take it away.","T. Michael Glenn","As I commented in my industry remarks, we have seen a significant increase in the demand for oversized and heavier residential packages. I referenced flat screen TVs, mattresses, and trampolines, and we expect that trend to continue. Having said that, we believe the bulk of that volume will be in the ground network. We\u2019ve made several pricing adjustments to make sure that we\u2019re compensated accordingly for handling that traffic, and we\u2019ll continue to reevaluate those. I also referenced that we have put up dedicated sort facilities. Henry can comment on that more. But we would expect the bulk of that traffic to stay in the ground network for a variety of reasons. If it\u2019s possible that we could see some bleed into the LTL network that would have happened, obviously we would make any necessary pricing adjustments to prevent margin decline.","Henry J. Maier","This is Henry Maier. The increase in large packages is clearly being driven by e-commerce. It also goes without saying that these packages create some operational challenges for us. For instance, they don\u2019t always fit on our standard sortation equipment and they take up more space in line haul and delivery vehicles in addition to being more difficult to handle. We recognize customers have few options here, so we\u2019ve realized that they look to FedEx for solutions. And in that end, as Mike mentioned, as part of our network expansion strategy we are now operating temporary non-conveyable annexes. This should repeat. We will run six of them which are essentially separate buildings designed to handle just these type packages which don\u2019t fit on our standard sortation equipment. We\u2019ve strategically located these facilities in parts of the country where our experience and history has shown that shippers reside and ship these type packages and continue to investigate how we handle these in the future. We\u2019re encouraged because there is some pretty interesting new technologies with respect to material handling equipment coming out that will be targeted directly at this type of packaged characteristics. As time goes on I think we\u2019ll employ more of that in our operations.","Michael L. Ducker","Mike Ducker, I would only add that it is really less than 3% of our overall shipment count that is residential, so it\u2019s not a big opportunity being no big transition as a result of the e-commerce initiative.","Frederick W. Smith","Here\u2019s a question from Helane Becker of Cowen. A lot of companies are starting to experiment with UAVs, FedEx experimenting as well. If so, how is that going and what do you think the timing would be of using UAVs both in the air and on the ground? Also, is it realistic to believe there could be unmanned trucks? Is FedEx going down this route (lol, pun intended)?","So Helane, obviously we at FedEx are very mindful of these trends. We have a number of activities underway in robotics in particular in the packaged handling sector. Henry and FedEx Ground are real leaders in this regard. In terms of UAVs in particular, we have five separate, I think it would be not fair to call all of them projects but work streams or projects in both aviation and automated vehicles. The difference with us and a lot of other people we\u2019ll just prefer to keep working those issues and tell you about them when they make a meaningful difference in the company. I will say this much. I think our philosophy and we know a lot about these technologies. After all, our auto pilots in our 777 airplanes are among the most sophisticated robots in the world. They can take off, land the plane and taxi to the gate and turn themselves off if that\u2019s what we chose to do so. But it\u2019s very difficult in the foreseeable future to substitute for the well trained pilot or driver or person. And we look at the use of automation more as an opportunity to improve the productivity of those types of experts within our system to make their job more comfortable and easy and above all to increase safety. So those five work streams are underway. You\u2019ll hear a lot about them I\u2019m confident in the next few years. But important in our philosophy maybe slightly different than a lot of other people that think that right over the horizon, everything is going to be an automated vehicle or some sort of UAV. We think that is unlikely and that this technology like most technologies particularly aviation technology will evolve incrementally over time with a great emphasis on safety first. So that\u2019s our UAV update. We\u2019ll take two questions now.","Operator","First up, we have Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Great. Thanks for all the color on the call and Alan in particular all the financial information around TNT is very helpful. I wanted to see if you could give us the sense of just to understand is there a base operating income level that we should be considering for TNT, and you\u2019re adding 750 million on top of that or is 750 really kind of the bucket that you end up with at the end of fiscal 2020 in terms of operating income contribution? And then also I guess are you \u2013 the goodwill amortization, is that going to come in at some point or we should just consider that number I think you said like 115 a year, that\u2019s just kind of excluded from the way you look at TNT going forward? Anyway thanks for the information. Just looking for a little more to understand it better. Thank you.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","There will be some base TNT in that number of 750 but you\u2019ll be able to see when we report what they earn at the end of this year, how much of that is actually increase going to be in synergy. So when we get there, we can give you some more detail about that. As to our purchase price accounting, you\u2019ll see in our 10-Q that there was about \u2013 the purchase price is $4.9 billion. There was about 3 billion of goodwill in that which we will not be amortizing and hopefully we will never amortize it as we will seek to make sure that we will earn plenty of money to justify the carrying cost of that goodwill. The intangible assets, the biggest one\u2019s the customer relationship that we\u2019re looking at right now. We\u2019ve got that on the books for 685 million in a 15-year use for life. We\u2019re going to work that very hard. We also have technology and trademarks. You\u2019ll see that in the 10-Q as well. I reserve the right to change these amortization lives and amounts as we get further through this process. And as we do that, we\u2019ll keep you fully informed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Rob, if you could check your mute function please.","Robert Salmon","Hi. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question. With regard to the U.S. domestic package market, we\u2019ve seen both you guys and your primary competitor Brown [ph] announce some decent announce some decent increases to the dimensional based pricing. And obviously, in 2017 you\u2019re taking kind of another step here. I\u2019m curious from a strategic standpoint, what risks do you see with the USPS kind of highlighting the fact that they haven\u2019t made any changes there and how you attack that from a competitive standpoint, whether it\u2019s through the Postal Regulatory Commission or just service? I\u2019d be curious to get your thoughts there.","T. Michael Glenn","Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on any competitors\u2019 pricing actions but I\u2019ll say that our decision was driven by a couple of issues. One is, we wanted to rationalize our dimensional weight policy for both domestic and international, which we have now done so both domestic express and international shipments will both carry a dim devisor of 139. In addition to that, obviously one of the key issues for us in managing the network is the density per package. And one of the challenges that we do see with the increase in e-commerce transactions is packaging that is not as efficient as it could be and there are a number of benefits to becoming more efficient and you can use smaller packages which is one, obviously it\u2019s more sustainable from that perspective. And we encourage customers to take advantage of our state of the art packaging lab to make sure that they maximize the packaging that they have to avoid these charges. So that\u2019s primarily the driver behind our decision and that was made in the defendant of any \u2013 what any competitor might consider. I can\u2019t comment on that.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. A couple more questions from the Internet. David Ross; why is the company buying back stock rather than paying down debt and deleveraging? I think I\u2019ll just have Alan answer this.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Thanks for the question over the Internet, David. As you know, we have very strong cash flows inside FedEx Corporation. I think you heard me today talk about how we are excited about the future and continuing to grow those. And the fact of the matter is we believe our stock\u2019s undervalued. But we\u2019re also investing in the company\u2019s future at the same time. I think we get criticized a lot about our capital expenditures but they all carry very solid long-term return on invested capital or we wouldn\u2019t be doing them. And then lastly, although we got a lot of debt, I should tell you that the average coupon on that\u2019s 3.6%. So every project that we\u2019re doing is going to be earning way more than that on an annual basis. So our credit metrics are good. We\u2019ve committed to improving our credit metrics but we\u2019ll continue to buy back stock, raise dividends and invest in our businesses going forward because we can and we\u2019re going to manage it accordingly.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. There are a couple of questions in here from Tom Wadewitz of UBS and Allison Landry essentially about improving density levels and the issue of SmartPost deliveries by FedEx Ground, FedEx SmartPost. So let me just make one comment here and then ask Henry to talk about it.","I have said this over and over again for the last couple of years. There is a continuing misunderstanding of the issue of route density, revenue per stop and the profundity of those metrics on the e-commerce business. And there is no entity that can provide the type of route density and cost for lightweight residential delivery as the postal services both in this country and abroad. Postal service in this country, correct me if I\u2019m wrong here, Henry, makes 156 million stops per day. So they are a mail company that puts parcels in with the mail stream usually in very small vehicles 200,000,150 cubic foot jeeps. They are out with an RFP for somewhat larger vehicles and so forth. So the real question about e-commerce is what\u2019s the future of mail and what implications does that have on the price of the delivery of packages. Put a different way, it is mail that subsidizes the delivery of packages not packages subsidizing delivery of mail. And the Postmaster General talks about this in her calls and so forth and it has been a very, very good thing for the postal service that the big carriers like FedEx and UPS that had these enormous upstream systems can feed these lightweight residential packages into the postal business. They don\u2019t have to have that investment, the hubs, the sortations and so forth. And similarly Amazon of course now has a very substantial direct injection on their own. But there is no comparable entity to the postal service in terms of density and even the most rapid projections of e-commerce growth will not be a fraction of the density that the postal service has today. So there are these continuing articles about this and more and more things are going to affect the density. My Goodness, they would have to be quantumly greater than is the case. And so that\u2019s the real question about e-commerce is, what are price of those deliveries on a go-forward basis which are driven either by density in the case of the postal service or input costs. And so Henry jump in here. This is the issue and is very poorly understood and it \u2013 I called everything I can think of, mythology or whatever you might want to say but most of the commentary on this is not accurate.","Henry J. Maier","I would just add to that, Fred. Thanks. Even with 156 million unique addresses that present an opportunity for a delivery every day, that base is growing by 900,000 addresses a year. So this is a moving target. And I would tell you even with the tremendous growth all of us who participate in e-commerce are seeing are really only delivered to a small percentage of those addresses every single day. We just happen to have very complex, state of the art software tools that allow us to take a slug of packages I guess for lack of a better word with what we\u2019re presented with every day by our customers and optimize those packages for the most efficient delivery. Now what\u2019s been going on at FedEx Ground is really an understanding of this phenomenon and what e-commerce is doing with respect to changing our business, our Holy Grail here is just to improve delivery density and revenue per stop and the only way you can do that in our network is with the network integration we\u2019ve been going through for the last several years, which includes the integration of ground and home delivery and now, since last September we announced we\u2019re integrating SmartPost in that as well. Over the top of this is the technology needed to manage the most optimal route of distribution of those packages every single day. Having a single contractor network which we announced in January we\u2019re moving to a single contract and we expect to be essentially 90% done with all of this by 2020. You layover our ability beginning earlier this year to be able to statically match packages that are destined to the same residential delivery address every single day. And next summer the ability to do that virtually plus some additional engineering around deliveries on certain streets and neighborhoods when there\u2019s another residential package involved. And what we end up with here is a much more efficient, much more flexible network that much lower costs, much better capital asset utilization going forward with the growth of e-commerce than the one we have today.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. We\u2019ll take two questions from the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Good evening. Thank you for the time. Just going back, Alan, to your comments on the synergies for a moment, are the synergies \u2013 just to be clear, are the synergies in addition to the expectations for margin improvement from the outlook program that TNT was already undertaking? And then also could you quantify the EPS accretion from TNT that is embedded in the adjusted FY '17 guidance? Thank you.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","I\u2019m not going to go there on number two. That would be again trying to break us down by segments in EPS delivery. As to number one, we bought TNT for a reason. We didn\u2019t own them last fiscal year except for a couple of days. So when we get out to 2020 what I\u2019m saying is we\u2019ll be 750 million of synergies better off than we would have been without them. So you\u2019ll be able to very easily measure that and follow that along. And as I said, we\u2019ll talk about this more after we\u2019ve completed our validation of our strategic business case and met with our Board of Directors about where we stand on that, which is going to take us a little bit of time to get to, as we are also right in the middle of the throes of actually integrating as I mentioned to you in my opening remarks. So just have a little patience but the whole point was to tell you, this thing is a homerun, it\u2019s going to be a homerun and we\u2019re going to have that done by four years from now and we will continue to update you along the way. It\u2019s going to be a great ride.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclay\u2019s.","Brandon Oglenski","Good evening, everyone, and thanks for letting me get on here for a question. And I\u2019ll just second that we definitely appreciate the TNT disclosure. I think your investors will too. And we\u2019ll also be shipping plenty of trampolines this fourth quarter. Henry, on your Ground margins, it looks like you actually got a little bit of improvement year-on-year. I know there\u2019s some issues with casualties last year. But nonetheless, as we look forward, I think a lot of folks had been worried that the network integration costs of expanding at such a rapid pace, growing the top line so rapidly, would weigh heavier on the margin. So can you talk to the market dynamics? Has volume gotten better? Is demand better than forecast, pricing better, or should we be thinking maybe those headwinds still loom in the near term?","Henry J. Maier","Let me let Mike comment on the market here.","T. Michael Glenn","Well, let me say that customers still have had demand for our Ground service for the simple fact that it\u2019s extremely reliable and we are faster than any other Ground network out there by a significant percentage. So our sales team continues to have great success selling our ground service. Let me say that from a volume growth and yield management perspective, we\u2019re always looking for the right balance there to maximize the profitability. So we work very closely with Henry and his team to make sure that we\u2019re making pricing decisions that they\u2019re going to contribute to long-term profitability and that\u2019s going on a weekly basis. So we got good collaboration there but we continue to see strong demand for Ground because of the value proposition that it provides.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","This is Alan. I\u2019m going to give you a little bit color on where Henry is right at the moment. We have invested and our investing significantly this fiscal year in Ground to get to the next level where we need to get. And it\u2019s a big capital step I would tell you. So it\u2019s $2 billion of this year, maybe the same even next year. And that of course has a cumulative effect. When you turn on these new facilities they\u2019re not full day one. You got to work them through the systems and they have a little bit of a drag. That drag is fine to me because I know what the long-term results are going to be. I know the growth that everyone is going to have. Originally, we did get a little surprised by how quickly these non-conveyables and oversized things grew. We\u2019re going to lean right into that. We\u2019re going to be the best in the business in getting those delivered. We\u2019re going to get them priced right. They got to be handled a little bit differently. So that also has a start-up cost associated with it. So I gave you guidance for the full company for the year and Henry\u2019s comparisons are going to be a little bit more difficult because of all those investments that we\u2019re making. But the state of the business is as good as it\u2019s always been and I can\u2019t wait until we turn the corner from this period of heavy capital investment.","Frederick W. Smith","Well, here\u2019s one for you Henry and Mike, whichever one wants to take it. Can you discuss and quantify the synergies thus far with GENCO in your portfolio as well as some strategic initiatives for this business over the coming year or two?","Henry J. Maier","Well, we bought GENCO because of their expertise in fulfillment, traditional 3PL services and returns. That expertise allows us to compete for business that we wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to compete for before. And on top of that we get to secure the transportation business. I would say strategically right now we continue to look and explore products that enhance e-commerce fulfillment and add to the returns portfolio they currently have. And I would also add here that we expect the integration of GENCO to be essentially complete by the end of FY '17.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay. Here\u2019s one from \u2013 Matthew Troy sent one from Wells Fargo Securities about the dimensional pricing and calculation. I think Mike has answered that as to what drove it and why we did it, to standardize it across the enterprise and basically the realities of the increased costs in handling it.","William Flynn [ph] just sent one in. When you think about the acquisitions you made over the past 30 years, which ones do you view as transformational? Well, I guess if you stack rank them, the three that would be in top tier categories would be Flying Tigers, which put us into an unprecedented position in the growing Asian market. Certainly Caliber\/RPS which is now FedEx Ground and TNT would be right up there and it\u2019s going to be as Alan said a very, very significant earnings engine for us. And what\u2019s a little bit different about Tigers and Caliber and RPS, those gave us presences in adjacent markets. Tigers in the intercontinental business, we were much smaller as FedEx and so we had to go out there and develop the business. Alan will remember this with keen detail like I do. We bought it at the optimally worst time. The Gulf War started and air cargo basically stopped, which was an interesting set of circumstances. But it put us in an unprecedented position. That\u2019s why we\u2019re the market leader in air cargo and air express. Caliber\/RPS of course put in the ground segment, which we had not been in before and a lot of work \u2013 a lot of people, like Glenn in particular heading up some of these transitions we made. Of course, it\u2019s a fabulous business now. And TNT, as Alan has told you there, we\u2019re going to get the synergies just from putting the companies together and then we\u2019re going to build additional profitability on top of that. So it\u2019s going to be a great thing and I think Dave Bronczek and Alan have all said this, but let me just add to it, just wonderful people. We have just been so thrilled with the folks that we\u2019ve gotten. Many, many of the TNT people are now in high executive positions in FedEx and I think it\u2019s going to be a great thing.","Next, we\u2019ll take two more questions.","Operator","Next up we have Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter","Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess you talked a lot about the integration of TNT, but maybe talk about are the expenses at this stage larger than what you thought they would be given the couple of months under your belt? I just want to understand kind of what \u2013 as you talk about the expenses? And then also you had talked before about the tax potential. Is that something that will roll in over time, Alan, or is that something we could see in kind of the stair step function? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","I\u2019ve been really pleased with how well our spending has followed what we had designed in integration plan. We knew that IT was going to be a big one and that\u2019s the long pole in the tent, but we\u2019ve got really good people working on this. And you\u2019ve heard we\u2019re already starting to integrate, that\u2019s a little bit ahead of what I thought we would be able to do. So when I say 700, 800, that\u2019s kind of what we thought about all along. And as I said there will be some restructuring charges along the way. We bought Flying Tigers and we bought Ground, there wasn\u2019t \u2018the integrations\u2019 so much to say as there is in this one. So this is going to be a little bit different for us but we\u2019re well ahead of the game, so I\u2019m very comfortable with how that\u2019s going and stay tuned and bear with us and we\u2019ll keep you updated and apprised. But it\u2019s going to be a homerun.","David J. Bronczek","This is Dave. Just to follow up on that. I\u2019ve been in Europe a lot of times now and meeting with the whole team over there now, the TNT people that have joined FedEx and I got to say and Fred said it now, the people are fantastic. Service is second to none on the ground. They\u2019re the best in Europe coupled with the best air express system in Europe. We have this opportunity to make this not only what Alan said a homerun, this is a grand slam. It has gone exceptionally well because their people and our people have matched culturally and at the end of the day that\u2019s the main thing.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Back to the second one, Ken, on tax, you tell me. Are we going to get tax reform or not? The United States is shooting itself in the foot by continuing to not do territorial and have the highest tax rate in the world. What I\u2019m saying is based on today\u2019s laws, we\u2019re going to earn a whole lot more in lower tax places than we do today and over time that\u2019s going to drive our rate now. We also are in the process of restructuring our tax structure and I think we\u2019re going to be much more efficient in terms of paying taxes where we actually earn the money than we\u2019ve been able to do as a U.S. certificated air carrier over the years. So both of those should work in our favor and neither one of those benefits are in the 750. 750 is above the line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.","Ravi Shanker","Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So not to beat a horse here, but when you consider the outlook costs and the integration costs, can you tell us how much of that is going to be expense versus cash? And also can you give us an update on the Hanjin situation and if you\u2019re seeing any benefits or any expedited freight as a result of that? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","The only thing that\u2019s not cash, Ravi, are the amortization of the intangible assets. Everything else is cash and I\u2019ve given you all those numbers in my presentation and they\u2019ll be restated in the 10-Q. And I\u2019ve only given 17 at this point. The total 700 million to 800 million is integration costs by itself and does not include any intangible assets, so that might help you a bit. I\u2019ll let somebody else handle Hanjin.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, this is Dave. There\u2019s no affect for us at the moment whatsoever on your last question, Ravi, on Hanjin.","Frederick W. Smith","So we\u2019ll just take questions now from the live call.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon","Hi. Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Mike, could you maybe help us dimension how much the dim weight change would affect, what percentage of the business would be affected by that and what kind of earnings impact you think that might have in the near term? Just trying to get a sense for what portion of volume that dim weight charge could apply to.","T. Michael Glenn","Well, I appreciate the question but with all pricing decisions we don\u2019t forecast the economic impact and the profit impact of that or the percentage of volume that it\u2019s going to impact. Obviously, as I noted before, we would love to see customers access our world-class packaging lab to continue to provide more efficient packing and we hope they do so. And so it\u2019s hard to determine what percentage of packages it will affect because we hope behavior changes. But we don\u2019t forecast the bottom line impact to these changes.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","This is Alan. We actually do internally but we don\u2019t externally. And so let me just say, it\u2019s a good thing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks very much. Could you discuss what you\u2019ve seen with regard to pricing and the capacity environment in the international markets, at least with regard to demand to international priority and international economy, as that trends look pretty good right now for you? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Well, as you\u2019ve seen in our numbers it\u2019s actually very good for us right now. The international priority box is up 3%, the international economy is up as well. So in many of the segments that we are really leading the world, the volume is there and it\u2019s growing. On top of that, the yields are increasing. So I would say and Mike might want to add to this, on the international front we\u2019re right in the mainstream of where the main business is growing. It\u2019s very good for us.","T. Michael Glenn","And I would just add that we\u2019ve got a rational pricing environment, so we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re situated.","Frederick W. Smith","Can we take one more question?","Operator","Our final question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane Becker","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Thanks for the time. And Fred, thank you for your earlier in-depth answer. Just one question, Alan, and I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s kind of short-term in nature. But in terms of the guidance that you gave us, the $0.10 raise, was it due to TNT or due to the increase because of improvement in the base business? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf, Jr.","Well, it\u2019s from my All-Star Dave Bronczek and his team. They\u2019re knocking it out of the park and you see what they\u2019re margin in the first quarter is. He\u2019s been having a heck of a year and so that was the reason for it.","Operator","That does conclude our question and answer session. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to our speakers for closing comments.","A. Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation first quarter earnings release conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team if you have any additional questions on FedEx. Thank you very much. Bye.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude today\u2019s call.

Good afternoon. Thanks everyone for participating in our first quarter FY 2020 analysts\u2019 call. Let me also thank the hundreds of thousands of FedEx teammates around the world who work everyday to keep our purple promise, I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","When our strategic management committee presented the FY 2020 business plan to our Board of Directors last spring, we identified three significant challenges to increasing earnings this fiscal year, consistent with our stated long-term goals. One, beginning in the fall of 2018, it had become clear that global trade disputes were adversely affecting manufacturing in Europe and Asia, thereby slowing international shipping demand.","Two, our TNT integration was facing its most important phase, leading to the integration of European ground operations by the end of FY 2020. And three, we plan to add capabilities to enhance our services for the rapidly growing e-commerce market, which we expect to grow in the United States from 50 million to 100 million packages per day by 2026. ","These shipments will be destined increasingly to residences, and one in four packages will be short distance deliveries. While the backbone of FedEx is the B2B business, our unmatched ground and express line haul and short networks carry both B2B and B2C commerce with great efficiency. The lead in e-commerce we have launched or announced FedEx extra hours and express service which provides nightly pick up with the delivery the next business day.","In sourcing FedEx SmartPost packages for FedEx Ground delivery by peak 2020. FedEx Ground six and seven day delivery. Expanding the FedEx Ground oversized package network to approximately 100 facilities by peak 2020, new return services and thousands of additional pickup and shipping points, including $8,000 general onsite locations in less dense areas.","And finally, FedEx Freight Direct for heavy and hard to handle items requiring delivery over the threshold, the so called H-3D [ph] market. FedEx can handle millions of additional shipments generated by these new offerings without adding significant additional sortation capacity.","It should be noted a large amount of Ground growth will be short haul zone one that will be lower yield, but with improved margin due to increasing density and minimal line haul cost. There is a new video on our website that goes into detail about our broad portfolio and I hope you will watch it. Our services and capabilities and cost will be industry leading in the short haul zone one sector.","The FedEx Board of Directors endorse making these moves as FY 2019 came to a close understanding the short-term cost, as we believe by the end of this fiscal year FY 2020, we will have significantly repositioned FedEx for strong future earnings. The market is changing as volumes are moving out of the USPS. And we are in-sourcing more, we have a chart on the IR website that shows these trends.","Over the summer, these challenges increased somewhat due to the decision to not renew our largest Amazon contract and deepening trade disputes. While the Amazon contract represented only a small proportion of our revenues, the nature of our business is such that near-term profits will be adversely affected since the last bit of volume has significant flow through to the bottom line. However, we have closed additional business to replace this traffic, which is being onboarded and we are taking out significant costs which were unique to Amazon's requirements.","Also, the global macro economy continues to soften and we are taking steps to reduce capacity. Specifically we will retire 20 MD-10-10 Aircraft over the current and next fiscal year, which will eliminate that fleet type from our air operations.","We are highly likely to also retire the remaining 10 A310 aircraft this year, which will also lead to the elimination of that fleet type. In addition, we are parking the equivalent capacity of seven MD-11 aircraft this fiscal year. Accordingly, assuming no recession, we will continue the initiatives announced in May and June with confident optimism about FedEx's long-term future competitive position and industry leadership.","We posted a chart on our website that shows the significant customer correlation among our three core OpCos. Our ability to bundle Express, Ground and Freight services is essential to success in our competitive exosphere. FedEx Office and FedEx Logistics also provide important value added services to our portfolio against the major competitors we face every day.","Let me now ask Brie to amplify our views on the marketplace and the economy, then Raj to discuss current operations, including our plans for peak season. And Alan will give you more details on our financials. Then we will take your questions. Brie?","Brie Carere","Thank you, Fred. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll open with our economic outlook then dive directly into how we're tackling market opportunities and delivering solutions for our customers at FedEx.","Comparing to where we were in June, our overall outlook for U.S. economic growth is down 20 basis points currently at 2.3% for real GDP. Our outlook has changed despite consumer driven growth of 2% in the U.S. in Q2 of CY 2019. This changes because the industrial sector remains sluggish due to an inventory build-up and increased geopolitical trade tensions. As you can see in chart number three on the IR site, U.S. manufacturing PMI has been very weak this year. Given that our industrial production outlook is down 70 basis points from June currently at 0.9%.","From a global perspective, economic growth has decreased as the developed world outside of the U.S. sees weaker growth and both domestic and external factors weigh on emerging markets. In Europe, ongoing decline in Germany's industrial sector is a drag on growth. While uncertainty over Brexit is impacting not just the UK where no sector has been immune to the negative impact, but its major trading partners as well. Growth in Italy remains week with Q2 CY 2019 data showing no gain in real GDP.","In reference to chart four in the presentation, you can see Eurozone manufacturing PMI has been signalling contraction for most of the year. In Asia, Chinese industrial production growth had a 10 year low in July and exports remain week. Chinese exports to the U.S. of the client every month in 2019. More broadly all manufacturer -- excuse me, all major exporting economies have been impacted by the slowdown in trade, especially Asian economies with high exposure to China.","I want to highlight that Q2 CY 2019 global trade volumes declined year-over-year, which is the first decline since 2009. This decline coupled with JPMorgan's global PMI manufacturing export orders index falling from 47.5 and August from 49 in May leads us to expect global trade volumes will contrast this year on an annual basis for the first time since 2009.","As we have stressed before, a zero tariff zero subsidy global trade environment is the most powerful economic growth engine there is. We will continue to push for policies that stimulate rather than depressed global trade.","Now, turning our focus to what we can control we remained laser focused on executing strategies across three key areas international, ecommerce, and small business. Right now our sights are set on an addressable transportation market totalling $550 billion worldwide. The majority of this opportunity lies outside of the United States where FedEx share has significant opportunity for growth. International is a clear opportunity for us with tremendous runway ahead.","As we integrate TNT and lower our costs to serve in Europe, we will be ideally positioned to gain share from the competition, the European team is gaining traction and accelerating the acquisition of parcel customers. Unfortunately, this momentum has been offset by reduction in industry air freight volumes between Europe and the United States.","In Europe, we are simplifying our pricing structures and are opening the valve for e-commerce for the first time ever to further stimulate growth. It is important to note that our European competitors have a larger ecommerce volume base, which insulates them from economic headwinds impacting commercial business. We are very excited about the e-commerce potential for our European business.","We are also creating new pricing and improving our value proposition between Asia and Europe. This is the largest trade lane in the world. Prior to the TNT acquisition, we did not have the European buyer base to pull this volume from Asia, as European payers make the majority of buying decisions in this lane.","Now shifting my focus to e-commerce, in reference to chart five on the IR site. In the U.S. more than 90% of incremental domestic parcel volume from 2018 to 2026 is expected to come from e-commerce period. This is why we are busy building a world class portfolio of solutions to best serve thousands of retailers in this space. We are very proud of the rapid innovation we have brought to e-commerce in the last three years and you can certainly expect more innovation in the months ahead.","On this same chart you'll see that more than 50% of the U.S. domestic e-commerce market is our addressable growth market with a CAGR of 12%. As the e-commerce market grows, so does the market for returns up 35% since 2015. Packages dropped off at our retail locations result in a higher pickup density and drive greater operational efficiency making FedEx even more competitive in the returns market. We're very excited about our network expansion with Dollar General. We will have 1,800 incremental locations open by peak. We also expect our [Technical difficulty] volume to reach a record high this holiday season.","Innovation and customer value are driving every decision we make when it comes to e-commerce. We are very excited about making everyday a delivery day with the launch of our Seven-Day service at FedEx Ground. We are already faster than the competition by at least one day in 26% of the lanes. This move will further speed up our network and allow us to continue to gain market share.","We are also building powerful relationships with many retailers and leveraging solutions like FedEx extra hours, and FedEx Ground zone one which is our local portfolio. Our local portfolio enables retailers to leverage local inventory and stores and DCs to take orders later in the day and still deliver them the next day.","We just forged a new strategic delivery partnership with Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods. The majority of their spend with us is on their e-commerce business by leveraging our portfolio of ground commercial, home delivery and express services. They are getting the product to their customers faster, which of course is paramount to them and to their business growth.","Another retailer we work closely with is Chewy. Chewy was one of the first home delivery customers that benefited from our Six-Day expansion. Due to their one to two-day shipping commitment and 24x7 operations, they are ready to take full advantage of our new Seven-Day service. Retailers and brands, large and small have recognized our commercial teams for their partnership and for our ability to help them grow their business and successful compete in the market.","Also e-commerce will continue to create great opportunities for our LTL business. Our new FedEx Freight Direct service moves large bulky items into consumer's homes and into businesses. Backed by the power of the FedEx brand and the speed and reliability of our nationwide priority network, we are able to reach over 80% of the U.S. population, and we have a unique ability to serve as a large part of this $10 billion market.","And of course, we can't forget about Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, who has recently been in three test markets, Memphis, Tennessee, Plano, Texas and Manchester, New Hampshire. Roxo was preparing to change the way on-demand e-commerce shipments make it to customer's doorsteps.","While these e-commerce investments benefit the broader market, I am particularly excited about how this strategy will support small and medium businesses, who remain our most profitable customers. In FY 2019 our small and medium businesses grew more than 8% and there is still a lot of room to grow as there are more than 32 million small businesses in the U.S.","Speaking of being there for small and medium businesses, we will not apply a residential peak surcharge this holiday season, a decision that has received outstanding feedback from countless small and medium sized customers. It's a great way to help make our customers the hero as e-commerce continues to grow and become a major part of their business.","Now let me turn the call over to Raj for his remarks.","Raj Subramaniam ","Thank you, Brie and good afternoon, everyone. As you are all aware, the global economic and trade environment remains very uncertain. Despite this uncertainty, FedEx remains committed to delivering long-term profitable growth. We are taking decisive actions to address the three topics that Fred covered in his opening.","Number one, reducing capacity, especially in our intercontinental network and overall reduction of costs in our Express business. Number two, completing TNT integration. And number three, leveraging our infrastructure at FedEx Ground and making targeted investment that allow us to successfully go all-in on e-commerce.","Let me talk about each of these in turn. First, capacity cuts and overall cost reduction at FedEx Express. We expect the current softness in air cargo demand to continue into calendar year 2020. As such, we will take action to reduce our intercontinental flights after our peak season to better match supply to demand. We have already decreased U.S. domestic flight hours and we will be aggressively looking for additional opportunities.","The Express team is intensely focused on overall cost reduction. This includes deferring non-critical hiring, limiting discretionary spending, and implementing structural costs initiatives such as the United States voluntary buyout program. In addition, we're looking at every opportunity to reduce capital spending, benefits from all these changes will be realized in the coming quarters.","Secondly, let me update you on TNT integration. Overall, I'm pleased to report that we have picked up the pace of integration and are continuing to improve our value proposition for our customers. Cross utilization of combined FedEx Express and TNT networks, which we share on our previous calls was a major step toward full integration of the operations. In June, these capabilities expanded across Europe. The transit time for FedEx intra-European economy parcel shipments improved by at least one business day on approximately 40% of the European lanes across the 28 countries in Europe. We are well on our way to achieving full Ground interoperability in our pickup and delivery networks in Europe by the end of May 2020.","Growing intercontinental packages into the combined European Ground network allows us to improve service, while simultaneously reducing our costs to serve. This will help us accelerate growth into Europe from all around the world. Asia-Europe lane, which remains the largest intercontinental trade lane is particularly important in this regard. Given our strong presence in APAC and significantly enhanced presence in Europe, we expect to gain share in this lane in the months and years to come.","Additionally, in Q1 we integrated customs clearance and brokerage services in Europe to provide a more seamless experience for our customers. This milestone ensures we are well prepared for Brexit no matter the outcome. Clearance integration is also very important for us to enable cross utilization of TNT road network for intercontinental shipments. And as mentioned on the previous call, Sales integration is practically complete. And now we are presenting a single phase to our customers nearly everywhere around the world.","And thirdly, e-commerce, Fred and Brie have discussed our robust portfolio. Let me now address the enhancements specifically underway within FedEx Ground, which is the backbone of our e-commerce strategy. FedEx Ground continues to transform the package delivery business in response to a growing market demand. Network investments including seven-day residential delivery, large package capabilities and SmartPost integration position us for future growth.","Leveraging the most automated network in the industry, we will once again offer seven day residential service to our customers throughout the peak season. After peak, the seven day residential delivery will become a permanent piece of our service offering. This will speed up our lanes throughout the week, and further extend our competitive advantage in some cases by two days.","We're also well underway in building our Ground\u2019s large package handling capabilities to accommodate items like TVs, tires and furniture. This includes dedicated large package facilities, plus new handling equipment in more than 30 of our existing stations prior to peak. ","In terms of SmartPost, the integration of that volume into our network directly addresses one of the biggest challenges in the industry density. From a cost perspective moving these packages to the same service providers already delivering Ground commercial and residential packages goes a long way in driving density up and driving the cost per delivery down.","Integrating this volume provide significant growth opportunities with thousands of entrepreneurs who run pickup and delivery businesses with FedEx Ground.","We\u2019ve already started transitioning SmartPost volume, majority of which will move during next calendar year. This should be complete before peak season in 2020. Investment in FedEx Ground was made and will continue to make in technology aim to optimize operations, reduce costs and enable real time decision making based on applied data analytics. We\u2019re offering our service providers new technology tools, so they can make decisions about how best to run their business each day in terms of staffing needs, vehicle load plans and optimize routes. Arming our employees and service providers with the state-of-the art tools expected to drive efficiency in FedEx Ground\u2019s operation, as well as the operations of service providers all the while strengthening the reliability of FedEx Ground service.","Several of these tools have started to be implemented in select markets prior to peak, immediate benefits will begin to be realized in fiscal year 2020, with increased benefits in the years to come. These investments will allow us to provide the speed and reliability our customers value, while offering market competitive prices as the low cost last mile provider. This means we are facing near-term headwinds including additional costs related to our service expansions and SmartPost volume integration. But these investments are necessary and will pay off in coming years.","And speaking of Last Mile, we\u2019re strategically working with a number of retailers to leverage their physical infrastructure with our transportation and logistic infrastructure to provide market leading value proposition for the end consumer. Interest from retailers remains very high in this regard.","In closing, as we approach another busy peak season shipping season, we are well prepared to once again deliver exceptional service to our customers. We expect record breaking volumes in multiple Mondays during the peak season. E-commerce growth continues, which in turns drives strong demand for residential delivery. Peak season is four day shorter this year and operational intensity remains the same.","We have been preparing in close collaboration with our customers all year. The FedEx team of more than 450,000 outstanding team members is the best in the business and is ready to deliver the holidays once again for our customers around the world.","In summary, the power of our network, coupled with the hard work and dedication of our global team sets us on a path of long-term profitable growth.","Now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf to provide details on our financials. Alan.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Raj and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter operating results were impacted by several factors. Weakening global trade and industrial production have resulted in less than expected demand for our most profitable Express package and Freight services. ","Express yields have also been negatively impacted due to the resulting mix shift, lower weight per package, and customer trade down to slower lower price services. These conditions are especially challenging in Europe, where capacity and network reductions are limited due to the current stage of integration as we are operating duplicate road and air networks.","FedEx Ground operating costs were higher due primarily to our expansion of operations to six days per week, higher purchase transportation costs attributable to volume growth and expansion to six day operations and higher self-insurance expenses. Each transportation segment had one fewer operating day in the first quarter versus the prior year, which is estimated to have lowered earnings by approximately $100 million.","The loss of volume from Amazon had a negative impact to the quarter. Operating costs including depreciation also increased with strategic investment programs, including the modernization of FedEx Express aircraft and hubs and investment in technology across the enterprise that will further optimize our networks, as well as enhanced safety and capabilities.","The modernization of our aircraft fleet lowers costs through enhanced reliability, reduced maintenance costs, and improve fuel efficiency. Partially offsetting these negative factors were the benefits from an approximate $300 million decrease in variable incentive compensation, FedEx Ground volume growth of 7%, increased revenue per shipment at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground and cost reductions from business realignment activities, including the U.S. voluntary employee buyout initiated last year.","Looking ahead to the rest of fiscal 2020, we are now forecasting adjusted earnings per share of $11 to $13 per share. The new forecast reflects our lowered revenue outlook, driven by increasing trade tensions, and the corresponding weakening in global economic conditions, especially industrial production that has occurred since our June earnings release. With the increasing uncertainty of trade negotiations and government policies, forecasting customer demand and our corresponding earnings is exceedingly difficult.","Our forecasts assume moderate U.S. economic growth, current fuel price expectations and no further weakening in international economic conditions. A further ramping and anti-trade measures and\/or adverse changes in international trade policies and relations would likely drive additional weakness in our business. While our current expectation is to earn slightly above the midpoint of our $11 to $13 range, we believe the range is appropriate given the current macro and business conditions we are experiencing. ","In addition to the impact of macro uncertainty, FedEx Ground operating expenses are expected to be higher than our previous forecast due to volume mix, lower than planned delivery density, higher wage rates and ongoing investments to enhance our e-commerce capabilities, including our expansion to seven day operations. The new forecast also reflects the loss of FedEx Ground business from Amazon that began in August.","Our FY 2020 effective tax rate prior to the year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustment is now expected to increase 24% to 26% due to lower than expected earnings in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. In response to these issues, we are taking additional actions on a number of fronts to better align our costs, including post peak reductions to the global FedEx Express air network.","We continue to expect to incur $350 million of TNT integration expenses in FY 2020 and $1.7 billion in total through FY 2021. We also continue to expect FY 2020 capital spending to be approximately $5.9 billion. While it's early in the process, we anticipate FY 2021 capital spending will be similar to FY 2020.","During the first quarter, we issued $2.1 billion of debt. We use the proceeds to redeem debt maturing in this fiscal year, as well as to contribute $1 billion into our pension plans. We do not expect to make additional contributions to our U.S. pension plans this fiscal year. We also have no material debt maturities prior to fiscal 2022.","In conclusion, we are taking actions to mitigate the effects of macroeconomic uncertainty. However, we are continuing to make strategic investments to improve our capabilities and efficiency, which we expect will drive long-term growth of earnings, margins, cash flow and returns. ","Now the operator can begin the question-and-answer session.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to just talk about the reduction in guidance and get a little bit specific if we could. If you think about the difference of where you were three months ago versus where you are today, it kind of equates to almost a $900 million write down in the operating profit of the business this fiscal year. So if you give us a little bit more specific sort of buckets breakdown, what may be the lower revenues based on macro? And then maybe what may be caused by higher costs associated with certain restructuring the network to adapt to e-commerce that would be very helpful.","Alan Graf","Chris, I would say that the vast majority this 900 is the reduction of our revenue forecasts associated with the macroeconomic conditions that we did not expect. Some of the cost increases that you are seeing did have some impact, but the main reason was the macro. The biggest impact, of course, was at Express, and that was in international with a large degree of that in Europe.","Operator","We'll hear next from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group ","Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. So this is I think, the fifth straight quarter of either missing or cutting -- missing numbers or cutting guidance. Are you approaching guidance any differently meaning taking a more conservative approach here. Anything that you think that gives you some confidence or us some confidence that this is the final cut? ","And then I separately just want to understand, Raj, you said we're doing everything we can to reduce capital spending, and yet, CapEx is staying unchanged and now flat next year as well. So can you help us understand that? I know that's two questions, but hope we need some hand holding here I think.","Alan Graf","Scott, I'll take on both. The lack of being able to hit our forecast is just the difficulty associated with forecasting in this environment. I don't think, we've been too aggressive based on what we knew at the time. You have noticed that, we've widen the range this year and I did mention that our current point estimate is higher than the midpoint of that range, so we've given ourselves a little bit more downside. I also said that we don't -- we're not expecting any additional weaknesses in the international macro environment from where we are today, which is a wild card. So I just want to point those things now to.","As far as CapEx, trust me, FY 2021 would be a lot higher than $5.9 billion have we not started cutting already. I think there are two things that are really important to understand. And number one is, we have to continue to modernize the fleet. The profound impact of the lower costs and higher reliability of the new twins is just remarkable. And we're going to continue to do that, we're going to maybe stretch it out a bit, but not much because the faster we can get those in there, the faster we can enjoy those benefits.","Fred mentioned the number of aircraft that we're going to take out a service either fully retiring or parking, so we're not adding capacity in our international network. And in fact, we're reducing that and we're reducing our domestic flight hours. But we need to modernize the fleet. It's very important. ","Secondarily, on the hubs at Express, where they\u2019re underway, we have a lot of things that are committed. But the improved automation and processing capabilities of those two hubs when we finish are also profound in terms of the productivity and the amount of throughput we can handle. And we anticipate that we're going to need that. If we get further deterioration in the macro environment or we see something in the U.S., that looks like a recession, we\u2019ll definitely cut further, but those are our plans at the moment.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear next from Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Hey guys, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Can you quantify the P&L benefits from the capacity and cost actions you announced this afternoon. And I guess from a bigger picture perspective, why are these capacity adjustments only being made now when it feels like we've been facing more challenging trade and industrial production trends since last December, what's prevented you from taking these actions before today? Thank you.","Fred Smith","Let me take a shot at that. This is Fred Smith speaking. First of all, I think it's important to look at the things that we've said over the last few earnings call in the context of about what's going on globally. I mean, I watch the business press every day and I have to tell you, I think there's a lot of whistling past the graveyard about the U.S. consumer and the United States economy versus what's going on globally.","So, the serious trade dispute began in the spring of 2018 and they escalated throughout the summer of 2018. And most people don't think about the fact that when China slows down because of U.S. tariffs or uncertainty or for whatever reason, as big of a victim, if you want to call it that, of the China slowdown is Europe, because Germany's contraction is because they're not selling as much to China, which is a huge customer of Europe.","So remember, last spring, there was a tremendous amount of euphoria when we were going to get a deal, China trade deal. And then at the last minute, it broke up and then over the period of the summer there have been escalating tariffs on both sides and increasingly lowered industrial production and that's why we\u2019ve put those charts up on the IR website.","So we're reacting inside of FedEx to the same thing. So as we went into the fiscal year, we were hopeful of a trade deal and some sort of restoration of normalcy that has not taken place. And the U.S. consumer, which is a remarkable driver of growth in employment, and all the things that are spoken about every day, sort of mass the fact that the goods producing sector, which we're in the midst of is much more global in nature than the U.S. consumer, which is largely services and certain consumption.","So that's the reason that we began the year the way we began it, and should we have moved faster or known faster or what have you, I mean all I can do is report the numbers as we see them. And I would point out to you that last fall, we were the first people that call this out. And I remember very vividly. I mean, we are the leading prognosticator of this, we have 15 million votes every day in our system. And I remember when we made this call on CNBC, they took our heads off that we were, \u201cblaming someone.\u201d We're just reporting what's going on and reacting to these macroeconomic things. And as Alan said, that's why it makes us so hard to forecast. We think we've taken appropriate steps. We'll do more if we have to, but I can't give any better answer than what I just did.","Operator","And from Barclays, we'll move on to Brandon Oglenski.","Brandon Oglenski","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So Fred, I guess coming off of that, I mean, clearly you guys have a culture of forward innovation and growth at FedEx. But I guess On the flip side, is there any like real ingrained process of the company that says, hey, we need to challenge every day what isn't working, because maybe even outside of these cyclical pressures. ","I mean, if you look at your LTL business, we can benchmark to other carriers that do better. Obviously, Express margins are at quite a low point right now. And you look at logistics or like FedEx Office, which we don't think have contributed a lot in the past. So, I guess, what can you tell investors that is the process for looking at things that maybe didn't pan out quite as well as you thought?","Fred Smith","Well, I think you're a great person to ask that Brandon because you\u2019re so called the deep dive, so let's talk about LTL. I don't think we have John Smith here to here today. First of all, there are other carriers that do better than FedEx with the exclusion of perhaps a little smaller carriers and ones sort of I'm not familiar with, I believe the better way to put that is there's one LTL carrier that does better than we do. And that's Old Dominion, and we're great admirers of Old Dominion. ","But Old Dominion operates a network that has I believe somewhere in the 200 and some odd stations, versus our 360. They don't deliver every day to every part of the United States. And they've been very brilliant in finding a niche that's for lack of a better term near TL. It's in that zone between LTL and TL and their average weight per shipment in much more dense network is about 350-400 pounds higher.","So their margins are outstanding, and they have terrific and obviously, we benchmark them carefully as our other competitors, which gets to you your point, do we ever think about doing things differently? And the answer to that question is we think about doing things differently constantly. ","Secondly, in the Express business, there is a belief, including you, Brandon, that somehow our Express operation in the United States is not profitable. Our Express operation in United States is very profitable. And we have some of the best industrial engineers and operations research people in the country. ","So there has been this constant mantra for 10 years that we ought to put Express and Ground together. Well, my goodness, we\u2019ve gained market share in Ground for 19 out of 20 years. And Brie and Raj just told you we think it's going to continue and our competitive advantage is going to improve. So we're very convinced that the way that we are operating is the preferred way. And yes, we look at it at it every day.","The third thing that gets people fired up. And I guess, Scott Group just mentioned it about CapEx is we are profligate in terms of CapEx. The reality is about $0.60 out of every dollar we're spending on CapEx are to modernize the Express hubs, to put in this new technology, we can't get people in Indianapolis and Memphis to work it. They're not out there plus it improves the productivity. So the failure to do it would be very dire.","And as Alan has said, and we've said over and over again, every time we bring on a 767 and to a much lesser degree, the 777 because we're not buying many other of them. It's accretive to earnings, the reliability goes up. So could we stop buying 767, and 777s? Yes, why don't we stop buying them, because we put a chart on the earnings -- the IR website today that showed the synergy between the three major OpCos. So 80% of our customers buy all three of the services.","So, if you took FedEx and tried to subject it, let's say to I think it was BCG that came up to that diagram, you have dogs and cash flows and one thing or another. If you did not improve the Express company, unless your costs get out of control, you couldn't win in the Ground sector and vice versa.","So, we are very convinced and we put up a chart that specifically addressed your comments about this, FedEx will unquestionably be the low cost producer in the domestic Express business because of the fleet modernization and that includes any new entrance into the business. ","Yes, we have higher pilot costs and AMT costs perhaps, than the third-party providers. We think that's a good thing. But our total productivity and our cost per tonne mile are down 2% over the past 10 years, in this year's dollars. I'm not talking about inflated dollars, I'm talking about 2019 dollars are 2% less than 2009 dollars.","So the fleet modernization, yes, we could stop it and yes, we could stop that CapEx, but the competitive positioning against our major competitors.","And the last thing I'm going to say is, we basically compete in an ecosphere that's got five entities in it. There's UPS, there's DHL, there's a US Postal Service, and now increasingly, there is Amazon. That's who we wake up every day, trying to think about how we compete against and give the best services to our sales force.","So, it reminds me of my days in the service where you run all these fake manoeuvres one thing another, it's a lot different when you got competition on the other side. So we try to beat these folks, UPS, and in particular has a very strong retail presence and both UPS and DHL have significant forwarding presences. So we\u2019ve decided that we would basically cover those portfolio gaps with more focused capabilities, and that's why we operate differently.","We carry retail freight on our purple tails and interline it, we don't have a huge forwarding operation. And we have a retail network that is smaller than UPS store franchise network, but utilizes partners as Brie talked to you about Walgreens, and dollar -- more recently Dollar General and some others. ","So the reason I'm going on about this, I'm not quite sure how this mantra got started, that we're hard hitted, or we're not willing to look, we'll look at anything. But what we can\u2019t do is to change the reality of the math. We can't make the competition go away, I wish they would, just leave the field, they're very good operators.","And the third thing that we have to deal with is the macroeconomic environment. And by the way, there's no company and no person that has been more vocal in our opposition to the trade policies that we are pursuing. Now, to be fair, I think it's not just the U.S., I think China is also pursuing bad trade policy. So you're taking a system over the last seven years that\u2019s drawn more people out of poverty than in the entire previous history of the world, and essentially putting it all at risk.","So these numbers on these macroeconomic production indicators, we didn't make those up. That's what's going on. So I apologize for the length of the response. But it's to this continuing drumbeat that somehow we're not willing to look at something and you take selective things like your LTL operation in as good as, all the others, it's not as good as one and it's not as good as the other ones in terms of margins for the reasons that I gave you. So it's important to look at this thing with those contexts in mind.","Next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll hear now from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks, good afternoon. So you talked a lot about the short-term cost inflation at Ground and driving down the cost of delivery longer term. I think you've done a pretty good job of explaining that to the market. But it sounds like you're also seeing some unexpected costs creep, higher wage rates, lower delivery density so forth. So, I guess, could you help us understand some kind of timeline for when we should expect to see some of the operating leverage and inflection of margins at the Ground segment, is fiscal 2021 the right way to think about it or do we need to look further out than that? Thank you.","Alan Graf","I like your Ground margins, I think they're fine. And I think we told you early on in the intro, Allison, as at least it goes to zone one where we think we're going to grow really rapidly. We're talking about lower yields and higher margins. So I think Ground performing admittedly. The issue at Ground is there's just not the commercial traffic we'd plan to have, which has significantly higher density than home delivery does. Home delivery is growing like crazy and the commercial businesses not because of industrial production, and all the other things we said.","So that's a fairly simple explanation. We're adjusting the model accordingly to do that. I think Ground\u2019s in great shape. I think it's doing fantastic. And I don't see anybody making better margins than us.","Fred Smith","Let me let me make one comment here, and then Raj and or Henry Maier, the CEO of FedEx Ground is sitting here so he can speak to this too, Allison. First thing that people need to understand the things we announced this spring and this summer, we just didn't dream them up in the last few months. ","We've been working on these for almost four years. And during that period of time, we have invested enormous amount of money in IT, which has been dragged through the P&L to make sure that I can make a statement and let me make it again because I think it may have gone over some people's heads.","We will in the short zone market, the zone one market, the ship from store or ship from local DC, FedEx will be the low cost, high service producer, you can put the traffic in very, very late in night or in the morning and at lower cost than anybody and I mean anybody, all of the five competitors that I mentioned a moment ago.","So all of these moves that we announced were triggered by a series of developments. And the strategy has been in production for a long time. So we're very confident about where this market is going that Brie described to you and we're very confident in Ground\u2019s position. But as Alan just mentioned, the B2B Ground business is being adversely affected for the same reason that the international PMI is going down.","The trade effects and the goods production side of the house is much greater than it is in the services business. And that's being reflected across all our businesses; Freight, Ground Commercial, and particularly International. Henry, Raj?","Raj Subramaniam ","Well, let me just add on to that by just saying that there's a strong divergence between the strong consumer sector and the weak factory sector around the world and U.S. as being no exception. That the industrial production in U.S. is expected to be flat to negative in the second half of CY 2019 that's the issue and once we get the commercial traffic -- that's the issue. Ground is doing very, very well. And we are definitely investing for the future and we are going to have the market leading value proposition, best service at low cost. So let me turn it over to Henry for his comment.","Henry Maier","Allison, let me just add cost headwinds at Ground are largely six and seven-day, because there's a minimum number of people and to staff a billing in order to operate it prior to the volume and revenue coming on. The wage rate issue is a number of things. First is year-over-year driver rates, which are reflective of the intense competition for truck drivers in certain geographic markets, both in PMD and line haul.","However, what we see going forward, as we transition out of the current model into the independent service provider model, which will be completely stood up on October 12th is annual, if not multi-year negotiations with those businesses about the rate -- about their settlement rates. ","Finally, we've talked about the robust labor environment out there. There are geographic markets, where it's highly competitive to get package handlers into the building. And while our automated network benefits us greatly in that regard for employees, where we're competing for the same unskilled labor in the market we have to be cost competitive. And that's just a function of the strength of the economy and the markets we operate in.","Operator","And from Goldman Sachs we move to Jordan Alliger. ","Jordan Alliger","Yes. Hi, guys. Just sort of from a big picture standpoint, can you remind a little bit what your long-term earnings or profit growth targets would be sort of once we get past this noise? And perhaps assess the ability of things to bounce back. Assuming the economy is okay, and assuming you implement the cost initiatives and the capacity initiatives that you do. Do you anticipate as we look into fiscal 2021 and 2022, that sort of growth can exceed sort of that long-term EPS growth target? Thanks.","Fred Smith","It depends on your outlook for the economy for sure. I mean, we said we're going to be really well positioned by the end of 2021. Yes, we were late and over budget on the TNT integration, but we're there we're will be there. And I don't know what the economic environment in Europe will be at that point, but we will be able to significantly reduce our costs and improve our service for all the reasons we've told you about. That's one.","Two, some of the things that we've talked about at Ground, like the loss of Amazon, getting ready for six and seven day, a lot of that stuff will be behind us. And we'll be ready to move forward. So given a decent economic environment, we ought to be able to easily hit our 10% to 15% earnings EPS growth going forward. But I can't tell you that that's going to be the case because I can't tell you what exactly the economy is going to look like right now. So if I'm a little gun shy, yes, probably I\u2019m.","Operator","Moving on to David Ross with Stifel.","David Ross","Yes. Good afternoon. Maybe a question for Mark, with Assembly Bill 5 out in California, I know since the extradition and refining [ph] the independent contractor model and now are moving towards an all ISP model. Is there anything in that proposed bill that could challenge the current ISP model or how are you guys viewing that right now?","Henry Myer","Hey, David, it\u2019s Henry Myer. I've been designated the company paralegal for this call. Let me get it up -- let me give the people listening in a little bit of background on Assembly Bill 5. Back on April 30, 2018, The California Supreme Court issued a ruling in the dynamics case, which held an ABC test should be used to determine whether a worker who is an employee or an independent contractor. Assembly Bill 5 is just an attempt by the legislature to codify the dynamics decision of the Supreme Court.","For those who aren't aware, there are a number of states that have ABC test, the A prong says an individual must be free of control and direction. The B prong a service has to be performed outside the usual course of business of the employer. And the C prong is the individual is customarily engage in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business. ","This is intended to address individuals who are classified as independent contractors. We believe it's largely directed at the ride sharing and food delivery business in California. And because FedEx Ground only contracts with businesses that are incorporated in a good standing in the states in which they operate. We therefore have no individuals who are classified as independent contractors.","All service provider employees under contract to FedEx Ground are subject to tax withholdings and are eligible for workers comp unemployment insurance and over time. And all of our service providers are contractually obligated to treat their workers as employees are registered as I said, in a good standing with the states and agreed to compliance audits by the company.","So therefore, we think that any risks that would accrue to FedEx Ground would be minimal to non-existent the way the bill is currently structured.","Operator","Helane Becker with Cowen & Company has our next question. ","Helane Backer","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Thank you very much for the time. Brie, I think you talked about demand from China being down between China and the U.S. and China and Europe. But did you speak at all to goods going from China to third countries? And then how those volumes are doing, for example, China to Vietnam and then Vietnam to the U.S. or Taiwan or places elsewhere in Asia. So maybe you could talk about trends you're seeing and goods moving that way, if at all?","Brie Carere","So great question, obviously, right now, from an outlook perspective, we are seeing pressure on all intercontinental and even within Asia, all of intra-Asia really is connected from a supply chain perspective. So even if it isn't direct to China, we are seeing a lot of pressure intra-Asia. What I think is most important to note, is we both Raj and I mentioned, is we are under penetrated from a market share perspective between Asia and Europe and Europe to Asia. ","We now have unleashed an incredible buyer base in Europe which we never had access to before and we have traditionally been very underpenetrated in this lane, and Jill and I are locked arm and arm to grow share despite the macroeconomic headwinds. So I think that's really what's most important. And that's what's newsworthy for us as we think about growth moving forward.","Operator","And from Oppenheimer, we\u2019ll move to Scott Schneeberger.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good afternoon. [Technical difficulty] in international priority and international economy in the environment and perhaps provide a perspective on the influence of fuel prices and the trade down dynamic, if and how that may factor into this updated guidance? Thanks.","Raj Subramaniam ","Scott, fuel prices have very little to do with this at this point. And I think there\u2019s a macroeconomic environment and primarily the industrial sector of the global economy that's driving that change.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Bernstein Research, David Vernon.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking our question asking on behalf of David Vernon, how should we think about the greater than 20% increase in corporate center loss? And is there any outlook there?","Fred Smith","Well, we have moved FedEx Office out to its own now, as you noticed, and while FedEx Office itself for reporting purposes, reports a loss gives you that as a channel cost, if you like. It's a vital channel and we've talked about this over and over and over again, our most profitable packages come through FedEx Office, FedEx Office has got many, many places where you can pick up, drop off great relationship going with in-store at Walmart.","So, I wouldn't be too concerned about that we have work to do on our logistics side of the house, we are working very hard on that. And I expect those will improve over time. But really at the end of the day, the real -- again, the real issue, I want to make sure I get this clear to everybody. All the things we've talked about. Our issue is international at Express.","Operator","Now from Deutsche Bank will move to Amit Mehrotra.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just wanted to ask if you think 2020 will represent a trough in Ground margins that you can build on in 2021 given the, I guess, the SmartPost integration? And then can you just update us on the integration of TNT businesses in the UK, France and Germany? Where are those countries, given their size and when do you expect the integration to be complete for those regions? Thank you.","Fred Smith","I think that was two. I think, we've answered them both, but I'll try to stab at this again. We will be complete with those countries at the end of May 2020. Again, as you have well pointed out in your note, we were a little bit late, a little bit over budget on that. Thank you for that.","And as far as FedEx Ground margins, again, we will have a lot of these things behind us, it will depend on our mix and economic environment about how fast we can move margins up, but we do expect our zone one traffic to grow rapidly and although at lower yield it will be at higher margins.","Operator","And with that at this time, I'd like to turn things back to you, to offer any additional or closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in the FedEx Corporation first quarter earnings conference call. Feel free to call anyone on the Investor Relations team, if you have additional questions about FedEx. Thank you very much.","Operator","Again, that will conclude today's conference.

Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Mickey. Good morning, and welcome to the discussion of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2015. We had a very successful peak season as volumes grew across all our transport segments. We believe our strategy is sound, our culture is unique, and our customers value our broad portfolio of business solutions. Our profit improvement programs are moving ahead as scheduled.","In addition to providing great service during peak, the FedEx team demonstrated outstanding execution during a demanding quarter that included the Chinese New Year, Valentine's Day, tough winter weather and labor disruptions in West Coast ports. Last month FedEx was again recognized as one of the most admired companies in the world and number one in the delivery industry by FORTUNE magazine. We believe this reflects our team's dedication to our Purple Promise, which is simply stated: I will make every FedEx experience outstanding.","I'd like to welcome our GENCO teammates to FedEx now that the acquisition is complete. GENCO's industry-leading supply chain expertise will help FedEx service offerings in rapidly growing markets such as e-commerce, healthcare, and technology. I'd also like to welcome a familiar face, Mike Ducker, our former President of FedEx International and COO of FedEx Express, to his first earnings call as CEO of FedEx Freight.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike Glenn and then to Alan Graf. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Thank you, Fred. I'd like to open by recognizing our team members who delivered a record-breaking peak season and outstanding service through a series of challenges during the quarter, including winter weather, shifts in demand due to significant disruptions at the West Coast ports, among other issues. FedEx was once again able to standout in service, thanks to our long-term planning, differentiated and flexible networks, use of technology and automation, and very close collaboration with our customers. All of these factors allowed us to provide excellent service and results during the quarter.","On the economic front, we see moderate growth in the global economy anchored by the U.S. where continued improvements in fundamentals will support real GDP growth around 3% for the next several quarters. Our annual U.S. GDP forecast is 3.1% growth for calendar 2015 and 3.1% growth in calendar 2016. We expect industrial production growth of 3.8% this year and 3.6% in calendar 2016. Global economic growth is expected to broaden with the U.S. and other developed markets leading the way. We expect global growth of 2.8% in calendar 2015 and 3.1% in calendar 2016.","Now let me make a few comments regarding the company's yield performance by segment. In the Express domestic segment, excluding the impact of fuel, we saw yields grow 1.5%, primarily due to rate and discounts. In the Ground segment, excluding SmartPost and the impact of fuel, we saw yields increase 3.7%, driven primarily by rate and discount and surcharges. SmartPost yield increased 9.9% year over year without fuel, driven by changing customer mix and rates.","In the International Export segment, excluding fuel, yield per package decreased 0.8%, primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange rates, which offset positive weight, rate, and discount changes. And finally in Freight, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 4.9%, being driven by rate and discount changes, changes in weight per shipment, and shipment class.","And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf for some comments.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone.","We had another outstanding quarter as our earnings per share grew 63% to $2.01. Corporate margin rose 250 basis points year over year to 8.2%. Revenue grew 4% to $11.7 billion from increased volumes and notably higher base yield. Our sales team continues to do a terrific job of improving base yields.","Operating results include a significant net benefit from fuel and less severe winter weather this year than last year, partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation accruals, which result from our improved financial performance. Share repurchases had an $0.11 year-over-year positive impact on earnings per share for the quarter. And during the quarter, we issued $2.5 billion of senior unsecured debt at very attractive rates.","At Express, operating income increased 129% to $384 million and operating margin increased 330 basis points year over year, driven by base revenue growth, a positive net impact for fuel, constrained expense growth from our profit improvement initiatives, a lower year-over-year weather impact, and reduced pension expense. These factors were partially offset by higher variable incentive compensation accruals and aircraft maintenance expense.","U.S. domestic volumes increased 4%, including a 5% growth in overnight box. International export volumes increased 1%.","Turning to Ground, revenues increased 12% to $3.4 billion from volume and yield growth at Ground and yield growth at SmartPost, partially offset by lower volumes at SmartPost. Ground's average daily volume increased 7% from continued growth in our commercial business and home delivery service.","Operating income increased 14% to $558 million. Higher revenue per package and volumes, positive net impact of fuel, and a lower year-over-year weather impact were the main factors. This increase was partially offset by higher network expansion cost as we continued to invest heavily in our high-margin high-ROIC growing Ground businesses.","Looking at Freight, Freight had another great quarter with 94% higher operating income and operating margin up 220 basis points on 6% higher revenue year over year. Freight's operating income and operating margin benefited from higher less-than-truckload revenue per shipment and 3% higher average daily LTL shipments.","During the quarter, FedEx closed on the GENCO and Bongo International acquisitions, expanding our portfolio in e-commerce and supply chain solutions. Both were included in our results from the dates of acquisition, and neither had a material impact on the quarter.","As we look at the outlook, based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about, we project earnings per share of $8.80 to $8.95 for FY 2015. Variable incentive compensation accruals will continue to increase as our financial performance improves.","Overall, we continue to remain on track with our profit improvement plans and expect to deliver record earnings this fiscal year and again next year. We have tremendous momentum. I'm very proud of the outstanding performance that our team members delivered despite a challenging peak season again this year and would like to thank each one of them for their dedication and their contribution to these terrific results.","Now we'll open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Mike, Henry, great job in terms of the yield performance at Ground. Could you talk a little bit about how the impact of DIM pricing, how that played out into the 3.7% yield improvement that the segment had achieved? And how we should be thinking about the DIM weight tailwind for the fiscal fourth quarter, and then over the next couple years, how much of the contracts will be flowing in annually in 2016 as well as 2017?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Rob, this is Mike. Obviously, the dimensional weight pricing decision that we made had an impact. But it's important to note that it was only in effect two of the three months. It was not in effect during the month of December. And I'd say a couple of things. The dimensional weight charge is important because we announced it so early, we gave lot of customers time to adjust packaging, and we were quite pleased at customers who took advantage of that. We worked with many of them through our packaging lab to help them get more efficient packaging. But at the same time, for those packages that were oversized, we were able to capture the dimensional weight charge and that was important to us. But again, it only had an impact two of the three months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair.","Nate J. Brochmann - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I want to talk a little bit with obviously the stronger dollar, I would assume that the import activity is probably picking up a little bit. And we had gone through such a period of time where we were out of balance on the international networks. I was just wondering if you could talk about where the balance lies now with some of the adjustments and the trade patterns and what you're seeing on more of a global basis.","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","This is Mike Glenn again. Obviously, the U.S. dollar strengthened versus the euro over the past several weeks, and we started to see some impact on freight to and from the U.S. However, I would say it's still a bit early to talk about significant shifts in trade patterns and we'll have a better understanding of that in the weeks and months ahead and can probably speak more about that in the fourth quarter.","David J. Bronczek - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","This is Dave Bronczek. We did have \u2013 because of the port issue, we did have \u2013 because of the nature of our portfolio we had more time definite freight coming across from the Pacific into the United States as well, to add to Mike's comments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to maybe talk about the guidance a little bit. So the full year is implying something in the high single-digit earnings growth range in Q4, which is meaningfully lower than what the current consensus has dialed in. So I was wondering if you could help us walk through some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about? It seems like it may be more on the cost side in terms of the incentive comp accruals, FX and possibly maybe a fuel headwind? So I was hoping you could help us walk through that.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Allison, it's Alan. And yes, you're pretty much right on there. As we continue to improve our financial performance it's important that we also improve our compensation programs. Our incentive compensation programs have not been funded at the target levels for quite a long time. And so we're trying to make sure that we have the right balance there so that will be a headwind. We had a significant benefit in quarter three from fuel. Given where oil prices are today, I don't expect to have much benefit at all in the fourth quarter and perhaps a slight headwind there.","And Forex certainly is having an impact on our revenues, particularly our international domestic businesses and those that are profitable are translating into less profit. That's also a little bit of a headwind. So I think overall it's just an anomaly between Q3 and Q4. And I would encourage everybody to continue to think about the momentum that we have in our base business. I gave you for the first time that I can remember a projection for FY2016 that we will have again record earnings and of course we'll have a lot more to say about that when we talk to you at the end of the year.","Allison M. Landry - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Benjamin Hartford with Baird.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. Just looking at GENCO and I'm interested in your perspective to what degree we should expect contribution in the fourth quarter and whether the fourth quarter contribution within the Ground segment for GENCO is representative of what we should think about the net profit contribution from that acquisition on an annualized basis. Can you provide some perspective there?","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Ben, this is Henry Maier. Let me say a couple of things about GENCO. First of all, let me tell you about how they fit within the Ground portfolio. They are a leader in lifecycle management, particularly in the dispositioning of returns which is something that our e-commerce customers have asked us for, for some time. And as a result that that business plus their fulfillment and packaging capabilities for both business-to-business and business-to-consumer customers complement our portfolio. We think that there's significant transportation opportunities in their business.","And looking at this acquisition going forward, we believe that it's a great add to the FedEx portfolio. In the near term, I would say that we've got probably 12 months to 18 months of integration facing us going forward. There will be some costs associated with that integration. We don't expect any of those to be material, but we've had them in the family here for about four weeks and I can tell you everything we've seen, we're more excited about this than we were even as we went through the process.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. If I can get a follow up in there. I mean is it fair to think that during that integration phase that you talked about the accretion is going to be minimal. But once we get beyond the integration phase 12 months to 18 months from now we should see clear accretion from the transaction from a profit perspective?","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Yes.","Ben J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Alan, just following up on your comments regarding the question on guidance. It sounds like you're suggesting fourth quarter is a little bit of an anomaly in terms of the rated growth. When you think about sort of the progress towards the profit improvement plan, are we still sort of sticking to the $1.2 billion run rate coming out of this year and then sort of a full $1.6 billion as we exit fiscal 2016? Just want to get a rough sense of maybe how we should be thinking about that progress towards the improvement plan?","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","We're sticking with that. We're very confident at least where we are right now. We're watching a couple of things. Certainly we're watching the international economic picture, which we need to maintain about where it is and there are lot of wildcards out there in terms of Europe and China for example. But we have done a fabulous job on our cost. I think if you just take a look at Express and you see flat revenue and a huge improvement in operating profit, while some of that was fuel, a lot of that was improved productivity and great cost performance. So we have that going for us. And as I said, we have a lot of momentum. And so as of today we are on track.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just add to that. Alan's right, our profit improvement is on track and it's on target. You can see in all of our numbers that the constrained growth of our expenses actually helped drive the 333 basis point improvement because overall revenue was flat for the quarter because of exchange in fuel surcharge.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. I'm curious about in Ground, a two-part question. You mentioned B2B was also quite strong in addition to B2C, if you could address that. And then just in SmartPost, I think we're near the anniversary of the turnover of the customer. Could you speak to margins on that? Thanks.","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Scott, this is Henry Maier. Our revenue in the third quarter was pretty strong both in B2B and B2C. We had an unusual peak this year. We were busy at the beginning, we were busy at the end; things were little light in the middle. We saw customers this year stay in SmartPost much longer than we've ever seen them stay in SmartPost before in a peak season. So I guess that would be my comments on that. I didn't hear the second part of the question. Was it concerning SmartPost?","Scott A. Schneeberger - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","SmartPost and the anniversary of the customer turnover and what you foresee in the quarters to come with regard to yield and volume. Thanks.","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Let me just say this. The one customer that's been responsible for most of the revenue and volume impact at SmartPost has been in and out of that business. So I think, it's a little difficult to forecast where we go from here. I can tell you without that customer in the mix, SmartPost volumes grew 14% quarter over-quarter. So we're seeing pretty significant growth and strength in the core business there, and I think that's the way you need to think about it going forward.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We have an e-mail question from David Campbell of Thompson Davis. We have a substantially different scenario than last year with the West Coast port disruption and much lower fuel prices. Do these events change the company's view that air freight will grow much less than sea freight especially in the Trans-Pacific trade?","I think that's really hard to see given the appreciation of the dollar against the number of the foreign currencies and lower fuel prices. I think on the margin obviously elasticities will make people use air more than they would have otherwise. But having said that, since the great recession, the big trend has been a de-coupling of world trade growth from world GDP growth, which prior to that time was about 2 times, 2.5 times GDP growth, and now it's actually on parity or a little bit lower.","And then the third thing is the main thing that drives things that go by air versus sea is value per pound or perishability or something of that nature. And the reality is that most manufactured products are going down in terms of value per pound, particularly electronics, which account for about half of all the tonnage moved by air. So I don't think that things are going to change materially because of these things, but it could on the margin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.","Kelly A. Dougherty - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I just had actually two quick follow-ups on earlier ones. Alan, I think you said you're on track for that run rate of $1.2 billion by the end of this year. Can you give us a sense of how much you've already got in the bank, and maybe how much it is cost versus revenue linked? And then I guess the other one was just following up on peak, you guys obviously seem to have a pretty smooth time this year, I'm just wondering what it is about the individualities of the FedEx network that you think positions you well for what just looks like it's going to become a more peakier process going forward? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Kelly, I'm pretty confident that we've got that between the fourth quarter and the first three quarters of FY 2016 that, that 75% is there. It's certainly different components than when we talked about it back in October of 2012. I think, it's been a little bit less on the volume side, but as Mike mentioned and I also mentioned, we've done a fabulous job with yield management, which has really helped. And I think if you again take a look at Express's results in the quarter they show that we can improve our profitability without a big volume growth rate, and that was one of the keys and that will be one of the keys next year as well. So pretty confident, and then I'll turn it over to Dave for his comments.","David J. Bronczek - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","Thanks, Kelly. It's a great question, and Alan is right on the profit improvement plan, we're right on track, very pleased with our results. Some of it did come in more expense than revenue quite frankly, but we're very pleased with that. But I loved your second part of your question, I want to take the time to thank our Express team that did a fabulous job, we think it might have been our best Christmas peak that we've ever had for service to our customers, and of course, the financial results came in right on top of it. So thanks for the question. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Kelly, let me make a couple of comments. I would characterize peak as anything, but smooth. We saw significant demand shift across the entire period with less specific demand on any given day such as Black Friday or cyber Monday, and that was a change in historical trends. Obviously we had labor issues on the ports that impacted retailers ability to get inventory where and when they needed it. Certainly that had an impact on our operations. As Henry noted before, we saw SmartPost usage continue further into the peak season than we have historically seen.","Having said that, on that backdrop, there are a couple important points to make. The structure of our operations with separate air and ground networks provides us a very unique advantage. And our ability with our solutions team working with our operating companies and very closely with our customers did a phenomenal job adjusting our networks and operations to take advantage of the opportunities and provide outstanding service. So I would characterize it as a challenging peak with outstanding execution by our teams, which enabled us to deliver the results that we did.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James.","Art W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning, everyone. Congrats on the quarter. Just, Fred, you've talked a lot lately about your concerns about this growing trend of protectionism around the world. Can you talk about that right now, if you've seen any sea change in the direction of that over the last six, nine months?","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. I think protectionism over the last several years after the Great Recession has been very concerning. We have an email question here in a minute about this Open Skies dispute. And the letter that Dave Bronczek wrote, of course, we're very much in support of continuation of Open Skies, so I'll let him take that in a minute about this particular question. But I think you're seeing this in all kinds of areas, lots and lots of regulations, many of them promulgated in the name of security, non-tariff barriers, like more difficult customs clearance activities in various parts of the world. I think you're having a very, very difficult period for the trade negotiators. There's lots of talk about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Initiative, very vociferous opposition to even the Trade Promotion Authority that the President has had for many, many years of both parties.","So the bottom line is trade since the end of World War II was liberalized largely because of the leadership of the United States of America, and that leadership in that sector has not been the same over the last several years as it has been in the past. We have a great USTR with Mike Froman and he's working hard. But to play a game you've got to have at least two players, and most of the people around the world are simply very, very resistant to further liberalization. They want to protect their industries, whether it's agriculture in Europe or certain of the emerging technologies in China. So further trade liberalization is very tough and lots of protectionist measures cropping up around the world for sure.","David J. Bronczek - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","I'll add to that. There's a question that came in from William Flinn at the Potomac. And the issue of Open Skies is the heart of his question. And of course, I wrote to several of the secretaries in the United States government talking about our view of Open Skies. And of course, our view is very simple. We believe in Open Skies and free trade, and we've been doing this for decades now. We base our whole business model on fifth and seventh freedoms, of course, it's Open Skies.","We have of a lot of business in the Middle East, a lot of business in Asia, and around the world. And of course for us, competing in an Open Skies environment is critical for us and that's what our customers expect from us. So we believe it's in the best interest of the United States, certainly in FedEx's best interest. And I know the issue has been raging up in Washington as recently as yesterday. So that's our view of it. We'll post it online, my letter, but we've been in favor of Open Skies and free trade for decades.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","This is Alan. I have an e-mail question from Jay (30:20) at BNP Paribas on our capital plan and dividend policy. I should point out that we did continue our stock buyback during the quarter. We bought 400,000 shares back. We'll continue to do that to prevent dilution from compensation programs.","Our capital plan remains steady as she goes. We're continuing our re-fleeting at Express, and we're continuing our expansion at Ground. So Ground's CapEx is substantial. It's needed to continue to build those beautiful automated hubs and satellites to handle the additional traffic that we're expecting. Ninety percent of what Ground spends is for growth.","On the Express side, while we certainly aren't getting the benefit that we thought from fuel, that's okay. We're still getting a tremendous benefit from the 767s from maintenance and reliability, which are adding to Dave's productivity and doing a fabulous job for us. We'll have more to say about what the FY 2016 spend will be when we get there. We are taking advantage of the fact that we have bonus depreciation still and that's an important factor in our decision.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald A. Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Good morning, everyone. Real quick, just focus on Freight, if you will. We saw two things. One, we saw the slowest growth rate in the Economy portion of Freight really since you started reporting it as a segment. Is there anything to be drawn from that change in the velocity of what customers are expecting? What do you see driving that?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Thank you, Donald. It's Mike Glenn. I wouldn't read too much into that. It's part of our strategy to balance our network with the right amount of volume and volume growth in shipments and yield management to deliver the type of results we're looking for. And we were quite pleased with the overall growth in mix during the quarter.","Donald A. Broughton - Avondale Partners LLC","Good. If I could just have one follow-up on that, can you give us a key on what you saw as core pricing? Obviously, fuel surcharge came down on a year-over-year basis significantly and sequentially pretty dramatically as well. Can you give us an idea of what the core pricing for Freight was?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","I think the market continues to be strong. It's rational. Obviously, the capacity issues in the market are having an effect on that. So we think the pricing environment is strong and rational.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So not much International Priority growth, Osaka is ramping up, any potential for some more capacity cuts out of Asia?","And then just one follow-up for Alan, your comments about the buybacks. So you took on more debt than you needed for GENCO. You've got $3.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. Why not more aggressive buybacks, is there something else, acquisitions, that you're going to expect use of cash for?","David J. Bronczek - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","Hi, this is Dave Bronczek. I'll answer the first part of the question and then I'll give it to Alan. On the International side, the International IP box, which is very critical to us, actually had nice growth of 1.2%. Very important for us, IE, which is very positive for us now going forward, had a plus 4%. IPD actually had a plus 1.1%. So if you look across the board, and in fact, our domestic International businesses grew 7%, we're growing exactly where we want to in exactly the right networks that we have to produce the profits that we're showing. So we're very pleased with where we are.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","And this is Alan, Scott. And I would just tell you that I couldn't help myself. The rates were so good that we just decided demand being the size it was that we could salt away some 30-year and 50-year notes at rates of 4.1% and 4.5%, which is essentially free equity, and we felt it was the right thing to do. Not ruling out further larger buybacks at the moment, but at the moment we are just steadily buying back to prevent dilution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen & Company.","Helane R. Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, operator. Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Just on dimensional weight pricing, I was wondering if you could flesh that out a little more for us. Have you seen, you know, can you just talk about have you seen benefits on the cost side? And have cost benefited more than revenues? Or are you seeing exactly what you were thinking you would see? Are there any surprises? Maybe some meat to that bone would be helpful. Thanks.","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Helane, this is Mike Glenn. I would say we haven't seen any surprises in terms of the response in the marketplace. One of the advantages again I'll say that we had is we gave the market six months notice of the change coming to allow them to adjust packaging as customers deemed appropriate. And as I mentioned before, we got a world-class packaging lab that worked with many customers to make adjustments to their packaging, and I think the market has responded to the pricing change well. As a reminder, dimensional weight pricing has been a staple of this industry for a long, long time, so this is not a new concept out there. Clearly it affects lighter weight packaging. So I would say in general the market has responded about the way we thought.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me add one thing to Mike's comment. We've highlighted this before, but e-commerce is inherently less cube-efficient than business-to-business traffic, and it's because the orders are pulled on a real-time basis and put into the array of packaging that's available as opposed to business-to-business packaging which is generally done in series production. So we have lots of photographs and stories that we could tell you about boxes that have 2 ounce or 3 ounce small device that just have incredibly bad cube to weight ratios. So what we really sell is cubic space almost all of our equipment cubes out before it weights out. There are a few exceptions to that.","So for those of you who are environmentally concerned, the dimensional pricing is probably one of the most important environmental initiatives in corporate America because it incents people not to waste fuel to move air. And I think the point that Mike made there, we gave our customers lots of notice. We have absolutely the best in class packaging engineers, we work with our customers to make their packaging more efficient, more environmentally acceptable, and so we think this is a very good thing in many different ways.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask a few \u2013 a question related to the Ground on the expense side in particular. We noticed a significant increase in labor, and I'm curious like how much of that is going to be recurring, i.e., like how much more elevated is that \u2013 really the cost structure structurally? And then with regard to other OpEx in Ground, there was another large increase in the third quarter. Again, can you just help us understand like how much of that is structurally elevated just because of the increased cost you need to meet the peakiness of the peak season, and how much of that is or how much of that's actually recurring that we can anticipate in the fourth quarter? Thanks.","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","Tom, this is Henry Maier. Most of that expense is the addition of temporary staff to handle the volume we see at peak. Likewise with the rentals, that's facilities. We had a lot of annexes during peak which are temporary. We use them for a month or two, and then we basically shut them down, and give them back to the landlord. So I would say that the majority of that is not reoccurring. However, we've talked about this before on the call. I mean, the purchased transportation rates in the industry right now are higher than what we've seen mainly due to the driver shortage. So we expect that to be ongoing until this \u2013 until the market rights itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Thomas Wadewitz - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Alan, I wanted to see if you could give us a little further perspective on incentive comp, and whether that might be \u2013 it sounded like it was a bit of a headwind in third quarter. Is that a greater headwind as you look to fourth quarter or is it a similar headwind? And then in terms of one for Mike Glenn on the pricing. Your primary competitor obviously had some challenges in peak season, and has talked about peak season surcharges. Is that something you think you would embrace, or do think there is some benefit to your pricing environment from some of the evidence of challenges your competitor has had? Thank you.","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Tom, this is Alan. On incentive comp, probably a little bit more of a headwind in Q4. Actually when we really true up everything for the year, we'll know exactly where we are. And since we are on a fairly steep slope in terms of how much we add or subtract to our AIC compared to what our business plan and our financial objectives are, I think it's going to have a little bit bigger impact in Q4. It will certainly help us as we go through our FY 2016 business plan. The closer to target that we can get this year, the lesser the headwind it will be for 2016. We'll talk about that next time as well, so it's been a long time. I think we're doing the right balancing act here.","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Tom, this is Mike Glenn. As I mentioned before, I think our sales, revenue management and our operations folks did an outstanding job during peak season working with our customers. That's one of our key strengths is being able to match capacity with demand. And we did an outstanding job of doing that during the peak season. Clearly, we monitor market conditions, customer needs and our operational costs relative to peak. And certainly, we're going to make the necessary adjustments to ensure our pricing accurately reflects the service that we provide, but this is really a customer-by-customer issue. And we do not discuss customer-specific pricing.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Fred Smith speaking. Let me put a little bit of color on this AIC thing that Alan has mentioned a couple of times. I mentioned in my opening remarks that our culture is unique. I think it's important for the people that follow FedEx to understand we have over 30,000 management folks that are participants in the AIC program and we have 225,000 other team members who participate in incentive compensation, so in this fourth quarter, based on the business plan which we put together last spring, we put some stretch objectives in there. People are knocking it out of the park, so this is a very good thing as we go into FY 2016 that people are going to earn some of this incentive compensation.","So I think that's a bit misunderstood on the part of a lot of people and certainly the size and scope of the participants is. This isn't like a financial, just a top management incentive program. It's very broadly based inside FedEx and it's one of the big parts of our culture.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial.","Bascome Majors - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, the post office continues to target the e-commerce market with pricing in Priority Mail, and at the same time, they're raising the rates you pay for last mile delivery at SmartPost. Was just curious what impact has their pricing had on your ability to grow Ground volumes and raise Ground pricing? And if you could give us a bit of an update on your efforts to have the regulators take a look at some of the cross-subsidies from Monopoly Mail perhaps supporting their pricing strategy in these competitive businesses?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","This is Mike Glenn again. As we've talked about before, the Postal network is a much different network than the FedEx network. They operate much smaller vehicles and there are significant differences in the networks. They tend to target lighter-weight packaging that has much lower yields, which is not necessarily the target of our initiatives. So I would just point to our results during the quarter. We had a very strong quarter, not only in volume and revenue growth, but also bottom-line performance. So we're quite pleased with where we sit relative to the competition.","Christine P. Richards - Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary","This is Chris Richards. We monitor the changes with the Postal pricing. But as you're well aware, there's been a lot of stress on the Postal Service over the last decade or so and they are facing a network situation where their vehicles are not designed for moving packages and they have obviously been addressing some services concerns. Just a reminder, our express company moves the bulk of the Priority Mail shipments as a part of our Postal contract. They are a wonderful customer. And we are pleased to continue that relationship. We are also a significant customer of theirs through the SmartPost service. So we watch what they're doing on the regulatory side and continue to evaluate our options depending upon which direction they choose to go with respect to the changes in their network.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me just add a little bit more color on this e-commerce segment. The vast majority of e-commerce shipments are very lightweight, less than five pounds. In fact the top two or three e-commerce shippers, 85% of their shipments are less than five pounds. And many of them are very poor cubed weight because of the nature of the type of traffic.","The Postal Service's very dense delivery network is very suited to delivery of those types of packages, particularly since the majority of them, the vast majority of them are residential deliveries. So as long as the Postal Service stays focused on that segment, I think they're going to do very, very well. I think as you get into the higher weights, diseconomies of scale come in.","The second point I'd like to make because this is a big source of confusion in the marketplace, a very, very large percentage of the e-commerce packages that are delivered by the Postal Service are originated by FedEx SmartPost and UPS SurePost. And there is a double-counting to some degree of those packages when people talk about Postal Service growth rates versus UPS and FedEx. So you really have to get rid of that static before you can see the real signals in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William Jeffrey Greene - Morgan Stanley","Yeah, hi there. Good morning. I have a question for Fred. Fred, you've probably seen some of these articles in some of the business magazines that talk about Uber and how it's potentially a threat to the FedEx business model. And I realize today they're no threat whatsoever, but they talk about it as a potential blind spot. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about this technology and what you can do to make sure it doesn't become a blind spot for FedEx as that technology evolves?","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There's a great country and western song called I Was Country Before Country Was Cool. We were Uber before Uber was there in our Custom Critical. Custom Critical is a business that moves things from point A to point B as fast as you possibly can. And it's done with in essence an app, but mostly through voice connections. And we also have, I think it's in 23 markets now, FedEx Same-Day City, which is a part of the FedEx Office operating unit.","So the demand for moving things same day or from one point to another as fast as possible in the goods moving business is a much smaller market than the business of moving things that are processed during the day, boxed and shipped on the circadian pattern that we all live by, go to work at eight, come home at five. A huge part of the e-commerce marketplace, for instance, are orders that are processed after 8:00 PM in the evening until midnight.","So Uber is a great company and a great concept. I use Uber. And I had occasion to use it up in Cincinnati not long ago while I was up there and it's terrific. And I think where the shoe fits, there's certainly some demand for moving a package across town in Uber or Lyft or the taxi services that have been in business for a long time have been able to do that, or some of the local same-day businesses. But I think there's just an urban mythology out there that the app somehow changes the basic cost input of the logistics business or changes the circadian patterns or the underlying business situation, and that's just incorrect. So great company, great concept, but I don't think it's likely to be a major player in the logistics business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Question on FedEx Freight, so specifically on the quarter, what was the reason that there was a big increase in maintenance and repairs expense while D&A declined?","But more longer term, Mike, you've been a couple months now at the head. Is there anything you're looking to do differently, or could you see anything that you think you can improve given your prior experience at the company given fresh eyes on FedEx Freight?","Michael L. Ducker - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Freight","On the maintenance and repair expense, that's more a quarter-over-quarter impact than anything else. And as we bring on the new equipment into the business, it will have a positive effect on the maintenance expense. Overall, I think we're on a pretty darn good track. We're balancing our revenue growth and we're gaining penetration on the small and medium customer base. Our service levels were good during the quarter, so I think we're on a very good track now.","In terms of different things that I see, we're going to continue to focus on those things. Profitable growth in the business is one of our main drivers. So for right now, I think we're on a good course.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Barnes with RBC Capital Markets.","John Barnes - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my call. In terms of the dimensional pricing, you talked a little bit about trying to influence shippers' decisions on packaging and maybe better aligning it with the size of the actual product. Can you talk a little bit about how much capacity do you feel can be freed up in your network as you roll this dimensional pricing out? And what does that mean for the long-term capital spending outlook for the network?","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","That's a pretty thin limb that I don't know that I want to go out on in terms of speculating exactly what the ultimate impact of dimensional weight pricing will be. Clearly, as I said, we've seen a lot of customers that have made nice changes in their packaging to reduce the size and footprint and that certainly will have an impact, but it'd be very difficult to forecast exactly the impact of that.","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me make just an editorial comment about the issue of cube and environmental concerns and so forth. The biggest single thing that could be done in this country that would help the environment and improve the productivity of our logistics system would be for the federal government to change the limit of the twin trailers used by the Ground parcel and LTL industries from 28 feet per trailer to 33 feet per trailer, and that gives about 18% more cube. The trailers, both in the Ground parcel and the LTL business, cube out long before they weight out. So there is absolutely no requirement to increase the gross weight of the rigs, which is controversial because it increases maintenance expense and the wear and tear on bridges and so forth.","So if that were to happen and I think there's a good chance that it will if the highway bill passes at some point, which is very difficult given the resistance to increasing the gas tax to fund the highway bill, but you get an immediate increase in productivity and a system that's much more suited to today's e-commerce world than the old 28-foot trailers. We've tested them. There have been studies. They're safer. They reduce accidents by the hundreds if they were adopted by the industry, millions and millions, tens of millions of gallons of fuel and lower emissions. So we're very hopeful that the Congress will pass that shortly. And it's supported by the entire industry, UPS, FedEx, all the LTL carriers. It's a really big deal, on point to the question you just asked.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone, congrats on the quarter and thanks for getting the question in. Alan, a two-part one, and one cheap. First, is there any way to quantify the fuel benefit in the quarter?","And then I think more importantly, you guys said that you're on track to get the $1.2 billion of improvement this year at Express. So if I look at fiscal 2013, which was about $1.2 billion for the full year, should you be close to $2.4 billion in EBIT even before improvement in fiscal 2016? Is that the right math right now?","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","We've always said it's a running rate. It's a going out running rate, so we'll see \u2013 you'll see Q4 and then the first three quarters of next year, you'll see it. And then when we get to the end of 2016, we'll have the running rate to complete the program. And as I said earlier, I'm pretty comfortable with that. What was your first question, Brandon?","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Is there any way to quantify the fuel benefit in the quarter?","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Yes, there is, but significant is all you're going to get from me.","Brandon Robert Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, I had to try. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin W. Sterling - BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. Alan, you briefly touched on this about the aircraft replacement at Express and how you're getting the benefit from maintenance and then what have you, but you're not quite getting the fuel benefit because of lower fuel prices. I'm curious. In this low fuel price environment, are you thinking about deferring some of the newer aircraft given the drop in fuel prices, or is it still full steam ahead? And also are your Hoosiers ready to make a deep run in the NCAA tournament?","Alan B. Graf - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","I do not have the Hoosiers in the Sweet 16. No. We've looked at it and we're still very pleased. Dave's going to add a little bit to this, but we're going to get five more 767s this quarter. Next year, I'll give you a little bit of expectation, while our maintenance expenses have been up significantly this year, they are going to be down in 2016 as a result of this plan. And so that's a very important part of our profit improvement program. Dave?","David J. Bronczek - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Express","That's right, Alan. We see the maintenance improving. You'll see it improve in the fourth quarter and then you'll see it into 2016. The reliability is outstanding for these airplanes. It's part of our profit improvement pillar. It's been outstanding and there is fuel savings as well, it's just not as much when the fuel price is $42 a barrel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.","Jeff A. Kauffman - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you very much and congratulations, guys. I'm just happy Indiana made the tournament, but like Alan, I don't have them in my bracket. Question bigger picture, you talked about the changing nature of the holiday season shipments. And now we're in our second year of this being a different shipping pattern for customers. You talked about the protectionism on the international markets. When you look at the business, if you were to put the four-year plan in place today, let's say we got a new plan to replace the 2012 plan and you're thinking about the capital investment that you need to make for the next four years, how is that shifting given some of the changes that you've seen over the last two years to three years since you put the plan out?","Frederick W. Smith - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Fred Smith. Let me give you a little bit of our management philosophy here. And that is, we don't know what's going to be the case five and 10 years down the road. So the decisions that we make, we try to be able to play a lot of different ways depending on what the situation is. A good example is, when we decided that we needed to replace the MD-11, we bought the 777 as opposed to bigger airplanes. And why is that important? Because it can go any place and to any market and it can also operate domestically as efficiently as it operates internationally. That's not true of the bigger planes.","The second thing is that despite the protectionism issues, we believe that the strategies that we have developed will allow us to increase earnings because we think we have better mousetraps or differentiated services which allow us to take market share that we can continue to grow even in a low-growth environment. So we're very optimistic about FedEx, while we might not be particularly optimistic about the political landscape around the world, those are two different things. And our management team has taken it as a challenge to develop strategies that work in both high-growth and low-growth environments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.","Keith Schoonmaker - Morningstar Research","Thanks. Ground improved margins slightly from the prior year despite some conditions that challenged others. Based on this, do you have plan to expand sort of unconventional delivery methods like lockers or access points or based on the solid margins you're able to sustain, are such other methods not really necessary at this point to contend with costly B2C deliveries?","T. Michael Glenn - Executive Vice President - Market Development & Corporate Communications","Clearly as e-commerce continues to grow, there's going to be need for alternative delivery or pickup. And we're currently testing lockers in the Dallas-Fort Worth market. We've got a couple in the Memphis market. We've got some other solutions in place that we're looking at. As omni-channel certainly becomes more important in terms of an e-commerce strategy, I think you're going to see an increase in pickup at the store, pickup at alternative locations, potentially pickup at lockers. And we're analyzing and investing and testing all of those forms with our customers. So we're pretty comfortable with where we sit and some of the opportunities that we have to be able to handle the growth going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein.","Vitaly Nesterenko - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Vitaly Nesterenko for David Vernon. If you can, give a little bit of color on GENCO acquisition. So we're particularly interested in why the integration might take 12 to 18 months and also if you can give some \u2013 elaborate a little bit on what we should expect on GENCO standalone financials. Thanks a lot.","Henry J. Maier - President & Chief Executive Officer, FedEx Ground","The short answer is that the integration is going to take 12 months to 18 months because the most important thing with respect to the integration is that we continue to run this business successfully over that period of time. There's a lot of moving parts here. Obviously there's IT, there's any number of things that we have to look at here. So that's just what we believe it's going to take. I would tell you that we're four weeks into this. It's always possible that when we get a little bit deeper into the process, we may find opportunities here to streamline that and get it done sooner. But based on what we know here today, that's the range I'm willing to give you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

And now our Chairman, Fred Smith, will share his views on the quarter.","Frederick W. Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, and welcome to our conference call to discuss operating and financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. We're very pleased with the operating results at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, which continue to show improvement. At FedEx Express, persistent weakness in the global economy and increasing demand for lower-yielding international services limited profits during the quarter. Superstorm Sandy affected overall earnings as well.","At the October investors and lenders meeting, we showed you plans to improve annual profitability by $1.7 billion during the next 3 years with a significant portion of the benefits achieved by fiscal year 2015. I'm very confident we're on our way to achieving this ambitious goal. We're hard at work currently on another record-setting holiday shipping season driven by the increasing popularity of e-commerce. On Monday, December 17, team members moved about 19.8 million shipments through our various systems around the world, a daily record. For the overall holiday, we believe volumes in our worldwide networks will increase by more than 13% compared to last year. I'd like to say thank you to all our team members, especially those in the areas affected by Sandy, for their hard work and dedication during this peak season.","Before I turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his views on the economy and Alan Graf for his analysis of the quarter, I'd like to do 2 things. First, I'd like to thank Bill Margaritis, our Corporate Vice President of Communications, who will be departing FedEx on December 31 after 16 years of service. Bill, we appreciate everything you've done for us during your time here and look forward to seeing you often in the future. Second, I'd like to congratulate FedEx Express for being recognized by the Great Place to Work Institute as among the world\u2019s top 10 best multinational workplaces for the second year in a row. The ranking is the world's largest annual study of workplace excellence and identifies the top 25 best multinationals in terms of workplace culture.","Now let me turn it over to Mike Glenn.","T. Michael Glenn","Thank you, Fred. I'm going to make a few brief comments regarding the economy, then give a summary of our yield results and then finally, a couple of comments on peak season.","We continue to see modest growth in the global economy with our forecast for U.S. GDP calling for 1.9% growth in calendar year '13. For industrial production, we expect a growth rate of 2.4% in calendar year '13. This is slightly lower than our prior forecast, primarily reflecting a lower entry point in FY '13 due to Hurricane Sandy. Our global GDP forecast is 2.5% in calendar year '13. And finally, I just want to emphasize that the calendar year '13 outlook could swing either direction depending upon policy outcomes, especially with the fiscal cliff issues in the U.S. and certainly issues in Europe.","Turning to yield. In the domestic Express sector, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express yields increased 2.5%, which was primarily driven by pricing and rate -- rating and discount improvements. In the Ground segment, again, excluding the impact of fuel, our yields increased 2.9%. The year-over-year increase was driven by list and discount improvements followed by an increase in extra services charges. Excluding fuel, in the international export Express segment, package yields declined 3.8% year-over-year due to a change in product mix, rate and discounts and weight changes as well as the impact of exchange rate. And finally, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight increased 1.9% year-over-year, which was primarily driven by pricing rate changes.","And as noted in our recently released peak day volume forecast, FedEx expected to handle more than 19 million packages on Monday, December 10. FedEx, not only exceeded our forecast on the 10th, but we also handled more than 19 million packages on Monday, November 26, which was Cyber Monday, and Monday, December 17. The heavy volume was driven primarily by e-commerce sales, which consist of lighter weight, lower-yielding residential delivery packages; and our team, both at Express and Ground, worked very closely with our largest e-commerce and multichannel retail customers to deliver outstanding service during this peak season.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan B. Graf","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes an $0.11 per share hit from Superstorm Sandy, reflects the strength of FedEx Ground and SmartPost, continuing improvement at FedEx Freight and the current trends at FedEx Express. As we said in October at our investors and lenders meeting, we are committed to delivering improved profitability and shareholder returns, and in addition to a review of the quarter and outlook for the second half of fiscal year '13, I will comment on our progress toward delivering on our profit improvement plans. So let's first review segment results for the quarter, and we'll start with Ground. Ground's strong revenue growth from e-commerce and market share gains continues to expand our network and increase our capabilities. New volume milestones were reached for the second quarter as SmartPost moved over 2 million packages per day and Ground delivered over 4 million packages per day. On Cyber Monday, November 26, Ground moved 8.7 million packages and SmartPost 6.1 million packages.","Ground's operating income increased 4% to $412 million in the quarter, primarily due to 8% higher volume together with yield growth, partially offset by network expansion costs. Operating margin did decrease in the quarter primarily due to lower fuel surcharge revenue and higher purchase transportation costs related to increased fuel expense. Operating income at Ground was also negatively impacted by Sandy.","At Freight, we are continuing to benefit from the leverage gained by integrating our networks and differentiating our service by offering priority and economy choices for our customers, plus increasing our use of rail. Freight's operating income for the quarter improved significantly, up $36 million from a year ago to $76 million as a result of LTL yield growth and increased average daily LTL shipments, along with ongoing improvements and operational efficiencies in our integrated network. Freight's results were also negatively impacted by Sandy.","Turning to Express. Continuing weakness in global markets and customers choosing slower, lower-yielding services are ongoing trends as we continue to adjust our network. Operating income and operating margin decreased in the quarter due to the demand shift toward lower-yielding international services, a negative impact of year-over-year net fuel changes, increased depreciation expense, the impact of Sandy and higher pension costs. These were partially offset by favorable impact of cost containment actions, which Dave Bronczek will talk to you about in detail. Operating income and margins were also negatively impacted by ongoing investments in integrating recent acquisitions into the Express network.","Fuel had a negative impact on operating income in Q2 based on a static analysis of the net impact of year-over-year changes in fuel prices compared to year-over-year changes in fuel surcharges. Fuel costs increased 3% during the quarter through an increase in the average price per gallon of fuel. Meanwhile, the weighted average U.S. fuel surcharge for the quarter decreased 1.7 percentage points versus last year.","In October, we announced programs targeting annual profitability improvement of $1.7 billion during the next 3 years with a significant portion of the benefits to be achieved by the end of FY '15. The majority of the profitability improvement will come from initiatives at Express and services and include cost reductions in selling, general and administrative functions through headcount reductions, streamlining of processes and elimination of less essential work. Also, modernization of our aircraft fleet, transformation of the U.S. domestic operations and international profit improvements in Express and also improved efficiencies and lower cost of information technology at Services.","Our overall profit improvement plan includes offering voluntary cash buyouts to eligible U.S.-based employees beginning in February of 2013. Cost of the benefits provided under the voluntary programs will be recognized in the period that eligible employees accept their offers, which will be predominantly in Q4 of this fiscal year. We expect the pretax cost of the voluntary buyout program to range from $550 million to $650 million, but actual costs will depend on employee acceptance rates. Eligible employees will vacate positions in 3 phases to ensure a smooth transition. Employees in the first phase will vacate their positions on May 31, 2013.","These programs, combined with continued profit improvements in Ground and Freight, are expected to increase margins, improve cash flows and increase our competitiveness. The ultimate cost and savings from our profit improvement initiatives will depend upon other things on a number of employees that participate in the voluntary cash buyout program and the timing and execution of these programs. We expect to begin realizing the benefits of these programs in FY '14 and anticipate these savings will be substantially realized by the end of fiscal 2015.","Our capital expenditures for the corporation are expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 and include spending for aircraft and related equipment at Express, facility projects at Express and Ground and vehicle replacement at all our transportation segments. In December, Express entered into an agreement with Boeing to purchase 4 incremental 767 freighters to be delivered in 2015. As part of that agreement, Express is also deferring the delivery of 2 firm 777 freighter orders for 1 year from 2015 to 2016.","Turning now to the outlook. And based on the economic outlook for the year, as Mike described, we are expecting diluted earnings per share of $1.25 to $1.45 for the third quarter. We reaffirm our guidance of $6.20 to $6.60 per diluted share for the year, which does not include charges related to our voluntary cash buyout program. Our outlook also assumes that the U.S. does not go off the fiscal cliff and into a recession. For the second half of fiscal '13, we are assuming a slightly higher effective tax rate of approximately 37%.","Finally, for those of you who haven't finished your holiday shopping, there are a few days left to ship your presents in time for Christmas, and our 300,000 teammates around the world are ready and anxious to deliver reliable service for you just in time for Christmas.","And with that, we will now open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.","Thomas R. Wadewitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Let's see. I wanted to ask a bit, Alan, about the -- you had quite a bit of helpful commentary following up in the October meeting, kind of reviewing some of the drivers on the broader improvement program. If you're taking this charge in fourth quarter, it would imply that you have significant run of the headcount that would be out in fiscal '14. Is that primarily related to the SG&A cost savings, the I think $500 million total that you had identified? And how would we think about that? Is it reasonable to think that you could realize a fair bit of that cost savings given the timing of your buyout program?","Alan B. Graf","Tom, thanks for the question. At the investors and lenders meeting, we had thought that the buyout would be as people departed. We have since done a lot of further accounting research and have determined that we will take the charges upon the signing of the execution of the voluntary buyouts no matter when people depart. So that's why we will expect most of the charges to occur in 2013. We are working very hard on our reorganization plans. We think we know within pretty a good tolerance range of how many people are going to accept it and where they will be and how we will address that. But until we actually get through February, it's going to be very difficult for me to quantify how much in fiscal '14 that we will be able to put to the bottom line as we determine how long we'll have to retain people to ensure the smooth transition. It will be significant, but I would look for most of the benefits from the voluntary buyout to be realized in fiscal '15. And I will say the same thing for the profit improvement program at Express. We've already started it there. Dave will talk about it. In fact, I'll just turn it over to him and let him talk about it as part of this. We've already started that. We've saved a lot of money already, and we're well on our road. I would just say to sum up, we are very confident about reaching the $1.7 billion profit improvement program by fiscal '16. And I think as the deeper we get into this, the more confident that we are. And let me have Dave talk a little bit about the profit improvement.","David J. Bronczek","Yes. Thanks, Alan, and that's correct. We're very optimistic that the 5-point plan that we presented is going exceptionally well. SG&A, as Alan pointed out, a big part of it is at Express. This quarter, I should go back to, and I'll talk about expenses in a minute here, significantly was affected this quarter, our profits and our margins by Superstorm Sandy was a big part of the $0.11 was at Express. Another big part of it significantly was at fuel that Alan pointed out, although it seemed like it would be a positive, it was a negative significantly. Pension, and then the fourth point that you may not pick up, it's in -- our purchase transportation is our new acquisitions sits in that purchase transportation number. It's a big negative number. That's the short term, obviously, until we get these new acquisitions rolling. So you have those significant headwinds in our profits and our margins this quarter. Going forward, we're very optimistic that those margins and profits improve. But on the expense side, even in this quarter, our FTEs were down 1,736, over 2%. Our fuel usage was down, thanks to our great programs we've put into air operations, aircraft maintenance was down even though our pounds were up. So our pounds were up across the world, a lot of them being international economy, which I'll talk about a little bit later, because it's a new network design that we're putting in for that lower-yielding international traffic to be in a much more cost-effective network going forward. That's part of our 5-point plan. So we're feeling very good about our 5-point plan. We actually had a quarter that would have significantly looked better had those 4 initiatives not hit all at one time. So going forward, we're very optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.","Robert H. Salmon - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's Rob on for Justin. I guess, Dave, as a follow-up to your comments related to the various cost initiatives at Express, you guys had called out, I think, roughly $350 million at the Investor Day, which you weren't including in that $1.7 billion of cost initiatives that you were targeting for fiscal '13. Can you give us a sense how much of that actually showed up in the earnings this quarter just given the headwinds from Sandy? Earnings were a bit better, so I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of those cost initiatives are now kind of showing up in the bottom line.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, that's a good question because if it wasn't for Sandy a lot more would have shown up, and we actually did reduce our FTEs in our U.S. transformation number that you're talking about, the $350 million would have been significantly better. You would have seen it a lot more dramatic. But it's in our U.S. domestic transformation program that you're talking about. We're going after those costs in a lot of different areas. Attrition, of course, redesigning the network, and even with Sandy, we still had pretty good improvement on our FTEs. Alan?","Alan B. Graf","Rob, let me just add to that, that we're building momentum, and while I know that a lot of people don't like my outlook for the third quarter, we did keep the year the same because we expect the momentum to build through Q3, and we will really start to see the impact of this at Express in the Q4 results for Express and for the corporation and then on into fiscal '14. So momentum is there. It does take a while to get everything once we've made the plans executed. You've got, for example, bid packs with the pilots. You've got attrition that you have to let happen. We've got to continue to go through the reorganization for the G&A that we're doing, but strong momentum-building, and you'll see it in Q4.","David J. Bronczek","And one last thing on the 4 767s, obviously, it's accretive from our operating profits and margins. It's a positive MIRR as well, and it's all part of 1 of those 5 pillars that I pointed out in our fleet modernization as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Nate Brochmann with William Blair & Company.","Nathan Brochmann - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I wanted to talk a little bit on the international side. Obviously, there continues to be some trade-down there, but yet kind of saw some uptick in volumes. I was wondering how much of that might be market share gains from your competitors' disruption over there may be with their big deal, just separating that as well as with just improved activity over there.","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. Market share data trails, so it would be premature to make definitive statements regarding market share gains at this time. Although, we have seen strong performance, stronger performance out of the Asia Pacific region and certainly, strong performance out of Europe.","Alan B. Graf","I would also add that our European organic expansion plan is right on target. Our strategic business case there is -- looks very good despite the weak economy over there. They're executing on it very well. As you know, we've made important acquisitions in Poland and France, and we will continue to roll that out, and we're very pleased with the progress.","David J. Bronczek","And just one last point, you've seen in our numbers. International priority, which is also international priority distribution where a lot of our high-tech customers use that product, grew at 3%. International economy grew at 14%. So going forward, there's a big opportunity for us there to put those packages in the right network for improving our profits.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Ross with Stifel, Nicolaus.","David G. Ross - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you talk a little bit about the company's exposure to the U.S. housing market? The housing market seems to have bottomed and has gotten better this year. If there's more upside surprise in 2013, can you talk a little bit about how each of the different segments might benefit from that?","William J. Logue","Yes, I think from the -- this is -- David, this is Bill Logue. On the Freight side of the business, as the housing recovery comes around, obviously, that's a big role in the Freight side of the business. So whether we -- in the quarter, we saw some good volume movement through November -- October, November, pretty healthy for us, so again, helped our results. And again, as we see continued improvement going forward, then there's significant upside for us on the Freight side. Now as we go into our Q3 side of the business, obviously, we have a -- 2 less operating days in this quarter, and our third quarter, which is December, January, February, is the most challenging quarter because it's in the LTL space. It's 3 challenging months. That plus 2 less days. So as we work through Q3, our objective is to stay focused on continuing to build on our base business, continue our efficiencies and very focused on our contract renewals, which we are in a very heavy part of our season right now and prepare us to run efficient through Q3 as best we can with the challenges of the volume during this period and get us ready for Q4. So again, if housing continues, we'll see the benefit of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Helane Becker with the Dahlman Rose.","Helane R. Becker - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just on the -- some press reports a couple of weeks ago on this recent lawsuit over charges in your network. Can you just address that or how we should think about that?","Christine P. Richards","Helane, it's Chris Richards. This case was filed in February 2011 and received some recent media attention. We deny the allegations in this complaint. It had to do with an assertion that we weren't properly paying -- we were improperly charging for residential surcharges which, of course, we have a very settled process where customers, if they have this concern, can note from their invoice that they have it, and we'll address those issues. I have to tell you, it's not uncommon for plaintiffs' counsel where they have a situation where a case may be disposed of on preliminary motions for them to go to the media and attempt to bring forward negative facts in the media. And we're not going to try this case in the media. So just want to bring it to the attention of all of our customers that we note on our invoices when a residential surcharge has been applied. We take seriously and address any concern that's raised about those charges. We have a good process in place to make sure we are doing this correctly. But on the other hand, this isn't a perfect science, and if you drive around your town, you'll probably find some places where houses that used to be filled with families are now the locations for beauty salons and Mexican restaurants and other kinds of things. And so it's a changing situation that we address through our various data sources. So that's where we are. It's very preliminary stage, and we can't be accountable for plaintiffs' lawyers' actions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with -- of Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin J. Hartford - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I'm wondering if you can provide some context on the airfreight dynamics without giving specific numbers in the quarter, can you talk directionally about how trends trended? It sounds as though November airfreight was healthy after being weak for the 5 months prior. And can you talk a little bit about trade lanes in terms of that dynamic and maybe what you're seeing from a near-term perspective, whether you do have the sense that airfreight fundamentals globally have started to bottom or if there's still too much uncertainty to make any sort of any claims? So any sort of color on that would be helpful.","David J. Bronczek","Well, I'll start. This is Dave Bronczek. The airfreight out of Asia Pacific is doing quite well. A lot of it is our high-tech customers. Obviously, this time of the year, there is a shift. However, we think, in the overall market that has more Express on the high end and more Freight IE type of traffic on the low end, so it's actually going to play into our network very well. So our volumes were up out of the Asia Pacific. They're also up out of Europe. So we are actually seeing some positive trends from our key customers in our market segment. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn","Yes, I was just going to highlight, as Dave mentioned, as most people know during the quarter there were several high-tech product releases that certainly benefited the market overall in FedEx. And those don't happen every quarter, but certainly, we benefited from that during the quarter.","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith speaking. On our Investor Relations website, you can read a speech which I gave in May at the Wings Club that gives a comprehensive look of our views about the international cargo business from the Express sector through the commodity airfreight or traditional airfreight business down to Ocean Freight. And you'll see that over the last several years, particularly since the great recession, there have been major systemic changes. And I'd commend that work to you because it gives a more comprehensive answer to the question you just asked.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","William J. Greene - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, Fred, maybe I can ask you just to follow up a little bit on that. We hear a lot about nearsourcing of manufacturing back to North America. Obviously, FedEx serves all of those places. But we also hear that international priority freight is some of the best freight on the network. So maybe what are the puts and takes there? Is it a good thing if we get nearsourcing back here for FedEx? Or is that more of a challenge as a secular shift?","Frederick W. Smith","Well, we're in all these sectors. It's just really an issue of managing the capacity and putting the right traffic in the right network. And I think over the last couple of years, as Dave mentioned, customers have opted to trade a bit of speed for a lower price but that's fine. We just have to make sure that the economy traffic has moved in the appropriate network, and we're moving a lot -- and moving it on the ground more as opposed to flying it as much. So it's more drive, fly, drive rather than -- and then fly, fly. So that takes some time. One of the things that we're most excited about in the last couple of years -- and perhaps, Dave can talk a bit more about this -- we bought a terrific company in Mexico, which will be a major beneficiary of nearsourcing trends. We got a great team down there, and it's going very well. So we're prepared on either side for continued growth across the Pacific. And I think the sector that we pioneered, the door-to-door Express, will be the growth area. And we're also well situated for nearsourcing. Dave?","David J. Bronczek","That's exactly right, Fred, and we have a great company in Mexico. We come across the border now in trucks when it gets nearsourced, and that's a great question. Or it's Indonesia or it's in China or it's in Austin, Texas. Those customers are telling us in advance where they're moving to, and we align our network to that. In some cases, it's actually better for us financially when they nearsource it. So we have a good line of sight on where these customers are, and we have great businesses and great business models all around the world to handle it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I was maybe wondering if we could touch a little bit on kind of the fuel surcharge in the purchase transportation and maybe the Sandy allocation within Express. Just trying to get a better sense of maybe what the underlying kind of earnings power the segment is right now and how you think about that x some of those items. Just a little bit more color there would be very helpful.","Alan B. Graf","Well, as we grow FedEx Trade Networks, our purchase transportation costs are going to increase because they're all -- that's all purchase transportation. FedEx Trade Networks is a very important part of our strategy. It goes back to the last couple of questions where we're getting bigger in ocean, and we are also getting bigger in forwarded air traffic on a small basis now, but hope to be larger as we go where we can't justify flying an entire aircraft. That's an important part of our strategy. Also with acquisitions, there's a lot of purchase transportation acquisitions. And acquisitions, when you first make them, you have 2 costs that you have to deal with, particularly in the first year. One is you can't capitalize the cost of the acquisitions anymore. Now those are expensed immediately. And secondarily, you have integration costs as we hook those acquisitions into our international network. We know that going upfront. We have a strategic business case on all of these that understand that. But as we get them tucked in and up and running and FedEx-branded, 18 months down the road, they start to pay off. So those are the answers there. As to the fuel, you have to remember about the fuel surcharge. You have to remember what happened a year ago in terms of those lag between the surcharge and the price and what happened this year. So a lot of people thought we'd have a tailwind. We actually had a headwind, as our fuel price variance was significantly higher than year-over-year and our surcharge revenue was basically flat across the enterprise.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Sterne Agee.","Salvatore Vitale - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sal Vitale on for Jeff Kauffman. Just looking at some of the trends in the Express business, volume-wise, was there anything in terms of easier comps this quarter? If we look at the trend over the last few quarters, you had the -- the May quarter was down about 3% year-over-year. August was up about 1.5%, and then you had up 6% in the November quarter. Is there anything there we should be looking at?","T. Michael Glenn","I don't think there is anything beneficial in that regard. I think to the contrary we're still lapping the one customer -- one large customer, the cell phone industry that I mentioned last quarter, which moved the traffic out of the Express network into the home and SmartPost -- Ground and SmartPost network. So that is still a headwind for us in the Express sector. So what we've seen is stronger numbers. Obviously, we've been benefiting from e-commerce to some degree and specific opportunities with other customers. But it's more -- I would say it's more of a headwind than a tailwind that we're dealing with.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Trahan.","Scott H. Group - Wolfe Trahan & Co.","So what I understand on the Ground side, we saw nice acceleration in the volume growth and wondering what's driving that. Are you hearing from customers? Or do you think you're taking maybe a little bit of share or accelerated share ahead of UPS' Teamster contract next year? And then on the expense side at Ground that you talked about expansion costs and higher contractor costs, maybe give a little bit of color there. And should we think about those as ongoing in the next few quarters?","David F. Rebholz","Okay, Scott, this is Dave Rebholz. There is no question that with our value proposition and the quality of the service that we are performing that we are taking some level of share. It would absolutely be ridiculous to not think that we're not doing that. All up, our customers are pointing out to us what's valuable, what's important. We have picked up a number of significant customers that have, obviously, stated concerns over the U.S. -- UPS situation, but I don't think that's the primary driver in this. Otherwise, I think we would see a heck of a lot more volume coming on board in the short term. So I think we're absolutely winning the game over the long run. In terms of the cost structure, just basic fundamentals here. We -- Alan already mentioned the net fuel position that we were in. We are all in the position of the lagging factor, which will benefit us going forward. We put on a significant -- and you follow us very closely. We put on a significant amount of expansion that comes on in this particular quarter in anticipation of the peak volumes that we have to handle, which Mike already told you, were record-level days. My peers laugh at me when I say it's kind of like the fishes and loaves because the days are unique, dramatic, and we're handling it at incredible levels of performance. So I am very, very pleased with our team. And I would like to go on the record for saying the level of dedication and commitment, not only from our own employees, but from our contractors is second to none. So all up, those are really the 2 big issues in this quarter, fuel and expansion. We anticipated it, and we're looking forward for the years to come, in particular the second half, because I think we've got headway to play this thing out. I have no idea what the situation is with UPS and their contract. All I know is we've got customers that are coming on for the long term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch.","Ken Hoexter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dave, can I just follow up on the Ground side there, it seemed like yields also seemed to take a deceleration, not a decline, but maybe slowing over what we've seen in the last few quarters. Is it getting more competitive in terms of getting those in that business? Or is -- I guess maybe is e-commerce having a greater impact? I know you just highlighted expansion and fuel, but is the rapid growth of e-commerce impacting your margin capabilities as a growth of SmartPost or anything else that's going on within the network that we should think about?","David F. Rebholz","Ken, the issue here is that as we have moved into this peak season, the acceleration of e-commerce is very real. You don't have to look at FedEx to understand what's going on out there in the marketplace with our largest retail customers and their customers. It appears that there's been a lot of pent-up demand from us, we as consumers, and so ordering online is the most convenient way to do business. So I don't think that trend is going to change. The economics on yield, we were over yield, as was already articulated by Alan in our press release. That's not to say that the larger the customers and as the mix changes that we could not envision some sort of yield risk as a function of customer mix, not as a function of rate, okay? So I think we're in a very healthy position, and all I can tell you is, is that the growth is and the demand is very strong. And yes, it is true, and I'll let Mike comment on it, our largest customers are seeing record years.","T. Michael Glenn","Ken, I just want to highlight a couple of points. I certainly agree with what Dave is saying. But I want you to focus on the fact that FedEx has been leading the industry in terms of overall yield improvement. And our yield management and our sales team along with our revenue management team has done an outstanding job of managing our yields in the various quarters over the last couple of years. Our objective, as I stated at the investor and lenders meeting, is to balance our yield improvement along with volume growth to maximize profitability for each operating company, and we have worked very closely with the operating companies to make sure that we accomplish that. Certainly, during quarters leading up to -- or the quarter leading up to the peak season, we do see a change in customer mix, as Dave noted, which does put some pressure on the yield. But our long-term objective is to balance yield improvements and volume growth to maximize our profits, and that's what we're focused on. So some quarters you're going to see yields a little higher, some quarters you're going to see yields a little lower, but the key is improving our profits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon R. Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Research Division","This question might kind of be a follow-up for you, Mike, or maybe Dave Bronczek. But when we look at yields in Express as well, is that being challenged any way domestically by what your peer is doing with these new Saver products that they've introduce over the last few quarters? And with the declining volume environment, what are some things that you're doing to try to push better pricing outcomes looking forward?","T. Michael Glenn","Our yield strategy, I can tell you, is independent of what our primary competitor is doing. As I said before, our objective here is to balance our yield improvement along with volume growth to maximize our profitability. We've worked very closely with our Express company to identify opportunities, whether they be on a lane segment basis or out of a particular market or region to grow our services. We've had a lot of new contract negotiations that have come up in the quarter, and we work, again, very closely to make sure that we're getting the level of contribution that we need to get. What's really driving a lot of the yield issues in the market in general in Express is the growth in e-commerce. And again, as I stated at the investor and lenders meeting, our SmartPost and home delivery services are ideal for growth in SmartPost; and at the same time, we are being more selective in the Express segment when pursuing e-commerce opportunities. Certainly, Express benefited during the quarter from strong e-commerce results, but we are more selective in that regard and perhaps more selective than our primary competitor.","Operator","Our next question comes from Art Hatfield with Raymond James.","Arthur W. Hatfield - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question going back to the profit improvement initiatives and the cost saves that will come. Alan, in your comments, you talked about some of the savings in next fiscal year and then most of the benefits being in place by the end of fiscal '15. Is the right way for us to think about it -- I know you can't pinpoint all of this at this point in time, but as this occurs will it be something that will come in a stair-step function? Or will it accrue smoothly over the quarters as you start to see those benefits kick in?","Alan B. Graf","I think it'll be a combination. There'll be small stair steps, but it'll mostly be momentum that will drive this. Again, we are talking about thousands of people here. So as we reorganize around that with a very limited backfill behind that, we have to space these folks out. So there'll be May, then there'll be some August, then there'll probably be some November, then there'll be some the next May. And I don't have clear visibility of that except I know where we'll be in fiscal '15 with pretty good certainty. So we'll have a lot more to say about this over the next couple of calls, Art, because I'll have a lot better knowledge after we actually go through the process. We've told our employees what the voluntary buyout is. We want them to think about it over the holidays and talk with their families. We want to do this the right way, and I'm confident that we'll get where we need to be.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Nesvold with Jefferies & Company.","Elliott Waller - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Elliott Waller on for Peter. Just continuing in the cost savings, just questions for you. Just how many people approximately were offered the buyout? And your charges that you spoke of in the next quarter, how many people does that assume, ballpark estimate, in terms of accept those buyouts? And then should we expect charges going forward into fiscal '14?","Alan B. Graf","Elliott, the -- most of the voluntary buyouts offered are at FedEx Express and FedEx Services. There'll be a significantly large population, but I'm not going to get into details of numbers. As I said, we expect it to be in the thousands of those who will take the voluntary buyout, and I've given a number between $550 million and $650 million. We will book the majority of that in the fourth quarter as contracts are signed as opposed to spreading that out. So we will have most of the voluntary buyout -- will be in fiscal '13. There will be some continuing costs associated with the program that will go into fiscal '14, but they will not be material compared to the savings that we'll see in '14. So we'll have a plus in fiscal '14. I just can't tell you how big it is today, but I will certainly give you some indication at our next call, and then we'll have a great definitive answer for you when we report our year-end earnings.","Frederick W. Smith","We have a question from Andrew Meister. Are you actually trying to affect turning freight from one network to another for the long-term benefit of both FDX and your customers? And how do you affect such changes, if so?","The reality is we don't affect those changes. The customers affect the changes, and it depends on a number of factors. But again, referencing the Wings Club speech, what you'll see is one of the most important elements in the transportation market over the last decade is the increased price of fuel. From 2001 to 2011, the price of diesel and jet fuel went up about 4.5x. So that by itself drives people to make price service trade-offs, and obviously, the more expensive Express transportation, the more energy intensive, because it's built around aviation, and it drives people to make decisions. Second is the relationship of value per pound of the product that's being shipped. Mike mentioned a cell phone provider, I think it was a communications company, and they moved from Express to SmartPost. Well, what happened there is cell phones went from being exotic, expensive devices to much lower-cost commodities, and so the need to move them with the same speed requirement declined. That's happened to a lot of the electronics trade across the Pacific. And they may be moved in air transportation for a product release, but over time, as the value per pound of the product goes down, they might move to ocean transport. So it's a dynamic process, and we're not doing this. It's a function of what the customers want, and we, then, have to be prepared as we are to efficiently handle it. And that's what the FedEx portfolio does. We can handle nearsourcing or Trans-Pacific. We can handle the most economical shipment in our Ground and SmartPost network or the defibrillator for the surgery tomorrow for a first overnight delivery. Now I do think that the rapidity with some of these changes over the last few years has been something that we've had to deal with, and that's what we talked about in the investors and lenders meeting. And the reality is that things didn't come back the same way after the big recession as everybody thought they would, and so clearly, the voluntary buyout and the new networks that Dave Bronczek are putting in place are reflecting what customers want. So that's the answer to how traffic churns in the network. It's not us. It's the customers and the macroeconomic environment and the input costs, particularly the price of fuel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Ceraso with Credit Suisse.","Patrick C. Geekie - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","This is actually Patrick Geekie on for Chris. We haven't talked too much about Freight thus far in the call, so I wonder if you could elaborate on the current competitive environment and in particular pricing that you're seeing right now in the market.","William J. Logue","Okay, Chris, this is -- or this is -- Patrick, this is Bill Logue. The -- I would say from a competitive perspective, obviously, the market is a very competitive market. There is a -- on the pricing side, again, pricing remains rational. Obviously, the contract renewals and pricing is -- gets a little more challenging as you go through this time of year with the volume levels where they are. So again, we're seeing some of that in the market space. But overall, we're happy with where we're positioned in the market space. Customers are responding. As you saw, our volume growth continues on both volume and yield growth, and so we're getting yield improvements, and we're getting volume. And the customers are using both services, which is, again, the value that we put out with our new design model. So from that perspective, I think we're in good shape. And I said earlier, we're going through a -- our Q3 is a challenging quarter. So again, I want to make sure that, that's something that we're very focused on and building through Q3 to get us ready into a -- our strongest quarter, which is Q4. So from the market's perspective, challenging as we go into this time of year, but I think -- and I'll let Mike comment on some of the yield initiatives.","T. Michael Glenn","Well, as Bill indicated, when you're dealing with softness in the economy and you have the number of competitors that we are facing in the LTL industry, there is certainly opportunity to see more aggressive pricing. But I would reiterate what Bill said. I would consider the market rational. I think our team has done an outstanding job, again, working with the freight operating company, selectively being aggressive where appropriate and at the same time being focused on improving our yields. And as I stated before, without the impact of fuel, our yields went up 1.9% during the quarter, which I would characterize as very solid performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Gallo with Wells Fargo.","Anthony P. Gallo - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of questions tied to the headcount reduction. It was $550 million to $600 million (sic) [$650 million] in charges that equate to about a $300 million run rate benefit that begins in May of '13. Did I get those numbers and timing correct?","Alan B. Graf","Well, I didn't comment on the run rate in '14 and I'm not going to, but you got the fourth quarter charges correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.","David Vernon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick question. Looks like we're getting very good volume growth in the Ground segment, 8% and 17% in SmartPost, perhaps maybe not as much operating leverage as you'd expect in the business with that kind of volume. There were some comments about network expansion costs and Hurricane Sandy and stuff like that. Could you help us to understand what level of nonrecurring costs might be in the Ground result for the quarter?","David F. Rebholz","Well, I'm not going to comment specifically on the specific numbers, but what we were trying to point out to you is every year we have expansion costs in this quarter because we time when we're bringing on capacity in anticipation of peak. In terms of the fuel, that's relatively public information that's -- you've got to be looking at what those fuel trends are. All up, I didn't think that our return on that growth rate was a bad number, so I'm not sure what else I can add to that, but I would ask Alan if he wanted to comment on it beyond that.","Alan B. Graf","I think Dave told you earlier about our biggest customers who are having seasons that are higher than they even forecasted. And so that means that we had to add late additional capacity in November and in December to be able to handle the volume surges that we had not planned or forecasted and still make the service commitments that we made. So that's probably a little bit of nonrecurring because we've really had an unbelievable peak so far as we've given you the numbers. But having said that, knock on wood, the weather's been pretty good, and I think we'll have a great Service week this week and expect that we will continue our expansion at Ground. And we will have to have some of the things that we're dealing with next year, so there's a little bit of that in there. But generally speaking, the margins in Ground are solid, and they're going to stay solid and their growth is going to continue.","Operator","And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation's second quarter earnings release conference call.

Good morning everyone and welcome to our discussion of results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. First, I'd like to say that on behalf of more than 300,000 FedEx team members around the world, we are deeply saddened by the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines flight and extend our deepest concerns to the families and friends of those aboard.","Now as we all know, historically severe winter weather has been a factor in all of our lives these last several months and it has significantly affected our third quarter earnings. In fact, it\u2019s been the toughest winter in which FedEx has ever operated. We\u2019re very proud, however, of the FedEx team for delivering outstanding service despite the hardships posed by a severe weather during December\u2019s peak shipping season when many team members volunteered to work on Christmas Day, and then in January and February when it really got bad. So, let\u2019s hope for spring.","Delivery metrics for this year\u2019s peak shipping season were among our best ever, I might note; thanks to the unique FedEx culture based on our Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding. The FedEx strategy of maintaining separate Ground and Express network with multiple hubs proved to be especially important during the season and an advantage for our customers during that severe weather and the peak shipping season. On days when the weather was closer to normal seasonal conditions, our volumes were solid and service levels were high. ","Despite the near-term impact of weather, the $1.6 billion profit improvement program at FedEx Express remains on track. Our accelerated stock repurchase program initiated in January reflects our confidence in achieving our ambitious financial goal. ","A couple of points worth noting, FedEx Express next month is scheduled to formally open its North Asia-Pacific regional hub at Kansai International Airport in Osaka reaffirming our commitment to providing customers with greater access to and from markets in Asia-Pacific, the Americas, and Europe.","Express will be opening a new hub station and call center in Mexico City in the coming week, and recently reached a significant milestone in its European growth initiative which started in October 2011 and now has seen FedEx Express Europe opening its 100th new station in Seville, Southern Spain.","I would like to call your attention to two recent speeches on global trade and transportation that I gave for the Company to both air and ocean transport professionals. These two presentations are posted on the Investor Relations website, and I think they will give you a good view of our view of the overall market.","In closing, I\u2019d like to congratulate the entire FedEx team for making the Fortune\u2019s World's Most Admired Companies list once again. FedEx is ranked number eight overall and number one in the delivery industry.","Now let me turn the call over to Mike Glenn and Alan Graf.","Mike Glenn","Thank you, Fred. I\u2019ll give some brief comments regarding our economic outlook as well as our yield performance during the quarter. We expect economic growth to look better in calendar \u201914 than in calendar \u201913, though growth remains moderate overall. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2.6% for calendar \u201914 and 3% for calendar \u201915. For industrial production, we expect growth of 3.4% in calendar \u201914 and 3.7% in calendar \u201915. On a global front, we expect growth of 2.8% globally in calendar \u201914 and 3.1% for calendar \u201915.","Turning to yields, in the Express Domestic segment excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic yield per package increased 1.9%. This increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvement followed by weight per package and service mix. ","In the Ground segment, yield per package increased 2.4% excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by product mix, rate, and discount improvements and an increase in extra service charges. ","In the international Export Express segment excluding fuel, yields increased 1.7% primarily due to a change in service mix.","In our FedEx Freight segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight declined 1.9% year over year. Rate and discount improved during the quarter and weight per shipment increased. Overall, FedEx had a very strong peak season, and I want to thank all of our team members for delivering on The Purple Promise.","And now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Graf.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Winter weather often negatively impacts our third quarter results but the impact of multiple severe storms during the third quarter of 2014 was more pronounced than usual, reducing earnings by an estimated $125 million versus last year. Our results for the third quarter also included a negative impact of fuel. These headwinds were partially offset by the benefit across all of our transportation segments of one additional operating day as well as reduced growth in salaries and benefits.","Revenues increased 3% to $11.3 billion, primarily due to higher volumes at Ground and Freight, and as Mike mentioned, yield increases at FedEx Ground. ","Express revenues were flat due to the negative impact of lower freight revenue, lower fuel surcharges, and as I mentioned the unusually severe winter weather offset by a stronger base U.S. and international export package business and one additional operating day. The demand shift from our Priority International services to our Economy International services continued to negatively impact our results in the near term.","Express operating income and operating margin increased due to stronger U.S. and international export package business and lower pension expense, partially offset by the lower freight revenues, the estimated $70 million year-over-year negative impact on operating income of winter weather, as well as higher depreciation expense. ","In addition, operating income benefited from one additional operating day and the inclusion of costs associated with our business realignment program and the prior year results. Operating income also reflects a negative net impact on fuel.","Turning to our Ground segment, revenues increased 10% to $3 billion due to both volume and yield growth at Ground and volume growth at SmartPost. In addition, revenues were negatively impacted by the severe winter weather and were partially offset by one additional operating day. ","Average daily volume at Ground increased 8% while SmartPost volumes grew 2%. Ground segment operating income increased 2% to $477 million driven by the higher volumes and yields. Operating income includes the estimated $40 million year-over-year negative impact of winter weather at Ground. In addition, the increase to operating income was partially offset by higher network expansion cost as we continue to invest heavily in the growing FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost businesses as well as the net negative impact of fuel. The Ground segment results also benefited from delayed start of the holiday shipping season in this fiscal year and one additional operating day. The decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the negative impact of the severe winter weather and the negative net impact of fuel.","At Freight, revenues increased 9% due to growth in average daily less than truckload shipments of 7% as well as weight per LTL shipment. In addition, the quarter was positively impacted by one more operating day partially offset by the negative impact of winter weather. Freight segment operating income and operating margin increased due to the positive impacts, the higher average daily LTL shipments, higher LTL weight per shipments, and greater utilization of rail in the FedEx Freight economy service offerings. Fuel costs increased 3% due to higher average daily LTL shipments. On March 3rd Freight announced it will increase certain U.S. and other shipping rates by an average to 3.9% on March 31. ","As we look at our outlook, I should remind everyone that as of February 28, 2014 approximately 75% of the 3,600 employees accepting voluntary buyout, vacated their position. The remaining 25% will depart by May 31, 2014. Our third quarter results included benefits from the voluntary severance program, and additional benefits realized from our voluntary severance program will continue as the fiscal year progresses.","We expect the earnings growth to continue in the fourth quarter driven by ongoing improvements in the results of all of our transportation segments. Our expected results for the fourth quarter will continue to be constrained by the low end of moderate growth in the global economy and continued challenges in demand shift trend from our priority international services to our economy international services at FedEx Express. ","We project earnings to be $2.25 to $2.50 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $6.55 to $6.80 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. We are reducing our full-year earnings per share guidance, largely as a result of the weather impact in Q3 and the beginning of Q4. The outlook also assumes the market outlook for fuel prices and continued moderate economic growth. This outlook reflects share purchases made to date, but does not include any benefit from additional share purchases. We do plan to continue purchasing shares under the program but have no specific timeframe for completion. As of February 28, we have 15.2 million shares remaining under our current.","We continue to execute on the profit improvement programs we announced in October 2012. These activities are focused primarily at Express and Services. The majority of the benefits from our profit improvement programs will not incur until fiscal 2015 and to a greater extent in fiscal 2015. Our ability to achieve the profit improvement target and other benefits from these programs is dependent upon a number of factors including the health of the global economy and future customer demand particularly for our priority services, which has not returned to the growth trends that we assumed in October 2012 when we announced the profit improvement program.","In our economic outlook as Mike discussed, coupled with continued execution of our profit improvement programs in Express and profit growth at Ground and Freight, earnings, returns, and cash flow should all increase over the next several year. ","I would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the severe bad weather the past several months. Our service levels were outstanding and they are truly an amazing team. ","Now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Justin Yagerman, Deutsche Bank. ","","Rob Saman - Deutsche Bank","Good morning guys, this is Rob Saman on for Justin. I guess, Alan, going back to the profit -- 1.6 profit improvement plan at Express, could you give us a sense what the cost run rate was on that profit improvement at the end of the fiscal third-quarter and how much you\u2019re expecting to see that ramp up in fiscal \u201815 and \u201916; if you could talk a little bit about some of the cost tailwinds you\u2019ll get from the opening of the Osaka hub, looking out later this month.","Alan Graf","Rob, I'll be happy to start the conversation and then I'll ask Dave to make some comments. I think the \u2013 well, I am most pleased about our profit improvement program is our cost management, not just at Express, but really across all of FedEx Corporation. It's been an outstanding job. We\u2019re seeing a lot of traction, I am pretty excited about what we're going to deliver in \u201815 and particularly towards the end of \u201915 on our outgoing run rate. ","We are in our business planning cycle right now for \u201915. So I'll have a lot more to say about that in June when we will tell you about the end of our year, and what we think '15 is going to look like, but that is not only on track, but probably ahead of plan. ","As we -- as I alluded to in my opening comments, we are not seeing a strong international trade and global growth right now as we had anticipated back in October of 2012. So, we are going to have to continue to work very hard on rightsizing our network, which Dave is going to talk to you about here next to match our new strategy which is to embrace international economy, and we\u2019re doing a good job there and we're going to really pick up a lot of traction on that in the next 12 to 18 months. So, let me pass it to Dave.","Dave Bronczek","Thanks Alan. Thank you Rob for the question. We are having great success with our fleet modernization. Our Boeing 777\u2019s are flying at well in excess of 99-plus reliability and service performance. Our new 767s are flying even greater than that in the high 99% range. We\u2019re very pleased with that. Obviously the aircraft maintenance fees and so forth are reflected in that because we have brand new engines and new planes, and so we\u2019re very pleased with that. We\u2019re pleased with the voluntary buyout at Express. It\u2019s actually more along the lines of 90% of our people have now accepted the plan, even though corporately it\u2019s at 75%.","And in the United States, if you look at our numbers, there you saw the 1% decline in our salaries and wages and benefits line, that\u2019s in spite of the fact that we had the bad weather and so forth. We\u2019re making tremendous progress there and really across the Board in all of our five pillars for profit improvement, but on the issue of Osaka, that actually affects and improves our profit improvement for international, we\u2019re very excited about that. I'll be there in April to do the ribbon cutting. We have lot of customers that are joining us there that gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility on volume increases or decreases quite frankly. There is a lot of flexibility to move up and down in our change of gauge operations in Asia Pacific coming into the United States. ","So we\u2019re very pleased that that is allowing us more flexibility. We\u2019re also taking advantage of the underbelly capacity that\u2019s around the world in moving our deferred traffic in several lanes that are lower cost for us. So, right across the board, we\u2019re executing our plans and we\u2019re very confident.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll take our next question from Nate Brochmann, William Blair & Company.","Nate Brochmann - William Blair & Company","Good morning everyone. Thank you for taking the question. I just wanted to talk a little bit, clearly there is lot of network disruption both on the revenue and the cost side during the quarter. Can you break that down for us a little bit in terms of what was the revenue impact and what rebates you might have had to give back if there was any service disruptions over the holidays versus what\u2019s on the cost side? And as you talk about some of those costs going into the next quarter, where you\u2019re seeing the biggest impact and trying to make adjustments there? Thank you.","Alan Graf","Nate, this is Alan I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll have the Opco\u2019s CEOs all comment on it. This was really unprecedented winter weather. We had bad winter in fiscal \u201911, but we are so much more advanced and so much more productive today than we were back then. To have a $125 million impact to us was really beyond the realm of believable for almost all of us. In Express, we estimate probably lost 40,000 packages a day for the quarter, Ground probably lost 100,000 packages a day for the quarter. Obviously, we had significant amount of over time, de-icing planes in the wrong place. We had a number of service disruptions that we had to declare, but fortunately because of the flexibility of our separate operating company and the number of hubs that we have at Express, we were really able to maintain an unbelievably high service level.","And our customers were very excited about that. We were open on Christmas. Henry will talk to you about how he ran his hubs seven days to week to meet customers\u2019 demand and service levels. And so, even though it was a big impact, we were very pleased with how well we performed and we would have had an unbelievable quarter had it not been for the weather and the fuel headwinds. I\u2019ll let Dave add to that and Henry.","Dave Bronczek","Yes, thanks Alan, that\u2019s right. We showed an improvement of 14% this quarter year-over-year and that of course was -- we should have done much better than that if the $70 million of weather impact wouldn\u2019t have impacted this quarter, but we ended up having the flexibility once again, although it cost us some money to move planes around and move customers\u2019 packages around. When Indianapolis got clobbered with weather and ice and snow, we were able to move it to Memphis and vice versa and New York was the same. So we weren\u2019t paralyzed with one hub that would be shut down over a long period of time. We were able to be more flexible.","Our customers have told us repeatedly how greatly they appreciated the fact that we were able to move their packages around over the holiday peak and through January and February, and quite frankly, it did cost us a little bit more money and more overtime and more deicing and -- but I am very, very proud of our team at Express, they did a tremendous job."," ","Henry Maier","Hey, Nate, this is Henry Maier. FedEx Ground operates a highly engineered and automated network that enables us to be faster and more reliable than the competition. But significant weather events therefore can disrupt the precision of our network driving increased costs. I think at last tally I think we had 20 significant weather events in the quarter. While safety is always our top priority if line haul loads don\u2019t move due to unsafe conditions or road closures, our hubs get behind causing short times to be extended. This puts the end of the line stations behind requiring them to work more hours to recover. As Alan said, while we plan to work seven days a week at peak in the months of January and February, we had a weekend operation running somewhere every single weekend.","So the impact of weather and fuel on our margin for the quarter was roughly 1.5 points, but thanks to the incredible dedication and professionalism of FedEx Ground people, we were able to provide safe and reliable service despite the worse weather we\u2019ve seen in four years.","Bill Logue","Yes, this is Bill, on the Freight side, again revenue up 9% for the quarter was an excellent quarter for us from that perspective. It probably was impacted on certain days by the weather. I would say the overall impact was large in our operating income although we had a really good quarter, it was held back due to the impact of the weather for sure. ","The line haul side of it, particularly the rail side, we saw some good utilization of rail that helped us work through these winter challenges, that was a positive. And these front line efficiencies obviously, anytime you go through these weather events, it will slow you down and make you -- impact you significant on your cost structure. I would say from my perspective, the big challenge this winter was, it wasn\u2019t one big event here, one big event there, it was weekly. There was always some event every week which is very challenging to run a line haul network when you have constant events week-to-week. Overall, I think the team did a fabulous job of working through the situation.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Ben Hartford of Baird.","Ben Hartford - Robert W. Baird","","Hey good morning. Alan, could you provide a little bit of context to the CapEx number following $200 million. We got the flight schedule here. It looks like there is some shifting here in 2014. Can you talk about the reduction in CapEx? What the source of that reduction here is for the fiscal year? ","And then can you provide any context for the next couple of years? I know it\u2019s early. I know you are in your budgeting process, but whether the $4 billion CapEx number over the next couple of years is still the right number that we should be thinking about. Thanks.","Alan Graf","","Largely timing and also we continue to scrub and purchase better and push things out. Again, we're at the low end of the moderate economy growth frankly as [I'll say] (ph) slow in my opinion and the weakest recovery from any recession even. There are a lot of reasons and so that\u2019s enabled us to do licensing. Having said that, we still are committed to our re-fleeting at Express and our expansion at Ground and I think if you take note of our great improvement that we're having at Freight, we're very pleased for what that is and are expecting great things from them over the next couple of years. So, we'll probably stay in the pretty high range of the $4 billion or so and a lot of that will be determined by timing, whether our plan is delivered in May or June, obviously can impact that. But we don\u2019t have anything other than from pushing back and timing issues right now and we're still committed for that. We need those 767s, I mean every time we get a 767 and replace it with MD-10, it's a $10 million annual positive impact to the P&L despite the higher depreciation. So, we're going to continue that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee, Citi.","Chris Wetherbee - Citi","Hey thanks. Good morning. When you think about the total value of the profit improvement plan relative to some of the progress you've made so far which sounds like it\u2019s kind of working in the right direction and doing well relative to expectations and then comparing that to sort of the economic backdrop which is maybe a little disappointing relative to what you initially thought. Does that change your thoughts and your ability to get that for '16? I guess I am just kind of understand sort of the puts and takes both for short-term and longer term as you think about that sort of total number.","Alan Graf","I will start and then I will pass it over to Dave. I mean we still are committed to having a 1.6 billion profit improvement as we exit fiscal \u201816 going into \u201817. We can still see it very clearly but it\u2019s not the same way we constructed it back in October of 2012, no question about it. Fuel prices have been working against this, and they could have been a benefit over the next couple of years in terms of that timing. We've had some benefits from pension and we'll see where long-term interest rates go, but basically as I said earlier, our cost programs working exactly as designed if not better. Our productivity improvements are very good although there were totally masked, had bad weather in Q3, you will see in Q4. I think the range I gave you for Q4 is pretty heroic for us and that will give you an idea of how will we executing FY14. Dave?","Dave Bronczek","Alan is right about all the expense initiatives. They are all performing exceptionally well. We didn\u2019t put in, if you will recall, in our 1.6 billion profit improvement, very much incremental revenues. It was mostly expense. The challenge for us is the base revenue of course, so if the base revenue deteriorates, we'll have to find more opportunities on expense and that\u2019s the balancing act that Alan has mentioned several times and that we're reviewing all the time. So, yes, we are performing well in all the areas of our expenses. Global economy isn\u2019t what we thought it would be and so we're looking at other opportunities on expenses. Now that being said, the global economy gets a little bit better, it\u2019s all good news.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.","Scott Group - Wolfe Research","Hey thanks, morning guys. Wanted to ask about the Ground segment and first on the volume side, so last quarter there was the issue of Cyber weekend pushed into this quarter and we didn\u2019t see that shop and better volume this quarter, I know there\u2019s some weather here. But how do you think or how should we think about Ground volumes going forward? Can we get back to a double-digit volume growth rate or is that unreasonable here? ","And then just along the same lines, just on the Ground side, when do you think it\u2019s reasonable to think Ground margins turn positive year-over-year again?","Henry Maier","This is Henry Maier. Let me talk for a minute about peak. The Ground segment experienced record peak in terms of revenue, volume and service. And despite certain challenges including the compressed calendar and weather, our on-time service for the month of December exceeded 99%. So we feel really good about that, I mean a lot of -- some of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the fact that customers work shorter days or work low, we saw more customer closures in the quarter than we have in memory. I mean certainly in my 30 some year career in this business, I have never seen the number of major cities in the mid-west and east entirely shut down for a day due to weather and unfortunately we don\u2019t see that volume come back when things recover.","So I think also Fred said in his release that on days where we had good weather, our volume performed exactly the way we expected it to, when we didn\u2019t have good weather, we were off considerably from what we expected it to be. So I think a lot of what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter is driven by this very severe weather situation we\u2019ve had in last quarter. And I\u2019ll tell you that nobody more than the Ground team and the rest of the Express team are looking forward to spring coming. With respect to our margins, I can tell you that we expect margins in the mid-teens. As I have said before on this call, there isn\u2019t anybody on the Ground team that would be satisfied with anything less. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.","Ken Hoexter - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Great, good morning. I just want to follow up on the cost side. I guess if you look at your profit improvement plan and if you add the one point of impact to Express, you would have done a 3% margin ex the weather, that\u2019s up about 70 basis points, in the first quarter you had 50 basis point year-over-year, second quarter is a little murky given Hurricane Sandy a year ago. So it doesn\u2019t seem like the benefits are accelerating to a very large extent in terms of hanging in that 50, 70 basis point improvement year-over-year. In order to try to get to your double-digit margin target, I guess how much more of the profit improvement plan do you still have to execute on and can you still meet that kind of 75% done by the end of next fiscal year target?","Alan Graf","Ken I will just tell you that I am not trying to time it anymore because of the changes that we've seen in the course of our strategic change. I feel very good about how we\u2019ll be exiting FY15, although we\u2019re not done with our business plan. And as you look at -- if we look at where we\u2019re going to go, this is going to continue to fill. As we said, we still have not exited all the people that we were and Dave takes a very big burden in the services expenses. Fuel has worked against this again this year and it's a fairly significant number on an annual basis and we\u2019re hopeful that that will turn because it should average out in the long run and that should be also a benefit in the next couple of years, we\u2019ll have to see. But as I said and as Fred said, we are still on track, we will be on pace by a year from now to be pretty close to that number on an exit basis. Not an average for the year but on an exit basis. Dave.","Dave Bronczek","That\u2019s right, the end of the FY15 and through FY16 it's by the end of FY16 is what we\u2019ve always targeted. Of course the profit improvement includes the voluntary buyout and the fleet monetization and all those things start building on each other and they accumulate. So, one thing that has been a major drag for us this year has been fuel, the net fuel and they always reverse but this year has been an incredibly difficult year for us on net fuel. And so when you look at our expenses, if not in a big way, I mean we talked about whether this year, in the third quarter fuel dwarfs that for the FY14.","Alan Graf","Also one last thing Ken, we are learning and doing very good job of handling this very strong growth in an international economy, bringing our cost structure right there, that\u2019s going to take a little bit longer than I might have anticipated in October 2012. But frankly we didn\u2019t see how much the ship was going to be. IP is still growing but at low rates, international economy is growing very strong and so that continues to grow and we continue to manage that cost structure that will also accelerate our profit improvement.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty - Macquarie Capital","","Hi thanks for taking my question. Fred, I just wanted to have the bigger picture questions to you kind of the changing landscape with e-commerce, sure you have heard about suggestion that FedEx and UPS can\u2019t be fast enough or nimble enough to meet the needs of some of these guys and they are more relying on regional delivery companies. I just want to get your thoughts on that suggestion. And then maybe what you may be doing to adapt to some of the changes that e-commerce is obviously bringing despite your peaks, things like that.","Fred Smith","","Well, let me say a couple of things on a broad scale and then I\u2019m going to ask Mike Glenn if he will comment about e-commerce overall. Couples of things that you got to remember about e-commerce, in certain ways its back to the future. There was a very large business of catalogue, shopping a long time before there was e-commerce, it\u2019s just the order entry system was a piece of paper or telephone versus a mobile iPhone or a wonderful app or excellent software by an e-commerce provider and the primary delivery mechanism for e-commerce for catalogue delivery was in the past and it will remain for the foreseeable future, the postal services around the world because you are moving mostly lightweight items in the residences and the challenges of moving lightweight items in the residences are very formidable in terms of the cost structure. ","So, our operations in the residential sector we very carefully manage and I think one of the reasons we had a great deep season is because Mike\u2019s sales and solutions group run by Don Colleran do a very good job of contracting with our customers so that we don\u2019t over promise or say we can do things that end up not being able to do. And when we launched FedEx Home Delivery, Henry was very involved in that and we recall as well it was important that we had traffic demographics of a certain weight per package and certain revenues that made it profitable from the get go. ","So, the real challenge about the e-commerce role is delivering those lightweight items to residences and Amazon talks about this constantly, the postal services getting a lot of business from various sources because of e-commerce and probably the biggest challenge is the fact that so much of the business comes in such a short period of time. And obviously it is not possible to make these enormous capital investments for two or three weeks out of the year. So, I suspect that what you will see on a go forward basis is a bit of realism on the part of consumers and providers as to what the infrastructures can provide even the postal service, because remember, the postal service is not geared up to operate for just those two or three weeks either. ","So, there will be lots of innovative solutions in this regard. One thing is very clear and that is the information systems that the consumer driven mobile society have today are very, very important. You can\u2019t just drop a package for an e-commerce shipper into an anonymous hole and they\u2019re going to be satisfied where they are coming out sometime on an indefinite delivery window. They actively want to be a part of that process, they want to know when it shipped, they want to be able to redirect it to a location. This is an incredible capability that we have and UPS also have and it\u2019s going to become a bigger and bigger feature. So, it\u2019s hard to see the landscape as this thing rolls out but we\u2019ll take a very disciplined approach in our presence in that business, because you can clearly go broke trying to delivery non-compensatory packages in to people\u2019s homes. Mike? ","Mike Glenn","","Thank you, Fred. Let me just say e-commerce has a long runway of growth opportunity for FedEx both domestically and internationally and we\u2019re poised and well positioned to benefit from that, the range of services that we have running from same day delivery in select markets to home delivery in smart approach aligned perfectly with the needs of e-commerce customers and I can tell you based upon our discussions with small and large e-commerce customers, there is certainly a need for the service and they appreciate the portfolio that we offer. ","Regarding regional carriers, they have long play to role in this market segment and will continue to do so. Having said that, they do not offer the same feature to service that FedEx offers and certainly the same level of reliability that FedEx offers. And regarding speed, let me just make the point that nobody operates faster networks than FedEx. ","So, we are very comfortable with our ability to provide the flexibility that we need to meet the needs of e-commerce customers. I think, the point that Fred made that its critical for us though is to be selective, you can go after a lot of e-commerce volume and be pretty pleased with your year-over-year growth rates but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s going to fall out of the bottom line. So, we have taken a very disciplined approach and one of the things that we have to take into consideration is the big impact. You can\u2019t, as Fred said invest significant capital to operate three to four weeks out of the year. So, when we are pursuing growth opportunities in e-commerce, we make sure that we have a proper balance between growth, the 11th month of the year versus the growth in P. So, we have a disciplined process, but I can tell you that nobody operates faster networks than we do, nobody has the breadth of services that we do to serve e-commerce. And we're pleased with our position and as I said, there is a long runway of growth opportunity for FedEx here.","Alan Graf","","I might just ask Rob Carter to comment on the incredible demands that consumers are placing on carriers in the e-commerce sector?","Robert Carter","Well, not just consumers, but the entire information ecosystem is so explosively growing around this. As our volumes peak in our network, our information systems peak at an even greater rate, so you can see when you watch this technology, you can see the consumer interacting with the shipments that are far greater percentage than they have even been in the past. They carry it with them in their pockets and on their tablets, so the shopping phenomenon is certainly a big part of it but also the tracking and accountability of that delivery is a big deal in today's consumer world and with the technology that they are equipped with.","Alan Graf","","I will just make one final comment and then hopefully we've answered the e-commerce landscape question. One of the things that happened during the peak season this last time is there was a disconnect between when the merchants in some cases were shipping the items, they in essence showed that they have been shipped when they actually have not been tendered to the carriers. And of course, if you don\u2019t have a possession scan or know that creates a lot of pressure and extra work on part of the our customer service folks [that connect] (ph) in our particular case. I think you will see that very much change this go around and that will eliminate a lot of the -- I think the angst that a lot of people had when they placed an order, they think it\u2019s underway. It actually hasn\u2019t been tendered through a carrier, that gap is going to be closed and people will have a much better visibility of what\u2019s actually going on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.","","Scott Schneeberger - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning. Shifting to FedEx and international, the 8% volume growth obviously very strong, we've seen it above double-digits recently. Just curious, is that something that you see returning to higher growth rate? Was there something regional moving around there? And then as a follow-up, could you just address the capacity issue brand specific any update there? Thank you.","Alan Graf","","Yes, that\u2019s correct. We have been running double-digit and of course it was 8% international economy and we feel strongly that, that will continue to grow. Don\u2019t forget in the international export and economy, its U.S. International is part of that international number and we did get some weather impact into our volumes even in U.S. International OPA. And from to a certain degree from Asia back into the U.S. because the plant being shut down, because of the weather back here in U.S., we have a tremendous market share, as you know. So, we're very bullish on international economy. We've repositioned our network so we can move our more lighter weight deferred traffic into the belly of some of our partners now and leaving our very valuable, very fast, very reliable PurpleTail fleet available for that higher yield and package.","Fred Smith ","","This is Fred Smith. let me make a comment here because I suggest that you read the speeches we put up on our IR network. It\u2019s important to focus on the details of what we say in those speeches and not just the top line. The reality is the Express market continues to grow. The global Express market continues to grow and we continue to take market share within the global Express market. ","The sea container business continues to grow. What\u2019s changed is the commodity air freight, the big consolidations going generally airport to airport and that cohort is being squeezed from both the door-to-door Express which, if it\u2019s very urgent and time critical, moves on our priority network and the opening of the new Osaka hub will be terrific in that regard of giving us these unprecedented transit time. And if customers are willing to take another couple of days in transit, same pick up in delivery, same IP interface, customs clearance and so forth but that can we loop in these prolific underbelly.","And electronics are a technology product, are a very big part of the total air cargo market in its broadest sense, but many of those products are much lighter weight today. They are not being -- the new products are not being introduced, so the type of door-to-door small shipments light freight and packages is continuing to grow because the internet in this perfect shopping universe are there by being connected to everybody else is creating this force field, that\u2019s why Mike Glenn said that international e-commerce has a long runway. So it\u2019s important that you separate these market segments to be able to correctly analyse the marketplaces that we\u2019re working at, and we\u2019re also in that sea freight and commodity air freight business with FedEx trade networks, we can handle that too. But the growth area is basically the door-to-door Express segment.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jack Atkins of Stephens.","Jack Atkins - Stephens Inc.","","Good morning guys, thanks for the time. I guess to focus my question on, I am curious if you could maybe comment on what sort of abnormal weather impact if any, that you\u2019re assuming for the fourth quarter guidance. And could you maybe quantify the negative impact from fuels, the consolidated operating income relative to your expectations in the third quarter. Thank you.","Alan Graf","Well we didn\u2019t give any guidance on the third quarter, so I\u2019ll just say that our guidance for the year is always anticipated that we would have some negative impact in fuel year-over-year and that\u2019s about as far as we\u2019re going to go on quantifying that. So, we don\u2019t -- it\u2019s not a GAAP number, I\u2019ll just remind you that there is a lag time between when we buy fuel and when we can surcharge fuel. And that means that there is anomaly between and a disconnect between year-over-year this year and year-over-year last year.","In the long run it should even out and that of course ignores the elasticity of the fuel surcharge itself but from your cost standpoint it should average out. So we weren\u2019t surprised by that, but we thought it was important to remind everybody that it did have a year-over-year impact.","Operator","Thank you. And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz, JPMorgan.","Tom Wadewitz - JPMorgan ","","Good morning, Alan I know this is a quarter early really to talk about fiscal \u201815 you\u2019ve already mentioned you haven\u2019t done the full planning. But I was wondering perhaps you could provide a broad comment. If I look at your guidance for fourth quarter, I believe the adjusted number is something like 12% earnings growth year-over-year. If I look at the street consensus for next year, it implies -- fiscal \u201815 implies something like 28% growth. So clearly the street is expecting some big acceleration in, I would think primarily in the cost initiatives maybe there is a little implicit improvement in the economy.","But I was just wondering if given what you kind of broadly see, if you think that that\u2019s just an unrealistic ramp up in terms of what you would see coming in on the cost side or if you could offer any kind of broader comment of expectations versus what you might see for fiscal \u201815? Thank you.","Alan Graf","Well Tom you\u2019re exactly right, it is too early to talk about FY15. And I really don\u2019t know what you and others have in your FY15 number, I am assuming that a lot of that EPS is from our accelerated share repurchase program, which will have a very big positive impact to EPS next year as we will be largely done by the end of this fiscal year with maybe some to go in the first quarter of next to have a big impact. I think run rate in terms of our cost reduction programs, which you can see in Q4 will only improve from that and I guess I\u2019ll just have to fill in the blanks in June. Because we\u2019ve got a lot of planning going on right here, a lot of initiatives underway, we get some things that we want to do that probably won\u2019t pay off in FY15, but will in towards the end of \u201816 and beyond that we\u2019re debating. So, lot of work to go and I look forward to having that conversation in June.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield, Raymond James.","Art Hatfield - Raymond James","","Well I was going to ask about \u201815 too but I won\u2019t even try. Alan if you could, I am assuming your fourth quarter guidance assumes the ice storm you had in the first week of March. Is there any way at this point in time you can quantify what kind of impact that has on fourth quarter? And finally can you tell us what the diluted share count was at the end of Q3?","Alan Graf","Yes, I'm sorry I didn\u2019t answer that question earlier. It\u2019s just that the very beginning of March we just had another one and so we\u2019re not used to that in the fourth quarter. It's probably not going to be significant but it\u2019s going to have some impact and we\u2019re trying to assess that right now, looking at the same methodology that we used in Q3. [Indiscernible] asked about \u201815, I think that\u2019s what everybody is wanting and like I said, we should have a good show for you in June Art, and that\u2019s the best that I can say at this point.","On the share count, yes, the share count for the three months ended in the quarter, well average diluted shares with 307 million versus 317 million a year ago. So obviously what\u2019s happening in that share count is that not only are we buying shares back, but the increase in the stock price has brought back into the calculation previously anti-dilutive option, there were 8 million of them a year ago, there was just a few of them this year. So, that\u2019s why it was only a few cents impact to the quarter of our share buyback in Q3.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. ","Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital","Yes, good morning everyone. I won\u2019t be the third in row to ask about fiscal \u201915, but to maybe the longer term question for Fred or Mike, we obviously feel you guys delivered some pretty good service results here for customers in quarter even with all the challenges in the peak, but what\u2019s the ability long term to drive better price outcomes, because obliviously even adjusted at 3% express margin looking for best return, I think if your look at your profit improvement plan obviously the targets are much higher if compared. Is there anything structural that can be done in this industry to extract a little bit more price for that service that you\u2019re going to offer. ","Mike Glenn","","This is Mike. We make pricing decisions regarding the economic conditions to market conditions and the value of the service that we provide and obviously that critical component of our yield management activity that we do on week-in and week-out basis. The main issue is to make sure that it\u2019s not a list rate issue, the main issue is as we work with customers to make sure that we get an appropriate price for the values and service that we provide, a lot of factors go into that. Obviously the productivity of certain lanes and head haul versus backhaul in the freight business and how we utilize and configure network in internationals. So, it\u2019s not a one size fits all by any stretch of the imagination, it\u2019s been up OPCO-by-OPCO service-by-service plan that we work very closely with the OPCOs. ","Having said that I think our yield performance given the situation that we\u2019ve been in and the weak economy, has been quite solid and it will be a continued focus area for us, yield improvement is an important part of our profit improvement plans and one that we focus on a regular basis and I\u2019m confident and our ability to execute that. our sales team does an outstanding job negotiating with our customers and making sure we get an appropriate yield for the future service that we provide and they\u2019ll continue to stay focused on that but we have a very disciplined process around that where we work with the OPCOs week-in and week-out to manage our yields. But it\u2019s not a one size fits all and that will continue to be a focus area for us. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.","Bill Greene - Morgan Stanley","","Hi there, good morning. Mike I\u2019m curious if you could elaborate on something that Fred said earlier about e-commerce and being careful about growing some of the high cost residential deliveries too quickly. Does the UPS experience in December create an opportunity or is it more of kind of a lesson learned about what can happen when you do grow that business too fast or don\u2019t have sort of the proper controls in place to measure it into a network. ","Mike Glenn","Well, we have enough to worry about at FedEx as opposed to commenting on issues that UPS might have. But I can tell you that we take a very disciplined approach working with our customers and its already started for next peak to make sure that we have a balance between the volume that we carry during non-peak versus the volume that we carry in peak, one the biggest challenges that you can have is over committing your resources during peak season because that\u2019s the recipe for service failure. I think one of the strategic advantages that we have is to do separate network of Express versus Ground and the hub configuration that we have allows us to have more flexibility and manage our network independently. So we can make commitments to the express or make commitments to Ground that don\u2019t necessarily impact the other operating company. ","So, we work very closely with our customers, we make firm commitments about the traffic that we\u2019re going to carry for them during peak and then obviously it\u2019s a daily dialogue with these customers during peak season, if we happen to have excess capacity on the next two or three days, we will work with customers and say we can take a little more volume or we\u2019re going to have to stay at their level that we pre-negotiated. So, it\u2019s an art, it\u2019s not a science, there is a lot of science built into it but when you actually get into the battle, it becomes an art and the flexibility in our networks and the outstanding job that our solutions team does in preplanning peak is the strategic advantage for us combined with the different operating networks. ","So, I think we\u2019ve got a pretty good track record of performing during peak season and delivering outstanding service for our customers and I think you go to talk to our customers and based upon our performance during peak and our ability to meet the commitments that we made to them, they would give us a very high score for this past six weeks.","Fred Smith","","It's Fred Smith speaking here, I would make this comment that during the peak season there was a lot of press reports about the issue of e-commerce and so forth and many times you would see that the FedEx name up on the collar of the TV or store, the reality is by historical standards, we had a terrific team and the Express company has done a fantastic job measured relative to years past and I think the reason for that was the very disciplined approach we take that Mike just talked to you about. The network design that we have and we just have this incredible commitment to the Purple Promise like our volunteers out there on Christmas cleaning up anything that was held up in the network because of weather and so forth. ","I think the change this year is we live in a world where Twitter and social media make anecdotes much bigger than perhaps they are and this whole phenomenon of e-commerce as people get better and better mobile devices as Rob was talking about where you can shop and monitor things coming in, that was the big difference from our standpoint. ","From the operational standpoint, at Christmas time we had a very, very good peak relative to few years past. So, we just plan to continue on doing that and planning very carefully to make sure that we don\u2019t disappoint people and that we provide that high level of service because at the end of the day, that\u2019s the business, that\u2019s the franchise. So, I just could not be more proud of our folks and we were disappointed that we kept getting pinged with the big problem in e-commerce and I tell by saying one other thing for those of you who are interested in the c-commerce world, the e-commerce world has grown very fast and there are a lot of people trying to gear up and meet this demand and quite frankly a lot of the processes that a lot of the e-commerce folks use, have many quality issues with. ","There are packages that are [forward named] (ph) to be damaged because they are not packed well. There are labels that are not affixed to the packages very well. As I mentioned earlier, there are e-commerce shipment advises when the shipment actually hasn\u2019t been tendered to the carrier. I can promise you that the customers are not going to tolerate those types of things over the long haul. So, the e-commerce shippers that succeed long-term are going to be the one that work with us and other folks to try to improve those processes and quality of their service because nobody wants to order something over the internet, get it three days before Christmas and it\u2019s smashed or the label comes off of it and the package into the ether.","So, we're working very carefully with our customers on these aspects as well but it\u2019s a big part of the e-commerce business that really didn\u2019t get enough publicity last year because they were an integral part of the problem even more than the weather and the carrier performance.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Troy of Susquehanna Financial.","Matt Troy - Susquehanna Financial","","Thank you. Fred in your comments on March 11th, you made some pretty detailed remarks and shows to isolate protectionalism, it\u2019s something that have been hampering world trade. I was just wondering when you look at that dashboard, what are the one or two key items you see coming down of pipe that may, it depending on how they break either to be favourable or unfavourable for FedEx specifically. And just more broadly long-term how do you engage to help gear some of these issues in more pro-business way whether it\u2019s engaging on a critical front or reallocating capital, I just want to get a sense of your dialogue and how you guys approach being part of more business oriented solutions? Thanks.","Alan Graf","","Well, first let me just give the highest accolade to Ambassador Michael Froman and the USPR team for the effort that they have underway on multiple front. The WTO agreement on trade facilitation was a great accomplishment that was the first agreement WTO in its long existence as ever concluded. So, it was long in nature, in other words many of the trade improvements that were agreed upon by the signatories take forever to put in place but at least there was an agreement. They have the Trans-Pacific partnership. They have the Trans-Atlantic initiative underway in the trade and services initiatives.","So, the most important thing that we do are as we were trying to do in those speeches is to point out to folks, of the great benefits of world trade and expanding it because at the end of the day, increased prosperity comes from innovation, investment and increased scale, bigger market and even a market as big as NAFTA is tiny in comparison to the world population. So, you have seen over the last few years partially because a lack of determined American political leadership as it was this country that really pushed this thing from the beginning of the World War 2 on, and so we\u2019re stuck. ","The Congress of the United States today is not willing as was famously noted in the press by the Senate majority leader to even [indiscernible] taking up trade promotion authority. There is no way to consummate any of these trade agreements without PPA, because our negotiating partner simply will not seriously engage if they think the Congress is willing to renegotiating the agreement after the U.S. trade as concluded his work.","So we just tried every possible venue to push these things forward and the purpose in those two speeches in the main was to talk to those few audiences about getting involved with it. Growth is low, trade is gone from 2.5 ex-world GDP growth to roughly into parity. There has been no endeavour in human history that has lifted so many people out of poverty than the opening up of world market particularly the United States leadership and opening up ours, often permitting other countries to trade with us on a merchant realistic basis. So hopefully after the mid-term elections, the administration will earn to own this, the Congress will see the light, I think it\u2019s particularly important to try to respond to the very strong position taken by the Prime Minster of Canada and the President of Mexico that we need to negotiate NAFTA 2.0 that has been a fantastic success.","We\u2019ve seen trade between the NAFTA countries go from 200 and some odd billion dollars to over $1 trillion in the last 20 years, that\u2019s a lot of jobs, no question there have been, local pain here there in the other place but overall the opening up of these markets have been very strong. So that\u2019s the concern I expressed in the speech on behalf of the Company. That\u2019s our prescription for doing it and I appreciate you giving me a chance to make these remarks to a sophisticated group like this, because it\u2019s a big issue.","Operator","Thank you.

Smith","Thank you, Mickey. Welcome everyone to our discussion of results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 just ended. Solid FY '15 earnings resulted from strong performance from each transport segment, all of which posted higher volumes with improved base yields. Last fiscal year was a good one in several other ways. We believe the three acquisitions we announced Bongo, GENCO, and TNT they proved significant to FedEx as the additions of Flying Tigers in 1989 and Caliber System in 1998 because they provide best in class capabilities and filled critical gaps in our portfolio of customer solutions.","Our $1.6 billion profit improvement plan we outlined in 2012 is on schedule and we are confident we will reach our goal. And FedEx team members around the world again provided our customers great service especially during another record breaking peak season. Thanks to each and every one of these team members for their continued unmatched performance. We now look forward to FY '16. We are very well positioned for long-term growth, increased margins, cash flow and returns.","Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy and then Alan Graf will give you more details on our financials. Mike?","T. Michael Glenn","Thank you, Fred and good morning. We see moderate growth in the global economy. Our annual U.S. GDP forecast is for 2.3% growth in calendar '15 and for 2.9% growth in calendar '16. We expect industrial production growth of 2.2% this year and 3.2% in calendar '16. We expect global growth of 2.5% in calendar '15 and 3% for calendar '16.","Now let me turn and make a couple of comments regarding the Company's year performance by segment. Excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic package yields grew 2.2% primarily due to rate and discounts.","In the Ground segment, Ground yields per package excluding SmartPost increased 4.3% year-over-year excluding the fuel surcharge driven primarily by the change in the dimensional weight surcharge and changes in weight and other surcharges. For SmartPost yield increased 12.4% without fuel, primarily driven by changing customer mix.","In the International Export Express segment excluding fuel, package yield decreased 2.4% primarily driven by the negative impact of exchange which outweighed the positive impact of rate, discount and weight changes. And in the Freight segment excluding the impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 4.2% year-over-year and the primary driver was rate and discount and shipment class changes. Alan?","Alan B. Graf","Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Our fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.66 compared to adjusted $2.54 last year and we achieved a 10.5% operating margin on an adjusted basis. Adjusted operating income was up 5% for the quarter and adjusted net income was flat as variable compensation benefits the net impact of fuel and higher Ground network expansion expenses were headwinds for FY '15 versus '14 in the quarter.","For the year, our adjusted operating income great 19% and adjusted operating margin was 9.0% up 110 basis points versus last year. Adjusted EPS grew 27% per diluted share to $8.95 for the year.","Annual results increased sharply due to higher volumes in base yields in all three transportation segments, benefits from the profit improvement program initiatives and a favorable net fuel impact partially offset by increased incentive compensation and higher aircraft maintenance expense.","As we look at Express we had a great quarter. Express Q4 adjusted operating income was up 12% versus last year's adjusted income and adjusted operating margin improved 130 basis points to 8.9%. Our adjusted operating results at Express improved due to higher base yield and U.S. domestic volume growth, the benefit from profit improvement program initiatives and lower international expenses due to currency current exchange rates. These benefits were partially offset by an unfavorable net fuel impact, higher incentive compensations and a negative impact from weather from the early March weather.","Revenue decreased 4% at lower fuel surcharges and unfavorable currency exchange rates more than offset base yield and volume growth. U.S. domestic package volume grew 2% driven by a 3% increase in overnight box. The growth of our adjusted profitability despite lower revenue is a strong testament to the continued cost management and productivity improvements.","Turning to our Ground segment, ground margins for the quarter were negatively impacted by the GENCO acquisition and related integration expenses as well as increased self-insurance reserves. Outside of these factors, the ground operating margin would have been just slightly less than last year's 20%. Ground's average daily volume grew 5% in Q4 primarily driven by growth in residential deliveries. SmartPost average daily volume decreased 1% due to the reduction in volume from a major customer. Excluding that customer, SmartPost volume grew 16%.","Freight also had a good quarter despite a sluggish lessened truckload environment with operating income increasing 5% or 1% higher revenue year-over-year. Operating results improved primarily due to the positive impact of higher LTL revenue per shipment which is benefiting from our ongoing yield initiatives.","As you know, we previously announced during the fourth quarter that we changed our method of accounting for our defined benefit pension and post retirement healthcare plans to a mark-to-market procedure which recognizes immediately in our earning during each fourth quarter actuarial gains and losses resulting from the re-measurement of the funding status of the plans. We believe the immediate recognition of actuarial gains and losses on the mark-to-market accounting is a preferable method of accounting as it aligns the recognition of changes in the fair value of planned assets and liabilities in the income statement with the fair value accounting principles which are used to measure the net funding status of the plans.","We incurred a pretax mark-to-market loss of $2.2 billion in the quarter versus a $15 million gain in FY '14 from our actuarial adjustments to pension and post retirement healthcare plans. Our operating segments continued to bear the service and interest cost for their employees that participate in a defined pension and post retirement healthcare plans.","Although actual asset returns are recognized in each fiscal period through the mark-to-market adjustments, we continued to recognize an estimated return on plan assets or EROA in a determination of net pension cost. At the segment level we have set our expected return at 6.5% for all periods which will equal our consolidated expected return assumption in FY '16.","In fiscal years where the consolidated expected return is greater than 6.5%, that difference is reflected as a credit in corporate eliminations and other where periods have been recast to reflect these changes. Mark-to-market accounting now in place we will see less volatility in pension expense at the segment level. In fact pension expense in our FY '16 guidance is flat year-over-year versus our adjusted FY EPS of $8.95.","Last week we announced that we were boosting our quarterly dividend by 25% for a total of $0.25 per share per quarter. In Q4 we repurchased $1.4 million shares at an average price of $170. Over the past two fiscal years we have repurchased a total of 45 million shares at an average price of $136 per share. Share repurchases increased adjusted earnings year-over-year by $0.12 and $0.53 per diluted share net of interest expense for the fourth quarter and the year respectively. As of May 31, 2015 we have 12.2 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase.","Turning now to the outlook and based on the economic outlook that Mike discussed and the momentum we have, we project adjusted earnings to be $10.60 to $11.10 per diluted share for FY '16 before any year end mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. These are driven by continued improvement in base pricing, volume growth and benefits from our profit improvement program. These factors will more than offset anticipated increases in salary and benefits as well as in anticipated unfavorable net fuel impact for the year. The outlook does not include any operating results nor integration planning and acquisition related expenses for TNT Express.","Looking at Express's outlook, we do expect revenues and earnings to increase during FY '16 as U.S. domestic base yields improved and international export package base yields improved as well. And of course we will continue to focus on revenue quality when managing our cost and productivity.","We expect operating income to improve through the continued execution of our profit improvement program including managing network capacity to meet customer demand, reducing structural costs, modernizing our fleet and driving productivity increases throughout our U.S. and International operations. These savings will increase towards the latter part of the year as our various cost reductions and efficiency programs continue to gain traction. And as Fred mentioned and Dave will discuss, we are on track to achieve our profit improvement program as we outlined in 2012.","Ground revenues and operating income are expected to continue to grown in FY '16 led by volume growth across all of our major services due to market share gains. We also anticipate yield growth to continue during the year through yield management programs including our dimensional weight rating changes. Effective September 01, 2015, SmartPost will no longer be a subsidiary and will be merged into Ground.","SmartPost will continue to be an important service offering in the FedEx portfolio by dissolving a subsidiary and merging the business into Ground will enable increased flexibility to leverage the strengths of both the Ground and SmartPost networks. We will launch new software that will enable us to combine packages that are destined to a common delivery address. This increased delivery density enhances efficiency and productivity and profitability.","Due to these operational changes in our SmartPost service we will begin to recognize revenue on a gross basis at SmartPost and for SmartPost revenue services starting in FY '16 including postal fees also start in Q1. We anticipate this change will dilute Ground segment margins by 100 to 120 basis points, but will have absolutely no impact on Ground's net profit or cash flows. Higher network expansion costs will continue to partially offset Ground's increase in operating income in FY '16.","At Freight we expect continued revenue, operating income and margin growth in FY '16 to be driven by volume and revenue per shipment increases from our differentiated LTL services as well as continued network and operational optimization. Freight is working diligently to improve productivity.","Although we don't give quarterly guidance, I'm going to give a little bit for the first quarter here. With the profit improvement initiatives at Express continuing to gain traction throughout the year, we project much stronger profitability growth in the second half of the year. We also expect year-over-year growth in our first quarter to be less than the current consensus due to higher annual incentive compensation accruals in FY '16's first quarter compared to FY '15.","Capital expenditures are going to increase in FY '16 to approximately $4.6 billion. The increase from FY '15 is largely due to the higher investment and the continued expansion of the Ground network. Both the commercial and residential service offerings at Ground continue to grow, thanks to industry-leading speed and reliability and continued growth in e-commerce. Given Ground's historical high ROIC, investing in network expansion fits our financial objectives as well as our operational objectives.","Moving to our tax rate, in FY '15 our effective tax rate was 35.5% including the impact associated with our mark-to-market pension accounting. We expect the FY '16 effective tax rate to be in the range of 36% to 37% before any year end pension adjustments and excluding any impact from the TNT acquisition.","And lastly, I want to point out that our balance sheet remained strong and the rating agencies have reaffirmed our ratings inclusive of the TNT acquisition.","With that, we will open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.","Robert Salmon","Thanks Alan. If you could provide a little bit more color with regards the fiscal '16 guidance, perhaps just an update with regards to the profit improvement plan how you guys exited the fiscal fourth quarter?","And should we be thinking about something to the tune of $2 billion to $4 billion of EBIT at Express looking out to next year or are there some kind of costs I think you had called out a net fuel headwind? Perhaps you could also give a little bit more color in terms of the overall expected headwind related to fuel?","Alan B. Graf","Well, I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Dave. Yes I think everybody has figured out the math by now about what Express has to earn to hit our running rate in '16 and you are not far off. But we're doing very well here in terms of hitting our profit improvement program and we will hit it. And I'm going to turn it over to Dave who has under his leadership has done a masterful job of getting the company in the position that it is in.","David J. Bronczek","Thanks Alan and thanks for the question. Yes, we\u2019re very confident. We\u2019re on track, we\u2019ll hit our 75% run out rate, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all figured that out in your models by now, had a great quarter almost $600 million of profit, 9% margin, up 30% or more for the year. Our team has done a fantastic job in all five categories of our profit improvement plan. So we\u2019re on track, we\u2019re on target, we\u2019re excited about the future and I look forward to more of the questions.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Christian Wetherbee","Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe a question on pricing and just some of your thoughts around sort of the domestic environment and seen from a competitive standpoint that price sort of the posture towards pricing is improving from your major competitor. Just want to get a rough sense of how you\u2019re seeing sort of market develop within fiscal '16 and maybe what is embedded in the fiscal '16 guidance from a Ground standpoint? Thank you.","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. I would characterize the pricing environment is very rational, in terms of Ground pricing obviously the change that we\u2019ve made with the dimensional weight surcharge is now in full effect and we expect those trends to continue. So I just would characterize the pricing environment is rational.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.","Alex Vecchio","Hi there, good morning, it\u2019s Alex in for Bill. Could you just clarify the comments on the first quarter expectations for year-over-year growth to be a little bit less than consensus, is that a reference to just the overall earnings per share growth rate? And also just talk a little bit about why exactly the run rate of the savings or the expected savings is going to be more back half weighted than front half weighted or just a little bit more clarity there would be helpful?","Alan B. Graf","Sure, this is Alan. The good news for our employees and our team here is that we\u2019re all working really hard to continue to grow our cash flows and our earnings and that\u2019s reflected in whether are there going to be higher accruals for our incentive compensation programs and in particularly in the first quarter, the accruals going to be significantly higher than it was a year ago. And so that\u2019s going to mean that we\u2019re going to come in below what the current consensus is for Q1, but that\u2019s also factored into our annual guidance of $10.62, $11.10.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.","Ben Hartford","Hey, good morning guys. Dave, this is a question for you on within Express, as you think about the progress that you\u2019ve made hitting your marks on the profit improvement target, it looks like the margin profile looks a lot like it did throughout the mid-2000s obviously cresting, than just shy of 10%, you made some changes with regard to compensation within that segment.","I\u2019m curious how you feel that that segment fits, how it may differ today relative to last cycle to give us a sense whether when you conclude this program, there is further upside opportunity as it relates to margins in the segment or maybe not and you believe that you\u2019ve improved the capital intensity, so return on invested capital at that margin level is better than cycle, but any perspective that you might be able to provide today and over the next 12 months, how Express sits relative to the mid-2000s would be helpful?","David J. Bronczek","Well, thanks and it\u2019s a great question because you\u2019re right, we are cresting right at 10% before the big recession. I would say we\u2019re actually in a better position and better shape right now because we have actually brought our whole company around the world more in line with our cost structure and our revenues and so our differed packages now around the world are making us more money.","Our network is more aligned to the right packages in the right network. Our U.S. transformation has been fabulously successful where we have reduced our headcount, reduced some of our stations, we\u2019ve consolidated our routes. So for last time around when our margins are up so high, we\u2019re better positioned now than we were back then. The second half of the year for us of course is big as it was this year. We were running over 35%, ended up because of the mark-to-market and so forth, some adjustments weather and fuel, we ended up the year at 30%. So I would say, we\u2019re on track and probably a little bit ahead of where we were in FY '15 going out into FY '16.","Our team has done a great job. Mike Glenn and his team with my team managing the revenues and the yields around the world, but it\u2019s a very good question and I appreciate the question because we were very proud of where we were back then, we\u2019re actually in a better shape going forward now.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie.","Kelly Dougherty","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the Ground side, what obviously team reports about your peers kind of stepping up their yield improvement initiatives, so how should we think about you responding competitively? Should we think that benefits more on the pricing side or maybe from a volume perspective if you\u2019re looking to be maybe a little retrospective than they are to take some additional share? So just kind of wondering how things shake out in Ground with this more rationale pricing environment?","T. Michael Glenn","Well, this is Mike Glenn, let me make a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Henry Maier. We\u2019re currently working with our customers to plan for peak to ensure we have the right amount of capacity in the right places to provide outstanding service which we\u2019ve done in the last couple of years.","I think the most important thing regarding peak pricing, however, is to ensure that you have the right pricing in effect year round to make sure that it covers the investments that we make in our network to provide outstanding service. So the right pricing for 12 months a year is first and foremost the primary objective not just pricing for three to four weeks during the peak period.","Having said that, we\u2019re going to continue to monitor peak season shipping trends and evaluate potential pricing changes on a customer by customer basis as required to ensure that we have the right return on investment. But let me reemphasize again, the key to peak pricing is to have the right pricing in place 12 months out of the year, not three to four weeks out of the year.","Henry J. Maier","Yes Kelly, this is Henry Maier. Let me just add that when we look at customers in particularly the way we allocate capacity at peak, we allocate capacity to our existing customers, we don\u2019t take on any volume for just one month a year. And it\u2019s really important that we do that, because our customers tell us that our ability to serve their needs during the peak season really drives how they expect to give volume to carriers the rest of the year. So we deal with that holistically with pricing, but just philosophically we very much base peak capacity, very scarce peak capacity to the volume we get the other 11 months out of the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.","Scott Schneeberger","Thanks, good morning. Staying in Ground, I\u2019m curious, obviously a little bit of slowdown in industrial production and the economy of weight. On B2B what kind of trends did you see in the quarter and what are you thinking about with your outlook for B2B in the fiscal '16? Thanks.","Henry J. Maier","Scott this is Henry Maier. Volumes in the quarter were up 5% year-over-year. I can tell you that I think volume for probably the last nine months has been a little bit on the soft side, but that\u2019s just us, we\u2019re always just as tight with our volumes. We\u2019re not seeing anything that would suggest that there is anything going on here.","I think that there clearly were some inventory disruptions with the port situation on the West Coast last year. We saw that manifest itself mainly at peak because we saw volumes from customers come from places that frankly they didn\u2019t expect them to come from and we didn\u2019t expect them to come from either. I think most of that is flushed out now and we expect fairly normal business levels going forward.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Jack Atkins with Stephens.","Jack Atkins","Good morning guys. Thanks for the time. Just going, getting back to the Ground segment, could you maybe comment for a moment on the integration cost that you mentioned from GENCO, that it may weight on the profitability at Ground during the quarter, do you expect that to continue during FY '16 and can you quantify that?","And just to follow-up there, Alan you talked about merging the SmartPost subsidiary and that could be dilutive to margins in FY '16 for Ground, could you maybe flush that out a little bit as to why that\u2019s the case?","Henry J. Maier","Jack, this is Henry Maier. So let me, there are two questions there, let me take the first one. We are actively involved in integrating GENCO into FedEx. We have a very disciplined process for doing that. It takes 12 to 18 months to pull that off. There are integration costs that we have to incur doing that. I think that we can expect that with the full year results of GENCO and our plan with very, very light profits as a result of these costs, that GENCO will be a drag on our margins for FY '16.","Concerning SmartPost there is a number of things going on with SmartPost. First of all, we made a decision this year to merge SmartPost into FedEx Ground. We did that for three reasons, one our people provides more opportunities for SmartPost people within FedEx Ground and vice versa, operating them as a separate subsidiary created some burdens or some obstacles to clearly moving people back and forth between the two companies.","In the area of service, we\u2019ve discovered over the last couple of years that we can maximize the use of facilities, both SmartPost facilities and Ground facilities not only do we drive cost out of the equation but we improved service and this change helps effect that. And then finally on the profit side, we expect OpEx to go down significantly as a result of this change, because we will have more efficient line haul and we\u2019ll make better use of our capital assets without adding CapEx going forward.","Now as Alan alluded to, we have our piece of software that\u2019s going to be released this summer which will allow us to match addresses in the network between SmartPost and FedEx home delivery. When we get two packages going to the same address, we\u2019re going to divert that SmartPost package into HD for delivery. We get significant savings when we do that as you can imagine.","The accounting rules suggest that when we decide where the pack, what network the package is ultimately going to go into for delivery, we have to recognize gross revenue instead of net. Now there is absolutely no change in the profitability of any of these services. SmartPost will continue to be a very important service offering in the residential portfolio, but adding that gross revenue portion to the top line with no corresponding operating profit dilutes Ground\u2019s margins by 100 to 120 basis points.","Operator","We will go next to Art Hatfield with Raymond James.","Art Hatfield","Hey, good morning everybody. Every so often we hear about a prominent user of parcel services that is deciding or trying to decide whether or not they want to do delivery on their own. And I think it creates a lot of confusion about the impact that that may have on your business or UPS\u2019s business. Can you kind of address what the impact any one customer could have on your business and how people should think about that? Also whether or not they could become a competitor throughout over the long haul?","T. Michael Glenn","Well, first of all, let me just say that setting up a transportation network is an extremely capital intensive network, requires very sophisticated information technology and takes a very long time to build out to scale, to be able to provide the type of service that customers expect.","I think what a lot of people lose in this conversation is the fundamental input cost on pickup and delivery and that while technology today has certainly made user interface much more streamlined and easy as in the case of some of the applications we\u2019re all accustomed to today, the fundamental input costs have not changed.","The other part about it that I think people lose sight of is the customer experience. Research has indicated time and time again that a uniformed person with proper identification showing up at your doorstep is an important issue for customers and consistency of customer experience is very critical in that regard.","So when you talk about the challenges of building a network of scale, the input cost, the technology issues and the customer experience required to deliver what customers expect of companies like FedEx and our primary competitors, it\u2019s a pretty tall hill to climb.","So, obviously we continue to monitor these situations and opportunities that that pop up from time to time, but we feel pretty comfortable in terms of our strategy going forward and our ability to serve the e-commerce market and our customers. So I hope, I have answered your question.","Operator","We will go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","Hey thanks, good morning guys. So Alan with the guidance for the year being a little back ended, can you help give us some numbers to just get some comfort in terms of how big is the incentive comp or stock based comp headwind in the first quarter or the first half of the year? And is it right to think that becomes a tailwind in the third and really the fourth quarter and how big of a year-over-year tailwind is that going to be in the back half?","Alan B. Graf","Well Scott as you know, we usually don\u2019t get down that sort of granularity level, but it\u2019s significant to the first half versus last year\u2019s last half and particularly the first quarter, because we\u2019re accruing at a higher rate. I think we go from 8.95 to our range, it\u2019s a significant achievement for all of our employees and we need to reward them accordingly. ","We\u2019re talking about incentive is cash compensation here. We\u2019re talking about our annual incentive compensation program. We\u2019re not talking about any of our stock or stock option program to simply related to the cash part of our incentive compensation. So it\u2019s significant, it\u2019s in the yearly guidance and as I said, we've given you quarterly guidance because frankly I couldn\u2019t hit the numbers. So I freely admit that, but I\u2019m very comfortable about the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Wadewitz with UBS.","Tom Wadewitz","Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit more on Ground; you've got a lot of moving parts going on there. If I look at the fourth quarter numbers and assuming I\u2019m looking at the right adjusted numbers, it looks like operating income was only up a touch year-over-year and I\u2019m wondering should I assume there are maybe some GENCO costs and so forth? But how much operating profit growth would you expect, is it in Ground in fiscal 2016, is it 5%, is it 15%? What is the right ballpark to be in for operating income growth in Ground?","And I guess under SmartPost comments, I\u2019m a little confused, I think you\u2019ve said well, there are efficiency gains from integrating SmartPost with the Ground network and so forth, but we wouldn\u2019t expect any change in profitability in that. I understand the optics of the margin impact to gross revenue versus net, but wouldn\u2019t there be some operating income benefit over time from that integration? So just a couple there on Ground. Thank you.","Alan B. Graf","Hey Tom, I\u2019ll start and I\u2019ll turn it over to Henry. Your question about net income in the quarter, that is the result of our increased self-insurance reserve catch up that we\u2019ve had to make in the quarter and that\u2019s why that net income is flat. The margin was down because of the GENCO addition of revenue with very little income associated with that. And so I\u2019ll turn it over to Henry for the rest.","Henry J. Maier","Yes, I think it\u2019s safe to assume that there is going to be fairly significant OpEx savings with the SmartPost change, obviously there is a lot of moving parts there. We\u2019re going to do that in pieces to make sure that we preserve the service and I would venture a guess to say that most of that will occur in the late second half of the year and will likely be realized in FY '17.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.","Allison Landry","Thanks, good morning. I was wondering if you could maybe breakdown the CapEx guidance of $4.6 billion between Express and Ground and directionally is the Ground spending higher or lower than maybe what you\u2019re thinking perhaps a year ago?","Alan B. Graf","Allison, this is Alan. We are significantly stepping up Ground investment in 2016 versus 2015. That explains the entire increase year-over-year. This will be the peak we believe, because as you bring on as Henry will tell you here shortly, as you bring, start building hubs and bring things online, we have a fairly substantial step function, particularly because we\u2019re so highly automated and those investments are going to give us returns right away, but that\u2019s why the CapEx is going up in 2016 and it\u2019s entirely related to our increased investment in Ground. Henry?","Henry J. Maier","Yes Allison, we have a CapEx budget in FY 2016 of $1.6 billion, 90% of that is for network expansion due to growth. This will be our peak year. I think you can expect that in '17 and years beyond our CapEx should drop 30%, 35% from where it is this year.","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. I\u2019ve got an email question from Brandon Cannon from Gutenberg Equity Research. It\u2019s regarding Ground yields. Can you provide some insight in the Ground yield exiting the quarter with first full quarter of dimensional weight changes behind us should we expect some decline and yield heading into FY '16 as customers adjust packaging?","I\u2019ve touched on this bit earlier and as I'd just remind everyone that we announced this change six months in advance and the reason we did that is to give customers plenty of time to start making adjustments and many customers have made adjustments in their packaging.","We would certainly hope that they will continue to evaluate their packaging going forward, but having said that, we don\u2019t expect any material change in trend in the dimensional weight surcharge going forward.","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ll go next to Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch","Ken Hoexter","Hi, great. Good morning. If I could just follow up again on Ground, it seems like a lot of questions, but just because you\u2019re spending more and obviously you\u2019re talking about lower margins and I get the GENCO lower margin impact and the SmartPost consolidated impact, but yet I think Alan you mentioned that overall Ground margins were up if you exclude a lot of that.","I just want to understand is e-commerce having a larger negative impact? And then maybe your thoughts on the contractor lawsuit and thoughts on margin impact going forward, is that something you\u2019re going to continued to see costs increasing, does that expand beyond California and other thoughts on expenses related to that? Thanks.","Alan B. Graf","Ken, Ground margins in the fourth quarter adjusted for the one-time insurance reserve change in GENCO would have been around 19.2%. The delta between last year and this year on an apples-to-apples basis would have largely been driven by increased appreciation and rent due to network expansion and I will turn the other question over to Chris.","Christine P. Richards","Hello, this is Chris Richards and I\u2019ll try to answer your question on the Alexander case in California. This settlement in Alexander results claims go back to 2000 and concern a model, but FedEx Ground no longer operate. This settlement is really unique that\u2019s why we disagree with the Ninth Circuit's decision that applies to this case. We have to recognize that decision and the size of the class and impact of California state laws on the damages sort by the class.","The settlement covers about 2,375 class members, who signed operating agreements with FedEx Ground between 2000 and 2007, but the parties have agreed that the settlement will resolve any claims, damages by the class members to the current year. California law imposes by far the most penalties and damages of any state. So if we have settlements with other states, this settlement is not an accurate measure to predict potential expense.","Ground has won more than the hundred cases of this type during its history. We continue to challenge the appeal on at the Eleventh Circuit, at the Eight Circuit and recently received very a favorable decision in the Massachusetts case which is now on appeal at the First Circuit where the district court judge granted summary judgment in favor of Ground finding that the contractors are contractors as a matter of law. So we\u2019re going to continue to aggressively defend ourselves from these claims and I want to put the Alexander case in some context.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs.","Tom Kim","Good morning. I have a question on Express, we continue to see some unevenness in your growth in IP and IE. Obviously last quarter we saw IP package volumes dip a little bit, with just the obviously incremental growth in IE and I\u2019m wondering is there anything that you\u2019re seeing to suggest that were could see a pickup in IP in the fiscal 15 outlook? And then if not can you talk about what you might have to do to adjust your cost structure accordingly, whether it\u2019s the time or fleet or even the more third party capacity or leveraging a bit more, just give us a little color on that, that\u2019s helpful? Thanks.","Frederick W. Smith","Okay, thanks Tom. Just so, the boxes which is what our focus is growing very nicely, the envelopes of course are declining. So that would be how the numbers and they all roll together, but that\u2019s where you would see that end result. But I think that going forward we were actually and several of you have sent notes to Mickey Foster on our fleet and our network and so forth, we\u2019ve adjusted our network as you probably know in April where we actually adjusted our system form and shutdown one of our Trans-Pacific flights. So we are down one Trans-Pacific flight there now.","That being said, we have adjusted it to the point where we still actually have 83% of our traffic moves as international priority and when we are moving deferred traffic, removing it in a system like our FedEx Freight network system, it actually makes more money on our deferred traffic as well. So we\u2019re well positioned, boxes are growing, documents are declining somewhat in International and so going forward we think we are in very good shape.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Yes, good morning everyone and thanks for taking the question. I was aware if the team can just comment on what was seem economically, because it sounds like you took that in your growth forecast for 2015. And if I heard Mike correctly, it sounds like you had some acceleration based on the 2016. So are there expectations from your customers, what\u2019s driving the brighter outlook in the back half of your fiscal \u201816 year?","And then, if I could follow up as well on Tom Kim\u2019s question here, if things aren\u2019t that great, it looks like you do have a net reduction in your fleet for the first time in quite some time at Express, can you talk to, apart from the Trans-Pacific frequency is there domestic capacity that can also be rationalized?","Frederick W. Smith","Let me go ahead and start with the second part of your question, where we are actually modernizing our fleet. So we\u2019re getting rid of very inefficient fuel burning aircraft of high maintenance to a newer fleet, better maintenance, better reliability, better fuel efficiency. So we\u2019re balancing our fleet in the United States and around the world and that\u2019s part of our profit improvement plan.","T. Michael Glenn","This is Mike Glenn. The primary reason for the lower GDP outlook for remainder of 15 and as the first quarter, as you know the first quarter came in at negative 0.7 GDP growth year-over-year and as a result of that, that took down the annual number. We do expect stronger growth in the second half of the year and our forecast really hasn\u2019t been materially changed in the second half.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Matt Troy with Nomura.","Matt Troy","Thank you. Just a quick one, I wanted to understand directionally you guys with the self help initiatives have done a lot of heavy lifting in the Express segment and it seems to be an undercurrent of concern that the targets for next year maybe backend loaded. You\u2019ve done a good job of explaining how incentive comp is driving some of that. But given the magnitude of what you came in on an EBIT basis and then got a year left to target, can you just help us in light of the confidence you expressed in then make-ability, what are the major buckets to get there?","I mean is there primarily at this point, those aircraft retirements you talked about and the fleet enhancement, how much of it is to tied to things you can directionally control in a line of sight because you seem very confident in the make-ability? I just want to make sure this isn\u2019t primarily something pricing or volume dependent. That would be helpful.","Alan B. Graf","Hi Matt, I'll start, this is Alan. First of all its really much more of a first quarter issue again and its incentive compensation, but also our maintenance expenses expressed is going to be flat year-over-year and it was fairly high in the third and fourth quarter. So that\u2019s another benefit to the second half, but more importantly, let me just say that back in October of 2012 we didn\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have any negative GPD growth quarters. We thought we were going to have a 3% to 3.5% growth rate in the U.S. and a better International none of those things have materialized. So, where we're really being outstanding is our performance across the board in productivity and cost management.","And although we don\u2019t talk about it very much, I\u2019m going to kick it over to my partner of Rob Carter on IT, because our IT transformation here is nothing short of spectacular. Rob\u2019s team spent less money in fiscal \u201815 and than they did in fiscal \u201814 and are going to be flat in \u201816 while they\u2019re modernizing our IT, making us quicker to market. I'll just let him talk about that. It is a very big part of profit improvement program and why we\u2019re part of the reason why we are so confident in our ability to achieve it.","Robert B. Carter","Well, thanks Alan. The profit improvement plan is definitely a team\u2019s work where lots of parts of the business were contributing and we are just relentlessly focused on simplifying and modernizing our IT footprint and that has a couple of really important benefits, one is it lowers costs as we modernize and simplify that footprint we spend a lot less money on infrastructure and infrastructure upgrades.","But then, secondarily it makes us more agile in these businesses that modernized footprint is much more flexible to meet the needs of the business to shift volumes and to represent customer needs more effectively. So thanks Alan we\u2019re proud of what we done and we plan to continue to relentlessly focus on lowering costs and making the environment much more agile.","David J. Bronczek","Let me jump in here. This is Dave Bronczek, Rob is right; Rob and his team have done a great job. Our profit improvement plan, we have a clear line of sight on really all five of the categories. The fleet modernization is forming magnificently. Our aircraft maintenance as Alan pointed out is going to be flat year-over-year which was always part of our plan. Our U.S. domestic operations led by Matt Thornton and Pete Gors [ph], excellent productivity, great cost control.","The International network is performing as good or better than I actually though it would be and we have the plan around the world is actually achieving all of our goals. What we actually didn\u2019t try to accomplish was over reaching on revenue.","So, Mike Glenn and his team and we partner on that is we were taking more aggressive steps on our cost, networks around the world, they are performing magnificently. So the line of site is pretty clear for us and we\u2019re very confident. ","Frederick W. Smith","This is Fred Smith, I had two questions that came over the Internet, one of them, another one about airplanes which I\u2019ll let Dave Bronczek read and answer here in a minute and a second one about Freight which Mike Ducker can answer from Washington.","For freight could we discussed ongoing yield initiatives and how they specifically relate new hires, either drivers or dock workers? Then there is a question related there, I missed it, any incremental productivity gains related to new our key deployments. I think in the macro since you can take what Rob just said for the enterprise and apply them specifically to FedEx Freight as well. There will be in the next few years\u2019 significant productivity improvements in FedEx Freight as a result in the software improvements and will be applying to the business.","Now as to the new hiring and freight drivers or dock workers as they relate to yield initiatives let me ask Mike Ducker to answer that question. Mike?","Michael L. Ducker","Yes, thanks Fred. Yes, we hired to catch up with demand from the first half and in preparation for the busy season. So our salaries, wages and education costs accelerated. Most of those are drivers which will serve us very well going forward and our teams are focused right now working hard to get the productivity increase and balance those with the volumes in the network as these new team members hit their normal efficiencies.","Also the performance on the small and medium segment has been very good in terms of yield improvements there and that was the one point that we were targeting for the most part. So the fundamentals are really sound in the business.","Frederick W. Smith","We have a question. It came in on the Internet that Dave Bronczek has now were about the airplanes and he will answer it for you. Let me make two comments here, one on the broad sounds and then secondarily to Dave on the airplane side.","I think the important thing that the people that follow FedEx should focus on is our constant comments that we are very confident that we will continue to increase margins, cash flows and returns. And we told you that in 2012 and we\u2019ve consistently done that, so let me reiterate that the management team around this table is very confident that we will continued to increase margins, cash flows and returns. ","Having said that, we are a big outfit and we buy lots of trucks, lots of ground support equipment, lots of trailers, I mean between ground and the freight, I was just looking at these numbers, the other day we have over 70,028 foot [parts]. There was an article in the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago about UPS handling oversized packages and I can tell you that the growth in those oversized packages is a big deal in e-commerce, so we are very, very hopeful that the Congress will increase the limit on twin trailers from 28 feet to 33 feet because it will take thousands of vehicles off the road, improve safety, save fuel, reduce emissions and allow both the LTL and the ground parcel businesses to better reflect the needs of the nation\u2019s supply chain.","Now as it applies to airplanes, they\u2019re just like trucks and ground support equipment. We need to buy the modernized fleet, 12, 15 airplanes a year and we continue to do that and you can count on us continuing to do that because they are aluminum, they oxidize, they wear out and the new models fortunately burn a lot less fuel and are much more reliable. For instance one of the reasons that the fleet can go down is we don\u2019t need as many spares with the new technology airplanes as we did with the old ones. Now, having said that, Dave you take over.","David J. Bronczek","Yes, thanks Fred. This question came in from William Flynn [ph] from Potomic [ph]. It says with regards to express in a recently retired 15 aircraft, 21 related engines and the adjusted retirement schedule of the additional 23 aircraft and 57 engines, what is the timeframe for the ongoing fleet reconfiguration to incrementally boost margins.","This was all part of the plan William, it was all part of the profit improvement plan, those planes that we talked about retiring they were all basically parked in the dessert, they were in engine repair that was going to be too expensive to re bring back and as Fred pointed out.","So it is probably incrementally going to boost our profits more but it\u2019s all part of our fleet modernization which is a big part of our plan. So you\u2019re right and you focused on a very important point, the fleet modernization does boost our productivity and our profitability ","Alan B. Graf","I just want to add one more thing about our profit improvement plan and our confidence. If you take anything away from today about Express, let me just focus on the fact that in the fourth quarter the revenue line was down 4% and the adjusted rate operated income line was up 12%.","So, it is lot of hard work and elbow grease, and productivity improvements, and tough cost management, that we're continuing, that we have ingrained in all of our companies and is going to continue and that\u2019s why we\u2019re so confident the way that Fred spoke.","And by the way that 12% increase in operating, adjusted operating income could have been a lot higher had it not been for fuel, incentive comp and weather. So we\u2019re highly confident about Express and that\u2019s in our guidance for '16 and I\u2019ll give you guidance from '17 a year from that, but I\u2019m just as excited about that as about \u201916.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Donald Broughton with Avondale Partners.","Donald Broughton","Good morning gentlemen and ladies. There has been a certainly, excuse me beyond your TNT acquisition in the freight forwarding space there has been one acquisition after another, after another mergers, both in domestic and global. How is it at all does it change your competitive outlook, your strategic approach to the market, CLDs, mergers and acquisitions, and you\u2019re spacing them and what especially in the freight forwarding space?","Alan B. Graf","It\u2019s Alan. I will start. Obviously we've been very aggressive in the acquisition space, so a long number of years. I expect we will continue to be aggressive in the acquisition space over the next several years. I mean we invest for the long term around here, but we also are very concerned with shareholder return as evidenced by our buyback in our increasing dividends. As to any specifics about any specific space, I will just say that depends on the fit, the culture, the price and all three of those things are vital and we\u2019ve got the, we\u2019re working on the TNT integration planning right now, which by the way is going very well. Thanks for asking. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Chris on the other\u2026","Christine P. Richards","This is Chris Richards and I have an email question that came in from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Can you give an update on the TNT acquisition and timing because it will be completed earlier than expected? Well I should I hope so. We\u2019re doing a tremendous job. We are preparing to submit our initial offering documents as required by Dutch law by the end of this month.","And we are well underway with the preparation of the necessary filings with competition authorities. We have been in consultation with European Competition Commission and continue to believe FedEx and TNT operations are highly complementary in Europe and we do not believe that the transaction faces any competition issues for the commission.","So we\u2019re in good shape. We\u2019re going to try to get this done as quickly as we can. My boss asked me this question about once a week, so let me assure you it is top of mind here at FedEx.","Frederick W. Smith","And I would like to thank Chris Richards who has had a tough time speaking the last four days and I have to tell you sometimes I would applaud my General Counsel not being able to say anything when she comes into my office, but thanks for coming out this morning Chris because I know it has been hard with that laryngitis you have.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Ross with Stifel.","David Ross","Yes, just a follow-up on TNT there, you mentioned in your guidance that that excludes any cost related to TNT, do you have any estimate on costs that you expect to be related to TNT in the upcoming fiscal year? And then just one quick question for FedEx Freight, what was the change in average length of haul year-over-year in the fourth quarter?","Frederick W. Smith","First of all we are not going to answer the average length of haul, that's down in the weeds. That's what I would call not a strategic question. But as to, yes I have a pretty good idea what we are going to spend on TNT and I'll report it each quarter as we have actually spend it ","Operator","We will go next to Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.","Kevin Sterling","Thank you. Good morning I had one, Alan you touched base on the capital spending that you gave for fiscal year 2016 talk about it, the Ground peaking, how about as we look about the 2017 and maybe even beyond when you factor in the TNT acquisition and any major CapEx needs you see in Europe?","Alan B. Graf","I think 2017 will be another year that is going to be a little bit on the high end of our range. We would like to be at the 6% to 8% of revenue, but the way our aircraft delivery schedule is shaping up at the moment, it looks like 2017 will be a little bit higher than that, maybe at 9% and 9.5% range, but after that we will just see. But as I said, if we need to make long-term investments to improve our productivity and drive these cash flows, we are going to continue to do that, whether they are acquisitions or CapEx and we have a very, very rigorous process for both.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to Mickey Foster for closing remarks.","Mickey Foster","Thank you for your participation in FedEx Corporation's fourth quarter earnings release conference call.

And welcome to all joining our quarterly call. Let me offer sincere thanks to hundreds of thousands of FedEx team members for delivering an outstanding peak season despite weeks of tough winter weather in many areas.","Quarter three was a challenging quarter. Our FY19 plan envisioned topline revenue growth of approximately $6 billion. Mostly due to lower economic growth in international regions, we expect to end the year with about $4.5 billion in increased revenues. Of course the profit flow through of the $1.5 billion revenue shortfall would of course been substantial in FY19. Nonetheless, the midpoint of the adjusted EPS guidance is up about $0.20 over FY18. Five-year EPS CAGR using midpoint of adjusted FY19 EPS guidance, I might remind everyone, is expected to be 17% and our target for long-term EPS growth rate is 10% to 15%.","We have projected FY19 earnings growth, despite a major expansion of FedEx Ground including one, the opening of two major new hubs in Pennsylvania and Connecticut this past fall; two, expanding facilities for the rapidly growing oversized package e-commerce segment; and three, transitioning to a year-round six-day FedEx Ground operation.","FY19 free cash flow adjusted to exclude voluntary pension contributions, cash expenses related to our voluntary employee buyout program is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. In addition, we expect free cash flow in the years to come to expand significantly, assuming that we have reasonable macroeconomic situation.","While that macroeconomic environment lately has presented challenges relative to our prior expectations, particularly at FedEx Express, we\u2019re quite optimistic we\u2019ll improve results in FY20 that begins 1 June. We\u2019re very enthused about the FedEx SameDay Bot, developed with DEKA Research and Development that we unveiled on February 26th. While we will have much more to say about this technology, we believe the economics of the FedEx Bot are compelling that regulatory approvals are highly likely over time, we will enter a substantial new market segment that is a logical extension of FedEx capabilities.","Let me now turn to Raj, followed by Brie and Alan for further remarks, and then we'll take your questions. Raj?","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Fred, and good afternoon.","I'm very excited to be here with you on the call today in my new role. I\u2019m also really excited about the two appointments we announced last week Don Colleran, as our President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, and Jill Brannon, who's succeeding Don as EVP and Chief Sales Officer. I worked with both Don and Jill for many years, and I'm thrilled to have their leadership in these critical positions.","I'd first like to take a moment to recognize the efforts of our team members to adapt to operational challenges this quarter. As you all know, we saw a number of severe weather events this winter in the U.S. During Q3, there were more than 17 instances of major highway closures or restrictions due to named storms. And in February alone, 50% of the FedEx Freight shipments were impacted by weather a five-year record. Thank you to our team members for their hard work and dedication in delivering the Purple Promise to our customers in these trying conditions.","As I mentioned on the last call, one of my immediate priorities was TNT integration. I'm pleased to share that we have made significant progress. The operational integration is complete in the U.S., Canada and the Middle East. We have 35% of our international stations integrated and our sales force will be substantially integrated by May 31, 2019.","As we integrate stations, duplicate pickup and delivery schedules are eliminated and routes are optimized thus reducing costs. At the hub level, our road and air hubs are outfitted with technology that enables injection of volume into the lowest cost air or road network.","Now, I want to emphasize that we are not waiting for integration to complete to add value for our customers. On February the 6th, we announced a significant integration milestone with the ability to inject legacy FedEx Express intra-European shipments into the TNT European road network. FedEx intra-European economy parcel shipments, transit time will improve on average by at least one business day on approximately 40% of the European lanes in the countries where the service is implemented. This service improvement is already launched in 7 countries including Germany and the UK and the full rollout, which includes a total of 28 countries, is expected to be complete by June.","This cross-utilization of the combined FedEx Express and TNT networks is a major step towards full integration of the operations. The benefits of this move are twofold, faster service for our customers at a lower cost.","Additionally, we announced yesterday that we have improved transit on our TNT European economy express service from two days to one day on 1,200 lanes. Our service levels continue to improve and we are aggressively moving forward to gain new business. In fact, you are seeing positive momentum in our European parcel business as year-over-year revenue growth has sequentially accelerated every month for the past quarter.","This European value proposition improvements and cost saving opportunities represent a significant impact on the total FedEx international business. Before the TNT acquisition, our European revenue accounted for around 20% of our total international business. Today, it represents approximately 40% of the combined FedEx Express, TNT international revenue.","Looking ahead, the rationalization of the legacy FedEx Express and TNT core service portfolios and the upgrades and enhancements to supporting technology are scheduled to complete the summer of 2020. And that will allow customer migration activities to begin thereafter. As you can imagine, there's a great deal of work underway on the IT side. And I'm now going to turn it over to my business partner Rob Carter to comment on where we stand. Rob?","Rob Carter","Thanks, Raj.","I believe it's well-known that the systems at TNT suffered from an underinvestment prior to the acquisition. Since then, however, we've made significant progress to modernize and eliminate legacy TNT applications. More than 600 TNT applications have been retired to-date and many hundreds more will be retired over the coming year. TNT\u2019s applications were historically very localized and bespoke. As we adopt the core FedEx applications, we're standardizing both business processes and applications at the same time. This results in improved security, reliability and speed to market, all of which improve customer experience. Due to this ongoing simplification, TNT system\u2019s reliability is at an all-time high.","Raj Subramaniam","Thank you, Rob.","To actually look beyond fiscal 2020, the integration has also uncovered numerous transformation and optimization opportunities that we will pursue. These include upgrades to financial systems, HR platforms and simplification and standardization of transactional work in our back office functions. While these activities will require additional investments, potential financial benefits are expected to be significant.","I want to reiterate that the value that TNT brings to us around the world is very clear. In Europe, we have an unmatched footprint and capabilities to deliver parcels and freight that encompasses more than 500 stations and 55,000 weekly road trips across 45 countries.","In addition to the TNT integration, there continues to be significant media and investor interest on the potential for Amazon to disrupt the transportation industry. We have been clear that this is not a threat to our business because Amazon represents less than 1.3% of our total revenue, which is substantially lower than what our largest competitor carries, nor is Amazon a threat to our future growth. I want to take this opportunity to provide some additional facts about the market we play in.","The size of the U.S. domestic parcel market is roughly 15 million packages per day. In addition, the global market for international parcel shipments is another 10 million packages per day. And we carry around 14.5 million packages per day today. Even if the e-commerce market did not grow one additional package, there's still substantial growth in the industrial sector of the market where we are extremely well-positioned to gain share due to our unmatched network and global portfolio.","So, now, let's talk about e-commerce. This represents a significant additional opportunity for growth. We believe that we are able to add to our existing expertise and provide a market leading value proposition here as well. We continue to invest and enhance our capabilities. You\u2019ve already seen several examples such as Extra Hours, FedEx Onsite, FedEx Delivery Manager and our enhanced Return Solutions. We are well-positioned to provide the best service at the appropriate price point, leveraging our current capabilities and targeted additional investments.","Now, there's an intense media focus on the quote unquote, Last Mile, but very few people think about the first few thousand miles. When you see a FedEx truck on the road, it not only is carrying those local Last Mile shipments, but also the other shipments that are originated from all parts of the globe, creating density for Last Mile delivery and higher revenue per stop. This is an inherent advantage of players who have a global network in place. Any new entrant in this space will not have this benefit and also not have any particular advantage on the input costs.","Our core business can be segmented in two basic categories, large customers, and small and medium enterprises. Large customers have complex global supply chains with specialized needs. Our international network, expertise and broad portfolio enable us to serve these customers with very sticky, customized solutions. Our value proposition is far more sophisticated than just local Last Mile, and we have bundled pricing across the portfolio.","Small and medium businesses speak simplicity and generally desire one stop shop, and they want a transportation provider who can handle their local, national, rural and peak needs. We also have a robust loyalty and earned discount pricing strategy for this segment that again rewards customers for bundling their business with FedEx.","So, in short, we have a terrific portfolio that'll allow us to grow our core business segments and we are very well placed to take share in the rapidly growing e-commerce segments. In the U.S. market alone, we expect the parcel market to double in size to more than 100 million packages per day by 2026. When you view the unprecedented growth opportunity in our industry in the years ahead, and a very small number of providers that will be able to address this opportunity, it becomes clear why we are optimistic about growth over the next few years.","Let me now briefly touch on some other key priorities. They include offering leading edge e-commerce solutions, reducing costs and improving revenue quality. We\u2019re investing in innovative automation that'll enable lower costs residential deliveries, and will be a key driver of growth for years to come. We're enhancing our networks and building specific solutions to improve profitability, such as expanding the footprint and convenience of a retail network, with FedEx Onsite, driving growth in the FedEx Delivery Manager enrollment and leveraging our FedEx Ground six-day network year-around.","I also want to show you that all our units are intensely focused on driving down the cost to serve for technology, quality initiatives, load optimization, safety improvements and many other areas. In summary, while significant work remains, I'm confident we are positioned for long-term success. We're making marked progress in our TNT integration, which represents the largest lever for improved express and overall company profitability. In the U.S., our revenue growth and market positions are exceptionally strong. And we are adjusting our revenue management and cost tactics to drive optimal performance. As we look ahead, my long-term priorities are profitable growth and shareholder value creation.","Now, let me turn it over to Brie for update.","Brie Carere","Thank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone.","Given that this is my first call, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our strategic growth priorities and why specifically I'm so excited about those growth priorities. At FedEx, we are laser-focused on three key areas that will drive this growth, small and medium business, international, and e-commerce. And let me briefly touch upon each of those now.","FedEx understands how important small businesses are to the growth of the economy and to FedEx. We have gained significant market share and revenue in this segment. We successfully delivered this growth through our efforts to optimize sales, marketing and digital capabilities and optimize our cost of acquisition. This segment is especially -- really values the market leading trends at the FedEx Ground. We also have strong programs in place that continue to gain momentum and loyalty with our small businesses, including our best-in-class loyalty program and our Small Business Grant Contest. It\u2019s programs like these that truly help us set us apart.","On the international front, we are taking decisive action to improve our results. And Raj already covered our focus on TNT in Europe. We have the most comprehensive intercontinental cargo air networks in the world. And we continue to lean into the strength, while supplementing it with new and innovative value proposition. For example, we have FedEx Delivery Manager now in 59 countries outside of the U.S.. And we are making strong progress on differentiating e-commerce portfolio through our FedEx Cross Border offerings.","Raj mentioned, e-commerce continues to be a significant driver of the growth in the U.S. domestic market. Currently, it's about 50 million ADV or average daily volume packages today and it will grow to 100 million by 2026. We have a very robust e-commerce portfolio with strong market differentiation. We are excited about the FedEx Ground 6-day network and our Saturday advantage. As we move to six-day, we added Monday while maintaining our advantage on coverage and commitment for Saturday.","Further, we expect one in four incremental e-commerce packages to be locally fulfilled between now and 2026. This is why we are so excited about our new innovations including the FedEx SameDay Bot and capabilities such as FedEx Extra Hours. As a reminder FedEx Extra Hours enables merchants to fulfill locally as late as midnight while enabling their customers to shop in the evening with next day or two-day delivery.","Across all our strategic priorities, we continue to be very focused on revenue management. We see a very rational pricing market. We also routinely review our fuel surcharges. As we announced last month and effective yesterday, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges for FedEx Express U.S. domestic services and at FedEx Ground. Although e-commerce will put pressure on yield with lighter and shorter distance packages, we continue to make structural changes to address the profitability which Raj just spoke to.","So, with that, let me take a few minutes to talk about our economic outlook. We see solid economic growth in the U.S. but somewhat below last year's pace. Internationally, performances is mixed across regions as overall growth moderates. The Eurozone and Japan still appear sluggish while emerging markets growth eases at a gradual pace. A recurring theme in global surveys on economic activity is a negative impact from global trade frictions and heightened uncertainty. World trade is slowing, and leading indicators point to positive but ongoing deceleration in trade growth in the near term.","Since our last earnings call, we have seen the overall China economy slow down further, and this has impacted other Asian economies. Given the size of China, no markets will be able to absorb more than a fraction of what China produces, but customers continue to look to diversify from China. We have also seen some customers evaluate mode optimization. Our network and portfolio lets customers respond quickly and act locally for our customers in China, as well as around the world.","In closing, our most immediate commercial priorities in the U.S. are to focus on yield growth for FedEx Express and to grow into our six-day network for FedEx Ground. In Europe, we are leveraging the value proposition improvements coming to market and are aggressively focused on gaining share. Despite economic headwinds, we believe we have growth opportunities from Asia to Europe and we will leverage our new expanded buyer base in Europe to acquire this share.","Let me now turn the call over to Alan.","Alan Graf","Thank you, Brie, welcome to the team. Good afternoon, everyone.","Slowing international macroeconomic conditions and weaker global trade growth trends continue. Asia volume weakness, which we experienced during peak season, deepened post Chinese New Year. Reflecting these macro challenges, FedEx Express international revenues declined year-over-year in the third quarter. U.S. volume growth continued to benefit from the expansion of our e-commerce solutions but yields were pressured by this expansion, lower weight per shipment and service mix changes.","With that, total FedEx Express revenue declined 1% year-over-year in Q3 versus growth of 8% year-over-year in the first half of this fiscal year.","Our strategic management committee has been investing a significant amount of time identifying operational and financial steps to address the challenges we are facing. To mitigate the lower than expected revenue trends, we have further reduced our variable incentive compensation, launched our voluntary employee buyout program, and limited hiring and discretionary spending.","FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight both had strong volume and revenue growth in the third quarter. FedEx Freight continued to focus on balanced volume and yield growth and produced another strong quarter of operating results. FedEx Ground operating results were negatively impacted by the inflationary impact, the tight labor market on our purchase transportation rates and employee wages. Higher costs related to staffing and network expansion, and the January launch of year-round six-day per week operations also impacted Ground\u2019s performance. While the launch of six-day operation was a headwind for the quarter, the use of existing assets more efficiently is a positive for the FedEx Ground business as it ultimately drives improved performance and enhances our competitive position. While these benefits are not always reflected immediately and may take time to be realized, we believe it is a winning strategy for the long-term.","Looking forward, we are now forecasting fiscal 2019 adjusted earnings $15.10 to $15.90 per diluted share. We expect year-over-year revenue and earnings growth of FedEx Freight will continue in the fourth quarter driven by balanced volume and yield growth.","While FedEx Ground year-over-year revenue growth is expected to remain strong in the fourth quarter, higher operating costs are expected to continue to negatively impact results. We expect earnings to decrease year-over-year at FedEx Express in the fourth quarter due to lower yields and continued softness in international package volumes, resulting from weakening global economic conditions, particularly in Asia and Europe.","Despite these headwinds, we are focused on executing actions to improve our performance. That focus includes the growth initiatives Brie discussed earlier and structural cost reductions we have been implementing. Next month, we will know which U.S. employees will be leaving the Company via the voluntary buyout program. They will begin exiting starting at the end of May.","Costs of our business realignment activities including the voluntary buyout program are expected to total $450 million to $575 million and will be recognized primarily in the fourth quarter fiscal year \u201819 with the remainder in fiscal year \u201820. The business realignment program is expected to drive savings of $225 million to $275 million in FY20. Similar programs are likely for employees in international regions.","If we see evidence of the further decline in international landscape or significant downturn in the U.S., neither of which we currently anticipate, we can take additional cost actions including network capacity adjustments, labor hour reductions, salary and wage initiative, aircraft delivery modifications, and deferring or extending project timelines. The implementation of multiple long-term initiatives will also drive improved performance. Those initiatives include completing the TNT integration, continuing to reduce our cost to serve the e-commerce market, improving revenue quality and improve leverage of our global scale to drive savings in our sourcing activities.","As Raj stated earlier, we remain confident in the long-term strategic value of the TNT acquisition and the synergies to be realized through a single pickup and delivery network, single air and road network, back office efficiencies, and enhanced revenue growth.","TNT integration expenses are now expected to exceed $1.5 billion cumulatively through fiscal 2021 and we may incur additional costs related to investments that will further transform and optimize the business. Timing and amount of integration expenses and other investments in any future periods may change as our plans are revised and implemented. Forecast for fiscal 2019 integration expenses is down slightly, $435 million.","Ground is well underway on a number of strategic initiatives and optimizing the Ground network through technology enhancements that enable real-time decision making based on applied data analytics. Each of these initiatives digs into opportunities, drive increased efficiency, while having a growing number of e-commerce packages, both large and small. For example, advanced loading, sorting, scanning and network operating technologies will provide near real time data to improve planning and maximize productivity. This will enable us to optimize strategic decision-making in multiple areas including our use of rail and improving residential density and the Last Mile.","With the growth of both small and large packages due to e-commerce, teams are also planning how we best optimize the use of our already highly automated assets by adding or extending source and increasing our capabilities for handling large packages. And tapping into real time data, for example, about package characteristics is integral to enabling this level of optimization for our operations and those of our service providers. Teams at Ground have made great progress and we expect several new technology tools will be implemented prior to peak with benefits realized in FY20 and beyond.","Considering the Q3 tax benefit from the recognition of certain tax loss carry-forwards, we now expect our FY19 effective tax rate will be 22% to 23% before year-end mark-to-market retirement plan accounting adjustments. We continue to expect our FY19 capital spending will be $5.6 billion. We are reviewing capital spending for FY20 and beyond and we'll have further guidance for FY20 with our fiscal year end release.","I want to iterate that we have large strategic projects underway, including the modernization of our aircraft fleet and our largest Express hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis. We're also investing in Ground to more efficiently process large packages to reduce our cost to serve residences. These investments are expected to deliver significant, long-term value-creation as we plan for the next several decades.","We are committed to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the long-term. To provide some context, since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, we have returned nearly $14 billion to shareowners through repurchases and dividends, including an 18% reduction in our outstanding shares and more than quadrupling of our quarterly dividend. During the third quarter, we repurchased 555,000 shares at an average price of $168.43.","We maintain a balanced, disciplined approach to capital allocation. Dividends and share repurchases have been and will continue to be a significant part of that. At the same time, we are making significant investments in the business to continue to position FedEx for superior performance in the decades to come. We\u2019ve balanced these priorities and decisions to invest or return capital, based on what we expect to achieve highest returns and drive the highest long-term shareholder value.","It is also important that we maintain a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity to ensure our continued ability to operate and finance the business efficiently and deliver excellent return to share owners.","As I end my comments, I will reiterate, management is focused on improving our performance, positioning FedEx for long-term success. Investments in our networks are multi-year propositions. The success of these investments cannot always be measured quarter-to-quarter. We are confident these investments will drive long-term earnings growth and improve margins, cash flows and returns.","Now, I will open it for question and answers. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.","Amit Mehrotra","Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Fred, when you started your remarks, you talked about 17% compounded annual growth in the adjusted earnings base of the Company. I also think it's -- I guess, it's important to note that free cash flow per share has gone from significant positive territory to negative territory over those years as well. So, while I fully understand and we all fully understand the importance of having long-term investment horizon, the margins of the Company are basically stagnant at best and in many periods down on a year-over-year basis. So, if you can just give us some of your thoughts on how you think about the moving pieces between balancing capital investments and returns given the performance in recent years? I appreciate it. Thank you.","Fred Smith","Well, I don't know much what I could add to the comments that you just heard from Alan and Raj. Basically, the perspective of Wall Street is always give me the money; perspective from inside FedEx is what's the best thing we can do for the long term. Now, there have been some exogenous factors that have happened. First, let me remind you that in June, June 27th of 2016, FedEx was in the middle of the largest state sponsored cyber attack in history, so-called NotPetya account that brought the British health care system almost to a halt, cost hundreds of millions of dollars for Maersk, the big sea container line. I think, I'm right, it cost $1 billion dollars to Merck, great medical company.","So, had TNT been a standalone company at that time, it would have been bankrupt. We did [indiscernible] Rob Carter and his people in recovering from that. So, I would say that the slowdown in the TNT situation on the Express side because of NotPetya was substantial as we reported at the time.","Second issue, but as Raj told you, we are very optimistic about our intercontinental network and the ability to improve margins in the Express business, because of the integration. On the Ground side, the issue is very straightforward and that is the market changed from more business-to-business to business-to-consumer. So, we could basically have decided not to address that. But as Brie mentioned and Raj both, we decided that we wanted to play in that space and that we were not only playing in it, we were going to be the market leader, and we\u2019ve gained market share in that sector for 18 consecutive years. So, I think we've got a pretty good track record of that.","So, we started this fiscal year, very optimistic about our ability to expand margins and to hit on all cylinders. But as I tried to lay out in my remarks, we anticipated a $6 billion revenue increase. We're going to end up with about $4.5 billion. And this is a leverage business and to the extent that the last few percentage of revenue points go to the bottom line at a very disproportionate rate. So, that hopefully answers your question, I mean, we're not unmindful to the issues that you're talking about, but we do think we've got a good runway in the future because we've made those investments.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.","Chris Wetherbee","I wouldn't mind picking up right through where you left off. When you think about the trends and sort of the revenue shortfall as the years gone on, how do you think about sort of adjusting to that? A lot of what we're talking about are some very interesting and started with probably important long term investments, but when you think about capacity in the short run, it sounds like you're not expecting trends to get worse, but at the same time it feels like maybe things are decelerating internationally. Can you talk a little bit about maybe what you're going to do in that quarter or two you try to stem some of that profit loss from the revenue shortfall that you're seeing?","Fred Smith","Well, you know, part of the problem about reporting quarterly earnings is, you're looking in the rearview mirror. The facts of the matter are that we actually are seeing a few green sprouts now as we go into the spring. Part of that may well be the significant weather issues that Raj and Alan both commented upon. And quite frankly, we're under reported I think because of the government shutdown and the trade issues. This was a very, very tough operational winter and in some cases unprecedented, but again somewhat underreported. So, we are seeing some pickup across the Pacific. Our package business in Europe is now growing again. And so, we're feeling a little better about things. And obviously, the range of the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that Alan gave you is related to our caution, I'm not putting too much of that in the bank. Alan may want to talk more about that.","Alan Graf","Chris, we don't have a capacity issue actually. I tried to describe we had some mix and yield issues at Express and [indiscernible] Express is the issue. It's not Ground or Freight. Express returns are what we have to work on the hardest I think we've described for you how we're doing that. But we run pretty tight capacity right now, it's just a different mix than we had expected. So if you look at Express\u2019 yields in the quarter, they were down year-over-year. And so, the mix had a big impact and one of that is the fact that we are striving to hit the e-commerce demands at the same time as we're reducing our cost structures and we're getting there. We just aren't getting there as fast as we would like to.","In terms of Ground, what's going on at Ground is nothing short of transformational. Ground is going to be in a position to significantly drive down its costs of serving the residential market and significantly increase its capacity with not much incremental capital expenditure particularly in terms of hubs. It will be investing in terms to be able to handle large packages. We love large packages, keep writing those large packages. We're the best in the business in handling those and we're going to streamline those operations even more. So, I'm not at all worried about Ground's particular margin situation here in Q3 and Q4 because I know where we're headed. So at the end the day, we're running pretty tight on capacity. We're expanding our capacity capabilities at Ground and Freight, and we're very carefully monitoring what we have available out there for FedEx Express.","Fred Smith","Let me just add one other comment here. I'll say perhaps, modestly, there's no organization in the world that knows more about aviation than FedEx, commercial aviation, not one. There's certainly some that are probably peers with us, but we have the finest aviation professionals that operate commercial airplanes. We have a lot of MD-10 airplanes that are 40 years of age. Now, we overhaul them and redid the cockpits and the one thing and another. 11 of those airplanes will be retired in next fiscal year. All of them, the MD-1010s will be gone in FY '21.","So, we're not going to slow down on that. It's imprudent to do so and I think there was one suggestion from somebody that we ought to consider that. But that is not a correct decision and our view based on our understanding of the equipment and capabilities. And as Alan has told you on several occasions, these things have great accretive capabilities. They lower our costs and improve our reliability. So, hopefully, we'll get some good news on some of this international traffic and it will go to the bottom line in the same rapid fashion that the top line diminution took it away. So hopefully that's helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.","Scott Group","So Alan, last quarter, you've talked about margin and earnings growth in fiscal '20. Do you still feel comfortable with that comment? And then, you also have hinted last quarter as international headcount reduction or profit plan. How come we don't have one yet? And then, is it sort of too late to get one that will get a full-year impact or much of an impact in the fiscal '20?","Alan Graf","You could tell me, are we going to get a trade deal done with China and is Brexit going to come out good. I could give you a lot better answer about FY '20 than I can sit in here for a moment. But we sort of have to plan for both ways and obviously the leverage right now that we have is in our international revenues, on a very large fixed cost basis. So in terms of a plan, we have a plan. No question, we have a plan, we're executing.","I think you heard Raj and Rob talk about, what's happening with TNT integration. But we're now finally getting service improvements at lower costs. We're speeding up and network by a day on 40% of the traffic. Customers are coming back. So, it's just a matter of time we have another year of integration to go. But we definitely need a little bit better economic environment in Europe to get the full benefits of TNT. We will get the full financial benefits of TNT, I have no doubt it's just a matter of when.","Operator","Jack Atkins with Stephens has their next question.","Jack Atkins","Just wanted to go back to the comments around, softening global macro condition and softening trade trends, I know you're specifically calling out Asia and Europe. But when you look through your U.S. Express results, I think it's fair to say, you saw volume declines and through your form U.S. Express package sub-segments. You also saw yield celebration in your U.S. Express business. So if you could just sort of comment on what you're seeing in the U.S.? I know you're talking about a fairly strong U.S. backdrop, but it seems like we're seeing deceleration there. We'd just be curious what's driving that?","Raj Subramaniam","Hi Jack, this is Raj. I think on the U.S. side, our overall volume continues to increase roughly 6%. And I think if you look at what's driving the growth, it is e-commerce. What we are surprised by is the fact that the way for packages and lower than what we anticipate is going to be and that is, that's impacted our yields. So we are doing, first of all, so we're in a position to gain share on e-commerce. We will adjust our cost structure to make sure that we have the right cost to serve. We are very focused on driving overnight volume growth and we are focused on revenue management as well. So there's a lot of activity going on in the U.S. today and I'm quite optimistic that we are going to get this right. And Brie, if we don't add anything to us.","Brie Carere","No, fundamentally, Raj is right. The volume is very strong. It is a lighter weight package from e-commerce perspective, which is why we have made the changes in our e-commerce portfolio that FedEx Extra Hours is a great, FedEx Express service that leverages the existing infrastructure. And again, that lower yield is two things, the lower weight and its shorter zones. As we mentioned, we anticipate that the large retailers are going to continue to fulfill locally that's going to put pressure on that top-line yields. But we have the right infrastructure to do so profitably, which is where FedEx Extra Hours and similar products come into play. Those are two issues.","Operator","Allison Landry with Credit Suisse has our next question. And we aren't able to hear you, please check your mute function.","Samantha Yellen","This is Samantha Yellen on for Allison Landry. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us some color on TNT mix? Specifically, have you been able to regain share in the European parcel market following the restoration of TNT service levels in early January?","Raj Subramaniam","The short answer that question is, yes. We are seeing actual -- we're higher year-over-year growth every month from the last 3 months we're seeing accelerating year-over-year increased in revenue and volumes in the European possible business. And as we have stabilized and improving our service levels. So it's not a surprise, you despite the economic headwinds in Europe. We now have a terrific value proposition. As I said in the opening remarks, we're releasing new value to our customers. We've improved our service and the customers are responding. So, we are seeing increased revenue, increased volumes in our core partial business","Operator","Our next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.","Brandon Oglenski","Fred I, always come back to your response to I think the first question which is, you know, Wall Street always wants to see the money? Well, I tend to agree that we can be short term focus and you guys have definitely proved over the longer going to be very growth focus. I guess if we look back 2006, I think your margins peaked out near 10% we thought to get in 2016. And it's always associated with a lot of CapEx, a lot of assets and then we go through sort of curious where you have to take involuntary separations or voluntary but incentive comp and things like that. Maybe just given the size of FedEx today have is that a new phase where we don't need to bring on as many assets, spend as much capital, maybe focus more on returns and margins because I think that's what investors would like to see, some more consistency and returns and margins over the long-term.","Fred Smith","Well, so would we. I don\u2019t know what to say? They the programs we have again are not driven because we are profitable in terms of spending capital. It's the nature of the business. We buy an airplane fleet of 700 planes. We've built the business quite frankly. We've used the airplanes and our largest competitor, when they came into the Air Express business was eight times bigger than we were. We're now roughly at parity with them. So we are in the midst of spending a significant amount of capital to replace our very old airplanes and to expand the Memphis in the Indianapolis hubs.","But again, I think as the year turned out the way we had hoped it would at the start of the year and remember it was still in October or November when the Fed was being chastised by the President and others because they were going to raise rates all through calendar year 2019. So you see the Cairns perspective right now so there's no just an act between what Wall Street wants and what FedEx want, it's the matter of whether we would be prudent and stopping doing what we were doing if we think that they will improve our margins and I think","I even answer previously to the questions you'd have a big setback with not patch you I think we would be even better results in terms of margins of Express at the moment. And secondarily, the Ground market is moved much move to residential delivery and we've moved with it. That's why we went to six day a week operations beginning January the 1st because that's what our ecommerce folks wanted. So, we believe very strongly that we will improve our margins and our returns, as Alan said a few moments ago, and we will get the benefits of the team.","Raj Subramaniam","Just want to add that. A lot of the CapEx that we're spending over the next few years is not to crease capacity at Express and it's to replace the 40 year old MD-10 and to drive better throughput, efficiency, productivity and lower costs at our two main hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis, those are big projects. Those have to be done for the long term of this company. And we do manage this business for the long term. Where I sit what I can see future cash flows is pretty impressive.","I'm not going sit here and make projections, but I'm just telling you that we don't have to expand capacity at Express for quite a period of time. We need to a Ground, but we're doing that in a unique way. We are sweating the assets, we're going to run the network more days and we're going to be a lot busier out there. As we lower our costs to serve the residential delivery areas. We had a bad quarter. No doubt about it. I'm disappointed in it. But I'm not letting one bad quarter decide how we're going to manage this business for the next five years.","I think that would be imprudent and not in the best interest of our shareholders, quite the contrary we got to redouble our efforts to get those costs down and those areas where we're seeing shorter zones and lighter weight. So that we can be as profitable as we need to be. And that's what we're working on.","Now the way, let me just add in the December meeting, our voluntary buyout we listed 3 reasons for those. First is the multi-year transformation that we've been underway at FedEx called project renewal where we have taken down hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of legacy mainframe systems and move these applications into the cloud. So, we are removing the last mainframe installations in the next year or so. And there are people whose skill sets, don't fit or they're in the wrong location.","So we're offering them a great opportunity, but we didn't want to stop renewal, because that's where technology is taking this. Second is Alan mentioned in his remarks? One of the things that we have, which is extremely important are very, very sophisticated analytics on the pick-up and particularly on the delivery side. So what you basically do is you substitute information for math, and we're not the only ones doing this. UPS talks about it. But this is going to be a profound transformation in the next few years.","So the use of AI and then robotics is also making folks that have been in staff positions. We don't require the same level of manning. And then finally, as has been mentioned, on a couple of occasions here, there will be people leaving on a volunteer basis from the legacy TNT system as the integration complete. These weren't layoffs and they certainly weren't because we were propagated or not watching our waistline, they were from those 3 reasons. And we think culture and service orientation is the most important thing in FedEx.","So we're not going to pre-people roughly and lay off about a bunch of folks. We're doing it in a way that that's consistent with our values and with the type of service in FedEx is known for. So I think it's important to reiterate what I said in December about those voluntary buyouts, because that was completely missed by a lot of people. In fact, right after their earnings calls some of the major media was talking about layoffs and FedEx and layoffs at all their voluntary buyouts driven by those 3 issues.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Ben Hartford with Baird.","Ben Hartford","Just want to clarify some of the integration related expenses obviously you've raised at target a little bit, you push the timeline out to 2021. Just wanted to clarify, is the integration now going to take a little bit longer than expected and cost a little bit more? How should we interpret that data particularly the greater than $1.5 billion target? And how do we reconcile that in the context of the fact that the integration related expenses here in fiscal \u201819 are coming in a little bit less than expected?","Alan Graf","Ben, I would say that, what we have found is that, what we've been talking you mostly about where the operational integration costs of putting these networks together. Again, as Raj talked to I mean, we're starting to get there and we're going to pick up a lot of momentum in FY 20. What we're seeing, however, is that as we -- as Raj and team continues to bring those antiquated systems up to current standards and beyond that we probably have some back office and other areas where we can do further investment. And so, we'll keep you updated on that. But far as operationally, we tend to be -- we think we're going to be there by the end of FY \u201820, and that's the biggest part. So, don't be scared about a lot of additional integration money. There won't be a lot additional [technical difficulty].","Operator","Our next question will come from David Ross with Stifel.","David Ross","Fred, you did mention something looking past 3Q about green sprouts that you guys are seeing in March. Can you elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing today in the past two to three weeks, both domestically and internationally?","Fred Smith","Well, let me, let the Chief Operating Officer talk about that because he's closer to it than I am, and I'm responding to you earlier I made those comments based on what he's telling me.","Raj Subramaniam","Hey, David, I think just to put it put it in perspective here. The inventory to sales ratio in the U.S. ran up in Q4 of calendar year \u201818. And so, we knew that the slowdown coming in Q1, it was just -- it was the pre-Chinese New Year. The peak was very muted, and the post-Chinese New Year was very, very soft.","Having said that, in the last few days, we are starting to see some pickup in the business, and I think that's looking good. I\u2019m going to sit here and project that's going to have -- what's going to happen for the rest of the quarter four, I cannot do that at this point. There\u2019s still uncertainty in the market. But, if the trend continues then of course it'll be good news.","Fred Smith","Let me add. I think there's been well reported in the trades. But prior to January the 1st, there was a significant amount of traffic that was put on the water beginning in late summer and in the fall, based on the deadline of January the 1st for the imposition of new tariffs. Now, the President decided to delay those, but there was a lot of inventory that was moved into the U.S. And you sort of saw the opposite side of that from China into Europe where they didn't have the tariffs. So, it was quite a different profile. So some of the follow activity during the first quarter, I think was a reflection of that inventory to sales ratio that Raj just mentioned to you. So hopefully now with the anticipation of a trade deal or at least a more can lead your conversation going on about it and in terms of tariffs, maybe we'll go back into a more normal cycle.","Operator","Next, we\u2019ll take a question from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan.","Brian Ossenbeck","Just want to go back to Ground for a minute. You can talk about just the headwinds in the quarter. I know you mentioned the high labor costs, inflation, the 60 network filling up, but you most never see sequential decline in margins for that business, at least not to this degree. So maybe you can you give us some context as to, how much longer you expect those to persists especially the type of volume that you're filling up in the Ground network? And then lastly on the transformation, I guess, what gives you the confidence to be able to get the cost of serve down to the right level? And does that actually include increasing stock density in a meaningful way?","Fred Smith","Well, if I answer the second question, I am sure the Board of Directors and Fed would bring me out of here for giving it away competitively sensitive data and information. So, I'm just going to tell you that it's going to be transformational. I'm highly confident about where we're headed. I've got a very good feeling about what our costs are going to be and how much volume we're going to be able to run to the ground network. As to the current trends, we did have a 3% yield increase in Ground. Frankly, we thought, we were going to a higher.","Same thing as Brie and Raj have been talking to you about, mix change orders a little faster than we thought. Cost structure will get there and we're not -- I'm not worried about Grounds margins in the longer term. Although, I did tell you that I don't think they're going to pop back up in Q4 like we sometimes see because we have a lot of investment going on for these transformational things that we have underway. So, all I can say they're standby, but I'm confident about our Grounds long-term potential maintain those margins that you used to.","Operator","And David Vernon from Bernstein has our next question.","David Vernon","Alan, maybe just kind of following up on that question. Is there any way you can help us understand of the, sort of hub, the 170 basis points a margin compression here is business condition shortfall versus investment in the business versus cost inflation.

And if you could help us understand, how long this investment periods is going to last? What is the impact of inflation and when that should lap off? And when -- or maybe when that should end? That will be helpful.","Alan Graf","Yes. Same thing, I mean. We're working on FY20 business plan right now.

We don't have our fair share yet at Grand in that area. We will. And then as I said, we're working really hard on our cost structure for residential and short-haul deliveries. And there'll be more to come on that.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session at this time.
