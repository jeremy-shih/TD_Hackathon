[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Kerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC report and today's earnings press release.","The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","All these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We are happy to report an excellent fourth quarter finish, wrapping up a strong fiscal year for Synopsys and providing a solid foundation as we enter 2016.","During the year, we made excellent progress with the new generation of design and verification EDA tools, and are now in the midst of a multi-year product upgrade cycle. We also continued to invest in and grow our new Software Integrity products with several important acquisitions in the software quality and security space.","Let me summarize our financial results for the quarter and year. We delivered fourth quarter revenue of $587 million and $2.242 billion for the year, a 9% increase, reflecting both solid organic growth and important acquisitions.","We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 in Q4, and 9.5% growth for the year to $2.77. Strong Q4 orders helped grow our three-year backlog to $3.6 billion. We generated approximately $495 million in operating cash flow and bought back $280 million in our stock, keeping share count flat.","Building on our strong yearend position, we are setting a 2016 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.93 to $3, a revenue target of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion and an operating cash flow goal of at least $500 million. Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly.","Several years ago, we embarked on a path to augment our leading silicon-enablement technology with a seamless connection to increasingly critical software elements and challenges. In 2015, we made excellent progress on our Silicon to Software vision. This vision and our execution put us at the right place, at precisely the right time, to help semiconductor and systems companies, as they transition to their next phase of growth.","If you look back at history, the first phase in semiconductors was computation, driven by the PC; followed by mobility, driven by the smartphone; each of which prompting significant technology advances. We're currently seeing the beginnings of a third phase, aimed squarely at the next decade of the Internet of Things or what I prefer to call, Smart Everything.","In Smart Everything, machine learning, image recognition and interpretation, reasoning and various other forms of artificial intelligence will impact every segment of the market. One remarkable example is in automotive, an industry that traditionally has only gradually adopted new technology, but is progressing by leaps and bounds from assisted to now autonomous driving.","During these transition periods, we see some turbulence in the landscape, as many companies compete by refocusing their end-product differentiation, while others combine forces to ensure sufficient resources or market presence. In the last 18 months we've seen just that, with a large number of sizeable company consolidations contributing to analyst semi growth estimates of 2% for 2015 and 1% for 2016.","In isolation, consolidations are a headwind for the EDA industry. However, they are also a hallmark of healthy restructuring in electronics, which drives major innovation from advanced silicon all the way up to software.","Synopsys is well equipped, both technically and through our multi-year business model to navigate industry challenges. Our Silicon to Software center of gravity positions us well to again be a keystone provider in the next phase of the industry.","Looking at 2016 and beyond, it's useful to assess how we're systematically evolving the company to deliver on this vision by focusing on four areas. First, develop and rollout the next generation of silicon design system capable of handling the most complex chips. Second, develop and rollout the highest performance verification solution for both the most complex chips, while addressing the intersection of hardware and software that is the very essence of modern electronic products.","Third, grow in IP with a portfolio of building blocks, well suited for the next market of Smart Internet of Things devices. And fourth, grow in our new TAM of software quality and security, which addresses the needs of both software embedded in electronics and applications software in market segments as diverse as automotive, finance, health, energy and others.","Let me report on our business from a product perspective in each area. In advanced design, we're tracking rapid adoption of 16, 14 and 10-nanometer FinFET technology. The cumulative number of active FinFET designs is approaching 260, a 50% increase in just one year.","Synopsys is relied on for 95% of those chips, and 42 of the 43 leading-edge designs at 10-nanometer are using our design tools. Through our TCAD and OPC technology, we're also the go-to partner at 7 and 5-nanometer, collaborating with all top silicon providers as well as research consortia, such as IMEC.","IC Compiler II is our cornerstone, next-generation physical design platform. Announced about 18 months ago, it saw a rapid, broad-based customer adoption during the year.","In fact, it's the fastest-ramping product in our history, with now over 50 unique customers, active on 135 complex production designs, in 19 different process nodes. Its broad foundry certification enables continued momentum, and customers such as AMD, ARM, MediaTek, Renesas, SocioNext and Samsung have spoken publicly about their successes with IC Compiler II.","Now, looking at verification. Complexity, not only exponentially grows with more sophisticated silicon, it greatly compounds with the amount of embedded software in all complex systems. This challenge, and thus opportunity for Synopsys, only increases as one foresees a decade of Smart Everything, with highly sophisticated hardware\/software-optimized devices.","We recognized this opportunity several years ago and accelerated R&D investments and M&A towards our Verification Continuum. Built around the fastest simulation, emulation and FPGA prototyping engine, our solution had an outstanding year of growth.","A number of bellwether global companies have recently adopted our solution and we expect continued growth in FY '16. Specifically, we saw broad-based strength in emulation this year with technology that competitively leads in both performance and cost.","In Q4, we shipped our new FPGA prototyping system, HAPS 80, with significantly faster performance. It enables customers to validate entire systems and accelerate software development by up to six to nine months.","To further strengthen our Verification Continuum platform, in Q3 we acquired Atrenta, a leader in static and formal verification. The integration has gone quite well, and customers are very supportive of the combined product roadmap.","Now, to our IP products, where we made good progress in expanding and optimizing our portfolio for IoT and key verticals, such as automotive. These application share many common building blocks, ranging from sensor connectors to embedded low-power processors and memories, to interfaces such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to the security blocks that enable built-in encryption.","In September, we introduced a comprehensive IoT platform built around our very broad IP portfolio, including our sensor subsystem and low-power ARC processors. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we'll continue to deliver extensions to the platform over the next year.","This year, we also launched an automotive-grade IP solution, which includes ISO-26262 pre-qualified IP for applications such as vehicle connectivity, infotainment and advanced driver-assistance systems. In addition, we closed two key acquisitions. We acquired Bluetooth IP from Silicon Vision and Elliptic Technologies, a leading provider of security IP and expertise. Both of these are critical building blocks for a broad set of IoT devices.","Our leadership in FinFET-ready IP continues. During the quarter we announced 10-nanometer IP at TSMC and won at a premier customer in Asia for advanced FinFET design. As customers grow their IP relationships with us, more and more are opting for longer-term volume purchase agreements, rather than project-based buying. For us, this is positively skewing the business mix towards more time based rather than up-front revenue.","And now to software quality and security, our early-stage, higher-growth business group that we call Software Integrity. As a backdrop, I spoke earlier about the mega-trend in the software industry, dealing with exploding amounts of complex software content. A second related trend is the continuous growth in the number of software developers. One source estimates 20 million developers today, growing to 25 million over the next five years.","And third, the tools market for quality and security, which analysts estimate at about $2.4 billion, is growing at about 20% per year. Our products help developers write better, more secure code. This is done by testing for quality defects and security vulnerabilities to help eliminate flaws during the development process.","Building on last year's acquisition of Coverity, 2015 was a year of operational integration and scaling, and broadening our presence in the security space. Coverity expanded Synopsys' customer base. Half of its business was with our existing customers, albeit different users, and half with companies we had never worked with before in the application software space.","This past year we fully implemented our sales strategy. Assisted by software integrity experts, the existing worldwide Synopsys channel now serves semiconductor and systems customers. And we have a dedicated enterprise sales team focused on application software firms in areas such as finance and health, for example.","Similar to how we built our EDA and IP businesses, our growth strategy features a combination of organic investment and acquisitions. During 2015, our organic investment focused on strengthening the sales structure and on broadening language coverage. With three recent acquisitions, we also significantly invested in the security space, expanding our TAM by about $900 million.","Most notable was Codenomicon, a well-known expert in dynamic security testing and the co-discoverer of the infamous HeartBleed bug in 2014. Augmenting the security portfolio were the Seeker products, which find high-risk security weaknesses throughout the software development lifecycle. And in the last month, Protecode, which specializes in managing open-source and third-party source code.","Finally, we are very pleased to welcome Howard Schmidt to our advisory team as Security Advisor. Howard is a noted cyber security expert, and former advisor to Presidents Obama and Bush. These investments will have a near-term, slightly dilutive impact, as we scale into this higher-growth space.","For 2016, we have three primary strategic goals in software integrity. One, unify all the acquired technologies into a next-generation quality and security platform. Two, evolve and expand our focus on vertical segments. And three, address new opportunities in the compliance arena.","For example, we started a collaboration with Underwriter's Laboratories on its Cybersecurity Assurance Program. It's designed to help companies manage security risks via a certification process, similar to what they have been doing for years for electrical hardware devices.","From an overall company financial perspective, our primary long-term objective remains to drive high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings per share growth through a mix of the following. One, organically grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single-digit range. Two, organically grow revenue in IP systems and software solutions generally in the low double-digits.","Three, actively explore TAM-expanding R&D and M&A opportunities. Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range. And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of M&A, stock buybacks and debt repayment.","While the combination of elements may vary, based on business cycles and in-period priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent. In summary, we completed a very strong year against a somewhat turbulent industry backdrop. Our game-changing design and verification products have made great strides and are yielding excellent results.","Our IP business continues to grow in sophistication and business breadth. And our drive towards the new TAM of software quality and security is rapidly establishing Synopsys as a key player in this emerging market.","With that, let me pass the mic to Trac for the financial perspective.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. As Aart mentioned, we delivered a strong finish to an outstanding year and continued to demonstrate our commitment to maximizing shareholder value.","We generated 9% revenue and 9.5% non-GAAP earnings growth, and $495 million in operating cash flow. We ended the year with $3.6 billion in non-cancellable backlog and returned $280 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. Simultaneously, we continue to make internal investments and acquire key technology to drive long-term growth.","Despite a challenging semiconductor environment, we continue to execute very well and enter 2016 with a solid financial foundation. Our outlook reflects another year of increased growth and profitability and strong cash flow. In addition, our stable and predictable business model allows us time to respond, if the environment becomes more challenging.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q4 2015 results and 2016 targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.","We closed another excellent quarter and achieved strong 2015 results. We delivered total revenue of $587 million in Q4 and $2.242 billion for the year. We significantly exceeded our original 2015 target, primarily as a result of solid organic growth.","Revenue growth was strong across all product platforms, with particular strength in place and route and emulation, and across all geographies, except for Japan, which was affected by the yen. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of both Q4 and 2015 revenue.","The weighted average duration of the renewable customer license commitment was about 2.9 years for the quarter and about 2.7 years for 2015. We expect weighted average duration for 2016 to be approximately 2.7 years.","Our three-year backlog increased to $3.6 billion from $3.5 billion, due to the timing of large contract renewals, business growth and acquisitions. We have approximately 80% of the 2016 revenue target already in hand, which provides us a good measure of stability and predictability.","Turning to expenses. Total GAAP cost and expenses were $530 million for the quarter and $1.98 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $464 million for the quarter and $1.72 billion for the year. The annual increase was due to higher costs associated with employee compensation, planned hiring, acquisitions and cost of goods sold for emulation sales.","We delivered very solid non-GAAP operating margins, 21% for the quarter and 23.4% for the year. At the midpoint of our 2016 guidance, non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by approximately 70 basis points over 2015 levels. We'll continue to drive company-wide operational discipline in order to fund our higher-growth initiatives, with an ongoing goal to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.31 for the quarter and $1.43 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Full year non-GAAP earnings grew 9.5% to $2.77. We were able to largely offset the dilution from acquisitions through strong operational execution.","Cash flows were excellent and above guidance, due to strong business levels and collections. We delivered $152 million in operating cash flow in Q4 and $495 million for the year, despite the impact of outflows related to acquisitions. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $965 million, with 16% onshore and total debt of $205 million.","In 2015, we repurchased 6 million shares of stock for $280 million. This was roughly 70% of the annual free cash flow. 1.7 million shares were delivered in Q4, as part of the $100 million accelerated share repurchase plan that was set up in August. The ASR was completed in November, when the final 377,000 shares were delivered.","In September, the Board replenished our share repurchase authorization to $500 million. We plan to return more cash to shareholders in 2016 by increasing our buybacks to slightly reduce the share count.","We expect operating cash flow to be at least $500 million in 2016. The quarterly profile will be similar to prior years, with a net outflow during Q1. This is due largely to the payout of the prior year's annual incentive compensation.","DSO was 60 days, reflecting strong business levels. We ended Q4 with 10,280 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies. The increase in the number of employees was due to recent acquisitions, along with planned hiring.","Now to the first quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the first quarter, the targets are: revenue between $560 million and $575 million, as we communicated in August, we expect increased variability in quarterly revenue due to lumpiness of hardware and consulting revenue.","Total GAAP cost and expenses between $505 million and $524 million; total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $445 million and $455 million; other income between 0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $0.25 to $0.33 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.63 per share.","For fiscal 2016: revenue of $2.350 billion to $2.390 billion, which reflects roughly a 1 percentage point headwind impact from the yen; other income between 0 and $4 million; beginning in 2016, we've adopted a normalized annual non-GAAP tax rate, which is the norm for our industry, we'll continue to use a tax rate of 19% through 2018, we'll monitor the rate for any significant events that could materially affect it.","Outstanding shares between 155 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $1.55 to $1.71 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $101 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 to $3 per share; capital expenditures flat with 2015 at approximately $90 million; and cash flow from operations of at least $500 million.","To help in your modeling, we expect second half revenue to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter. Total non-GAAP expenses to skew slightly toward the first half of the year. And second half non-GAAP EPS to be moderately higher than the first half, with Q1 the lowest EPS quarter. We are also reiterating our multi-year goal of high-single digit non-GAAP EPS growth.","In summary, even in the context of a challenging semiconductor environment, we're delivering very good results. Our 2016 outlook reflects solid growth in revenue and profitability and strong cash flow. Our healthy cash position, conservative business model, and excellent backlog provide a stable financial foundation for this year and beyond. And our focus remains centered on managing the business to maximize shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Valera from Needham & Company.","Rich Valera","Aart, as I'm sure you're aware, most of the large semi deals that have been announced have not yet closed, so presumably there could be some increased EDA headwinds as those deals closed and deals renew. Can you say what if any allowance that you've baked into your guidance to sort of allow for that potential pressure as those deals close and the contracts renew?","Aart de Geus","We think we have fully allowed for that in the sense that in my preamble I think I may have used the word, being prudent under the circumstances. And that's exactly what it meant, is understanding that these shifts are occurring, have occurred, but also understanding that we are actually quite well-positioned in those, meaning that in a number of situations customers, when they combine, they rethink where they want to go with their tools. And we think how they can be more efficient and more often than not they also select the better solution.","And I hope that we can say that we have that solution in those cases. So from a guidance point of view, we obviously are well aware of this picture. And have tried to bake in our best estimation of what is likely to happen.","Rich Valera","And it sounds like you had a strong year with emulation. And I take it that means you didn't see any significant pause in that business in the fourth quarter, is that accurate, Aart?","Aart de Geus","Yes. I don't think that we saw any change in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. When we look at emulation, we look immediately at our overall verification continuum. And I think at this point in time, we have a value proposition that is really exciting, because all the sub-pieces are very good. And now we are starting to see the leverage between the different products and aspects of the solution. And the fourth quarter, in general, was maybe slightly surprisingly strong quarter for us, and I think bodes well for the next year.","Rich Valera","So you feel pretty good about the growth prospects of your hardware business, the emulation and the FPGA prototyping, is that a fair statement?","Aart de Geus","Yes. And there is a reason for that, which is that the entire industry, and what I mean with that is both the semiconductor side as well as the systems side is really focused and centered now on providing value that sits at this intersection of hardware and software. And you say what does the software have to do with these EDA tools. Well, it has to do a lot, because what people would like to do is to try out their software on the hardware before it's built.","And in that context, that require super-fast simulation and debugging, and emulation and FPGA-based prototyping sits right in the middle of that. And so I think this is a very big trend that is going to be positive for the entire EDA industry.","Rich Valera","And just one more to clarify. Did you say in the prepared remarks, I think this was Trac, actually, that you expected to do a greater dollar amount of share repurchase in fiscal '16 versus fiscal '15?","Trac Pham","That's right, Rich. We did $280 million in '15 and we expect to do more than that in order to reduce the share count slightly to the range of 155 to 158 for '16.","Operator","And now to the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America.","Krish Sankar","I had a couple of them, Aart, just to follow-up on the M&A question. Even though some of these M&A deals have not closed, have you seen a change in the behavior from the EDA purchasing managers at semi companies, anticipating the potential M&A, are they scaling back EDA purchases?","Aart de Geus","That reaction happens about 10 minutes after the deal was announced. Meaning that, within companies that are contemplating mergers, every employee in those companies ask themselves, so what about me and what happens next, and how do you align the company and so on.","Now, there's a whole set of restrictions in terms of what they can do between companies that have announced mergers and have not merged yet. But there is clearly a large amount of planning that goes on in parallel to the process of seeking the various national approvals, and in that process they look at where their future will lie. It is certainly true that in practice the actions occur really only once their mergers are closed, but the thinking proceeds that.","Krish Sankar","And then I think in your prepared comments you kind of said that, one of the goals is to have like a low-to-mid single-digits kind of a core organic EDA growth rate. That seems like a shift from like prior growth rate expectations. I'm just kind of curious, if semi M&A is impacting EDA in the long run, at least being a headwind in the near-term, do you still need to have a 32% kind of a R&D as a percentage of sales given the fact that even if Moore's law are slowing and companies are consolidating, is there room to actually bring that R&D down, because it seems like pretty high run rate?","Aart de Geus","It's an excellent question, because whenever there are major shifts in the industry or the makeup of the industry, the characteristics of differentiation may evolve. What is clear, and by the way I think, very exciting, is that from a silicon perspective, we can see the next 10 years still cruising forward rapidly in terms of complexity.","What this does is that it provides the computational platform that will make a whole different phase of software possible, and so from that perspective, yes, you may say, our R&D is high, but it's always been sort of at that level, because for literally 29 years of our existence, we have driven the state-of-the-art of Moore's law. And from a technical point of you, there is no slowdown. If nothing else, there is an acceleration because it's multiplied by the software side of things.","Now, we do look at presently being in somewhat of a phase shift in the semiconductor industry as a number of companies look at these opportunities, invest, and reconfigure themselves towards them. I think we are already well-moved in that direction. And hopefully I was able to communicate a little bit the notion of the vision that we've had now for a number of years of silicon to software as really moving the center of gravity exactly where the customers are going to be in the next few years. And so notwithstanding, the normal turbulence, whenever you have new opportunities emerging, but not yet having big economic impact, I think we're very well-positioned for that.","Krish Sankar","And then just a final question from my end, Aart. If you look at the backlog growth, which is probably like 2 or 3 percentage year-over-year, it looks like bookings might have declined on an annual basis. Where was the biggest weakness you saw on the bookings?","Aart de Geus","Yes, the challenge with looking at bookings when you have a business profile that has a majority of the deals that are only averaged about round numbers three years, if some of the larger deals fall in a certain year, the backlog will grow, in other years it may actually shrink. And so maybe more relevant to your question, therefore, two other points, one is that the run rate continue to grow for us, but secondly, that we're entering again a year with essentially 80% of the revenue in hand. And so when we look at the backlog, the real main value of that is degree of stability that allows us to continue to invest precisely in turbulent times, so that as the economic opportunities come out, we're ready to grow with them.","Operator","And now to the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","Let's actually follow that line of thinking, because that was actually one of my questions, but also shouldn't that sort of factors that are in that backlog that impact that calculated bookings growth won the timing of your largest customer and when that renewed? And how that impacts your calculation, as well as any contributions to the backlog from acquisitions? And if you could actually give us any additional color on what the acquisition contributions to the backlog last year and this year, that would certainly be helpful to understand the [multiple speakers].","Aart de Geus","Sure, actually, I think you're making exactly the point that I intended to make, which is that, there is a variability from year-to-year depending on not just one, but some of the larger customers. And most large customers don't have just single contracts, they have multiple contracts. So it's actually in practice more complicated.","Let's say, for arguments sake, if we had only one customer and that customer renewed every three years, while you would have every three years a big backlog increase and the next two years a big decrease. Obviously, that's an extreme case, but if you look at the universe of our customers, there is variability depending on where the bulk of the renewals fall.","And sometimes these timelines change as a function of us having different tools that we engage. We have new products or customers have changed circumstances such as consolidations, so we're managing a dynamic set of relationships, but fundamentally our duration, I don't know, the average number is maybe about 2.7 years or 2.8 years or so, and so that has been remarkably confident.","Sterling Auty","So if I'm look at the guidance on revenue and the growth either at the midpoint or even at the high-end of the guidance range, it still seems to imply some deceleration, even though you've got Atrenta in there for a full year, how should I think about where the biggest parts of that deceleration is coming from? Is that factoring in the M&A headwinds and a slowdown in EDA? Is that some sort of normalization to the higher growth parts of the portfolio? How do you kind of connect those dots?","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well, I think the first point is actually more fundamental, which is if you look at the semiconductor industry, its own growth rate is somewhat anemic right now. And in all fairness, this can go up and down by 5% without anybody being able to predict it. That's just the normal noise in that industry. But against that backdrop customers are cautious. And it's also against that backdrop that consolidation manifests itself. And as I mentioned in a previous answer, I think we have a very good understanding of the potential impact of consolidation and we've taken a prudent approach to it.","The other thing I am reminded of is that there is about a 1% impact of the yen, but in all fairness, I always discount these things a little bit. Now because they're not right, it's just that, it feels like somewhat simplistic comment, when the reality is, hey, we're hustling for business and that's how we should grow the company.","Lastly, I do think that there is no question that our largest market is the one that's most impacted by semiconductors, but we continue to invest in these new areas I think with quite good success. And so in that sense, our product portfolio I think is evolving well. And that's precisely, what one should do in these phase shift on an industry.","Sterling Auty","And then last question, can you give us a sense, you gave us some statistics around IC Compiler II. I don't know if there's a way for you to qualify or to measure, but what perhaps the win rate in terms of IC Compiler II adoption in situations where you saw side-by-side RFPs, bake-offs, tasks, however, you want to describe it just to see how the tool and those heads-up competitions actually fared during the quarter?","Aart de Geus","So there are a lot of head-to-head competitions largely because the industry is very engaged in both looking forward, from a technology point of view, while simultaneously becoming or being very cost conscious. I don't think that in general this is not quite a zero sum game. And a number of customers use tools from multiple vendors, partially to quote, keep us honest, which I never quite like as a terminology, but I can sympathize with their desire to make sure that we stay on the ball, and partially because they want to negotiate on price.","Having said that our product is technically doing extremely well and this year was really the year where we were almost overwhelmed by the number of customers that adopted us on a product that is now rapidly gaining in solidity, as it gets applied to more and more extremely, extremely complex shifts.","And what is exciting about that is that many of the capabilities that this was built for are precisely the capabilities that are now being exercised. And I'm talking here about 10-nanometer, and in the beginning it was 7-nanometer design. And so we expect that the benefits of the products are now becoming rapidly more and more visible. And so far I think from a market share point of view, we've done quite well.","Operator","And now, to the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson.","Tom Diffely","The first question on the balance sheet. You mentioned that only 16% of your cash was onshore. You're going to increase your share repurchasing and I guess ongoing M&A. So I guess a couple of questions here. First, what is the cost to repatriate some of your cash that's offshore? And then of the $500 million cash generation this or in the coming year, how much of that is expected to be onshore?","Trac Pham","So let me take the first question. So the simplest answer is any cash that you patriate through U.S. will be taxed at the 35%-plus rate. The intent is, we would obviously look at debts and find a way to manage that effectively. Second part is when we look at the $500 million cash from operations for next year, it should be similar to the mix that we've had in the past, which is about 50-50 U.S. versus non-U.S.","Tom Diffely","When you look at the potential acquisition targets out there, are they predominantly in the U.S. or is there a pretty good international mix?","Aart de Geus","Well, the international mix is growing. And actually if you look at some of the acquisitions we did in the security domain, albeit that they were relatively small companies, they're literally a bit all over the map, because software is being developed in a much more distributed fashion in the world than silicon or chip design.","And so that is an interesting perspective, because that also says that our TAM is much more global from a software point of view. And we never really looked hard at doing business in Australia, I guess now we are in Australia. And at least there is sufficient software opportunity is there to warrant having a presence, whereas from a hardware design point of view, that's a very, very, very little.","So these profiles changes as a company. And I think four out of seven deals this year were offshore. But the reality is we have a balance sheet that we have structured on purpose to be flexible enough, so that if there are great opportunities, we will not hesitate to do them wherever they are.","Tom Diffely","And it sounds like the 2016 will be another year of investment for the software security space. Should we expect operating expenses to go up in this space or maybe just to shift over from some of the core EDA into software? How do you view the drawbacks as it goes through the year with the ramping software security business?","Aart de Geus","Well, our hope, of course, is to continue to grow well the software integrity business, and so far, so good. I think we are very happy that we invested in this area. It's actually very complex area. And we are seeing that many of the things that we've learned over literally decades in the hardware world do apply in the software world in terms of building a platform of tools that is very sophisticated.","And so from that perspective, we will continue to push on investing in this area as long as we see really good growth. We will and are gradually improving the profitability of the business, but if I had to push on priority growth versus profitability, I'd go from a growth any day, because we know that in a new market you can drive the profitability overtime. Having said that, just to make sure everybody understands, we do believe that, the notion of a business means that you're profitable overtime, and so we're heading there. And the acquisitions we did where really only very marginally dilutive since all these things get up sort of very quickly.","Trac Pham","I would add that these investments are done in the context of us also expecting to drive off margins up this year in 2016. When you look at the EPS guidance that we provided, at the midpoint we should be looking to increase operating margins by about 70 basis points versus 2015. So these investments are important, but we're going to manage it, strike the right balance between growth and profitability.","Tom Diffely","And then finally, when you look at the customer consolidation overtime, say over the next few years, is your view that the number of engineers in the world continues to grow? Are you seeing kind of plateauing of engineers that ultimately drive the seats that drive your business?","Aart de Geus","Well, so our past experience has been that certainly in the electronics domain, the number of engineers has certainly not shrunk. It may have grown actually quite a bit in the development countries that initially had good engineers, but not the same level of productivity. I think that the second comment I would make is I think that the notion of engineer is evolving, because if you buy into the picture that I painted of a really an intersection between hardware and software, that's much more optimized for the end application.","You will see that the value of engineers that are having sort of 1 foot in each cap will grow. And we see that in our own company having a number of people that have visibility precisely because we developed a new generation of tools and systems to deal with that. And then on the software side, there is no question that the number of engineers -- they don't call themselves necessarily engineers, they call themselves software developers, but it's fundamentally an engineering schooling and that number is still growing rapidly.","Operator","And now to the line of Gary Mobley from Benchmark.","Gary Mobley","I wanted to start out by asking a question about the core EDA business. Could you give us a sense, and it doesn't have to be precise because I'm sure you don't have it at your fingertips, a sense of the mix between systems OEMs and pure merchant chip companies? And can you give us some sense of how the systems OEMs licensing activity has trended may be relative to historical trends or relative to the merchant chip vendors?","Aart de Geus","We actually do have that sort of at our fingertips. And I say, sort of, because the notion of semiconductor and systems, there is a whole bunch of companies that are sort of in the middle of that. But for many years, Synopsys has had about 40% of its revenue coming from what one would call, system companies, meaning companies that are closer to end product versus semiconductor companies that are closer to the physical manufacturing of chips.","And I don't think it will change all that much. There are a few more companies that used to do manufacturing that are now relying on foundries to get there. But it's really a spectrum. And 3precisely, because it's the spectrum, it's useful to understand what new system companies do more often than semiconductor people.","And of course, you arrive again at this word of software, meaning that for them a lot of their differentiation is how their software performs certain end tasks. And increasingly these end tasks will be optimized by dedicating hardware to the specific nature of that task. And so it's in that context that you're asking a good question because we're connecting well with that part of the world. And more rapidly, maybe then even we had expected people are using our verification tools to check out the software, while the hardware is still in development.","Gary Mobley","Just one follow-up question. If I'm not mistaken, we're targeting about $80 million in sales from the Coverity business, and perhaps targeting roughly $100 million for fiscal year '16. Did we, in fact, finish somewhere around the $80 million mark for the fiscal year? And are you still looking at roughly 25% growth for 2016?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think we have communicated, when we acquired it that we would pass the $100 million in '16. I think we're well on track for that. We don't disclose the intermediary numbers. But as said, I think the prediction that we had made to them, which was we granted significantly less knowledge still appears to be right on.","Operator","And now, to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Trac, I was wondering if you could speak a bit more about how you went about allowing for the possible effects of semiconductors consolidation. We, for our part, for example, have calculated that the pre-merger EDA budgets of the companies known so far to be merging with the exception of Intel keep their budget aside is somewhere between 5% and 10% of total EDA industry revenue.","And even if you haircut that, as you have to, that would still amount to a relatively small percent of total EDA spent and it's probably not going to be affecting the vendors according to the market share. In other words, it's likely to be some unequal effects on the vendor. So anyway, I just wondered, if you could talk about how you're actually went about haircutting and thinking through the pre-merger to post-merger budgets of the companies involved?","Aart de Geus","Well, I'm glad you did this exercise. Because we do this exercise every day, right. And so this is part of running the company. And without going into the specifics of any of these companies, fundamentally what you did is the right type of calculation. I would make sure though that as much as there is a lot of talk about consolidation, we should really look at the macro numbers on semiconductors, which is really the growth rate of semiconductors.","And while that growth rate itself does not impact EDA all that much from year-to-year, for the simple reasons that, A, we are much more tied to the R&D budget and those don't change so fast; and B, we have multi-year agreements, so in that sense, we feather through the up and downs of the industry. Nonetheless, I think that is a bigger factor of the consolidation itself how the two relate.","And so we did essentially an exercise multiple times like you did and then the question is, okay, at any individual situation, how does it play out? And we will put our best foot forward in those. Given that the number of those this year was clearly higher than what we've seen in the past, so we decided to be prudent in the guidance. But I think that we are clearly out executing significantly our host industry. And from that perspective, I think we are going to be able to continue to invest to be well-positioned as it finds its next wave of growth.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Just a follow-up on the consolidation thing and then a change of subject. With respect to the transfer of licenses, one company gets merged into another, is there uniformity in the terms and conditions affecting the transfer of licenses and whether or not the acquired company or the surviving company needs to re-acquire or re-contract for those licenses? Is there some uniformed method to that? And similarly, this is somewhat speculated, but is there any reason to believe that companies customers not involved in merging might somehow also changed their behavior that they see all the budgetary fund that the emerging companies are having and they might want to have some to?","Aart de Geus","Well, you know every company, every customer at all points in time is always trying to see if they can get more value at lower cost, and nothing wrong with that. We have always been successful in providing lower costs, but also providing so much more value that we have continued to grow as a company and as a matter of fact as an industry. And so I think that will continue. The transactions or the contracts that we have with customers are non-cancellable, but at the same time, we all want to have long-term good relationships with our customers. And so when changes happen, one will discuss that with them.","And the last comment I would make is that all the contracts they are like phonebook thickness complexity because there are so many different variables and conditions and so on, because these are typically very large deals, and so from that perspective there is a certain degree of built-in stability. And I think that's stability is especially when you have a well-structured multiyear set of agreements is precisely what has allowed us to do really well in any of the more turbulent phases of the industry over the years. And so I think we know well how to behave in such phase.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Lastly, at the Design Automation Conference back in June during the investor meeting you hosted with analysts, there were some discussion about some price changes that you've had made with respect, for example, to verification and place and route in terms of your core-based pricing, that's essentially a price increase, if I remember correctly. Could you talk about the effect of that change of pricing on your '15 results? And how are you thinking about pricing going into '16 and beyond?","Aart de Geus","I am a bit embarrassed to say that I'm drawing a blank about that discussion. Generically speaking, we typically increase the prices of our products, when there is a major shift in additional value that's been provided. And so, for example, the move from our IC compiler I to IC Compiler II is on a very different price base. And then we have all kinds of discounts and arrangements in volume situations. And it's a function of a number of cores it's run into. So it's actually a fairly complex set of calculations.","But at the end of the day, it's what I tried to mention earlier, which is, customers will drive on costs, we will drive on value and let the two meet at a place that lets us go. And so far so good and I look forward at this coming year in terms of Synopsys really delivering a lot of incremental value. And so as customers will need these capabilities, I think we have an opportunity to continue to do very well.","Operator","And now to the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg","The first is on the cash flow guidance. Cash flow operation, guidance is flattish year-over-year. And especially given last year, you had one-time charges, one to retirement and acquisition-related charges. So the question is kind of is the number conservative or otherwise why it's kind of flattish number?","Aart de Geus","So Monika, I would say that we're approaching the cash flow outlook similar to how we're guiding on revenues. We're taking a prudent approach to it. It's early in the year, and as you know, the cash flow is driven a lot by the bookings and the business levels. And so we'll continue to update that throughout the year as we get better visibility. But it's consistent with how we're looking at the rest of the business.","Monika Garg","Then on the IP systems and software quarter revenue, it seems both for Q3 and Q4, it is flattish year-over-year. Now, given the Coverity is growing, you require some assets in software security market. Could you help reconcile these numbers?","Trac Pham","Sure. I would look at the annualized growth rate and look at over a multi-year period, when you look at their IP business and as we evaluate our IP business, we still believe it's a low-double digit growth opportunity. And the overall market continues to be very healthy. Our business, we feel very confident in. And so over a multi-year period, that should still be the model. You will see it vary from quarter-to-quarter or even occasionally year-to-year, depending on the timing of the percentage of completion for IP consulting. But we still think that the model of a low-double digit for IP is the appropriate one.","Monika Garg","And then on the Coverity. Is Coverity expected to be breakeven and then second half accretive? I think that's was the kind of guidance you provided last quarter?","Aart de Geus","As we mentioned it in the Q3 earnings call that it was going to be slightly dilutive in the second half. Originally, when we first purchased Coverity, we thought it would breakeven. And we, frankly, at the levels that we're operating at, we certainly could have gotten to that level. But given the opportunity to invest in some of the languages, we thought it would be a better investment to allow to be slightly dilutive in the second half in order to drive the growth.","Monika Garg","So still expected to be dilutive in second half 2016?","Trac Pham","I'm sorry. You're asking about '16. For '16 we're certainly going to exceed the original guidance of over $100 million. And that will be slightly dilutive, given the acquisitions that we made in the second half of '15. Keep in mind, this is in the context of us expanding margins from '15 to '16.","Monika Garg","Then the last question so, on the consolidation again, Aart. You kind of talked about you targeting low-to-mid single-digit organic or EDA growth. How much do you think is impact of consolidation in that number, like 1% to 2%? Would you be able to quantify that?","Aart de Geus","I think you should give Jay a call. He did the computations in detail here. We don't want to go into the specific, because each one of these situations is different and they haven't played out. And as one of other callers correctly said was, many of these things have been announced, but are not closed, and so the impact in timing can still be very far away. Having said that, it's just we have looked at this head on, and actually see in a number of situation some opportunities. It's just that you can't count on them, until they come home to roost. But it is not as dramatic as it sound.","Operator","And now to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets.","Xiao Yuan","This is Xiao Yuan for Mahesh. Thanks for taking my questions. So Aart, there are a lot of questions on this consolidation. And I'm sorry, I have to ask one more. So on the synergy perspective it kind of makes sense for two companies to move to one unified design platform after the merger. I guess, questions, one, do you think there will be any market share shift, as the main deals are getting closed. I guess maybe the impact will not be immediate. But what do you see in the next two to three years? And then, two, given that background what is your expectation of Synopsys' core EDA growth rate in relation to the market?","Aart de Geus","Well, in relationship to the market, we think that we can do better than the market, which is another way of saying that we think that there is an opportunity for us to gain share. At the same time, there is some degree of headwind by virtue of the customers fundamentally wanting to do this, to pay less, not more.","And so in that context, I do think that we have a great opportunity for Synopsys, because: a, we are well-positioned for all the technologies that these very companies aspire to be good at; b, we're well-positioned to also now reach into the domain that they were less in, which is everything that touches their differentiation through hardware and software.","And lastly, we are very well equipped to continue with a really good support at the very moment, where they will definitely need some help on the advanced chips and while integrating their companies. And so I think we are not only a safe bet for the technology leadership bet, and that's a good position to be in, in situations like this.","Xiao Yuan","And then, one more question, on the Q1 revenue guidance the midpoint is down about 3.5 percentage point. I understand there is lumpiness in the business because of verification. One of their competitors is shipping their new emulators right now. Are you seeing any impact from that from any changes in market?","Aart de Geus","No. We don't see any impact of that. The emulation market is actually a very broad one. There is opportunities to grow, just because that as a market segment is I think doing quite well. And typically, when people introduce something, there may be sometime where customers want to look at the new product, whatever it is.","In our case, the characteristics of our product are very well known, specifically the super-high speed and low cost per gate is a key differentiator. So for the people that are focused on those type of angles, we have seen no impact by anybody's announcement.","Operator","Thank you. And we have no more questions in queue. Please continue.","End of Q&A","Aart de Geus","Well, thank you so much for attending this call, and thank you also very much for supporting and being interested in us for all of FY '15. I think we delivered on the mark versus where we set our guidance a year ago, actually I think a little bit better or quite a bit better than the numbers we had in mind then. We'll, of course, try to do the same in '16, and we hope that you will be part of the team following us at that time.","For those of you that have additional questions, as usual, the small crew here will be available for calls after this earnings release. Thank you very much. And have hopefully a good vacation break at the end of the year.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Lori, and good afternoon. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets, and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. Finally, please note that we issued a second press release this afternoon announcing the close of the acquisitions of Cigital and Codiscope.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year, as we delivered solid double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenue was $653 million, notably above our target range. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.94. We are raising annual revenue, earnings per share, and operating cash flow guidance, reflecting our confidence in our outlook. In addition, we continued to return capital to shareholders with a $100 million share repurchase; Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","The market that we serve through our three customer segments of Semiconductors, Systems and Software Developers remains mostly unchanged since last quarter. In semiconductors, analyst predictions are more positive than in past quarters, reflecting the investments going into the early products in the Internet of Things, machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure, and the continually growing need for more compute power in the cloud.","Fundamentally, though, the dynamics have not materially changed, as companies continue to prioritize aggressive adoption of advanced silicon and state-of-the-art design, while being mindful of their need to control costs. The consolidation drive to combine forces in order to better attack certain markets or more effectively utilize resources is likely to continue. Many of these consolidations have worked their way through the system, and while they are a headwind, Synopsys has fared well. The technology leadership and completeness of our solutions, combined with unwavering support, has made us a highly valued partner. In fact, the strength of our design, verification and IP platforms positions us well with customers readying themselves for their next wave of growth.","Moving to systems companies, which represent about 40% of our revenue, the intersection of hardware and software is at the core of both their needs and our ability to deliver value. It\u2019s hard to overstate the promise and the challenges brought by the new applications that are emerging as the age of \u2018smart everything\u2019 is taking shape. Helping our customers de-risk as they bring all the pieces together has now become our joint challenge. This is precisely where Synopsys excels. Our broad portfolio, proficiency and problem-solving experience, reaching from Silicon to Software, continues to increase in value as the challenges grow more and more multi-dimensional.","Our third customer segment \u2013 software developers across many industries \u2013 is a growing differentiator for Synopsys. The expansion of interconnected devices \u2013 with immense software content and complexity \u2013 brings with it the need to find security and quality vulnerabilities early in the development process. Fixing issues by sending out a stream of software patches is now untenable with systems that touch human life, society\u2019s infrastructure, all the way to high-value industrial and financial systems.","Our growing portfolio of software security and quality products and services is gaining attention in market segments that, only a few years ago, we would never have touched, ranging from embedded to enterprise.","Now to some Q1 product highlights spanning from Silicon to Software. Through our most advanced design tools, we are well-known for supporting adoption of 16, 14, 10, and 7 nanometer FinFET technology. With our advanced lithography and TCAD platform, we are also well engaged in the development and research of 5, 3, and 2 nanometer nodes.","For example, we teamed up with IIT Bombay to announce an important extension of our Sentaurus TCAD for FinFET reliability modeling at 7 nanometer, 5 nanometer and below. Meanwhile, adoption of advanced design with our tools continues unabated.","Of the 300 FinFET designs completed to date, Synopsys was relied on for more than 95% of those chips. Significantly, 55 of the 56 tape-outs at 10 nanometer and below were completed using Synopsys. Overall, our digital design platform, which is centered around synthesis, place and route, and sign-off, continues to make great strides.","First, our leading synthesis franchise around Design Compiler, which benefits from an extraordinarily strong and broad usage base, is seeing a rapid succession of technology advances and runtime improvements, including in its ability to deal with advanced test requirements.","Second, our state-of-the-art Place and Route offering around IC Compiler II is benefiting from very rapid adoption, including 19 of the 20 top semiconductor companies; Better and better results and solidity by honing the product on more than 250 production designs covering now over 25 different foundry processes. And as a result, we are seeing notable successes in head-to-head benchmarks and customer engagements.","And third, the strength of our gold-standard sign-off franchise. In addition to a continuing drumbeat of technical improvements, the strong correlation between the design and sign-off tools is a massive risk-reducer for our customers while impacting their time to market.","During Q1, for example, we released PrimeTime HyperScale, which reduces timing sign-off runtime and compute costs by 5 to 10X. The adoption is swift as market-leading companies such as Broadcom, Juniper Networks, MediaTek, Renesas Electronics and Samsung Electronics have already deployed HyperScale in their signoff and tape-out flows.","The sharing of physical sign-off algorithms from IC Validator, natively inside IC Compiler II, also greatly improves sign-off time as it minimizes physical design violations during, instead of after place and route.","In custom\/analog design, adoption of Custom Compiler is steadily progressing. In Q1, a market-leading mobile fabless company deployed Custom Compiler on multiple 7 nanometer designs, while a large semiconductor IDM is replacing our competition for the design of a growing number of custom IP blocks.","Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth. Verification is a showcase of our broader Synopsys Silicon to Software vision. Our focus is squarely on the greatest enabler of the IoT\/Smart Everything age: the intersection of hardware and software verification.","The center of our offering is our VCS simulator franchise. The product is not only doing well business-wise, but also delivering great new technology advances. During the quarter, we announced the roll out of massive parallelism natively integrated in the next release of VCS.","Advanced customer-partners are already experiencing substantial performance boosts as this technology further cements our commitment to best-in-class verification products. Our hardware-based ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping had another strong quarter as well. The combination of increasing customer demand and our ability to deliver the fastest solution on the market today, gives us confidence that our verification business will do very well again this year.","On to our IP products, where we continue to deliver strong results and gain customer recognition. Strength was across the board, with notable wins in 7 nanometer and continued momentum in IoT. A major Chinese customer selected Synopsys for a wide range of IP for their 7 nanometer designs. TSMC certified our area-optimized USB 2.0 solution for IoT for its 40 nanometer Ultra Low Power process. The ARC SEM security processor won the Linley Group\u2019s best processor IP award for 2016, based on power\/performance efficiency, as well as unique security features.","Our IP group is growing well. This is the result of more than 15 years of investment and hard work, yielding an unmatched portfolio of high-quality, trustworthy IP products. These characteristics are particularly important in the expanding automotive space \u2013 a key focus segment for Synopsys, touching our IP, EDA and software security portfolios. Our customer base in automotive continues to widen, including new semiconductor companies as well as OEMs and noted Tier 1 suppliers.","In Q1, a high-profile automotive semiconductor company adopted our test solution for use in mixedsignal automotive ICs to enable ISO 26262 compliance. Their ICs are for safety-critical systems and therefore require in-system and power-on self-test to comply with the standard. Key elements of our EDA, IP and Software Integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety measures defined by the ISO 26262 standard. Which naturally leads me to our Software Integrity group.","Succinctly stated, our focus is to provide products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain. Clearly, security challenges are only increasing, but so is the recognition that finding and fixing security vulnerabilities must be addressed vigorously while developing the software. That means high-quality code-checking long before the software gets deployed is a must. For example, Online Trust Alliance, a well-known industry organization, states that 100% of recently reported IoT vulnerabilities could have been easily avoided if manufacturers and developers took security and privacy measures into account throughout the development process.","Our strategy is to: First, broaden and deploy our Software Sign-off Platform. Second, accelerate our penetration of key verticals in both the embedded and enterprise spaces. And third, drive demand creation, with services, ecosystem partners, and certification projects. While it\u2019s early, we are making great progress: 8 of the top 10 software companies in the world are now Synopsys customers; So are 7 of the top 10 automotive OEMs; And, illustrating the TAM-broadening potential for Synopsys, so are 16 of the top 20 commercial banks in the world.","Having greatly tuned our channel in fiscal 2016, we continue to invest in this promising business. In Q1, we launched a new version of our static analysis tool with enhanced security for mobile and web applications. It\u2019s designed to help provide enterprise-level security analysis and broad programming language support necessary to address today\u2019s many evolving application security demands. In Q1, we further broadened our language coverage, by adding support for Fortran through a small acquisition. While arguably an older language, it\u2019s a very important legacy component in many oil and energy systems.","And, of course, in Q1 we closed the acquisitions of Cigital and Codiscope, a pivotal move to expand our market through a services arm that lets us reach and engage with higher-level decision makers at a broad set of customers. We see Synopsys and Cigital as an ideal combination: Synopsys leads with best-in-class products; Cigital with high-expertise services. Synopsys has a very strong presence in the embedded space, including automotive, medical devices and IoT; Cigital is a leader in serving enterprise customers, with particular strength in financial services.","Synopsys is eminently engineering-centric, while Cigital brings a demand creation element, with customer touchpoints earlier in the security strategy development process. Thus far, the integration is proceeding well, and we had our first taste of the potential of the combination just this week at RSA, the world\u2019s largest security conference, where Synopsys highlighted the most comprehensive software security solution available today.","In summary, we exceeded expectations in Q1 for an excellent start to fiscal 2017, and we\u2019re raising our full-year guidance. We\u2019re seeing very good momentum with our EDA platforms, continued strength in our IP portfolio, and good growth in Software Integrity as we continue to invest and broaden our TAM in this very promising emerging market.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. I\u2019m very pleased with our strong start to the year. In Q1, we continued to build on our momentum from 2016 as we achieved financial results that exceeded our expectations across all key metrics. We posted double-digit revenue and earnings growth, expanded operating margins, and generated considerable cash flow. In addition, we returned $100 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Based on our excellent Q1 performance and confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, earnings, and cash flow.","Now to the numbers: As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 15% to $653 million, with strong results across the entire product portfolio. The upside relative to our target range was due mostly to timing of hardware sales and IP consulting deliverables. 90% of revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.8 years, and we expect the 2017 average to be about 3 years.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $556 million, which includes a restructuring charge of $12 million, part of our plan to align resources to position the company for long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $477 million, slightly below our target range. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 27%, driven by strong top-line growth and better-than expected expenses.","For the year, we expect solid margin expansion over 2016 when the modest dilution from Cigital and Codiscope is excluded. GAAP earnings per share were $0.56. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.94, above our target range, due to strong operational execution and the timing of hardware and IP revenue. We generated $47 million in operating cash flow, even with the outflows from our 2016 annual incentive compensation payments.","Collections were very strong, reflecting some large payments that came in earlier than expected. We are raising our 2017 target to a range of $500 to $520 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $966 million, with 16% onshore, and total debt of $320 million. In Q1, we returned $100 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. In 2017, we intend to slightly reduce share count, and we have $335 million remaining on our current authorization.","Now to the quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. For Q2, the targets are: Revenue between $665 and $680 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $560 and $579 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $507 and $517 million; other income between negative $1 and $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.59 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.85 to $0.88 per share.","For 2017: revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion, a growth rate of 6.5% to 8%; other income between $2 million and $6 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $2.01 to $2.12 per share; we\u2019re raising the mid-point of our non-GAAP earnings target range by $0.04 to $3.21 to $3.26 per share. Capital expenditures of about $100 million; and cash flow from operations of $500 to $520 million.","As we look to the remainder of 2017, we now expect total revenue to be skewed to the first half of the year due to the timing of hardware and other deliverables. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share will be higher in the first half. Investors should expect continued quarterly variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware business and its upfront revenue recognition.","In summary, in Q1, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue and earnings, and generated solid cash flow. Based on our excellent Q1 performance, strong Q2 outlook, and confidence in the rest of the year \u2013 we are raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, earnings, and cash flow. Lastly, we will continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of shareholders through an appropriate combination of investing in the business to drive sustainable earnings growth and returning capital to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go to Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.","Gary Mobley","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Let\u2019s start out with sort of the order or magnitude of your guidance for 2017. You beat in first quarter by almost $15 million. You\u2019re raising the midpoint of your guide by $10 million for the full year and your full year guidance implies that the second half of the year is nearly 5% lower than the first half, where typically it\u2019s normally the inverse of that. Is that sequence of fiscal year quarters purely a function of up-front hardware revenue recognition? Or are you simply trying to be a little bit conservative as we start out the year?","Trac Pham","Hi, Gary, this is Trac. You\u2019re heading the right direction. Certainly when we entered the year our plan was, from a revenue perspective, certainly skewed more in the second half versus the first half of the year. What we\u2019re seeing in Q1 and what we\u2019re seeing in our outlook for Q2 is that the profile of both hardware and IP has skewed towards the front half. So that\u2019s affecting the profile. Overall we still feel \u2013 in fact feel better about our outlook for revenue this year despite that profile.","Gary Mobley","Okay. Aart, we\u2019ve seen some re-acceleration in semiconductor sales after what has been basically three flat years in overall semiconductor sales. I think we are now topping year-over-year to the tune of close to 10%. So outside of any of the impact from consolidation in the industry, are you seeing a more buoyant environment as it relates to IP and EDA licensing? Or is it still status quo with EDA revenue expected to grow somewhere in the neighborhood of 2% to 4%?","Aart de Geus","In general, when the customers feel that they have a good year, everybody is a little bit more pleasant to deal with, as you would expect. At the same time, I\u2019ve said many, many times that the growth rate of the semiconductor industry in aggregate over multi-years is really about 4% to 4.5%. The fact that from different years there can be big swings, is more a function of individual product lines and rhythms within the buying market than anything else. Nonetheless, though, I think if there is one positive I would take out of this, is that the predictions that we\u2019ve made now for of a number of years that electronics would bring about a wave of new opportunities through this whole notion of a smart everything, you can also call it machine learning or digital intelligence, is starting to become visible.","I think that is very exciting because if you have something that\u2019s a little bit smart, the one thing you want it is to be smarter. And one way to make it to smarter is to give it more compute power. We can see that the pressure and the push for advanced nodes is very solidly driving this notion forward and it\u2019s becoming increasingly real. All you have to look at is how immensely powerful automatic driving cars are, and yet how immensely far they still have to go before you can completely trust them. That\u2019s all good news for us. It\u2019s in that context that the combination of hardware is getting better leads to software that is much more performance. That leads to applications that really, I think, will wow us in the years to come. I think there is a little bit of that in this picture as well.","Gary Mobley","Thank you for that. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. I\u2019d like to sort of revisit the question about the front half loading of the year, in particular on the hardware side. I think when you entered fiscal 2017, or at least on the last call, you talked about how you\u2019re taking a cautious stance with respect hardware because of the difficulty in predicting sort of the timing and magnitude of hardware in a given year. Now that it looks like you\u2019ve got the year pretty well set with a very strong first half, curious what your thoughts are on the second half. Might that come in stronger? Or do you feel like you\u2019ve kind of got the funnel pretty well set and you wouldn\u2019t really expect the second half hardware funnel to sort of build up further from here?","Aart de Geus","In many ways you answered your own question. You said at the beginning of the year we were cautious because we felt it was fairly difficult to predict a part of the hardware waves. And you were right because we have not predicted such a strong Q1; and the fact that Q2 is a strong follow up is only encouraging. But it\u2019s also true that we want to remain cautious. That when you look at in aggregate, raising a year is a big year when you do better early in the year, but many things can happen. There\u2019s no indication of bad news, it\u2019s just that we are digesting the good news, I think, at a slightly slower clip than being too aggressive.","Rich Valera","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. I wanted to talk about the software integrity business. One, you\u2019ve had close to a quarter of having the acquisitions under your belt. I wanted to get your impressions of how they are fitting in and how they are integrating in. And then just talk about where you are in your sort of longer-term goal of creating this software signoff platform and what other pieces, if there really are any meaningful pieces that you think you\u2019d need to get to that goal?","Aart de Geus","Sure. I think we have \u2013 it was close about halfway in the quarter. So far, the integration is, on both sides, a lot of learning while making sure that we continue to execute well. And I can state that the execution appears to be on track based on the plans that they have. But the opportunity really is how does, in this case, one plus one really be more than two, in that the services can help accelerate a broader adoption of the tools. Because the services tend to interact with high levels, in the strategic levels, in a company. And how can the tools be a wonderful add-on to a service business that is already quite performance in some of the market segments, most notably the financial services market segment.","Having said that, I don\u2019t want to minimize at all the challenge of that learning because Synopsys fundamentally has been a product Company more than service Company. We, of course, have a very large support force that service requires a certain set of behaviors. We are step-by-step broadening the Cigital capability on a world-wide basis, which is a great opportunity, and at the same time making sure that both teams are well educated on the offerings that we have. I think we are well on track to create something that is stronger again. That belief is bolstered somewhat by the fact that the non-Cigital part of Synopsys, of SIG, did well again.","And I think we have alluded to that the last few conference calls, that the predictability of that business, the number of large deals, was on a very good track. And so that gives us a degree of solidity that gave us additional courage to make this move.","Rich Valera","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, Aart.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes. Good afternoon. Maybe one more question on the linearity of the year. What is the current \u2013what are the current lead times for some of the hardware systems that you have? And how long ahead of time do you typically get those orders?","Aart de Geus","Well. The lead times really at this point in time are only a marginal issue because typically we can execute within a quarter or so. Now of course if an order comes in late e in the quarter then typically it would not have much impact revenue-wise in that quarter. Regarding the linearity, of course I understand that many of you are trying to handicap how good the rest of the year looks. I think what we\u2019re fundamentally communicating is that our guidance at the beginning of the year turned out to be more conservative than the first quarter delivered and therefore we made some changes. But we are maybe a conservative Company, or fundamentally we try to execute to what we say we will do. And that\u2019s why after the first quarter we don\u2019t want to change guidance too much.","Having said that, run rates grew again. I think we have many customers that are actually quite interested in the emulation part of the business, in the prototyping part of the business, because they\u2019re going more and more into the hardware-software part of the space that determines their time to market. And so it\u2019s well possible that the second half of the year turns out to be strong. It\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have visibility to that. Yes.","Tom Diffely","Okay, that sounds good. And then you had some comments earlier about your simulator coming online here pretty soon. Does that close the gap at all with the emulator? Or is it still a very distinct market for each of those?","Aart de Geus","These are quite distinct markets because they have different catches both in speed but also in the ability to debug and look at things. At the same time, one of the very strengths that our verification platform has, is that it can be used very much as a continuum. Meaning that one can do parts of the design in the VCS software simulator, one can do part of it in emulation or in the prototyping boards. And we will continue on that track, because if we can execute well on that, while each one of these products from version to version will get faster again and higher capacity, the fact that they work well together is actually an asset for Synopsys.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Great. When I look out a few years, in my mind the big drivers, digital drivers of IP, the China IoT market, automotive and software integrity. Curious if you think those are the three biggest drivers that you have and the relative strength do you think of each?","Aart de Geus","Well. As you were listing them, I kept thinking about all the other products that are positively impacted too. Because while things like IoT, machine learning, automotive are going growing very rapidly, they pull with them an unbelievable need for more capacity and everything that connects to the cloud, to a massive amount of computing and therefore the bandwidth and the storage that goes with that. I think that is why, as much as a lot of people call this the age of internet of things, the internet of things is almost more a catalyst to growth in all of these other dimension than anything else.","Now if you look at our products, there is no question that some of the products that have done particularly well happened to touch the areas that you mentioned. And so IT is particularly relevant in people that want to very quickly do complex systems where they don\u2019t want to build all the blocks themselves. And our IP blocks have literally been honed over many, many years and are constantly pushing the state-of-the-art. I mentioned already the verification of this intersection between hardware and software.","For us the promise of the software space, we originally got into that by realizing that software complexity was starting to rival hardware complexity, and that the penalty for errors was rapidly moving up. Penalty for errors in hardware has always been high. Software, as I said, you could get away with patches. But that\u2019s not the case when the software drives things of very high value all the way to cars and human lives and so on.","And so you amend that with the very fact that there is a world of hacking that really with nothing good in mind. You can see that the need for high degrees of discipline in the software space is a necessity, even if it will take some time before development flows get there. And so that is the mission that we are on. While this is a new market, it\u2019s particularly rewarding now as we start to see that we are interacting with companies that literally five years ago we would never have dreamed of talking to. And we\u2019re talking insurance companies, health companies, banking consortia, and so on. And these are all people that use software and use it in the context of very high-value propositions. So they need to be safe and they need to be efficient.","Tom Diffely","Okay, great. Trac, when you look at some of these new drivers for the Company, does that fundamentally change the model over the next few years as they become a bigger percentage of the overall mix?","Trac Pham","The emulation, Tom?","Tom Diffely","Like software integrity.","Trac Pham","Oh, software integrity.","Tom Diffely","Yes.","Trac Pham","Certainly, as we \u2013 and that\u2019s factored into the overall mix. We\u2019ve talked about that segment growing in the 20% to 25% range we are cognizant of how that grows as an overall mix. And so when we talk about the long-term growth rates and earnings growth rate, that\u2019s factored in.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then finally, when you look at some of the impressive numbers you have, 19 of the 20 top semiconductor guys for placement, how much of those positions are sold positions versus shared positions with other employers?","Aart de Geus","For many, many decades most positions have always been shared in various ways. There are a few that are sole positions or there are a few that where one or the other company is massively dominant. But we are in field where constant advances are constantly being explored. And we have been very fortunate to do very well in this. But our investment continues to be at the high speed and to race forward. Customers will look at anything that helps them but they are also increasingly benefiting from the collaboration that comes out of fairly deep long-term relationships. Yes.","Tom Diffely","All right. Thanks for your time today.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re most welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Krish Sankar with BofA Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes, so thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of number one hard to track. If you look at your last quarter, did your EDA software revenue come down year-over-year? I\u2019m trying to figure out, because given we\u2019ve been talking quite a bit about digital share gains and I\u2019m trying to see if that is actually impacting the numbers quite yet. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive situation and if EDA software revenue is down? And then I had a follow-up.","Trac Pham","Krish, revenue is actually up. When you look at the year-over-year comparison on a trailing 12-month basis, it\u2019s actually up very healthfully, 8.5% year-over-year and then 6% on a trailing 12-month basis.","Krish Sankar","Okay, all right. And then can you talk a little bit about the competitive situation you are having?","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, we compete intensely for this market that continues to push hard and in some cases accelerate their need for technical advances. And so as you know, there are not that many players in our field. And so it\u2019s a healthy and good thing that we are both pushing hard. Synopsis has had the benefit of having a portfolio that is both well-anchored and quite complete and increasingly very well integrated in platforms that are helpful for the customers time to market and risk reduction.","All of these are probably statements that some of our competitors would make about themselves as well. And we never underestimate them, but we are both providing tools that are sort of similar to race cars, the faster they go, the better for the customer.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And then, can you give us an update on like \u2013 all this like FASB ruling that\u2019s coming up, that\u2019s being implemented next year? Looks like some software companies are moving away from ratable model, but the EDA companies and a few other security companies seems to be believing that the ratable change will not impact them. Can you tell us where you stand in that spectrum and what gives you confidence the ratable model will continue? Thank you.","Trac Pham","Hi, Krish. You\u2019re referring to 606, the new revenue recognition rules. We have been working on this for a number of years and working closely with our auditors as well as the regulators. And first of all, let me remind you that this won\u2019t take effect for us until FY2019, so there\u2019s a lot of time for us to implement it. But right now, based on the work that we\u2019ve done, we feel very confident that most of our ratable models should stay in place.","Krish Sankar","Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Just one moment, thank you. Mr. Vleeschhouwer, we\u2019ve got your line open, please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay, thank you. Aart, I\u2019d like to ask you about future growth potential within specific parts of core EDA, but excluding hardware, and where you might possibly see some positive inflections. There are times when there are certain categories within EDA that foreseeably might grow or grow again. If you go back a few years, four or five years, it was fairly foreseeable that the PCB category would see a reinvestment or retooling cycle, which it went on to do for a number of years.","You are not in that but just making a point about some predictability in this space. Implementation has seen some renewal, obviously, with ICC and Cadence\u2019s business there. So when I think about your references to DC and VCS and signoff, those are for the industry altogether about $1 billion of total EDA revenue. So I\u2019m wondering if, after a fair number of years of somewhat flat results in those categories, there might not be in any or all of those, some new inflection over the next number of years?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think at a macro level, if you look at all of these products taken together, they\u2019re fundamentally anchored at least to a large portion, not entirely, in the semiconductor industry. Per an earlier question, notwithstanding the year-to-year differences, the semiconductor industry has had a fairly steady growth rate and with steady R&D expenditures, and therefore fairly steady EDA growth all in all. Within individual product groups, and especially when you connect them together in coherent platforms, there are actually very big changes in products in a matter of two to three years as on moves to the next generation.","And these changes invariably are around finding a way to dramatically improve one of three characteristics. Either characteristics of the quality of results, meaning the power of the chips or the performance of the chips, or the time to results, meaning make the product run much faster, or the cost of results which is reduce the area of chips. These evolutions are not linear because often you work for two or three years on a set of profound algorithms and then suddenly it makes a difference. If you look at a little bit higher level, and this is where sort of intersects with the strategy for a Company, the big inflection points from my perspective have been the addition of the IP business to EDA.","And this, of course, now already quite a number of years ago but now it is a significant portion of our business. I\u2019ve alluded the last couple of years to the inflection that is coming with the addition of the software side of hardware-software. And it\u2019s not a surprise that so many of the verification expenditures are increasingly focusing on that. And then we have predicted that the software side itself would go through this by virtue of the complexity growth.","And so that is how we are looking at our opportunity space. And to the earlier question of how does our financial profile evolve, be it in growth and profitability, while we\u2019re managing Synopsys as a portfolio of a number of specialty areas that are very related but somewhat independent in their growth spurts. And in large arrangements with customers, the allocation of the individual revenue streams can be somewhat fuzzy just by virtue of accommodating how the customer wants to look at it. I\u2019m not sure I completely answered your question sharply, but I did give, I think, what I think are the big things that actually bode well for us for a number of years to come.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Second question with respect to software integrity. At the investor luncheon in New York back in October you made two interesting points about that business. Number one, that you were seeing or would expect to see more large deals in that business. So the question is if you are in fact beginning to see that?","And secondly, that business would necessarily have a services component to support customers pre- and post-sale and so forth. You addressed that with the Cigital acquisition but the question is, do you think that makes you sufficiently capacious in services? Or do you think you need to do more building, organically or otherwise, in services to support the SI business?","Aart de Geus","Well, listening to my predictions through your mouth, I almost feel clairvoyant because indeed the deals did get larger. And that\u2019s not surprising because this is the same history as EDA many years ago or many other fields where automation and verification takes hold. And yes, it takes hold faster with people that look forward and so on. But really it happens very often when people have a catastrophe or an issue to deal with. On the services side, you\u2019re right, we mentioned that then.","And to be honest, I don\u2019t recall if we were completely engaged with Cigital at that point in time already. But we have felt for a while that the issues around security are so large that when you get the opportunity to talk to, let\u2019s say, the CIO or CSO or CTO of a large Company, and they tell about all the security issues, the next answer is, well, we have this one product, why don\u2019t you just buy some, feels pretty shallow.","In that context, the Cigital acquisition was great because these are people that are accustomed and knowledgeable about reflecting the broader picture than advocating what is sort of a good approach for the Company to deal with it, while not necessarily pushing for individual products. But of course, now highlighting what we have. And so in that sense, I think that we will first learn how to run that business well. And assuming that goes well, my guess is that this will broaden more and more on a world-wide basis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question. My first question is related to your recent law suit against ebiquity. And secondly, if you can talk about how big of issue is policy of software for you.","Aart de Geus","Well, if you don\u2019t mind, we don\u2019t want to talk about individual legal situations, so let me more generalize. From time to time we obviously see glaring cases of misuse of software. And we try to respond forcefully but gracefully to it. It is always better if we can guide a customer towards a healthy long-term solution, if I can call it that. Every thoughts and that\u2019s more difficult and maybe legal situation is resulting from that. We\u2019ve had a few of those in the past, they have been resolved, I think, professionally and positively. Let\u2019s hope this yields the same.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. My second question is in regards to just the overall China market. Are you seeing like increased growth in \u2013 coming from China design companies? And just in relation to that, why isn\u2019t your Asia-Pacific revenues as a percentage of mix not growing?","Aart de Geus","If you looked at our distribution of revenue over many, many years, you would see that Asia-Pac for decades has been growing substantially faster than other parts of the world. Asia-Pacific itself has multiple components and Taiwan and Korea have been big parts of that for many years. In the last number of years China has grown immensely, and of course the potential to continue to do so.","Simultaneously, we know by virtue of having been in China since really the early 90s, how the competence of the engineering teams and the companies that have grown and some have merged and have grown again, have progressed quite superbly. And so in that sense, a number of companies that do state-of-the-art design in China just like anywhere else in the world. We have been very fortunate to be, I believe, the largest contributor to that from an EDA space point of view.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then my last question is on the competitive dynamics, Krish talked about it earlier. But just \u2013 can give us a sense of like where are we in terms of adoption of IC compilative? And do you think that can be a driver of share growth for you? And also if you can touch on the on the IC Compiler on the custom side.","Aart de Geus","IC Compiler II has seen, actually, an enormously rapid adoption rate which continues. And which is solidified more and more by the fact that we are also getting increasingly excellent results, especially when used in conjunction with some of our other tools. And so from that perspective, while I certainly don\u2019t want to be negative on any other competitive products, we have a high degree of competence and confidence, I should say, in this product line and we expect it to continue to grow.","Your second question was on Custom Compiler. There too, this is a smaller product, less visibility and typically a slower adoption rate by virtue of the longer history that people have in the custom space. And our focus has been primarily in the more advanced node, the FinFET technology. And we are seeing some very good adoption, especially in the last few quarters. So we will continue to watch this space.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino","This is Jason on for Monika. Thanks for take my questions. My first question relates to maintenance and service revenue. I\u2019m showing that it\u2019s up 20% quarter-over-quarter. Is there any reclassification of revenue in this?","Trac Pham","No, Jason. The maintenance and service line should reflect the strength in IP. And then, in this quarter when we completed the Cigital acquisition, that business should flow through that line as well.","Jason Celino","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then my next question was to the stock buyback. How are you guys thinking about doing the rest of the $325 million for the rest of the year?","Trac Pham","As I said, we will look at what\u2019s necessary to bring the share count down to the guidance range. And we continue to evaluate whether or not it\u2019s expense to do an ASR or an open market. But that remains to be determined.","Jason Celino","Okay. And then my last question, with Siemens buying Mentor Graphics, have you seen any change in competitive dynamics in the market? Do you see competition increasing, decreasing because of the acquisition?","Aart de Geus","For starters we certainly don\u2019t underestimate what the change can do for Mentor. I certainly can not say that we\u2019ve seen an increase in competitiveness. But let\u2019s see what the future brings. It\u2019s a very capable Company with very capable products. Maybe if I can toot our own horn, I think that we are \u2013 we have very capable products too, and increasingly a lot of our top customers reflect on the strength of our platforms. And that will certainly be a continued angle for competitiveness in this regard.","Jason Celino","Great. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We\u2019ll go to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. And I guess, I\u2019m going to look at the linearity, not from a top-line perspective, but for operating margins here. Typically the back half you get a lot of operating margin expansion, so I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re essentially saying that the operating margins will be down on a year-over-year basis in the back half.","Trac Pham","Hey, Mitch, this is Trac. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. We typically don\u2019t see it necessarily increasing through the year. And it will vary depending on the profile of revenues and that could flow depending on hardware or IP services. And then throughout the year, what we\u2019ll see is the change in variable comp as it \u2013 particularly on the commission side as it ramps up depending on shipments. So I would not interpret that as something \u2013 a longer-term trend.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And then one quick follow-up. On the IP business in your software investment, it should be growing materially higher than kind of the rest of the Company. So I\u2019m curious if this means for the next couple of years here, that you will see revenue re-accelerate if it\u2019s going to come down in the back half?","Aart de Geus","I\u2019m not sure if we understood the question. You are saying that we will see the software business and the IP continue to grow well. And what was the question attached to that?","Mitch Steves","Right. So, essentially if the back half comes down low single-digits by the implied guide, will you then re-accelerate because of a much higher mix of essentially software assets and IP?","Aart de Geus","Well, if you\u2019re referring to the profitability part, obviously these businesses as we grow them, we also have in place a discipline to make them gradually more profitable. And the question is always when you have something that grows very fast, is it better from a \u2013 both competitive position, growing the value of the Company over time, to push on growth or on profitability. That decision gets made sort of on a continual basis. But fundamentally we follow a belief system that says once a business starts to grow, it also has to increase it\u2019s profitability. And so while the high-growth businesses are less profitable than the lower-growth businesses, in aggregate I think we\u2019re actually in a very good balanced portfolio situation.","Trac Pham","Mitch, let me just add to Aart\u2019s comments. I would not take the second half of the year and annualize it in any way or extrapolate off of that. We are very comfortable with the overall business and the growth that we said we\u2019ve identified from core EDA, IP and software integrity. And those trends, I think, remain intact. They shift from the back half to the first half of the year is really the timing of the hardware and IP. But overall, I think you look at business over a multi-year trend, those growth rates that we previously communicated for each of the segments remain intact. Does that help?","Mitch Steves","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And I\u2019ll turn it back to our speakers. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Well, I guess we have reached the end of the hour. Again, thank you very much for attending the earnings call.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Rochelle. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release.","All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm happy to report that we closed a very good quarter and achieved excellent 2013 results. We're seeing strong product and customer momentum, and we're positioned well as we head into 2014.","Summarizing our results, we delivered revenue of $505 million in Q4 and $1.962 billion for the fiscal year, a 12% increase over 2012. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56 in Q4 and $2.44 for the year. This is 16% growth over fiscal 2012 and substantially above the target range communicated at the beginning of the year. Simultaneously, we increased our non-GAAP ops margin to 24% for the year and generated $497 million in operating cash flow. With strong multiyear commitments by a number of key customers, we grew our 3-year backlog to $3.1 billion. Lastly, we continued to diversify and broaden our product portfolio, with strong momentum in IP and Systems.","Building on a very solid year-end position, we're setting a 2014 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.55 to $2.60 and a revenue target of $2.06 billion to $2.085 billion. Brian will discuss these in more detail shortly.","Before providing some highlights for the year, let me comment on the customer landscape. As you've seen, 2013 has been a year of gradual and uneven economic recovery across the globe. Against this backdrop, the semiconductor market, while forecasted to show modest growth in 2013, remains highly competitive. To prosper, our customers must excel in both cost and time-to-market while accelerating their adoption of disruptive new technology such as FinFET transistors, 20 and 16, 14 process geometries and multi-pattern masks. While we have not seen a material change in customer behavior, we realize that 2013 is another year in an extended period of uncertainty, and customers have remained somewhat cautious. Nonetheless, they are willing to spend on technology that enables them to differentiate. This is great for Synopsys, as many key customers are specifically counting on us to accelerate their differentiation and speed their time-to-market.","Driving growth of the market are the 3 segments of mobile, cloud infrastructure and what can be summarized as \"Smart Everything,\" also known as the Internet of Things. The mobile market shows very good growth, which is projected to continue well into the future, albeit with a shifting mix towards more lower-cost devices. The customers in this markets are particularly counting on Synopsys, as they require both advanced FinFET technology and substantial amounts of IP.","The increasing number of mobile devices, combined with massive Internet search, social applications and video, in turn drives continued demand for cloud infrastructure capacity. This bodes well for Synopsys, as servers and Internet infrastructure use the most challenging silicon technology and EDA optimizations for speed and low power.","The third category of smart everything is readily visible in the automotive segment, for example. Today's cars include hundreds of sensors, dozens of electronic control units, extensive network systems and millions of lines of software code, which can already exceed 20% of a car's total cost. The electronic and software content will continue to grow as increasingly smart and powerful driving assistance features are added. Integrating these complex hardware\/software systems is a real challenge, necessitating the adoption of the types of hardware\/software prototyping tools that Synopsys pioneered over the last decade.","The outlook is especially promising for top-tier customers, who are demanding the most advanced tools, design flows, global support and sophisticated IP. For many of them, we're already their preferred collaboration partner, and their multiyear commitment to Synopsys, reflected in our backlog, has allowed us to invest substantially in new technology that we'll be introducing over the next 18 months.","Let me provide some technical highlights, starting with implementation. The move to advanced silicon nodes continues unabated as customers seek to take advantage of considerable power, performance and area benefits. During Q4, we saw the number of designs for 22-nanometer and 14-, 16-nanometer increased notably. This has a positive impact on us, as Synopsys is the acknowledged leader at these geometries. Approximately 90% of 20-nanometer-and-below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation tools. We're already engaged all the way down to 10-nanometer in design and at 7-nanometer with TCAD. The design activity on 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes is accelerating. Foundries are under pressure to stabilize their process and provision the necessary IP. Design houses are under pressure to execute their first designs, and we expect that during 2014 and early '15, pressure will mount to ramp yield. These are all areas where Synopsys plays a central role. Competitively, Synopsys has at least a year ahead start. Our complete solution, from earliest stages with TCAD to digital and analog mixed-signal design and verification to IP and global support, is unmatched. Our FinFET solutions are also production proven, with well over 100 million FinFET chips in the market today that were designed with Synopsys tools.","During the past year, we announced a number of customer and ecosystem partner successes. TSMC certified both our digital and custom design and verification solutions for its 16-nanometer FinFET process and awarded us partner of the year for joint development of their 16-nanometer FinFET design infrastructure.","We were also presented TSMC's partner of the year award for interface IP for the fourth consecutive year. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of the successful collaboration history and our complete solution. We enabled the tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer low-power test chip and delivered a comprehensive design implementation flow for its leading-edge 14-nanometer FinFET process.","We announced UMC's first qualification tape-out in its 14-nanometer FinFET process, achieved using Synopsys tools. Our early collaboration with GLOBALFOUNDRIES helped accelerate availability of their 14nm-XM process for the mobile market.","Achronix standardized on IC Compiler and IC Validator and taped out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based complex FPGA using our tools.","In addition, in 2014, we plan to roll out next-generation capabilities that will enable notably faster design than anything seen so far. This is the result of many years of R&D, and the initial collaborations show outstanding results that will materially impact the competitiveness of our customers.","Moving to verification. These increasingly complex chips require an immense amount of complex simulation, emulation, prototyping, verification IP and debug tools. Leading customers rely on us in this area as well, with approximately 70% of advanced digital designs utilizing Synopsys and 19 of the top 20 semiconductors counting on our analog circuit simulation.","In 2013, we embarked on the development and assembly of a major new verification platform. First, we completed our solution through the acquisitions on EVE, with the industry's fastest emulator, and SpringSoft, with the gold-standard debug tool. Since then, we have mounted a massive effort to develop a next-generation verification platform. The customers response has been excellent, and hereto, we have a strong pipeline of capabilities that will be rolled out over the next 18 months.","Finally, our IP and Systems products continue to grow very nicely, now representing approximately 25% of revenue. Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world and #1 in interface, analog and memory segments. Outsourcing of standard-based IP continues to increase. We estimate that just over about 50% is outsourced today. With a potential TAM of $4 billion to $5 billion, there's plenty of runway for continued Synopsys growth in IP.","Our track record of quality and efficiency, plus the increased complexity of the IP we are delivering, means that our customers not only save money buying for Synopsys, but also accelerate their schedules and de-risk their chips. During the past year, we continued to deliver highly sophisticated products, including memory IP and logic libraries for a number of 14-, 16-nanometer FinFET processes. Looking into 2014, we expect FinFET-based IP to grow as design in these technology accelerates. Simultaneously, we have embarked on next-generation interface protocols such as DDR4, PCI Express Gen 4, USB 3.1 and HDMI 2.0, all significantly more complex and, thus, promising for our continued growth.","Given the sophistication of our IP teams, we are very involved in the development of new standards to best meet initial customer demands. For example, after working for 2 years as part of the HDMI Forum to architect the 2.0 specification, we launched our digital and analog cores just 1 day after the Forum ratified the specification. We have subsequently closed HDMI 2.0 deals with a number of customers in applications such as ultra high def 4k TV, video cameras and tablets.","In summary, amid a customer environment characterized by a mix of economic uncertainty and aggressive investment in design, Synopsys is in a very good position with product and customer momentum, as well as a financial base that supports continued execution and investment. We performed well in 2013 and look at 2014 as a year to expand our technology and market leadership. Our primary economic objective is to drive high single-digit non-GAAP earnings per share expansion.","We plan to achieve our goal through a combination of the following: one, drive traditional EDA organic revenue growth generally in the low to mid-single-digit range; two, achieve IP and Systems organic revenue growth generally in the low double digits; three, continue to grow non-GAAP operating margins solidly into the mid-20s through continued global focus in operational efficiency; four, actively explore value- and TAM-expanding M&A; and five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow through a balance of M&A, debt reduction and\/or stock buybacks.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year and provide you with our guidance for Q1 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Now, as a reminder, FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and total expenses by $25 million and $16 million, respectively.","Synopsys delivered a solid fourth quarter, wrapping up an outstanding year. FY '13 financial results were highlighted by double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we significantly exceeded our original 2013 target for operating cash flow and continued our stock repurchase program. Q4 total revenue increased 11% to $505 million. Annual revenue grew 12% to $1.962 billion, the third consecutive year we've delivered double-digit growth. This, of course, includes the revenue contribution from our fiscal 2012 acquisitions. But even excluding these transactions, business was very solid.","We met our original 2013 revenue growth targets, even in the context of the significant yen depreciation this year, due to our stronger business models. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for approximately 11% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 3 years. For all of fiscal 2013, it was greater than 3.5 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal in Q2. We currently expect average duration for FY '14 to be approximately 3 years.","Three-year backlog increased to $3.1 billion from $2.7 billion, with just over $1.5 billion scheduled to be recognized as revenue in fiscal 2014. Taking into account the impact of our larger hardware sales and the continued strength in IP, we have approximately 75% of our target fiscal 2014 revenue in hand for the coming year.","Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $454 million, which included $30.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $18 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.716 billion, which included $127.5 million of amortization of intangible assets and $67.5 million of stock-based compensation.","Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $396 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.491 billion, an expected increase due to headcount and expenses from our 2012 acquisitions, primarily SpringSoft and EVE, along with year-over-year increases such as employee compensation and planned hiring.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.7% for the quarter and 24% for the full year, the second consecutive year of margin expansion. For all of FY '14, we expect an increase in non-GAAP operating margin similar to that of FY '13. Our ongoing goal continues to be the focus of operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.36 for the quarter and $1.58 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.56, while full year non-GAAP earnings grew 16% to $2.44. This is the third consecutive year in which we've substantially exceeded our high single-digit EPS growth objective. Non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 21% for both Q4 and the full year. Now, as a reminder, the full year 2013 reflects the reinstated R&D tax credit for both FY '12 and '13, which benefited FY '13 earnings by approximately $0.12. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24% is a reasonable estimate for all of fiscal 2014.","Now turning to our cash flow. We generated $191 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $497 million for all of fiscal 2013. FY '13 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations, due primarily to higher-than-planned business levels and cash collections experienced throughout the year. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan in Q4 and $30 million for the full year, leaving a remaining balance of $105 million. During the quarter, we purchased about 2 million shares of Synopsys stock for $75 million. For all of fiscal 2013, we spent $145 million repurchasing about 4 million shares. Yesterday, the board replenished its share repurchase authorization to $500 million.","We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 46% onshore and 54% offshore. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of $425 million to $450 million in FY '14. We plan to continue optimizing the use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.","Finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments.","Capital expenditures were $18 million for the quarter and $65 million for the year. For fiscal 2014, we expect capital spending of approximately $130 million. The increase was primarily facilities related, including a 2-year project to build out a newly leased Bay Area facility that will replace several current buildings and several projects related to past acquisitions.","DSO was 46 days, reflecting the timing of invoices, and we ended Q4 with approximately 8,570 employees with about 1\/3 in lower-cost geographies.","So now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. For the first quarter of FY '14, our targets are revenue between $475 million and $485 million. As we communicated last year, we expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue going forward. This can be driven by factors such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue; timing of IP consulting projects and royalties; and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are received.","However, we continue to expect a revenue model that's approximately 90% time based. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $422 million and $444 million, which includes approximately $18 million of stock-based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $377 million and $387 million. Other income and expense between $6 million and $8 million, which includes a gain associated with a previous investment. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million. GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.38 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.51 to $0.53 per share.","So now, looking at fiscal 2014, our outlook is for revenue between $2.06 billion and $2.085 billion, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 6%. We note an approximate 1 percentage point headwind -- it's not material, but it results from the devalued yen rates that we locked in during 2013; other income and expense between $7 million and $10 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.69 to $1.82, including impact of approximately $78 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60, a growth rate of approximately 5% to 7%. And as I mentioned, FY '13 earnings reflect the approximate $0.12 benefit from the reinstated R&D tax credit, and we are targeting cash flow from operations of $425 million to $450 million.","Now finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2014 revenue and expense profile. At this time, we expect second half revenue to be a bit higher than our first half revenue, with Q4 higher than both Q2 and Q3, which are similar. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly towards the second half of the year.","In summary, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, highlighted by double-digit top and bottom line growth, solid operating margins and strong cash flow generation.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, as you noted in your prepared remarks, for the full year outlook, you've got 75% coming from backlog versus the 80% we've seen for the last couple of years. How much of that revenue that won't be coming from backlog would you attribute to the emulation type of products versus IP versus other things that maybe is more transactional or upfront revenue recognition?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, the shift of where we've seen, last year, for example, 80% moving to 75% does reflect the increased amount of revenue associated with hardware businesses and with our IP balance of increasing revenues there, which are a little bit more front-end loaded. And it's just the profile of the business that comes through based on the makeup of that. Our hardware business continues to grow. We can see, again, continued growth in our IP and Systems business. So that really takes into account the shift from the 80% to the 75%.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you look -- Aart, when you look at the -- you mentioned kind of the leading-edge designs, et cetera. How would you characterize kind of the budget and the headcount views in terms of the design teams, design engineers at your customers, heading into 2014?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, actually, I think it follows very much the semiconductor evolution, which is a slight growth. I think a lot of the companies that are venturing into the very advanced designs do it pretty much with the same teams. There are a number of situations where companies acquire additional teams, mostly for the specialties that they bring in-house, as they go towards more complete solutions. I can't say that I even have heard anywhere that suddenly, the teams are dramatically different. I think they just follow sort of the industry. And that makes sense because everything we see in terms of the complexity growing rapidly, our tools can -- I wouldn't say easily, but they can certainly match the increasing complexity. And good old Moore\u2019s Law is very much alive and well, and our industry follows up with it.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And last question. As you look at 2014, you kind of characterized the growth rates, I thought, more industry-like, core EDA versus IP. Would you think that, looking at your business, that core EDA growth in fiscal '14 was going to be faster, slower, or the same as what you saw in 2013? And the same on -- same question for your IP business.","Aart J. de Geus","I think it's, all-in-all, pretty much the same. Now the only reason we are a little bit prudent is because we realize that the semiconductor industry that has had essentially 5 years of fairly slow growth is under some degree of pressure. But on the positive side, there's no question that it also accelerates the adoption of some of the newer technology because they're really looking hard for differentiation. And by the way, we do see continued strong growth on the IP side because -- and maybe that ties a little bit to your earlier question. One way to, out of the same teams, get actually more productivity is to increase the amount of IP we use. And so we definitely see an evolution of design methodology towards what they have predicted for a number of years, and that serves us well.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Tom Diffely of D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Brian, I was hoping you could give us maybe a little more qualitatively on the yen impact for both 2013 and your outlook for '14.","Brian M. Beattie","Sure. The yen impact did affect us in '13, on various lines of the P&L, both revenue and, to some extent, the earnings piece because we do have spending also in Japan. And that went in a favorable direction. So, overall, you looked at about a 20% reduction in the impact of the yen last year, going from '12 to '13. But it's just something we had to manage. It did not have a material impact on either revenues or expenses or the bottom line, as a result of the hedging program that we have in effect. Then, if I look at 2014, I said we have a 1 percentage point impact on the top line. That is something, again, we've locked in those hedges, as we kind of directed to everybody during FY '13 that we are locking in those rates in '13 for '14. And it's about a 1% impact to the growth rate, and it's just one of those things we've had to offset with other operating efficiencies and growth in other parts and other regions.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And have you also seen weakness with some of the Japanese customers, or is it really just a yen issue for you in '13 or '14?","Aart J. de Geus","I think the economic impact that you just heard about is just a yen currency issue because, from a customer point of view, Synopsys -- and not just last year, I think in the last -- in quite a number of years, has done particularly well, while it's well understood that the overall Japanese industry is going through almost sort of a generational shift in how they do business, who is doing business, how the companies are made up. And so we've actually done quite well in Japan, and I think we have a very strong team there working with all the top companies. So I would say the only impact, really, that we felt has been through the currency change.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, Aart, in the past, you've talked a little bit about progress made in the IP from a margins side. Maybe give us an update there and where you are and where you think you can get to.","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, in general, on all the IP that we have had on the market or that is a part of our business, we keep improving our efficiency. At the same time, and economically, of course, that's relevant, is we also keep investing in it because we see more opportunity. So, in general, we feel very, very comfortable where the margins of the business are now. They are lower than for the rest of the company. But as you have seen, we continue to improve the overall ops margin of Synopsys, and that certainly includes paying a high degree of attention to the ops margin of a growing business such as the IP.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. Is it as simple as just getting more customers to use the IP, or is it you're fine-tuning how you customize the IP per customer, or is it a little of everything?","Aart J. de Geus","I wish I could say it is as simple as. Nothing in what we do is simple, partially for a good reason, actually positive reason, which is the very IP that we do, I think, every 2 years is dramatically increasing in complexity. And while that does add a lot of stress, including economic stress of how to develop it, how to make sure that the quality is there, it does add not only differentiation, it really impacts the efficiency of our customers that are okay with adopting very complex IP from the outside. And so, in that context, I think it's a business that is not only a growth business, it's a very foundational business in terms of where the design methodology is going. And I think, even if it gets harder, it is really good for Synopsys because there's a high value we provide, and therefore, we will see good return.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And then earlier, you talked about how you've even seen some very early work on 7 nanometers. I'm just kind of curious, how much of your businesses is driven by 10 and 7 at this point?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, it is only through our very most advanced tools. Those fall into the general area of manufacturing. And really, they're 2 areas. One is TCAD. And for those of you not familiar with it, TCAD is really 3-dimensional modeling of devices, almost at the molecular or atomic level. And the other area is, of course, in the mask-making, where doing masks for these geometries requires just fabulous photolithography tricks, if I can put it like that. And so that's the area that we are investing in. And the manufacturing is, I don't know, 10%, 15% of our company or so. So that gives you a sense. It's a subcategory of that, but a very important one and one that gives us very important insight where things are going and also gives the first models of transistors, even before transistors are manufactured.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, there's a lot of concern today about the ability to yield the 14-nanometer FinFET move as we ramp over the next year or two. Do you feel as though your tools are complete and ready to go as far as that transition goes?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, I do because, at the end of the day, we do impact yield. But the reality is the sleepless nights on the part of the guys in the fab. They have to continually tune the manufacturing to literally wring out percentage point after percentage point. Recently, the indications are getting more positive about those nodes, so I think that the foundries are really making excellent progress on it. But this is not any different than 1980s, '90s and 2000s. Tomorrow was always really hard. On the design side, though, which is where we sit, I can absolutely say that the tools for FinFET design are not only ready to go, they have been used on quite a number of designs that have either taped out or have gone to production already. And so, while nothing is simple there, I think we are in a very strong technology situation, maybe much stronger even than where we, as a field, were in the late '90s or 2000s.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I also had one industry-level question. You guys highlighted how you're getting very good traction on the FinFET side of the business. It's going to be a big opportunity for EDA down the road, and Synopsys, specifically. Given that it's a consolidated industry with only 3 large players, I'm kind of curious to know that -- are you seeing any pricing upside? Is there any way you can actually get value pricing because you're providing such a value-added service? Should we start hoping that, down the road, pricing should start improving due to a consolidated industry and the fact that you guys are enabling such leading technology transitions like FinFET?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, in general, the best way to maintain pricing is, obviously, to not only be providing superior value but to actually be differentiated in it. And I do think that we have a number of areas that Synopsys, specifically, is differentiated. At the same time, we are in a hypercompetitive market. And this is especially competitive because our customers are seeing their world change at a rapid pace, and they have not seen their market grow all that rapidly. So, having said that, I think we're in as good a position as any of the companies. And we've always believed that, if one can conquer the next round of really tough technical problems, that's the first premise to do well. And as a matter of fact, we've seen, again, this year, our run rate go up. I don't think that we've seen any price erosion beyond the normal customers always wanting more for the same renewals. But aside of that, I think we're actually in a quite good position.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, got it. And then another -- a quick follow-up. Even in your fiscal '14 guidance for Synopsys, or broadly speaking for industry, what do you think is the emulation growth going to be? And what contribution is EVE going to be out of your fiscal '14 guidance?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we don't break out the contribution of any of our individual products. And we look very much at the emulation part as a key ingredient in our broader verification strategy. It's hard for me to speak for the industry, given that there have been other people in emulation that have substantial size, and they have clearly shown that they can go up and down quite rapidly. Our approach has been, I think, more temperate and more steady because we're looking at a more integrated, broader solution. And that is how we differentiate ourselves, and that has turned out to be, I think, a wise direction.","Operator","And the next question's from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","This is Zack Ajzenman for Jay. First question. When you're further communicating or substantiating the value and impact of EDA, as with customers, are there certain metrics that you use, for instance, in terms of the results for specific product segments?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes. There are some metrics that just come back over and over again. And there are 2 or 3 key categories. Some have been more emphasized in the past than today. But in the past, number one was always the performance of the chips. Number two, invariably, was the power consumption. And because the 2 trade off, you never look at them in isolation. Underneath of that is always how dense a chip can you make, meaning what is the area going to be because that impacts directly the cost of the chips. And that gets refined by, oh, well, if you make them small, can you also make them yield well because that multiplies all of this. And so, pretty quickly, you're into a fairly broad set of metrics. On top of that, touching the time-to-market metrics are really 2, which is the run-time of the tools, and that includes how long does it take to read in the design and set it up, and the amount of memory needed on computers because we somehow lightly say, \"Oh, well, I'm doing a chip with 1 billion transistors.\" That takes substantial compute power. And so time-to-market is very much impacted by how efficient the tools are and how cost-effective they are. And last but not least, as we move more and more towards the hardware\/software world, a variety of prototyping forms become important. Now hopefully, this is not too long an answer, but what I told you here is, in one way, nothing new. It has always been objectives that one keeps optimizing. On the other hand, what is new is that the interaction between all of the terms I just gave you is much more prevalent. And therein lies, I think, one of the differentiations for Synopsys, which is we are optimizing so many variables at the same time, and I think we do it quite well. So, in that context, over and over again, we take existing designs, pass them through the new tools and, at the same time, make sure that the new tools are ready for the new technologies. And I think we have quite a machine capable of doing that today.","Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Has Synopsys been able to quantify what the incremental revenue opportunity from FinFET might be when we take into account specific tool areas that are most likely to be affected, the number of customers likely to design with the new structure and then your share of the affected segment?","Aart J. de Geus","It's very difficult to quantify it, partially because, in all the key customers -- and the key customers, invariably, are the most advanced ones that are also the first adopting FinFET technology -- we have multiyear agreements that make sure that at no point in time are they left hanging. With other words, we work with them to migrate the tools to the newest technologies. Now the benefit of that for them, of course, is a high degree of stability in the economic relationship and, most importantly, the technology; but for us, is that at renewal, we have an opportunity to grow our business to be very stable where others are maybe in question in ups and downs of the market and in general, be always connected to where the state-of-the-art is going. And the state-of-the-art is where most of the money is spent. So I think we're in a good position there.","Zachary R. Ajzenman - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, and last question. When you look back on 2013, other than acquired products, which products or segment did you see the most increase in usage and\/or the base of user licenses?","Aart J. de Geus","Good question. I would say, solely generically, IP is growing just because that market is growing and the number of pieces are growing. On the individual tools, invariably, the highest growth in numbers of copy tend to be in verification, validation. And the reason for that is that the systemic complexity as you have more and more and more transistors grows much more rapidly than the number of transistors. And so those are sort of the tools that, invariably, customers just want more and more copies, and it's almost like they're limited by their own compute farm availability. Now in terms of some of the other tools, the IC Compiler and IC Validator have tended to do very well because the advanced chips really do require a high degree of optimization and verification physically. And Synopsys, I think, is particularly well placed.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And you have a question from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria of RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Aart, just see if you can give us a comparison of how you felt entering last year and how do you compare that to this year. Last year, your performance was much better than initial expectations. And also, the semiconductor industry, most of the growth -- I mean, the spend -- I said last -- this year has come from memory, not from everything else. So, in that environment, the EDA has grown reasonably well. How do you -- I know that there is a caution for the next year, but even in a very cautious semi environment, do you think you can perform in the same manner you did in 2013?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, obviously, every year is a little bit different, although we enter, typically, with the same level of confidence, and then it's full speed ahead on evolving through the year. What was different last year, we had made a large set of acquisitions, and so there was a high degree of emphasis on the integration, making sure that the transition for the customers would work well. This year, we're entering '14 with having made a large number of investments in R&D over the last, actually, more than 18 months, and integration of technologies acquired. And so it's going to be a fair degree of focus on advancing the introduction of new capabilities that will be announced throughout the year and, I think, will make a major impact on the customers. Just to clarify a little bit more about how I look at the semiconductor market, I cannot really say that our customers have changed or are dramatically more or less cautious. I'm just observing the number of years of, let's say, mitigated growth in semiconductors with an increase in complexity. What that brings about is a fairly high dynamic among the customers on how are they competing. In general, that is called uncertainty. In practice, it's called opportunity for us because if we can help them, in that situation, do better, we add real value. And by the way, it's interesting, you mentioning memories, because we've actually done quite well in that domain. And you're absolutely correct, the price -- that segment grew, but it grew mostly because prices went up. And as you remember, it went all the way as bad as one of the fabs burning down and, immediately, the market growing more. So those dynamics are beyond our control. But what we do have impact on is that they, too, are driving technology towards the systemic complexity end, meaning not just make the transistors smaller, but make, actually, the memories much more complex. And that is very interesting to us because, again, many of our system tools, even some of our IP and, certainly, our digital tools are highly applicable to that evolution. So, in general, we're looking at a very dynamic market that, hopefully, will attract more money. But for right now, we're in a good position.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That was very helpful. And Brian, just a question on your revenue profile. Just can you give us some color around what drives the linearity of revenue so that we can model it better going forward and...","Brian M. Beattie","You best, Mahesh. On the quarterly profile, it reflects, again, a very detailed bottom-up, account-by-account profile. Given that we've got $3.1 billion of backlog, as you know, we profile that out by quarter, by account. And the guidance that we provided this afternoon gives you the perspective of how much would be in Q1 and then what that revenue profile would be. We said it'll be slightly higher in the second half of the year. Also, we could note that Q1 is followed by other quarters of growth as well. So that's how it is. So it really kind of breaks out to the individual makeup of the detailed backlog of those accounts. It ties into when cash is scheduled to be collected. It takes into account the makeup of hardware, things like royalties, which, again, are not in the backlog. They come in based on usage in the future. So, again, we take all that into account providing to you that level of guidance for the quarters and the halves of the year to address the linearity question you had.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one more last question on your 24% tax guide. Does that include investment tax credit?","Brian M. Beattie","It does not. It takes into account, because it's a calendar year R&D tax credit, it goes until December 31 of the year. But we have assumed no additional R&D tax credits to be in effect from January 1 forward for all of '14.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","But you do expect that to be there for 2014? What's your opinion on that?","Brian M. Beattie","No, we don't. No, we do not have that taken into account based on -- we call it -- in a tax world, we call it extenders. And right now, in a world of tax reform and all the other positioning, the expectations that all companies have right now is don't count on that for 2014. So that's what's reflected in our statement. And if it got approved at some point in the future, then we would be able to reflect that in the numbers.","Operator","And speakers, at this time, there are no further questions in queue. Back to you for closing remarks.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, thank you very much for your time. I think we closed a very strong 2013 with many investments that will become visible in '14. And our job is to make that a great year again. We look forward to talk to you after the call or in subsequent events. Thank you very much.","Operator","Okay, thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm pleased to report excellent Q3 results, an increase in non-GAAP earnings and cash flow guidance for the full year, an excellent progress on our product roadmap and acquisitions integration. Let me begin with the summary of our results.","Our business in Q3 was strong, with revenue of $444 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 and excellent operating cash flow. For the year, we are raising the mid-point of our non-GAAP EPS outlook by $0.05 to a range of $2.09 to $2.11. We're also raising our operating cash flow outlook to approximately $450 million, and we reiterate our target of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth for 2013. Brian will provide more financial detail for the current quarter and year in just a moment.","Let me briefly comment on the current landscape. Looking at our overall business, we see our customers continued to drive design as aggressively as they can. Even in the context of an uncertain economy, they are focused on accelerating the innovation required to stay competitive. In this context, EDA and IP are increasing in importance, enabling designers to achieve the necessary power, performance and cost specs of each wave of new products within the tight schedules dictated by challenging end markets.","Synopsys is at the forefront of this design wave. Our financial strength has enabled us to invest in innovation and global support consistently over many years. Our technically deep and complete solutions are hard to beat in benchmarks, and our corporate stability makes us an ideal partner in any phase of the business cycle. So regardless of fluctuations in the overall economy, we expect Synopsys to continue to do very well.","From the perspective of our customers, we continue to see rapid migration to ever more advanced technology nodes, an area in which Synopsys is particularly well qualified. Migration to the very advanced 20-nanometer node is progressing rapidly as we now track approximately 80 active 20-nanometer designs. We're also supporting intense efforts in the development of FinFETs, which are the fundamentally new vertical transistors that are needed to keep Moore's Law on track.","Here, Synopsys is at the forefront through our TCAD offering, which is used to do 3-dimensional simulations of these new devices. Our latest IC Validator physical verification solution also supports emerging FinFET requirements and is already demonstrating success with customers. Leading-edge customers such as Samsung and STMicroelectronics have been taping out 20-nanometer designs using our solutions for more than 2 years now. At this summer's Design Automation Conference, ST, GLOBALFOUNDRIES, Samsung and Oracle highlighted remarkable 20-nanometer design successes using IC Compiler.","Moving to 28- and 32-nanometers, which we consider the mainstream leading-edge node, we're seeing rapidly broadening adoption. While the designs are complex, the design rules are now stable, and recent yield progress has improved the availability of manufacturing capacity. Approximately 80% of 20- and 28-nanometer designs use Synopsys physical design and approximately 70% use Synopsys verification.","To achieve this, 20-nanometer alignment with foundries and with ecosystem partners such as ARM, GLOBALFOUNDRIES and Samsung are vital. At DAC, these 3 partners described our excellent collaboration with Synopsys as essential to help mutual customers address leading-edge challenges.","In Q3, Samsung announced qualification of Synopsys Galaxy Design Platform for their 20-nanometer processes, and TSMC announced Phase I Certification of Galaxy for their 20-nanometer. I should add that, although less in the limelight, 45- and 65-nanometer design can be very challenging as well. While the technology is clearly well proven, and our tools have been honed over thousands of designs, our customers still push for maximum functionality and performance and minimum power and cost.","It's interesting to note that many of our tool innovations, aimed at the advanced nodes, also greatly benefit the more mainstream technologies and thus, directly improve the economics of our customers in those nodes.","Let me now give a brief update on the integration of Magma, the acquisition which closed in February. As we had planned, within 30 days, we have fully integrated our teams, retaining the great majority of their technologists. 30 days later, we have completed our listening tour of the key customers. And our 30 days after that, we shared roadmaps with those customers.","Overall, the response has been very positive as customers saw us, first and foremost, support their existing designs. Secondly, build on those Magma tools that they thought were strong. And third, immediately begin accelerating the joint long-term roadmaps.","With this enhanced confidence, we've seen a number of customers migrate to Synopsys faster than originally anticipated. A key part of that roadmap is analog\/mixed-signal, an area with particular strength for us in verification and opportunity in custom design.","In verification, the addition of Magma's FineSim solution, which had especially good success in memory companies, has been very well received by the broader Synopsys customer base. In custom design, we continue to build a more and more differentiated solution and have seen the number of tape outs with Custom Designer continue to grow.","To further accelerate innovation in this area, we recently acquired Ciranova and announced a definitive agreement to acquire SpringSoft. In addition to some excellent shape-based routing and optimization technology from Magma, Ciranova brings strong placement and a number of other key pieces.","SpringSoft, which is the world's second-largest provider of custom design tools, contributes not only great products but also an expanded geographic reach. Headquartered in Taiwan, SpringSoft broadens our analog\/mixed-signal product offering, while strengthening our position in the growing Asia Pacific market. SpringSoft is also the technology leader in functional debug tools, which are increasingly critical for complex designs. Their tools are frequently paired with our simulation solution and are perfectly complementary to our offering. Here again, we expect the acquisition to accelerate our future roadmaps and drive good business growth in an area of great customer need.","To round out the SpringSoft comments, we are currently executing tender offer and Taiwan regulatory approval processes, which can take several months. We will then move to SpringSoft shareholder approval. We expect the transition to close in our fiscal -- in our first fiscal quarter and anticipate the SpringSoft addition to be slightly accretive to 2013 non-GAAP EPS.","Now let me turn to IP and systems, both of which are growing in importance and essential to meeting schedules on complex products. Similar to our core tools for business, we have been systematically investing in both areas for many years.","In IP, we have built a large lead in terms of portfolio of titles, reliability and quality and customer commitment to us. Today, we are second only to our business partner, ARM, and our focus is to be the leading provider of connectivity, analog and memory IP. IP revenue grew nicely again this quarter, and we saw continued momentum with numerous customer wins in PCI Express, USB3.0 and memory compilers, among others.","In systems, to complement our historically strong presence in the mobile market, we are methodically expanding our reach in the automotive market with virtual prototyping. Recall that prototyping can accelerate embedded software development by 6 to 12 months, and was nearly 100 million lines of code in today's premium cars, virtual prototyping is a must use technology.","Consequently, we are seeing good momentum in the automotive space with companies such as Renesas and Infineon, further adopting Virtualizer to enable their customers to develop software earlier. During Q3, we also launched the industry's first hybrid prototyping solution, which seamlessly integrates software-based virtual prototyping and FPGA-based prototyping approaches. Even at this early stage, we are already seeing strong and growing customer interest.","In conclusion, we delivered excellent Q3 revenue, earnings and cash flow. As a result, we are raising cash flow and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. The EDA and IP industries are doing well. And Synopsys, in particular, is executing on all fronts with strong demand for our technology across the board. Looking forward, we remain committed to deliver continued solid growth and profitability in the years to come.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q4 and the full year and provide some financial details of the SpringSoft transaction. As a reminder, we will not be breaking out the impact of Magma as the company is now deeply integrated. In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.","Now Synopsys delivered a great quarter, highlighted by strong business levels, increased run rate, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation.","Total revenue was $444 million, an increase of 15% compared to a year ago and within our target range. We delivered growth across all product groups with particular strength in IP and systems. Greater than 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of third quarter revenue.","The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.5 years. We continue to expect average duration in fiscal 2012 to be about 2.8 years, which is very similar to last year.","Now turning to expenses. Total GAAP, cost and expenses were $380 million, which included $26 million of amortization of intangible assets, $17 million of stock-based compensation and $3.7 million of acquisition-related costs.","Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $335 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases of headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions, but at the low end of our guidance range. This was driven primarily by timing of expenses, such as some hiring and other expenses that shifted out of Q3 into Q4.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5% for the quarter and about 24% for the first 3 quarters of the year. For all of FY '12, we are still on track to expand non-GAAP operating margin by more than 100 basis points over FY '11 levels.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.50. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.55, above our target range.","Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remained strong with $964 million in cash and cash equivalents. Of our total cash balance, 22% was onshore at quarter end and 78% was offshore. We paid back the outstanding $100 million of our revolving debt, along with $7.5 million of our term loan, leaving only the $142.5 million term loan outstanding. Additionally, we made 2 small acquisitions during the quarter.","We generated $296 million in cash from operations, including an expected payment from a large customer in the quarter. We are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to approximately $450 million to reflect increased collections, driven primarily by strong business levels.","DSOs declined 10 days sequentially to 40 days, and we ended Q3 with approximately 7,525 employees with about 1\/3 at low-cost geographies.","Before moving onto guidance, let me provide some of the financial details of the SpringSoft transaction. The value of the transaction is expected to be approximately $305 million, net of cash acquired or USD 1.90 per SpringSoft share, which we intend to fund with our existing offshore cash.","Subject to the terms of the tender offer agreement, Taiwan regulatory approvals and other customer closing conditions, we expect the transaction to close in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Now in Taiwan, this is a 2-step process. Step 1 is the tender offer. Step 2 is the subsequent shareholder vote. If 51% of the SpringSoft shares are tendered during the tender offer, our Q4 2012 financials will include our portion of SpringSoft's net income as of October 3 at the earliest and November 3 at the latest.","We do not expect the consolidated numbers to be material and have not included that impact in our guidance. We continue to expect the combinations, once closed, to be slightly accretive to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share. However, until the transaction is closed, we have limited ability to comment on our specific plans going forward.","Now let's address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes the impact of SpringSoft and any other future acquisitions on the targets.","For the first -- for the fourth quarter of FY '12, our targets are revenue between $440 million and $448 million. Total GAAP cost and expense is between $387 million and $403 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense.","Total non-GAAP cost and expense is between $345 million and $355 million. Other income and expense between 0 and a negative $2 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 150 million and 154 million. GAAP earnings of $0.22 to $0.28 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.46 to $0.48 per share. And we expect that greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue will come from backlog.","Now our fiscal 2012 outlook. Revenue between $1.742 billion and $1.75 billion. Other income and expenses between $1 million and 3 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%. Outstanding shares between 148 million and 152 million. GAAP earnings per share between $1.25 and $1.31, which includes the impact of approximately $72 million in stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.09 to $2.11, and we are raising our guidance range by $0.05 to reflect our Q3 overachievement. Capital expenditures of approximately $55 million, and we're now targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.","So as Aart mentioned, we're also reiterating our objective of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth in FY '13, even when factoring in the extra week that contributed $0.05 in FY '12.","In summary, we're pleased with our excellent third quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First, we'll go from the line of Richard Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the revenue guidance. Small change, but you did bring that down a little bit at the mid-point. Anything you can ascribe to that change?","Aart J. de Geus","I don't think there's so much meaning to that. We managed for the year, and so if you look at the overall numbers for the year -- I forgot the exact number, but we must be growing about 14% or so. And so everything else sort of falls in place gradually during year as the reality of transactions get executed. And it's all -- as far as I recall within the same range that we had before.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And nothing like, perhaps, related to Magma being different than expected or anything specific?","Aart J. de Geus","Oh, I think Magma and all of our own business is always a bit different than expected. The -- I'm, frankly, always a little bit baffled at the number of digits that we have in accuracy in giving guidance a year ahead of time. And so -- but in general, the picture actually is very, very solid. And actually, we're executing quite well with Magma. As said, the companies have been completely integrated. And so how all of these arrangements with customers actually play out over time is actually very difficult to predict exactly. But fundamentally, I think, no, there's no change to the business picture.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. Just with respect to business levels, which seems to be your sort of terms for bookings, you had apparently very strong business levels in the first half. And then that seem to be reflected in higher-than-expected sales and marketing expense. This quarter, sales and marketing was actually better than we had modeled at least. I'm not sure if that actually is reflecting maybe less strong core business levels. So I'm just wondering if you could say anything about the sort of the bookings or business level [indiscernible] ranks as you've moved through the year?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes -- by the way, and I can see why that would be slightly confusing. But when I said business levels, really, what I always think of is really how's the run rate of the business developing because we're certainly very clear that high or low orders can be significant or completely insignificant. It's all a function of how they roll out in the backlog over time. And so in this case, actually, the combination of both orders and run rate were positive. And so I didn't mean to obfuscate things. It's just a general term for actually business feeling good.","Brian M. Beattie","Rich, just to add some clarity around -- we did have a very good quarter, as you could see from cash collections, and it allowed us to raise our cash forecast for the year. And it does relate to a number of those elements, just saying that the business is coming in stronger. The payment terms that we typically see actually were also more favorable relative to the amount of cash collected in the first year of the roughly 2.8-year deals. And we're also seeing lower disbursements as well. So all that contributed to good cash flow in the quarter and our ability to raise, fairly significantly, our cash flow for the year. And then the last thing is, again, we always highlighted, it does move quite a bit. It's tough to forecast and track our EBITDA numbers over time. So we're again happy with the output on cash flow for this year.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Understood. And just one final one, if I could, with respect to SpringSoft. You noted that the DeBussy debug stuff is sort of perfectly complementary, which is great. I agree there. Obviously, the Laker stuff would appear to be somewhat overlapping with your current Custom Designer offering. I'm just wondering how you think about those 2. Do you look to integrate Laker with IC Compiler as you have with Custom Designer? Do you think those 2 sort of sit side by side, or how they -- how you think they play out?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, this is a little bit always to the dilemma commenting before one actually has closed and most importantly, really have the teams work together on this. And so I can't really make many comments about this. But I can tell you one thing, which is what we do is, we try to take the best people that we have from -- on the acquisitions. And in this context, actually multiple acquisitions that play together, and ask them the question, what's the best thing for the customer today meaning to make sure that they fair well, and what's the best thing for the customer 2 years from now? And then you have to build a bridge trajectory. And having just done that with the Magma tools, I think we are well versed in that. And there may be some overlap, but I think there's a lot of complementary capabilities and strengths. And so I don't foresee any big problems there.","Operator","Next, we will hear from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups on a couple of things Rich was talking about. Brian, on SpringSoft, I know there's not much you can talk about vis-\u00e0-vis integration, et cetera. But I'm curious if you can comment on the model that they were running and whether or not you're going to need to twist that model towards a much more ratable model like you're currently operating in, whether or not that's likely to be dilutive at the beginning of the year, admittedly, if you've talked about accretion for the full year, but maybe you can talk a little bit about what kind of model they were operating?","Brian M. Beattie","You bet, Raj, yes. They are expected to be slightly accretive, as I said, for all of FY '13. Of course, what will happen is that we will take their business model, which was more upfront, again under their local accounting standards and so on, that's all totally appropriate. And they're looking at how we then would go through on a contract-by-contract basis, just as we did with Magma. And then reprofile -- excuse me, we'll reprofile that revenue under the Synopsys business model, which has that 90% minimum ratability curve to it. And then we'll extend that again out over time. Their deferred revenues at the last financial statements were not very significant, with a little bit more revenue being taken upfront. And again, we'll go back and when we get into the details of the contract, break out the deferred revenues, apply the appropriate revenue haircut and purchase accounting and then integrate that. And again, our intent would be on the next earnings call, where we would give a guidance for 2013, that we could identify more of the details, only if the transaction closes by that time. If it doesn't, we'll give you an update at the end of the first quarter when we expect all of it to be fully complete.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. A couple of other follow-ups, if I might. You pointed to increase in cash flow guidance rather substantive. Deferred revenues also jumped materially. How much of that is just the payments off a renewal from one of your biggest customers? Is that the majority of what drove those increases, or is it broader than that?","Brian M. Beattie","It's specifically to each third quarter. We have a significant customer with an annual payment that does come through. So you've seen over a number of years now quite a nice growth in the deferred revenue accounts. And that is reflected again in this third quarter, as we expected. And again, anything relative to backlog and other things, we'll give you more details at our year-end call, as we typically do. Overall, just the message being very strong, broad-based growth and strength in our business levels and have to be able to pass that through in terms of increased earnings per share guidance for '12.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. When you guided cash flow last quarter, did you presume the payment from that large customer as you usually see in Q3, or do you sort of wait till you get it to guide for it?","Brian M. Beattie","No, it's fortunately very tightly tracked and aligned and very tight payment schedules against that. So no surprises; exactly as expected. And we factored in the growth in cash flow guidance from last quarter was related to the strong business levels, better terms and conditions and lower disbursements, as our expenses are coming in lighter for the year.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's great. Last one for me. It looks like maintenance -- your service maintenance line popped sequentially, looks like it's probably maintenance. What's going on there?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, actually, maintenance in itself does not move a lot for us. It's fairly consistent. The delta from our prior quarters is in the service piece, which is what we call business unit consulting, which does tie into either milestone-based revenues or percentage of completion revenues. And in Q3, there was a number of specific deliverables in our IP and systems group that contributed to that growth in the quarter.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, you mentioned that you had the typical customer just over 10% of revenue. But can you comment did you have any deals that were over 10% of bookings in the quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Now we wouldn't give you the details of the bookings activity. Recall, that we'll provide the amount of 3-year backlog at the end of each year. We track the revenues, of course, and go through contributors. We address the fact that we had nice run rate growth in the deals we did sign during the quarter. And again, anticipating very strong business levels through the second half to generate that ability, again, as last quarter as we're doing today, reiterating high single-digit EPS growth for '13.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you add a little bit more color? You've mentioned on several quarters in a row the idea of run rates, better business levels. But there hasn't really been any kind of quantification behind it. Can you just put a little meat on that in terms of what you're seeing maybe on renewal run rates compared to the last contract, or something else that can quantify that we can kind of get a handle on?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, it is actually quite difficult to quantify because it's always a little bit hidden in between the organic growth that we have, and of course, the M&A that we're doing. And you could say, \"Well, why don't you segregate the M&A out?\" But from an operational point of view, we are mostly doing exactly the opposite, which is as quickly as possible integrate the acquisitions. And so at the end of the day, the only metric that passes the -- the sniff test of time is the revenue over time, which you can see growing this year at about 14%. And I think we did better than we had planned last year as well. And while we're not really commenting about revenue yet, we have said that we expect to be on the same plan of commitments as last year in terms of the earnings per share growth. And so fundamentally, I think we're managing a very stable, well-growing business right now that is in a phase that is quite solid.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","No, I think that's fair. And along the lines of the treatment of the M&A, I guess we understand in terms of the integration. And I frankly think, strategically, Magma was a great deal. But do you and the board have a measuring stick in mind in terms of financially, how you'll measure the Magma acquisition success, either at a one year or some point in the future, either an IRR or something else that you can share with us?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we won't share the actual numbers with you. But the fact is we do have a great number of these metrics. And I'll be the first one to say that they are very important to work through prior to an acquisition and look at to what extent they were roughly right afterwards. But I'll be also the first one to say that they are often not as meaningful as one would want to because the very nature of success is for these metrics to disappear and become part of the Synopsys overall metric. And therein lies the challenge and having been on other boards, I see the problem in many of these situations where you really would like to track for the next 5 years if it was a great decision. And the reality is, they're part of the family and the products are integrated and one builds on it in different ways. And so at the end of the day, it ends up being executive judgments to see which ones were well done and well not. Now just to give a little bit more color, we do look back on the acquisitions, and there's always the test of fire, which is, would you do it again? And would you do it again differently? And would you not do it at all? And in the very, very majority, we never arrive at the question, we'd not do it at all, but we use each one of those look backs, which we do periodically as a way to learn and how to do it better going forward.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. And last question around SpringSoft. You mentioned using offshore cash. Is there any tax implications? In other words, do you have enough cash in that jurisdictions, or is there going to be some either transfer payments or other things that we should think about in terms of how we're considering your cash flow as you close that deal?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, I would say that there would be a minimal tax impact on the transfer. The major jurisdiction is the U.S. versus offshore, if you like. And that is where, again, a pretty significant charge if you had to bring funds back to the country. So in a way, this is an excellent use of the cash that is offshore. The fact that it's offshore allows a lot of flexibility in which country and which subsidiary it's associated with and then bringing it into Taiwan to actually close the tender offer and the full share buyouts. So minimal impact from a tax perspective since the cash is already offshore.","Operator","Next, we will hear from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar. Within the context of the photomask business, recently talking about some weakness in leading-edge IC design. Have you seen any signs of increased caution from your semi customers? And if not, what kind of scenario would it take for customers to really pull back on their R&D spending?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think we have seen caution for the last 2 years. And that is mostly due to the up and down of the economic picture. But interestingly enough, that caution as one aspect that tends to accelerate things, which is that people are even more conscious that if there is any economic challenge, you need to be very, very competitive. And if nothing else, I would say that the utilization of the advanced geometries and that touches certainly everything that has to do with lithography as well, has been very, very strong and very demanding. Now these new nodes tend to be actually fairly difficult to design in, and we can see that by just watching the amount of support and hand-holding required, but we can also see it by the level of interest in having tools that are ready for these advanced nodes. So interestingly enough, this is a clear situation where the overall, let me call it, caution in the global markets has had no negative impact on the R&D side of things at all, on the contrary. It may bring additional caution to the volume management side of these companies, but we have very little to do with that.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then a quick one on SpringSoft. You'd mentioned that SpringSoft is more upfront than Synopsys in terms of the Synopsys 90-10 ratable model. Is it safe to assume that SpringSoft's revenue recognition is potentially more ratable than Magma's previous split, which is around 50-50?","Brian M. Beattie","It's again hard to compare until we dig into the specific details because again, we're under a slightly different local Taiwan GAAP standards to U.S. GAAP standards and the treatment of that. So again, we have a good assessment internally for our due diligence work that's gone on. And again, they will be operated as 2 separate companies until the transaction is completed. And we'll be working during that period to identify each one of the contracts and profiling according to the Synopsys and the U.S. GAAP standards that we will follow. And the end result will be that those revenues will be taken -- that have not yet been taken will be taken over very ratable more than 90% ratability curve. And that will be profiled. And again, expect to give details more on the next earnings call, as we learn more of that ourselves","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a quick one on the average length or duration of the contracts for SpringSoft. Is that something that you have available at the top of your head?","Brian M. Beattie","I don't, but I'll just color it by saying more upfront revenue than what we have. So again, as we get those contracts in place, we will align them, integrate them, report back to you on our new duration if that looks -- we again anticipate it will be very similar. It's all software; just as ours is predominantly software. And we'll give you the details once we integrate it.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","First, a quick clarification. The high single-digit growth next year, that's earnings growth and not revenue growth, is that correct?","Brian M. Beattie","Earnings growth, EPS.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So what is your view then on just the industry growth for core EDA at this point? It sounds like across the board, things are better than they were a year ago. And I'm just curious if you've change your outlook for low- to mid-single digit?","Aart J. de Geus","I think they are better than a year ago. And right now, we have not really changed the outlook. Remember that we were hesitant to comment about the industry, a, because there are fewer players that really matter; and b, because we're on slightly different revenue recognition models. And so it's only for ourselves, we think that this year turned out to be stronger than anticipated so when we did the planning mid last year. And at the same time, I think we're executing well, so that helps. Going forward, in -- all in all, I don't expect to see huge change. But obviously, economy does impact things a little bit. It's just not as much as for most other companies.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, okay. And when you look at the revenue growth in the industry, are you seeing higher growth rate at the smaller companies that are moving to these advanced nodes faster than they have in the past? Or is it really the large customers that are driving the pace still?","Aart J. de Geus","I'm hesitant to say yes and yes. It's very individual to companies. There are some large companies that are racing like crazy. It's quite amazing actually how they do that. And then there's some small companies that see an opportunity by racing like crazy to either get acquired or to take a piece out of the height of some of the medium-sized companies. So in many ways, it's the history of advanced high-tech is in full swing here. And with that, I think we're going to see a continual changes in the industry, some positive surprises, some unexpected changes. But I would like to highlight again, there's fairly high degree of concentration on advanced technology. A lot of people betting on getting the next shift to be at the next node and being still faster, still larger and in some cases, also lower power. So that's a race that we absolutely want to participate in.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, well it seems like since there's such a large investment at several foundries right now that the mid-tier fabless guy could get access to this advanced technology sooner than they would in the past. And that would...","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think, generically, that's true. At the same time, it's interesting to observe that in the last 6 months, there were innumerable stories about not being able to get sufficient access to 28-nanometer. And that was a combination of capacity not being in place, but also, the yields not being as good as people would like to have. And so why is that important to us? Well, it's important to us because not only do we have tools that help improve the yield, but we also have design techniques that create higher yield. And so it just closes again the loop that from manufacturing to design, it's really one success ecosystem. And it's to our benefit to help people be as competitive as possible.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then earlier, Aart, you talked about the 80 active designs of 20-nanometers today. How does that compare to the 28-nanometer ramp? And maybe how does that compare to just what the total design activity is at 28 today?","Aart J. de Geus","Okay. Well, to give you a comparison, rough round numbers at 28-32, we lump those things together. We have about a bit over 400 of those active designs.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then so the 80 at 20, is that kind of ramp what you've see in the past, or is it a faster ramp than you've seen in the past?","Aart J. de Geus","No, it's similar. There was a bit of a delay on the ramps, I would say, about 2 years ago. And you can see it on the graphs of the different nodes. But fundamentally, at least at this stage, the shapes look similar. And we certainly know that people are already chasing the next one, too. So, so far, as much as the proverbial death of Moore's Law has been predicted many times, probably including by us, right now, we're defying death and for the next 5 to 10 years, I think there's a lot of work to be done.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","That sounds good. And then, Brian, back on the cash flow. You talked about $450 million this year. In a typical year, how does that break out between onshore and offshore? I'm just kind of curious how fast you'll be able to build back up your onshore cash.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, good question, Tom. It's 50-50. It flows if you look where our revenues are split, 50 U.S., 50 outside of the U.S. The cash flow follows that profile as well. So again, relative to SpringSoft, use of offshore cash that will continue to build up there, for the U.S. side where, again, we can look at U.S. M&A, our buyback scenarios and other things, half of the cash will be attributed to the U.S., and good strong balances as well as having both debt capacities and the small amount of current debt currently on the board to really put our -- continue to put our balance sheet to work.","Operator","And next we'll hear from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Brian, just on the non-GAAP operating margin. You've been pretty consistent since 2008 in 23% to 24% range. Is that something we've kind of -- at a saturation level, or are you thinking anything? Is there anything that can be done there to push that beyond 24% levels?","Brian M. Beattie","Sure, Mahesh. You can see that in 2012, we are forecasting over 100 basis point improvement in our operating margin compared to 2011. We have said for several years that our goal is, over time, to be in the mid-20s. So just as we're delivering as we have over the past several years, we continue to push for higher operating margin levels and expect that to be in the mid-20 range.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And where do you think that most potential is? Is it revenue growth or slower cost to increase? I mean, with the M&A, as you can't keep up the cost increase, you cannot slow down the cost increase. But where do you think that level is to go to the 25%?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, it has to be both, of course. At the end of the day, no business can grow its profitability well if it doesn't grow revenue. And obviously, that's got to be our driving consideration. At the same time, the rest is really the discipline of managing your P&L. And that discipline, of course, gets sort of shocked every time we make an acquisition because, at least temporarily, you have a new family member, so to speak, with different P&L configuration. And moreover, a haircut has been applied or is being applied for the first year or so. But having said that, we clearly look at acquisitions also from a perspective of efficiency, certainly for the infrastructure, certainly for part of our field connection to the customers, be it on the sales side or be it on the support side, and even in some of the cases on the R&D side. Although if there's efficiency of the R&D side, we tend to variably use that to really accelerate other capabilities. But fundamentally, there's no reason whatsoever that acquisitions should be negative over longer period of time to our profitability. And as Brian said earlier, we have been on the track to get to mid-20s and mathematically speaking, 24% is not quite mid-20s yet.","Brian M. Beattie","And Mahesh -- maybe, Mahesh, also just to maybe add to that, all of the discussion on operating margins, of course, are vectored towards continued high single-digit EPS growth. I mean, we've put that number out there several years ago. We've been fortunate in the last few years to see double-digit top line and EPS growth. And again, all of the actions we take relative to driving our core business, our IP and systems business, which now, even on a trailing 12-month basis, is over $400 million, driving that on double-digit top line growth, managing our expenses, looking at M&A for continued growth and finally, holding our share count at roughly flat with the FY '12 levels, have been the ways that we have developed our plan on continued high EPS growth. So margin management is just part of that related to both revenue growth and expense management.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And to follow up, just a clarification on the cash flow commentary. I mean, you're increasing the guidance pretty significantly. But you mentioned one time that it was related to one customer coming up at the -- big payment, but that was predictable. So I was wondering if you can give a little bit more color on where the higher cash flow guidance -- the significant increase in cash flow guidance is coming from?","Brian M. Beattie","Absolutely, yes. The first element that you referred to in the question earlier was about our large customer. And that payment was expected, and it's not contributing materially to the growth. Our prior guidance was about $320 million to $340 million. And now based on Q3 results and cash achieved, plus the outlook for our fourth quarter -- based on those stronger business levels, is one reason to show that our cash flow could increase hereby between $130 million and $110 million. The second thing was the profile of those new transactions, which we saw in Q3 and anticipated in Q4, just show that the ability to collect cash within the first year of the 3-year agreement is actually coming in better than we expected and very strong, good terms and conditions being put in place. And then remember, the third point was about the lower spending, lower disbursements and all that contributing. But again, to put it in context, we look at how that relates over time to our EBITDA less the tax -- cash taxes paid. And if you look back on the last 3 years, in '11 -- from '11, '09 and '10, our average operating cash flow is about $340 million. So we'll track that EBITDA over time. And just forecasting it of when a particular contract is signed and whether it's renewed early or renewed on time, those are all the elements we try to forecast each quarter in our outlook. And again, it's just all of it coming in much better than where we saw it a quarter ago.","Operator","In a moment, we'll hear from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer. [Operator Instructions] And so next, we'll hear from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Aart, 2 somewhat related questions about EDA customer activity. Historically, the EDA industry was not particularly governed by a large number of licenses installed. Even within the larger revenue categories of EDA, it's not a particularly high-volume industry. And the question is, is there anything now particularly at the newer nodes or the newer applications\u2019 requirements that might suggest that there would be some meaningful increases in the volume of licenses, not that you get paid by customer for their volume, but instead that you -- they would consume more licenses than they might have in the past. Secondly, at the DAC breakfast that you had mentioned earlier, Synopsys highlighted the fact that you have now double patterning enabled many of your tools. There was even some mention of something called triple patterning. But the question there is, are you, in fact, seeing a large usage or increased usage of those newly enabled tools, particularly since the 20-nanometer design activity has gone from the 50 that was quoted at DAC to be 80 now?","Aart J. de Geus","So on the licenses, I assume that you say it's a low-license market, if you compare it to, let's say, design drawing tools and things like that. Certainly, in that sense, we are relatively low license, also a much lower number of customers. However, certainly, in the last decade, we have seen a continual growth of the number of licenses. And the challenge that, as an industry, we have always faced is that customers need many more licenses but don't have many more times the budget that they have before. And so for better or for worse, the reality of that has been that they have gradually grown larger pools of licenses and gradually grown the amounts that they have spent with us. But the spending is unfortunately not proportional to the number of licenses. Now be it as it may, that is just the way this industry functions. And I'm not complaining; it's just an observation. Having said that, I think there's some areas that have seen clearly more license growth than others. And the area that immediately comes to mind is the various forms of simulation. And what you can see is that the complexity of the designs that people are dealing with, that simulation can be at the transitional level all the way to the system level. Those complexities are such that the number of potential errors is very large and growing much more rapidly than the size of the design, therefore, verification continues to grow. And so this is one of the reasons we're spending attention to that area. And I think we will see a continued license growth there. On the double patterning, yes, this is technology that is both very advanced and now very necessary. And for those that are not initiated with that term, what this is all about is that in order to get very, very small devices on a chip, instead of doing a single illumination, a flash of light, you do 2 flashes of light, or even 3, in most cases 2, therefore double patterning. And the combination of the patterns give you sharper lines, so to speak. Now you can quickly imagine that, that becomes very difficult because you're essentially doing 2 designs at the same time that are -- that become 1 design through the interaction of light rays. I've purposely made this story a little complicated because -- and you will appreciate that the tools to make this actually work are very, very sophisticated. The good news is, I think, we're very much on top of this field. We have been investing in this for at least a decade. Many acquisitions that we made in the lithography area over the years have greatly enhanced our understanding from every which way you can think about this. And so for the advanced tools, the answer is yes, this is now in utilization and is actually a point of differentiation when you can point to the fact that you have these technologies and get good timing and good power and all the other metrics of success. So the games continue to become more complex, and that, so far, plays into our hands.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. A couple of follow-ups for Brian, please. First, according to your website, you're listing close to 400 open positions globally, mostly in engineering and R&D, of course. And that number that you're showing is roughly equivalent to 5% of your current headcount. The question is does your margin guidance for the rest of the year and earnings consumption going into next year envision that you would fill most, if not all, of those positions? Then one final one on IP.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, you got it. The expenses we factored in for the rest of the year assumes some growth in the numbers, but I'd kind of take you away from those open wreck list because in there, again, you've got a number of things. One is, again, we go after very, very specific technical engineering skills around the world in terms of EDA and semiconductor technologies. And those people aren't always available. So we are constantly looking for the best people. Second thing is there are normal industry levels of attrition that go on and happens in different places around the world at different rates. And you always have to have people available to come in and join your team, just taking care of normal attrition levels that we and every other company in the industry have seen. So again, the specific heads coming in, we factor through after -- you look at a significant list of potential hires and then bring that down into specific names and numbers and when would they start, what jobs will they have and so on. All of that is factored in very clearly, into our '12 plans. And again, we're also very cognizant of '13 spending levels. And we're working through some of the internal budgeting activities between now and, of course, our next earnings call to complete the details of how we're going to deliver again high single-digit earnings growth in '13.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then lastly on IP, is there an appreciable change in the license mix in your IP and systems business? For instance, sequentially, your IP and systems business was up about $17 million from Q2, but your upfront revenue and total was up only $3 million. So I know that in the past, IP was somewhat more upfront than the software tools business, but has there been then appreciable change at all in that respect, Brian?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, Jay. What I'd highlight is that again, relative to our organic growth and number of the acquisitions in this area, that we've seen some changes in our slight business model, less upfront revenue generically. We see more revenue related to both percentage completion and milestone based, and that was the discussion of how Q3 had picked up in the service line earlier. And again, many times in terms of some of the IP activities in that, there are commitments that take place over multiple years and the revenue has to be recognized over that period as well. So again, you see very strong numbers in terms of IP and systems. Even on a trailing 12-month basis, we're up about 26% in that area. And as I mentioned, we're now over $400 million trailing 12-month revenues in that area. So we said double-digit growth and clearly, you can see the results reflecting that over the past several years.","Operator","Speakers, we've got about 1.5 minutes before the top of the hour, no further questions in queue.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, thank you very much for attending this earnings conference call. As said, I think we're looking back on a very strong quarter with a strong outlook for the year, which we shared with you, and also a lot of good work already in preparation for 2013. So with that, thank you for joining us, and we will follow up with some of you individually after this call.","Operator","Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual risks -- actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risk that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the time to join us. Synopsys continues to perform very well and in Q3, we again delivered solid results in terms of business, technology and customers, meeting or beating every target we communicated last quarter. We achieved revenue of $483 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 and strong operating cash flow. For the year, we're raising non-GAAP EPS outlook to a range of $2.42 to $2.44, projecting excellent double-digit growth for the year. We're also raising our operating cash flow targets to approximately $400 million. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute.","Before proceeding to the company highlights, let me comment on the customer landscape. For semiconductor companies, Q3 was yet another quarter with a relatively weak global economy, particularly in Europe, and with slightly reduced growth in Asia. While this landscape is not really new, the continued pressure quarter after quarter of this economic squeeze is challenging. Simultaneously, though, our customers have a high focus on new technology and aggressive design activity. The result is a relentless demand for advanced tools and IP, areas in which we continue to lead and have a strong track record of excellence.","For our customers, high-impact EDA and IP are more differentiating than ever before, making deep collaboration with the right supplier crucial. Synopsys benefits from these trends, and our technology investments and acquisitions are paying off. This is evidenced in the closing of multiple large deals in the quarter, despite significant competitive battles. Superior quality and breadth of our portfolio, as well as the engagements of our highly skilled global support team helps us win the fought-over business.","Looking at the continued technology evolution, Synopsys today enables the most advanced designs in the world. Be it design at the most innovative FinFET-transistor-based technology nodes or be it advanced design at more established nodes, customers rely on Synopsys whenever they want differentiation from their competitors. Fundamentally, their differentiation is achieved along the 3 axes of better, sooner and cheaper. By better, we mean chips that are faster and\/or lower power and, in most cases, are both. By sooner, we mean earlier time-to-market, which involves every aspect of design, including the verification of hardware and software. And by cheaper, we mean chips that are smaller, denser and achieve higher yield in manufacturing. Needless to say, each of these dimensions competes with the others and really good tools, IP and support materially impact the overall results.","This is also why the new type of vertical transistor called FinFET is so important. FinFETs are simultaneously faster, smaller and lower power, but they do require sophisticated tools and IP. Synopsys has taken a strong leadership position in enabling this promising wave of advanced design, and we see excellent adoption as companies are investing more aggressively in this direction than initially forecasted.","To date, approximately 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation, and we're already engaged all the way down to 10-nanometer. This past quarter, we saw the number of designs at 20-\/22-nanometer and 14-\/16-nanometer increased notably. Except for some specialty approaches, all 14-\/16-nanometer designs are 3D FinFET-based, and all key foundries are investing heavily to develop their FinFET processes, promising eager customers about 40% lower power consumption.","Synopsys has been investing in FinFET enablement for half a decade, and we have at least a year head start over any competitor. Our complete solution addresses design challenges from the earliest stages of process design, transistor development and characterization, library and memory IP development, digital and analog\/mixed-signal design and verification, all the way to complex IP cores and sophisticated global support. By now, we also benefit from production-proven tools and IP, with more than 100 million FinFET chips shipped, thus far, using Synopsys tools.","During the quarter, we announced a number of customer and ecosystem partners successes, all the result of multi-year collaborations. TSMC, for example, certified our digital and custom design and verification solution for its 16-nanometer FinFET process. We also delivered a comprehensive design implementation solution for Samsung's leading-edge 14-nanometer FinFET process. And we announced UMC's first qualification tape-out in its 14-nanometer FinFET process, achieved using Synopsys tools.","These are just the latest in a growing string of achievements, including the tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer low-power test chip. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of its successful collaboration history and the comprehensive capabilities throughout our portfolio.","Another excellent example is FPGA provider, Achronix, standardizing on IP Compiler and IP Validator and taping out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based SOC using our tools.","Now let me turn to verification, where technology leadership is just as important. Today, our digital verification is used in the vast majority of advanced designs, and 19 of the top 20 semiconductor companies use Synopsys circuit simulation. With smaller transistors, and thus more transistors on a chip, the need for massive amounts of verification continues to grow. This is why the quest for still faster simulation is essential to our strategy. In that context, our VCS simulator and ZeBu emulator both have the fastest run times in their category.","Growing equally rapidly in importance is the need to simultaneously verify hardware and software. Our combination of emulation, FPGA-based prototyping and virtual prototyping is unique in its breadth and capabilities. This is an area for growth for us, and prototyping, specifically, has been strong for us all year. In the past, customers typically built and assembled complex FPGA boards in-house to complement their chip simulation and accelerate their hardware\/software debugging. These efforts are increasingly being outsourced to us, and we're collaborating closely with some of the most advanced design companies in the world in this area.","To fully increase the impact of all these verification technologies, we are substantially investing in integration around the Verdi debug system. As you may recall, we acquired Verdi through the acquisition of SpringSoft late last year. It is the gold standard open debug system used broadly across the world. I can report that not only is the product superb, but the integration, while an enormous task, is progressing well. A number of key customers are collaborating closely with us in setting long-term direction.","Let me close with an update on our IP products, which continue to thrive and grow. Over the past 10 years, the use of third-party commercial IP has gone from experimental, to periodically used, to mainstream. In parallel, the complexity of our IP has evolved from simple cost-advantaged blocks, to a broad portfolio of all the main interface protocols, to now extremely complex state-of-the-art and rapidly evolving next-generation solutions. In addition, our team has also become extremely proficient in the advanced technologies around FinFETs, and we're heavily engaged in sub-20-nanometer libraries, memories and analog IP.","According to Gartner, Synopsys is the largest provider of physical IP, more than double the nearest competitor. The amount of IP that the top 20 semiconductor vendors consume has increased by 5x over the past few years and now represents almost half of our DesignWare IP revenue. Overall, we're the second largest IP provider in the world, with about 1,900 engineers designing commercial IP blocks, giving us the #1 position in interface, embedded memories and analog IP. We estimate that only about 50% of these types of blocks are outsourced today, and we expect this area of our business to continue to yield double-digit growth, driven more -- by more outsourcing as well as additional protocols and titles.","In Q3, we released memory blocks for a number of 14-\/16-nanometer FinFET processes, realized a key competitive win in interface IP and were chosen as the strategic IP partner by a large U.S. company for 16-nanometer FinFETs. Lastly, we also announced a new low-power IP subsystem for sensors, aimed at the \"Internet of things\" markets. This is an integrated, pre-verified system that sensor developers can purchase off the shelf rather than developing and assembling each component themselves.","In summary, Synopsys continues to demonstrate broad strength and innovation in technology, customer relationships and financial execution. We delivered very solid financial results in the quarter, and as a result, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q4 and the full year. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.","Now Synopsys delivered a solid quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in May. Additionally, we continued our stock repurchase program and generated considerable operating cash flow.","Now some additional detail. Total revenue was $483 million, an increase of 9% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Approximately 90% of the Q3 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for more than 10% of third quarter revenue.","The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.9 years. We continue to expect average duration for FY '13 to be greater than 3 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal in Q2.","Turning to expenses. Q3 total GAAP cost and expenses were $428 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16.5 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $375 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases in headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions, along with timing of quarterly expenses, including year-over-year cost increases, such as employee compensation and planned product investments.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5% for the quarter and 25% for the first 3 quarters of the year. Our ongoing goal continues to be a focus on operational efficiency with annual non-GAAP operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.33, with non-GAAP earnings per share at $0.55. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 20.5% for the quarter, below our target range due primarily to some onetime tax benefits that resulted from a true-up of our FY '12 taxes with the U.S. tax return that was filed just last month. As a result, we think that the non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13. And as a reminder, this rate reflects the reinstated R&D tax credits for both FY '12 and '13, which benefited FY '13 non-GAAP earnings.","Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. During the quarter, we generated $263 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow targets for the year to approximately $400 million. And this is reflective of the higher-than-planned business levels and cash collections experienced throughout 2013. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $130 million. During the quarter, we purchased about 1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $35 million. During the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we spent $70 million, repurchasing about 2 million shares, and we have approximately $202 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $892 million, with 43% onshore and 57% offshore. We plan to continue optimizing use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.","DSO was 53 days, reflecting the timing of invoices, and we ended Q3 with approximately 8,400 employees, with about 1\/3 in lower-cost geographies.","Now let's address our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the fourth quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $500 million and $510 million, a year-over-year increase of 11% of the midpoint. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect some increased variability in quarterly revenues going forward, and this can be driven by factors, such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue, timing of consulting projects and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are received. However, we continue to expect a quarterly revenue model that is approximately 90% time-based.","Total GAAP costs and expenses between $432 million and $449 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $386 million and $396 million; other income and expense between $1 million a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 23% to 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.29 to $0.35 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share.","Now our fiscal 2013 outlook shows revenues between $1.957 billion and $1.967 billion, a growth rate of 12% of the midpoint or 13%, excluding the extra week we had in 2012. We've been able to maintain our annual revenue growth targets even in the context of a significant yen depreciation this year due to our hedging programs and our stronger business levels.","Other income and expense between $8 million and $10 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.51 to $1.57, which includes the impact of approximately $67 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.42 to $2.44, which represents solid, double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $400 million.","So in summary, we're pleased with our solid Q3 financial performance and execution, highlighted by considerable cash flow generation and on-target operating results.","So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Brian, you referenced higher-than-planned business levels, yet you very slightly tweaked down your revenue guidance for the year. Is that just due to the, what you mentioned, sort of higher expected volatility around hardware sales and those timing of consulting deals?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, again, we are seeing very, very strong business levels, and we referenced that last quarter and again this quarter. And as a result of that, we're able to confirm a very solid revenue growth for the year. We're looking at about 12% right now. It's right within the range we set at the very beginning of the year. It's within the range that we set at the last quarter even. And as a result of that, too, we're now able to raise the midpoint of our EPS guidance by about $0.03 from last quarter. So again, we're in good shape. We're actually -- you see us now shooting for over $500 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, which is a record achievement for us as well that we're planning.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe I can ask it another way. Were -- are there any geos or product areas that are a bit lighter than expected? And I guess I'd call out Japan, in particular, that's been down high-single digits to double digits for the last 3 quarters. Is that a headwind that's sort of had some cumulative impact here? And any thoughts on any of those?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, yes. We do see, as I mentioned, even last quarter, we anticipated the results we'd have this week -- this quarter. We do see some variability just based on the timing of the elements like our emulation hardware products and our boards, our prototyping activity, where all that revenues move within the quarter; so again, seeing very good, strong growth. The consulting part of the business is doing pretty well. And again, that timing of that is based on, Rich, either the percentage completion or when the cash comes in from the customers. So we just tune it into the actual expectations based on the type of business. But overall, looks like a very, very strong year again that we're putting up.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, one final one for me. With respect to your analog and custom design initiative, just wanted to talk about how that's going in the market, how the Laker product is doing. And that was a well-respected product but a very small revenue base relative to the total market. Wondering if you feel like you're having some success there in trying to crack into that sort of analog custom design market, based on those Laker tools.","Aart J. de Geus","As a matter of fact, yes, Laker was a very good acquisition, and the combination of Laker and the efforts that we had in CD are quite complementary, and we're still in the process of integrating all of that. But one of the other things that we inherited with Laker, of course, is a very strong presence with a number of customers. And while one goes through the uncertainties of an initial acquisition, I can report that the customers are very positive about what we're doing and have been very stable with us, so we can build on that. In addition, we're finding also that the ability to do code design with the obviously very strong digital offering that we have is growing in opportunity. So I think Laker was a great addition to what we have, and the integration is progressing very well with what is truly also a stellar team in the form of SpringSoft people.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I had a couple of them. One, Brian, on the guidance for the October quarter, what is the reason for the non-GAAP OpEx going up that much?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, the timing of the spending, again, is just based on when the agreements are put in place, and it's a profile that's recognizing salary increases that come in the year. There's little bit of variable comp related to, again, a very strong fourth quarter that's expected. So really, just a -- it's a typical Q4 profile that we see. We saw the same thing last year and then typically, the next quarter, in Q1, kind of drops off. So it really is just the tuning-up for all the final year expense activity.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. That's very helpful. And then I have another question for you. When you look at the foundries moving to 20 and below on the FinFET side, I'm just kind of curious, can you help quantify what is the increase in design cost when you go from a 28- to a 20-nanometer planar? And then when you go from planar to 16 or 14 FinFET geometry, can you help quantify what the incremental design cost of that [ph] is?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, this is actually quite difficult because very often, people, as they move to the next node, and especially as they move into this one, they're simultaneously dramatically increasing the complexity of their chip. And so what they are trying to get is, for roughly what is the same manufacturing costs because those have tended to be relatively stable for many, many, many years, is a much higher degree of functionality. On top of that, what complicates your question is to what degree are they pushing the envelope on performance and power. And so those people that really want to exceed their competition in that angle will spend more with us, and we're clearly seeing that the first version of any design is a step-up in terms of investment, in terms of time and in terms of utilization of tools. I'm clarifying that it's first version, because there's a lot of wrong beliefs in the industry that every chip is just incredibly more expensive. That's not true. Once you've done the first version of a chip, most of the chips are derivatives, that then are much lower cost. So at the end of the day, the economic equation holds pretty well together, and the reason I can say that is because we can see the number of people accelerating their push towards the sub-20-nanometer FinFET generation to actually continue to increase. And I think that's a very good sign because, as you've heard me say before, I think FinFET has opened up another decade of Moore's Law, and we're well on our way with that.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But -- and then when you look at it historically, like maybe going back to the 28-nanometer node, what was the time from the time -- from the moment they finalized the design to the time they ramped up capacity? And do you expect that to be shorter when you go to FinFET because you said that you're accelerating to the FinFET node? Once they finalize the FinFET design, when do you expect actual volume output on factories to happen?","Aart J. de Geus","I think that, in aggregate, it is not that different from any of the previous nodes. Because as much as the processing is a bit more complex, it does not add an enormous amount of time compared to previous processing steps. And so then it's more a question of what your degree of confidence in the quality of the designs, do you have to do any engineering changes to it and tape it out another time -- another round. And in general, so far the evidence is that we're doing just as well as we did with any of the previous generations, but it is a big investment for specifically the foundries to get all of their data together. One more comment, with these much larger chips, these chips are de facto little supercomputers because they have many processing cores, comes also an increase of the embedded software that goes with it. And so as much as your question is pertinent, I do think that the time-to-market is as much dominated by the readiness of the software as the issues around the hardware.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","I think the first question for Brian. Brian, if I look at 9 months, the revenue from Japan, it's almost down 10% year-over-year. Is it mainly due to the yen? Or you think either the semi spend or the EDA spend in the Japan is slowing?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, it's really a combination of that, Monika. For the first part, we do see the yen has devalued about 20% this year, and most of our revenues in Japan are in yen-denominated contracts. In addition to that, we're just looking at perspective on Japanese economy, which is fairly flat, and a lot of activity, of course, going on to encourage the activity levels and the investments to the government and so on to pick up the overall economic growth levels in Japan. So again, we expect that, that may bring us even better results next year.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then just kind of a follow-up, what we have seen in the semi industry right now, I mean, semi industry kind of is deep in challenge, as you kind of talked about in your opening remarks. So could you maybe talk about the impact of slowing to flat growth of semiconductor industry on the EDA industry?","Aart J. de Geus","Sure. So first and foremost, I think what happens in the semiconductor industry is largely governed by the external economy. And so, in that sense, that industry is not different than any others, except for the fact that new technology has an uncanny way of actually holding strong even in economic tough times. And I shouldn't just maybe call it tough, it's just sort of anemic for, now, a number of years. And so semiconductors are actually quite intense in terms of the investments. The growth rate, it keeps being projected as going up 6 months from now. But in all honesty, that's been now happening for, for a little while, but the investments continue to be very targeted. And so for our industry, the EDA industry, and I would say also some of the technology investments around manufacturing, investments have continued because the opportunity space going forward is extremely attractive as we enter this next round of silicon technology in transistor type. And we, Synopsys, have been fortunate to see this coming for a little while and, therefore, have invested heavily into it. And that's why I think we will continue to deliver a higher growth rate than the semiconductor industry for sure and, in general, have done quite well and certainly, our bookings have been strong again in that direction.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","Then I have one on the cash and capital allocation. I mean, you guys have raised again your operating cash flow guidance. So have you thought about maybe initiating dividend?","Aart J. de Geus","We have shied away from that because we feel that, in our space, having options around M&A or buybacks is actually the better way to use the cash and that is what we've been doing for the last number of years. We never say no to anything, but at the same time, right now, our priorities are very clear. Our objective is to continue to grow the earnings per share, and we are doing that -- the -- all the mechanisms that we set, which is leadership in technology, invest there, invest in the support of our customers and then also manage the profitability of the company upwards and keep looking at opportunities to acquire technologies if they are ready and if they fit our profile.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities, Inc., Research Division","And just the last one, if I may. You talked about the sensor IP. Could you maybe help me understand maybe more details on the sensor IP you talked about? Is it the interface IP for sensors or is it something else?","Aart J. de Geus","Certainly. Well, first, why is it important? Well, if you look at the Internet today, of course, this has been growing immensely in the last 15, 20 years mostly because of the connectivity first of people to people over the Internet and then major compute centers to other major compute opportunities over that same medium. What is clearly going to happen now is that for many things, and it's actually referred to as the \"Internet of things,\" there will be more and more connectivity provided, which is another way of saying that everyday objects will need some connectivity, will need some smarts [ph] , will need some memory and it will need to be connected via sensors to the physical reality. And so what we have provided is essentially a very, very well-integrated small set of IP blocks that are ready to be connected to sensors and that can be, in turn, integrated into a broader compute environment or communications environment. And thus, we're following our past strategy, which is provide the puzzle pieces that maybe others could build as well, but that can be more efficient -- efficiently acquired or outsourced to us.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Want to start with the upfront revenue. So the results of the quarter, was all of that attributed to the acquisition of EVE and the revenue recognition around that? Or was there other upfront contracts in the more traditional part of your business?","Brian M. Beattie","Sterling, it's really related to the hardware part of the business. All of our hardware transactions are enacted in the quarter, in which we shipped, and it's taken upfront, so that reflects that. And it was a very strong on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So that's what happened in Q3, and it came in pretty well as expected. And again, it's one of those items we've highlighted that may move from quarter-to-quarter just based on timing of the deals and when we actually are shipping the product but it's not ratable. It's right upfront.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And when you look at the contributions from the recent acquisitions, can you at least qualitatively characterize how they performed? And can you talk us through, was there any impact on deferred revenue from the acquisitions?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, maybe on the last part, no. No impact on deferred revenue. That's just business as usual. Everything was fully integrated for all of the acquisitions last year, were integrated at the very beginning of the year. So balance sheets and everything reflected that. And so the quarter-to-quarter swings in deferred revenues, which, as you know, just reflects the ability to invoice customers. And where we haven't taken revenue, there's no significant change in that profile year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter.","Aart J. de Geus","On the integrations, I think things are actually progressing extremely well. We're happy with all the acquisitions that we made. And there's, of course, a lot of work to integrate them, largely because the acquisitions were made with the broader vision in mind. And specifically, if you look at even SpringSoft, the broader vision has been clearly around providing a much more sophisticated verification environment that would not only contain more multiple engines, so our simulator's an engine, but so is EVE, so are some of the FPGA prototyping that we have and so on. And it connects all of those to a common debugger, which is the Verdi debugger. I think that vision is turning out to be right on and has connected very, very well with a number of our most advanced customers. The other part, of course, that was mentioned briefly earlier is that there was also an analog\/mixed-signal set of capabilities that came with SpringSoft, and that team has aligned very, very well with the team that we already have in that domain. And maybe the third one to mention, because it was also done last year, is Magma. There are 2 -- in the last 2 quarters, and specifically also this quarter, we saw excellent progress with a number of formerly key customers of Magma to now really align strongly with where we're going in our implementation flow on the new technologies. And so I think those transitions towards a common set of company products, all in all, are progressing very well. And the hard metric, of course, is, is that what's happening with the customers? And the answer is yes. The customers are very much following our vision there.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, last one. I want to go back to the point you made about business momentum. You sounded very positive on it, but I wanted to just connect some dots here. You had DSOs that jumped 7 days quarter-over-quarter. You've got the jump in OpEx expected in the fourth quarter, partly in your comment about variable expenses, because you're expecting strong bookings in the fourth quarter, and the revenue forecast for October is below consensus. If I put that all together, perhaps one theory is going to be, you had a back-end-loaded quarter this quarter and a number of yields pushed into the fourth quarter, where you're not going to get a full coverage worth of revenue recognition, that's why the revenue guide is where it is. I just want to throw that out there, so you can talk to it, so we can just tell if that's not the right way to connect those dots.","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, just to be clear, the way I look at it is from a very different perspective, which is we are running the company, first on a yearly basis and secondly, sort of backwards from earnings per share. And so whenever we look at how these different things flow, our key objective is to not execute -- not only execute within the guidance that we've been giving, but hopefully, even better than guidance if the external business picture allows for that. It has done so this year. Obviously, we have one quarter to go. But as you know, we have a pretty good sense of where we can land in a given quarter. And so all of the comments that you've made are all variables that are being tuned as we end the year. And right now, overall, we'll do a substantially better than what we had set at the beginning of the year. And most of our focus right now has to be, therefore, on FY '14 and '15. And that is really where most of our planning work is going. So again, the emphasis is on the earnings per share. All the other variables are important, but they sort of have to fall in line just like the puzzle pieces over an overall picture.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of financial questions for Brian to start and then a couple on the industry for Aart. Brian, could you connect the dots as well with regard to the sequential drop in your core EDA business plus a fairly substantial drop in Asia-Pac versus Q2 and as well as the sequential drop in your TBL revenues from Q2? Is that all correlated? And then similarly, going back to Sterling's question about the upfront revenue, you had a fairly large sequential increase in your cost of license revenue from the second quarter. Was that more closely connected to a increase or strength in your HAPS prototyping business that have -- might have been connected to the emulation business?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes. Okay, let me tackle all those questions. When we look at both the Q2 to Q3 profile, you're -- you sort of triangulating on a number of points related to specific contracts with specific customers. So for example, on the TBL line, as we had expected back in second quarter, we knew that there were certain elements related to both deliveries, cash collections from customers and so on that would have projected revenues in Q3 to come down a little bit from what we saw in Q2. That came through exactly, in effect, and that account was in the Asia-Pacific region. So sort of triangulating on your points about TBLs and then the Asia-Pacific. And then as we had indicated last quarter and this quarter, you are going to see a little bit of movement there based on either the hardware variables or the other elements that come in to services, which are up very nicely year-over-year. That's based on percentage completion, when we actually make the deliverables or milestones for that effect. But nonetheless, still maintaining 90% of each quarter's revenue coming from the backlog and being time-based. So it's just as we expected, as it came through, as it's profiled now in the Q3 is totally aligned. Your second question was about a COGS increase in Q3, and it was at $85 million and it was $77 million from a year ago. So that part there primarily related to the hardware deliveries, which I'd indicated with Sterling, was also up very nicely on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So that was where you'll see that movement from COGS for the cost of the hardware product that we delivered in the quarter. It was up very nicely.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Right. But I was asking if it was more correlated to the prototyping business, which, Aart mentioned in his prepared remarks, was strong through the year versus the EVE business.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, I'd agree with the first part. It's -- the extra strength came through the prototyping side.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Aart, the latest industry data would suggest that the big 3 EDA vendors have reached a new level of concentration or percentage of total EDA revenue, let's call it around 80% versus roughly 75% that the big 3 shared for many, many years. Do you see that as having any effect in terms of pricing or other business effects by virtue of you're now having a more concentrated EDA supplier base? And by the same token, do you see the customer base potentially offsetting that by themselves becoming more concentrated?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, for starter, if I may change the premise a little bit. We have already, for a number of years, started to look at ourselves as not at all limited by the traditional definition of EDA and much more look at the entire space of chip design. And a good example for the benefit of looking at it that way is clearly what we can see happening both on the side of the IP business growth as well as all the areas that we touched where there's hardware\/software and, by the way, also in some of the manufacturing area. And so as much as we often get lumped, of course, within the traditional core EDA space, and we're sort of lacking to find the right terminology how we want to describe ourselves, our business space is actually quite large. And in that context, I think we have a lot of opportunities. Now having said that, I think we have competitors. We never underestimate them, and we can hope that they have good, healthy growth and no need to compete in ways that are not good for the market. But I've very little to say about that. Our objective is to keep growing our bottom line. And so far, I think we're well on track with that.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. Since you brought up the issue of a broader view of the market, let me refer back to your presentation at the conference in Austin 2 months ago where you spoke fairly broadly about the role or value of EDA, and you put it in the context of application, customers' applications -- your customers' applications relative to the cost of electronics, which are presumably becoming less significant. Could you put that in the context of how all of that, that very broad vision you talked about, informs your product strategy or your market strategy, particularly for emerging markets in terms of automotive electronics and other market? How do you translate that very broad thing you talked about 2 months ago into your product and market strategy, particularly in terms of the specific verticals?","Aart J. de Geus","It's a great question because it's a difficult question. And it's a difficult question because, on one hand, one needs to have a clear understanding as to where the entire industry is going. And one of the key drivers motivating in that specific speech was to highlight the fact that with absolutely another decade of Moore's Law ahead of us, we will see such tremendous capability changes that is actually hard to predict all the applications, but it's not hard to predict that it will impact many fields very fundamentally. And for an earlier question half an hour ago on the \"Internet of things,\" that's just one aspect of that. But one can also talk about all the aspects of how it will touch the health industry. You mentioned automotive. In maybe somewhat flippant terms, there will be more smarts brought to individual tasks and individual objects in the world. Now that's easy to say, and then how do you make next quarter, and that's called the running of a company like Synopsys. And so the way we translate this is to understand where the long-term trends are. Understands that even if we may understand these very well, they're always very difficult to predict from a timeline point of view, but it is very useful to say, well, any action that we take, how is it helping out existing customers? How can we make it as adjacent as possible, adjacency in technology, adjacency in channel? Adjacency in terms of the customer makeup and thus, expand the serviceable market for us; and a TAM that I think is actually quite broad, depending on how you define it. And so in that context, we do have a number of bets in the water, and we have also a number of them that are seeing strong traction. As you well know, one of those bets was the moving into IP and that is over 10 years ago. And today, it is -- it's an engine that has a lot of growth potential with it. You now see that we are broadening those solutions, adding more hardware and software. And so, it is always a balance between long-term vision and day-to-day execution, and I think we are in a very, very good position because the core of our technology is absolutely exactly where the semiconductor customers need us to be. And they continue to bet on us for all the difficult work.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Aart, just continuing on that theme, can you talk about, again, most specifically, what your expectations for the long-term growth are for that core EDA and IP business? And in that context, how do you feel about the next year? Is it going to be a typical year? Or do you see something different next year?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we want to refrain to give guidance now for next year. As you know, we do that in the fourth quarter. I think that, fundamentally, our view of the market that we're in has not changed. The core EDA is stabler for us and in the mid-single-digit growth range. The IP is in the double-digit growth range. And on average, as you know, we tend to sort of predict the year as a balance of those 2 things, and I'm refraining to give guidance for '14 right now. That has fundamentally not changed. At any point in time. We have things that go through growth spurts and others that need to be revamped, and that's something different this year, I think, than any other year. I think we're in a -- really a very strong and solid position.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","That's fair. And in terms of emulation, you talked about that. Where do you see -- what kind of contribution do you see from that particular business? And can you talk about -- a little bit about the competitive landscape in that business?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, for us, emulation actually, just like any of the other tools in verification, is no longer viewed as a standalone point tool. We are very much focusing everything we do on a verification solution, and the reason for that is simple. As much as we'll push on every one of our teams to be at the point tools [ph] , state of the art and best in class, the reality is our users use this tools in the context of very complex systemic verifications, where you pass certain portions of the design to one tool, certain portions in another tool. You need more accuracy. You need more speed. You balance these things. And what is great about the EVE acquisition is that it fits very well in the picture that we were building and, augmented by the Verdi debugger, really now complements our offering to be not only very complete but to have state-of-the-art point tools. But our objective is really to integrate those into an overall outstanding solution. We're well on our way, but there's still quite a bit of work to be done there. And so I think that FY '14 will really be the year where we will have a lot of real messaging around verification.","Operator","We have a follow-up from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, Brian, you talked about the FX impact of the yen, but wondering if you could actually quantify what the revenue impact year-to-date has actually been because of the yen headwind.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, we've indicated that again, in Japan, most of those contracts are yen denominated. We haven't broken out all the details on a line by line, but it is noticeable as a nonmaterial impact up to the revenue line. We've seen some improvement during the year from the hedging program that was booked through other income and expense. And when it flows through to the bottom line of 2013, it's really non-material to the EPS as well, just based on a very conserved hedging business. And the rest of it is just offset by a lot of hard work by all the different business units. So we've got recognizing what we had on our hands in 2013 and overall coming through, netting out in terms of revenues here that are right on track with what we said at the very beginning of the year despite some of that devaluation, looking at earnings, which are up about 16% overall for the year as well. So again, we just have to offset it. It's one of the many things that you have to deal with in running the business, and we're happy to deal with our results for the company.","Operator","And with that, I'd like to turn it back all to you, speakers, for any closing remarks.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, thank you for attending this session. I hope that the picture that emerges is one of excellent results and a strong confidence based on the technology position that we have. And as usual, we are open to your calls right after this. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","This presentation is now finished. Please check back shortly for the archive."],"20080":["Synopsys, Inc.

And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2017. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Reba. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. The company will also refer to the planned acquisition of Black Duck Software. Please note that the acquisition is not yet closed and is subject to closing conditions and regulatory review.","Finally, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I am happy to report another excellent quarter and with it another outstanding year for Synopsys. In fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $2.725 billion, an increase of 12.5%, non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.42, 13% growth, we generated $635 million in operating cash flow, our three-year backlog grew by approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion and we bought back $400 million of our stock.","These results extended our multi-year track record of strong growth with three-year CAGRs of 10% for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, accentuated by upside from hardware and IP, our business became stronger and stronger as we moved through the year, resulting in good revenue growth across all product groups and all geographies.","The fiscal \u201817 double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth was achieved through both revenue growth and increasing operating margin, even with acquisition-related dilution. Simultaneously, we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions with good organic growth, the Cigital acquisition in Q1 and the planned Black Duck transaction announced earlier this month. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","As we assess the business we\u2019ve built over the past 30 plus years and look forward to the next five years to 10 years, we\u2019re enthusiastic about our prospects. The market opportunity is vast and increasing as we enter the age of Smart Everything. Synopsys is well-aligned to benefit from the emerging market dynamics. And lastly, our financial position and priorities amply support our aspirations.","Let me expand on these three elements of our value proposition. First, the age of Smart Everything or Digital Intelligence is here. Following the decades driven by Computation and then Mobility, Digital Intelligence is the third major wave of electronics impact.","Week by week we can see its reach growing, be it through the Internet of Things, automotive, virtual reality, medical devices or industrial. The need to manipulate massive amounts of data, apply AI through machine learning, while guaranteeing security is unstoppable. All of this is made possible with an insatiable hunger for next-generation advanced chips and complex software developed by our customers.","Second, Synopsys is uniquely positioned at the very intersection of silicon hardware and software. Our design and verification tools are essential for the next-generation of advanced chips and systems. Our growing silicon-proven IP offering reduces risk and speeds time-to-market. In addition, our Software Integrity portfolio prevents code flaws from becoming security disasters.","And third, we have maintained strong financial solidity while broadening our company TAM precisely for the opportunity at hand. Our recurring revenue model lets us consistently invest in advanced product development and support. We\u2019ve managed our strong balance sheet and cash flow to enable both consistent stock buybacks and TAM-broadening acquisitions. And we\u2019re driving shareholder value through long-term, high-single digit, non-GAAP earnings growth.","Elaborating on our market and technical position, let me provide some highlights, beginning with EDA. With continued silicon and architectural sophistication, the success of next-generation chips is paramount in bringing about big data and machine learning opportunities.","Synopsys EDA continues to enable astounding levels of complexity, resulting in strong demand for state-of-the-art solutions across our product lines. Even with strong competition and continued customer consolidation, we\u2019ve fared well with growth outpacing the others over the past several years.","We continue to strongly invest in our market leading digital design platform. Our solution has been instrumental in enabling many firsts, the first ever 10 nanometer production design, the first 7 nanometer tapeout, and now significant activity on early 5 nanometer designs. The largest ever FinFET design was implemented with the Synopsys platform, as was the largest networking processor in the world.","Our digital platform is consistently trusted on the most advanced projects and is relied on for more than 95% of all FinFET designs. Our success is particularly evident in applications such as mobile, automotive, CPUs, graphics and AI-specific processors. And while we\u2019re seeing share gains with customers across industries ranging from networking to storage to sensors, automotive has been particularly strong with nine of the top 10 automotive IC suppliers enabled through the Synopsys platform. Notably, at a leading automotive IC supplier, we\u2019re growing and displacing the competition.","Meanwhile, the move to smaller geometries continues. New manufacturing approaches, new materials, and new innovative transistor structures require our 3D TCAD expertise to develop them.","In Q4, we announced the acquisition of QuantumWise, whose amazing atomic-level simulation tools enhance our ability to model the most advanced next-generation devices. In custom and analog mixed-signal design, our Custom Compiler and Circuit Simulation not only demonstrated excellent technical results but saw good revenue growth during the year.","Customers such as MediaTek, Renesas, Panasonic, ST and TDK\/Micronas have reported very successful deployments and tapeouts using our Custom Compiler solution, which is targeted specifically at FinFET designs.","Now to verification, which continues to be an area of strength and growth for Synopsys. We realized a number of years ago that as chips and systems became more and more complex, verification would increasingly be required at the intersection of hardware and software. Over the last years, while collaborating with market leading customers, we developed a comprehensive verification platform that excels at exactly that.","In fiscal 2017, our investments have resulted in another outstanding year of growth and share gains. One example is Samsung SARC, which chose our Verification Continuum, including simulation, formal, emulation, debug and verification IP as the primary solution for their advanced mobile processor designs.","Strong customer adoption of our hardware verification products drove another record year as well. Among high profile customers presenting at the Design Automation Conference in June, AMD highlighted its use of our ZeBu emulation for early software development and bring-up. For software, emulation speed is critical and ZeBu is the fastest solution in the market.","In Q4, we saw another example of the huge potential for our emulation. A mobile giant, faced with verification challenges inherent in software-rich mobile platforms adopted ZeBu citing its performance superiority.","Turning to semiconductor IP, we had another excellent year of double-digit growth. Over the past 15 plus years, we\u2019ve built the broadest portfolio of IP titles and subsystems and have become a trusted partner and market leader. Our foundry relationships and active drive in standards groups ensure that customers can buy leading-edge products in key technology processes at the earliest stages.","During 2017, we further expanded our portfolio, with continued focus on automotive, IoT and security. We expanded our IoT offering with our new ARC Secure IP subsystem for endpoint security and our IoT Development Kit to accelerate software development for sensor fusion, voice recognition and face detection designs.","We announced the collaboration with Morpho, a leader in digital security and identity solutions to accelerate deep learning processing for embedded vision applications. In Q4, we acquired Sidense, adding One-Time Programmable Non-Volatile Memory IP, which is used in automotive and IoT among other markets.","Our IP group has been a beneficiary of customer consolidation, providing outsourcing options to companies who want to target their limited engineering resources more towards differentiating their projects.","Let me next move to our Software Integrity Group, which provides products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.","Customers for these solutions span semiconductor and systems companies, who are embedding considerable software content into their chips and devices, all the way to developers of software in industries such as financial services, medical, automotive and high-impact industrial.","Over the past three-and-a-half years, we\u2019ve become a clear leader in this emerging high-growth industry. Since our initial entry with the acquisition of Coverity, we\u2019ve invested both organically and through key acquisitions to develop a product platform and services to better serve companies deal with daunting software security problems. As we gain scale and credibility, our brand recognition continues to strengthen. Gartner ranks Synopsys now as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Application Security Testing.","During the year, we made good progress integrating the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, and are now seeing a positive impact on demand. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Black Duck Software, the leader in testing Open Source software for known security vulnerabilities and license compliance. With Open Source making up 60% or more of all applications, this capability is critical to deliver a robust platform.","Initial customer reaction has been great, as they recognize the benefits of combining Black Duck\u2019s highly respected capabilities with the broader Synopsys offering. The acquisition is scheduled to close shortly, subject to regulatory review and customary closing conditions. Our vision and investments are resonating well with customers and we\u2019re excited about the long-term potential of this product group.","Lastly, I\u2019ve mentioned a number of vertical markets this afternoon. One key vertical that is going through momentous change and is directly impacted by our end-to-end solutions is automotive. Let me provide some highlights resulting from our multiyear automotive strategy.","Because safety is so critical, the automotive industry requires certification of products up and down their value chain. We\u2019ve significantly expanded our portfolio of products certified for standards such as ISO 26262, including our functional safety test solution, which was certified in Q4.","During this year, we\u2019ve massively expanded our industry-leading automotive grade IP offering, including a broad portfolio of interface blocks that meet stringent automotive temperature requirements for the 16-nanometer FinFET process.","In Q4, we extended a multiyear Automotive Center of Excellence collaboration with NXP, enabling early software development for next-generation electronic systems. We\u2019re also well-recognized in the industry, serving as a leader on the Society of Automotive Engineers\u2019 Cyber Security Task Force focused on driving new standards for software security.","In summary, for Synopsys, fiscal 2017 was an excellent year, positioning us well going forward. We achieved outstanding financial results, with revenue strength across the Board. Our EDA and IP products are delivering top-notch results for customers building chips to bring about the Digital Intelligence, Smart Everything age. And we\u2019re making significant progress in scaling our software security platform and market leadership position.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. To echo what Aart said, our strong finish in Q4 capped an outstanding 2017. This year\u2019s success reflects our commitment to deliver solid financial results in the near-term, while simultaneously creating sustainable growth and profitability over the long-term.","Over the last three years, we have continued to expand our leadership in EDA and IP, while also broadening our portfolio with our Software Integrity solutions. We are executing very well on our strategy, which is reflected not only in the broad-based strength of our financial results, but also in the expansion of our Software Integrity business group with the announced planned acquisition of Black Duck.","Based on our recent performance, the strength of our portfolio and the backlog coverage heading into fiscal \u201818, we are optimistic about our ability to drive sustainable success in the coming years. As I discuss the financial highlights, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.","We delivered total revenue of $697 million in Q4 and $2.725 billion for the year, an annual growth rate of 12.5%. Business was strong across all product groups, particularly hardware and IP. In addition to another record year for hardware, our Q4 results included approximately $30 million in revenue from a large hardware shipment that was planned for 2018 but shifted into Q4.","Our three-year backlog grew approximately $150 million to $3.7 billion, reflecting very good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals. We again have a large proportion of 2018 revenue, approximately 75% already in hand, providing stability and predictability not often seen in enterprise software companies.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $605 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $566 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year. 2017 expenses increased due primarily to higher costs associated with acquisitions, employee compensation and cost of goods sold for hardware sales. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 23.8% for the year, even with the modest dilution from our Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions.","We posted GAAP earnings for the year of $0.88 per share, including a loss of $0.80 in the quarter, reflecting the one-time impact of our repatriation of offshore cash, which I\u2019ll talk more about in a moment. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.69 for the quarter and $3.42 for the year, an annual growth rate of 13%.","As I mentioned earlier, Q4 had the benefit of a hardware-related shift, which was the primary driver of $0.11 overachievement versus expectations. Even excluding this upside, we delivered annual EPS growth of 10%, exceeding our original target.","We generated $185 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and $635 million for the year. We significantly exceeded our original 2017 target due to strong collections and business levels throughout the year, as well as $30 million received from ATopTech for litigation damages.","During the quarter, we initiated the repatriation of $825 million of offshore cash, taking advantage of our R&D tax credits and resulting in a cash tax rate of approximately 6%. This resulted in a GAAP-only tax expense of $166 million in Q4 and will drive a one-time cash tax payment of approximately $40 million in early 2018.","Also affecting 2018 operating cash flow is a $65 million one-time payment to the Hungarian tax authority, in connection with an ongoing tax dispute. While we expect to prevail, we are required to make this payment as a condition for continuing our appeal. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $1 billion, with 53% onshore and total debt of $144 million.","In 2017, we used about 70% of our free cash flow for stock buybacks. We repurchased $400 million this year and over the past three years have repurchased close to $1.1 billion of our stock. We have $400 million remaining on our current authorization. Our current plan for 2018 is to use buybacks to keep share count roughly flat.","Before providing 2018 guidance, let me briefly comment on the Black Duck acquisition, which is subject to regulatory approval and closing conditions, but we expect will close in December. When closed, we will pay approximately $548 million net of cash.","Due to a purchase-accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $25 million to $30 million, Black Duck is expected to contribute roughly $55 million to $60 million revenue in 2018. We expect it to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2019 and be accretive thereafter.","Now to guidance, due primarily to an extra week in fiscal Q1 and the profile of expenses, we expect first half revenue and earnings to be greater than the second half. Q1 targets are, revenue between $740 million and $765 million, which includes approximately $40 million from the extra week, total GAAP costs and expenses between $625 million and $641 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $560 million and $570 million, other income and expense between minus $1 million and $1 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share to $0.70 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.98 per share to $1.02 per share, including approximately $0.05 from the extra week.","For 2018, total revenue of $2.88 billion to $2.91 billion, a growth rate of 6% to 7%. Excluding Black Duck, the total revenue target range is $2.82 billion to $2.855 billion. Other income and expense between minus $6 million and minus $2 million, a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $2.24 per share to $2.38 per share or $2.68 per share to $2.80 per share excluding Black Duck, non-GAAP earnings of $3.46 per share to $3.53 per share or $3.58 per share to $3.65 per share excluding Black Duck, capital expenditures of approximately $110 million and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million. As I mentioned earlier, this reflects one-time cash payments totaling approximately $105 million.","In summary, we are executing very well on our goal to drive long-term shareholder value. We reported outstanding results across the Board in 2017, while delivering a high level of predictability with $3.7 billion of backlog and scaling our Software Integrity products with the acquisition of Black Duck.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Lisa Ewbank","Reba, are you there?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am, I am.","Lisa Ewbank","We are ready for Q&A.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I do have on site Mr. Gary Mobley, your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","Gary Mobley","Hi. Can you hear me okay.","Aart de Geus","Yes. Thank you.","Gary Mobley","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong finish to the year.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Gary Mobley","Trac, can you confirm whether or not the Software Integrity Group finished fiscal year \u201817 with about $170 million? And with the contribution from Black Duck as you outlined in your guidance, can you give us a sense of where Software Integrity will be for fiscal year \u201818? And is there any quantifiable impact to ASC 606 implying your Q1 and fiscal year \u201818 guide?","Trac Pham","So let me start with your first question on SIG. The numbers you described for SIG is pretty consistent with what we had guided at the beginning of year, and yes, we did achieve the goals that we\u2019d outlined at the start of the year.","Second part is, we are not calling out the numbers for Software Integrity specifically for next year, but it is consistent with about 20% growth on an ongoing basis. And Black Duck separately from that as we mentioned is in the range of $55 million to $60 million of revenues for 2018. With regards to 606, we will be implementing 606 starting in fiscal \u201819, so there is no -- that is not factored into the \u201818 guidance.","Gary Mobley","Got you. Okay. And Aart, this is somewhat topical just given that we\u2019ve seen or we had the RISC-V gathering \u2013 semiannual gathering this past week and so, curious to get your perspective on the impact of this open RISC-V processor IP as it relates to your ARC business and then as well does it drive a wave of, say for example, compiler EDA sales for you looking forward and is it a significant impact on that front as well?","Aart de Geus","Well, RISC-V is sort of in its beginnings, but it is also one processor among many being built right now. This is aimed, I think, at being more a general purpose processor and maybe of high interest to some parties. But many people are focusing right now on the development of AI-specific processors, and so from our perspective as EDA and IP provider, it\u2019s a little bit like the more the merrier, because we can support many people doing designs, and we expect many processes to be optimized specifically for the applications, because the hunger for more speed will be so high that just going to smaller geometries will not be sufficient, and therefore, people will say, \u201cHey, if I can build processors that are narrower and just aimed at some application and can make them faster,\u201d and we\u2019re seeing really a plethora of companies investing in them.","Gary Mobley","Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next on the line we have Rich Valera, Needham & Company. Please go ahead, sir.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Aart, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the business got stronger as the year went on, sounds like kind of maybe each quarter got stronger. I am wondering how much of that you would attribute to just general macro strength, just kind of global economy improving versus some underlying kind of secular trends going on in the -- that are affecting the EDA industry whether it\u2019s new areas as you mentioned all of the sort of smart areas, but do you think there are some things going on that are actually expanding the TAM of the traditional EDA market that are helping the business grow or do you mainly attribute it to just better macro?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think, the answer is yes, yes, yes, because there is no question that the overall global economy has done well, mostly because all regions are reasonably solid and so having those in unison tends to help things.","Secondly, there is no question that semiconductor has had a very, very strong year. And in all fairness, this is after a few years of not being particularly strong and so these things tend to go up and down but up feels better than down, no question about that.","And then, lastly, and I think that that is actually the factor that will matter most in the long-term is that, this move into this next wave of electronics enabling a very notion that was [indiscernible] in the \u201890s of artificial intelligence and outcomes under a set of other names, big data, machine learning, digital intelligence, I\u2019d like to call it Smart Everything, that will drive a very broad consumption of semiconductors, because the amounts of data generated by IoTs and various forms of sensors are growing by leaps and bounds, and just think of any camera as being really billions of pixels being generated.","Secondly, this data needs to be manipulated through machine learning, which is extremely compute in terms, and then the machine learning it in terms gets interpreted in the utilization, let\u2019s say inside of a car for example.","And then on top of that, you need to add one more aspect, which is security. And security, there is a very, very big component to that in the software part of our business, but it also will impact hardware as a variety of security modules will get added. So, I think, that semiconductor is at -- really at the heart of enabling a whole new wave of impact and therefore would stay reasonably healthy just on that basis only.","Rich Valera","Great. Thank you for that. And I have a couple of questions on Black Duck, can you say roughly what that was growing and if you think you can perhaps accelerate that growth rate, and also, Trac, I am not sure, if you\u2019re willing to share, how much revenue you expect to lose from the deferred revenue purchase accounting? Thanks.","Aart de Geus","Well, Trac, can comment on some of the financials normally, we don\u2019t give out specific growth rates on the acquisitions. And frankly, our first job is to always make sure that the company really lands well and that we can quickly look at what are the upsides for them with Synopsys or for Synopsys with them, that goes in both directions.","Having said that though, I think, what is exciting about Black Duck is that, they are really have grown up and have impact to the whole aspect of software refer to as Open Source. And one of the biggest productivity increases and this is true on chips with IP, I think, it is true on software by virtue of our use of software and Open Source software is, of course, the fact that you can use software for many sources and assemble it quickly.","There are quite a number of lurking dangers in that and there is a large catalogue of known vulnerabilities, and when people integrate this Open Source code material and they don\u2019t pay attention to at least the vulnerabilities that already known, I think that\u2019s closely delinquent when thinking about building secured software. And so it\u2019s just a natural for us as an extension of our focus on quality and security of software.","Trac Pham","Rich, the guidance for our revenue for Black Duck is about $55 million to $60 million for 2018 and then deferred haircut is about $25 million to $30 million. As for Aart described the market SIG, we\u2019re expecting -- Software Integrity we\u2019re expecting to grow in the 20% range and Black Duck is being doing very well -- as very well and then there -- the market demand and the secular trends in that space would drive growth similarly in that range.","Rich Valera","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you, gentlemen.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next on the line we have Farhan Ahmad, Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My question is on autos, you talked about the growing opportunity in autos, in particularly as it relates to ISO 26262 and your role in the IP there. So could you just talk about how much is the exposure that you have to the auto market and what is your opportunity in both EDA and IP?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s actually a quite difficult question, because we touch many, many companies that are in the automotive space and we ourselves find it a bit challenging to know exactly what is in the automotive part and what is in the regularly semiconductor deliveries.","Having said that though, the reason I like to highlight automotive is because it is such a poster child for what big changes are happening in an industry that traditionally was very slow in the adoption of any super advanced technology and so many semiconductor technology.","I highlighted specifically the fact that we had invested substantially in automotive certified IP in FinFET 16, because three years ago nobody in their right mind would have ever associated the word FinFET in automotive and today all of the big providers in that value chain are focusing on that, because they need more computation inside of the car.","And so the investments that we\u2019ve made are not only to provide the tools that are suited for designing and modeling what goes into a car, but as you mentioned that also fulfill the existing standards that initially were all built up really for safety and only now are gradually being evolved towards security and those are words that we can certainly deal with very well. So I think we\u2019re well-equipped to be a good provider in that value chain.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then the second question is on the Software Integrity side. I mean, once you integrate Black Duck, the total Software Integrity portion of the business will be larger than 10%. Do you think at some point you will start giving us disclosures separately for the Software Integrity business?","Trac Pham","Well, that\u2019s a very good question. That\u2019s something we will actively consider as we progress throughout the year. Our focus in the near-term clearly is to increase that business and make sure that we can drive the growth that we\u2019ve got planned for the year. But as we progress, we will look very closely at that amount of disclosure we want to provide balancing between keeping the information, avoiding competitive issues, as well as on the flipside making sure that investors get enough insights on the business to evaluate the opportunity.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And just one last question on the market share, you are growing significantly higher than some of your industry peers this year. Some of the strength obviously throughout the year, you\u2019ve talked about hardware has been a big portion of the growth, but when you look at your throughout the product portfolio on the core EDA and manufacturing, what are some of the areas that you\u2019re gaining market share in this year?","Aart de Geus","Well, I am always careful answering questions like that, because often the claims get out of hand quickly. We have extremely competent competitors like Cadence and Mentor, of course, are the largest ones. In some areas, Cadence has been growing a bit faster in digital design. We have been growing faster in verification. Things ebb and flow and go back and forth.","But in aggregate as an industry, we\u2019re quite competitive, because we have to constantly develop technology that\u2019s at the leading edge. And so, I think, I have nothing negative to say about any of the other companies, we are all striving to be a good providers in a market that right now is doing very well and so we\u2019ve had the benefits of making a number of investments over the years that are paying off particularly well right now.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next on the line we have Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Go ahead, sir.","Jackson Ader","Great. Thank you. Hey, guys. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. One question from our side, it looks like the time-based licenses had a pretty significant spike up and you mentioned the -- Trac, the $30 million in revenue from a hardware shipment that was pulled forward into the quarter. Does that explain -- I don\u2019t think that that would necessarily explain all the shifts in time-based licenses, so we\u2019re just trying to triangulate the two?","Trac Pham","Jackson, actually, it doesn\u2019t drive -- the hardware would not drive the time-based products. And keep in mind that we do look at that over time and it could vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on the nature of the contracts. Royalties can also fall into that that as well. So, there is really no issues within the core and that\u2019s not related to hardware at all.","Jackson Ader","Okay. So what was it then that drove the sequential increase?","Trac Pham","Overall, the business was very strong. I mean you look at the growth across the geographies, the crisscross different products, even to the cost the number of top customers we had very solid growth, so there\u2019s any number of things that can drive it. We did end the year on a very strong -- with very strong run rate growth so the business is very healthy.","Jackson Ader","Okay. And then one quick follow-up, the expected 2018 revenue that is expected to come from the backlog dipped down to 75%. Is that mostly because of Black Duck or is there something else we should be reading into?","Trac Pham","No. It\u2019s really a function of hardware, as hardware gets to be a larger part of our business, it changes that mix a little bit. Excluding hardware, we\u2019re running generally in the same percentage as we have historically. So there\u2019s no -- there\u2019s been no change to the business model with that regard.","Jackson Ader","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next on the line we have Jay Vleeschhouwer, Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Aart, with respect to the strengthening of the business over the course of the year, would you say that that was correlated more or less in real time to the positive inflection that we\u2019ve been seeing for the last three quarters or four quarters in semiconductor R&D spending, that\u2019s your principal source of revenue and it\u2019s clearly been trending higher for the industry over the last number of quarters and perhaps that\u2019s what you saw over the course of the year in real-time in terms of unscheduled business for software or IP as you -- or as you pointed out accelerated hardware or might there still be a lagging effect from semi-R&D that we have begin to see now more in 2018?","Aart de Geus","Well, a little bit everything you said is true, meaning that, there\u2019s no question that when your customers do really well, they are a little less hesitant in spending money and semiconductors have been doing extremely well and I expected right now to continue for a bit.","At the same time, the -- our solution in the verification space, the overall verification platform, which includes the emulation and the FPGA prototyping boards has done very, very well. And this is not completely a surprise, but somewhat difficult to predict in timing, because it follows what we have said, which is the center of gravity between hardware and software is going to increase in importance. With more complex software, people want to run the software before they have the hardware and therefore they model the hardware and that\u2019s the basis that we\u2019re in.","The third aspect I would mention is that, our IP business has been very strong and that is definitely partially the result of continued investment in the most advanced nodes, which is difficult IP to do. And as you probably know the advanced nodes keep rolling out at a rapid pace, because the providers are very competitive with each other.","And last but not least, the Software Integrity platform, so far I think is living up to our open expectations to be good pillar for the company that is on one hand completely adjacent to what we already do both in terms of technology and complexity and in many cases in embedded situations.","On the other hand, it\u2019s clearly a fresh TAM for us as we were talking to customers that in the past we would never have dreamed of interacting with. Jokingly, I sometimes say, we now have customers from Samsung to Starbucks, in fact is it\u2019s actually true and so that is a very big opportunity space.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","When you think about the Black Duck acquisition, can you talk about how you are thinking about integrating it in terms of technology with the other parts of the SIG portfolio and\/or perhaps your thoughts on integrating the software integrity portfolio in any case with let\u2019s say your hardware-based prototyping to expand your overall concept of verification, system verification and so forth?","Aart de Geus","This makes for a very long discussion, because we have -- we are now very, very rich in technologies in this domain. And this is a domain that has been extremely fractured in the past, and we\u2019re already starting to get I would say very strong positive feedback from the number of CIOs or people that are responsible for the security of software that being able to interact with a company that has longevity and some mass, gives them a better feeling of security that we\u2019re going to be around.","That\u2019s just another way of saying, there is a lot of work ahead and we are continually integrating capabilities. But it is after we really understand them well and so an integration is really a two-year to three-year process at many different levels.","Having said that, Black Duck resonates very well with many of our customers and they understand immediately that doing some automatic checks on software that comes in from variety of not always understood sources is a good defense mechanism that they need and so, I think, that we will be well-equipped together with them to drive this area forward.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right. Lastly, for Trac, with respect to the $30 million of accelerated hardware revenue into Q4, could you comment on the relative contribution from either ZeBu or HAPS in there, I mean, was it more one than the other. And then, similarly, it looks like you also had some quite good upside in the IP business, was that more from services than IP product?","Trac Pham","Okay. So let\u2019s start with the first one which is easy. We won\u2019t give more detail on the hardware. We\u2019ll leave it at hardware for now. But we continue -- for the year we actually did very well on both HAPS and emulation. So, as I said, it was very broadly -- the business was broadly strong. As far IP, it was with a combination of services and products.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Right. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next on the line we have Monika Garg with KeyBanc Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. First question is, if I take out the $40 million revenue of extra week and $55 million from Black Duck, it seems you are guiding to organic growth without those two components to about like 3% to 4%, in spite of the fact that you just talked 20% growth at your software security business. So, why such a low growth if I take out these extra two stuff in -- from 2018 guidance?","Trac Pham","Well, actually -- we actually did the full normalization taking into account the fact that we had $30 million that was planned for \u201818, that shifted to Q4. We do the math that you just did on Black Duck -- and Black Duck. We\u2019ve got mid single-digit growth on revenues and we are actually growing earnings per share on a high single-digit basis.","So I think as we continue to describe we\u2019re really running this business over a multiyear period. And in this particular quarter, you\u2019re getting a very high sense of that, because in one month you\u2019re seeing a very significant shift in revenues. And so, it\u2019s best to look at our business on a multiyear basis and if you go back and look at the charts for revenue growth and earnings growth, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job executing against that.","Monika Garg","All right. So if I look at the M&A on the software security side last three years, four years you have done, you\u2019ve spent almost $1.2 billion. Could you walk through how you look at the ROI from these investments, what are the free cash flow metrics you\u2019re looking to generate over the next three years, four years? Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Well, for starters, we always start to look at this via a multiyear perspective, because acquisitions like that, they take some time to integrate, they have haircuts, they have a number of complexities on the financial side that that need to be understood on a longer term perspective.","We have actually a fairly well-honed process of trying to understand the value of the acquisition based on the cash flow that comes out of it over many years. We don\u2019t disclose the exact metrics, but we have a fairly good discipline for that.","We review this for many years after the acquisition with our Board, always with some up and some down surprises, which is another word of saying, it\u2019s always difficult to exactly predict. But in aggregate, it has been part of how we continue to create value for the company and in that context Black Duck is not an exception.","Our own sense is that this is a particularly valuable acquisition, because of the strategic position it fills technically in the portfolio, but also because of the very acute value it can create by reducing the risk profile for customers. So, that is the process that we follow. Nothing is perfect and I am sure we can always do better, but we do have a long-term experience that has worked out pretty well for us.","Monika Garg","All right. Just last one on the software security side again, most of the customers are software security are still in financials industry software, so maybe talk more about your sales strategy especially given the Black Duck acquisitions. Would you need to ramp sales and marketing more or would you look to develop channel for this segment?","Aart de Geus","Well, this is an excellent question, because there are so many opportunities and your commentary is partially correct in that when we did the Cigital acquisition. Cigital was particularly focused on the financial sector. At the same time, my mentioning earlier of the automotive sector was interesting, because those people are just as interested in the issues of security and software as anything else.","The other areas that are also highly paranoid about what can happen medical is a good example and you\u2019ve seen some really horrific acts happening there. And so, I think, over time, no area, no verdict vertical is immune to the damages that can be done by essentially leaving the software doors wide open for hackers. And so this is going to become more and more a must do everywhere.","But clearly, the sectors that are most sensitive also the ones that have been most attacked. And the financial sector, it quickly goes to the bottomline, because the attack means trying to steal money and that brings a very rapid reaction.","So we are prudent in investing in verticals, because each vertical requires skills, it requires understanding the vocabularies and it requires understanding who to interact with. But I think our opportunity space will continue to grow and with is this part of our company broadening, we will put some more effort in understanding what are the best channels to do that, but so far I think we\u2019ve been executing reasonably well.","Monika Garg","Thank you so much.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And here comes our next question from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitch Steves","I just had two, one for Aart and one for Trac. So, sorry, I will start with Aart, from a high level perspective, I believe the Black Duck have talked publicly about kind of $5.6 billion TAM and you guys have talked about a $2.4 or so billion TAM in the original acquisition. So can you give us a broad update on that? And then, secondly, is this kind of the last transaction you need to get all the four capabilities in the top side of the business?","Aart de Geus","Well, let me go backwards. We continue, of course, to always look at opportunities, at the same time, it\u2019s also important to make sure that we executed well on the integration of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve done so far. And while we have a number of teams that are extremely skilled at this, every case is different and so they take some time. And what is also interesting is that as we bring new members to our team, they bring fresh perspective, I like to call it fresh DNA that allows us to shop and how we think about the field.","To be honest on your TAM question, I sort of read the same reports that most people do and I am equally skeptical if the number reflects any reality, because when you have a very rapidly developing market where there are many, many different, very fractured companies, that typically indicates that there\u2019s a high need and that the need is still not satisfied or still in development and those are actually all positive words, because that\u2019s just coming opportunity, but it also says that adding up whatever these companies have been able to do and then extrapolating this mostly spreadsheet effort.","And I don\u2019t want to be negative when people are trying to forecast it, because it is important, of course, but from our perspective, right now, the size of the TAM is the least of our issues. I think we have open space to run with and our challenge is how quickly can we execute on this, not are there more customers to call on, there are many more.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And it\u2019s actually for, Trac, the financial question so, a small one is the Coverity and Cigital piece combined still tracking to kind of that combined business excluding Black Duck being profit on the back half? And then, secondly, is there any sort of way to track the health of the business besides kind of the quarterly update calls we get from you guys?","Trac Pham","Yes. The numbers for that we had discussed for the Software Integrity business was tracking to both revenue and profitability for this year. And then as far as the getting more update on the Software Integrity business and progress there, I think, we\u2019ll start with the quarterly calls, that\u2019s a good start and then throughout this year, as I said earlier, we\u2019ll evaluate how best to provide more insights to the analysts, as well as our investors on that business.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you. Great quarter.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Operator","There are no additional questions in queue. Please go ahead.","Aart de Geus","So at this point in time, first a big thank you for having reported on us and supporting us during the year. Fiscal \u201817 turned out to be a very good year, not only from results point of view, but to most importantly from the perspective of preparing us for the next few years. And by now it already feels a little old and so we are fully proceeding on like on 2018 and hope to talk to you soon. As usual, we\u2019ll be available for individual calls in a few minutes.

And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode, and later, we will have a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release.","The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to report that our third quarter results were very strong, as we achieved revenue of $556 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.63 and $275 million in cash flow from operations. In addition, we closed several key acquisitions, as we continue to strengthen and evolve the company for long-term growth. As a result, we are again raising our annual revenue guidance.","Characterizing the customer environment around us, the semiconductor and systems industry results and outlook remain mixed. Customer growth rates appear more challenged than three months ago as some customers thrive while others struggle.","Consequently, consolidation continues, be it through asset purchases or full company combinations. While consolidations overall are somewhat of a headwind for EDA, our customers continue to invest heavily in designing highly advanced chips.","They seek long-term relationships with trusted suppliers to meet the very demanding time-to-market expectations of their customers. In addition, our expansion into the software quality and security space has broadened our long-term opportunity to grow well beyond traditional EDA. Thus, Synopsys, continues to be well-positioned as partner of choice for electronic design and software development.","Ranging from silicon to software, our multi-year strategy has three pillars. First, continue to build on our EDA leadership by providing state-of-the-art design and verification platforms with best-in-class support.","Second, offer high-impact productivity solutions such as outsourced IP and extremely fast hardware\/software prototyping, enabling customers to beat their relentless time-to-market constraints.","And third, invest in and grow our software quality and security solutions. Software complexity is escalating in both electronic systems and in the broader application space, and security vulnerabilities are visibly creating ever-greater challenges.","Let me provide some product and customer highlights that demonstrate our progress. Throughout our entire history, Synopsys has endeavored to be the technology leader in the highest impact areas of EDA. The investments we\u2019ve made both internally and through acquisitions continue to bear fruit in terms of, new game-changing products, clear leadership in advanced node enablement, amazing customer design successes and the resulting customer wins. While I\u2019m sure it\u2019s difficult for you to sort through the many claims of leadership in advanced designs, we are confident in our position and momentum.","Let me provide some color and data points. The number of FinFET designs continues to grow rapidly, as leading-edge companies race to take advantage of significant power efficiencies.","The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date continues to grow quickly now reaching almost 240. Synopsys is relied on for 95% of these. Technology differentiation matters, and customers and partners count on us.","For example, in June, we announced Intel Custom Foundry certification for Synopsys design tools for 14-nanometer FinFET production. During the quarter, we achieved certification from multiple standards organizations for our IP portfolio for TSMC 16-nanometer FinFET-Plus and in June, we announced an expanded collaboration with UMC on embedded memory and test solutions for their 14-nanometer FinFET process.","In physical design, our game-changing new product, IC Compiler II, continues to gain traction with rapidly growing adoption. Customers are seeing 10X improvement in throughput and are using IC Compiler II in designs throughout the process spectrum.","During Design Automation Conference in June, AMD, ARM, MediaTek, SocioNext and Samsung spoke to a standing-room-only crowd about their successes and deployment plans for IC Compiler II. TSMC signed off on IC Compiler II certification for their latest 16 nanometer FinFET Plus process.","Demand is very strong and broad-based, as evidenced by the fastest ramp-up in bookings for any product in our history. As customers move rapidly from IC Compiler I to IC Compiler II, so does our support. We have transitioned a majority of our dedicated application engineers to IC Compiler II, a further indication of its momentum. We are already serving 38 different customer logos with well over 100 production designs and tape-outs, a significant increase over last quarter.","Now to verification, where requirements have exploded as designs have become much, much more complex. Here, too, our Verification Continuum platform is truly a next-generation solution with both breadth and depth of technology. Approximately 80% of advanced designs already use Synopsys as the primary simulator and over the past year, we have steadily introduced many enhancements and a whole different level of integration throughout the platform.","Propelled by multi-year collaborations with some of the hardest-driving semiconductor companies in the world, our Verification Continuum now integrates all the critical software and hardware verification tools onto a common infrastructure. As a result, Q3 was another strong quarter for verification, particularly in emulation, where growing demand is benefitting the entire EDA industry.","At the Design Automation Conference, Altera, ARM, Cavium, AMD and Freescale spoke at a customer luncheon about their verification challenges and how Synopsys is helping them achieve success. On the analog\/mixed-signal side, a technically challenging area, we introduced significant advances in our CustomSim product, which delivers a 2X speed-up.","Finally, earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Atrenta, a recognized leader in static and formal verification. Its SpyGlass product is an anchor technology in the industry that effectively addresses verification and power challenges early in the design cycle.","The Atrenta technologies further enhanced both our Verification Continuum platform and our implementation solution. While we\u2019re in the early stages of integration, customer and employee reactions have been very positive.","Let me now move to IP, where our optimized solutions for the Automotive and Internet-of-Things market segments continue to strengthen. About six months ago, we launched a major initiative to robustly address the automotive space by augmenting our product portfolio to include automotive-grade IP.","In June, we rolled-out a broad set of IP optimized for automotive chip development. The portfolio now meets key safety, reliability and quality requirements while continually being enhanced to address new emerging standards. We have also worked with industry leaders such as Freescale, Infineon and Renesas to create Automotive Centers of Excellence with our virtual prototyping products, enabling our mutual customers to accelerate software development.","Clearly, semiconductor content in automotive systems will grow significantly over the next five to six years. With this offering, we are expanding our influence in this","important vertical market segment.","For the Internet of Things, the ability to connect multiple smart devices to the cloud and to each other is fueling great application innovation, ranging from wearable devices to machine-to-machine markets. Synopsys provides a comprehensive portfolio of IoT-ready IP, ranging from interfaces, to memory and logic, to power-efficient processors, to pre-validated subsystems.","During the quarter, we announced a collaboration with TSMC to develop an integrated IoT platform for TSMC\u2019s 40 nanometer ultra-low-power process. We also acquired Bluetooth Smart IP from Silicon Vision, for key low-power smart home, portable health, and industrial applications that require on-chip wireless integration.","Lastly, and second only to connectivity, security of these devices is paramount. Through the acquisition of Elliptic Technologies, we added proven security IP solutions for identification, authentication, data encryption and content protection, which brings me naturally to our Software Quality and Security products. While security in the cyber world has been an issue for years, the combination of increasing connectivity and highly publicized breaches, including recently in the automotive domain, are spurring an intense security focus on the entire electronics and software applications space.","Our entry into Software Quality and Security comes at just the right time and Q3 was significant for our promising business unit. As a refresher, last year\u2019s Coverity acquisition expanded both our total available market and our customer base. It\u2019s a compelling combination of technical, customer and channel adjacency to our existing business as well as a significant TAM broadening into a new, higher-growth space that truly differentiates us as a company and investment.","During the quarter, we bolstered our security presence significantly with two acquisitions that are already showing great promise. The first is cyber security company, Codenomicon, a leader in the area of dynamic security analysis, and well-known for independently discovering the infamous Heartbleed bug.","We also acquired key assets from Quotium, specifically, the well-regarded Seeker product, a leader in application security testing. While we're in the early stages of building and scaling our presence in this space, we're already making a notable impact. Evident earlier in the month at the Black Hat security conference, a conference renowned for its hacker, and security company attendees.","For example, at a standing-room-only Synopsys event that featured speakers from Underwriter's Laboratories and the Department of Homeland Security, UL spoke about its developing Cybersecurity Assurance Program and the collaboration with Synopsys to drive it forward.","It\u2019s designed to help companies manage security risks via a certification process, similar to what they have been doing for years for electrical hardware devices. UL's program, which is still under development, is expected to provide a baseline for Cybersecurity Assurance. Initially focused on medical devices, industrial control systems, and networking and telecom equipment, it would utilize technology from a number of key suppliers, including Synopsys.","Finally, reflecting the growing brand recognition in this space, we were named by Gartner as a visionary in their application Security Testing\u2019s Magic Quadrant. This is a big deal. Out of hundreds of companies in the Application Security Testing space, only 19 are identified in this market-making group. Stay tuned as we evolve our software quality and security strategy in the coming months and quarters.","In summary, we delivered strong Q3 results and expect to exit the year with approximately 10% non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Our new products are driving excellent customer design successes and adoption momentum. And, lastly, we closed several key acquisitions, strengthening our technology and evolving Synopsys towards promising higher-growth market segments.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. As you heard from Aart, we're seeing good momentum in the business. Our internal investments and key acquisitions are paying off in terms of broadening our portfolio with new technology and expanding our TAM with new growth opportunities.","Our results reflect a business that is not only strong today, but also well positioned for future opportunities. Our excellent Q3 performance and Q4 outlook solidify another year of increased growth and profitability. In fact, we're raising our annual revenue outlook again, reflecting the strength of our business. We continue to execute very well, and we are committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q3 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 6.5% to $556 million. Greater than 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%.","The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.5 years, and we expect duration for the full year to be about 2.7 years. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $494 million and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $432 million, at the lower end of our target range.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 22.4% for the quarter and 24.2% for the first three quarters of 2015. Because of the technical complexity inherent in our customers' design processes, it's critical that we prioritize leading edge product development. Nonetheless, we continue to drive global operational efficiency in order to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range.","GAAP earnings per share were $0.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.63.","Turning to cash flow, we generated $275 million of operating cash flows for the quarter. We are reiterating our full year target of approximately $450 million.","Cash flows to date have been strong and we are able to offset the net outflows related to acquisitions. We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion with 31% onshore and total debt of $213 million. We have since funded the Atrenta acquisition from that U.S. cash, so would expect it to be lower at the end of Q4.","Over the years we have utilized our balance sheet very effectively for both stock repurchases and M&A. Since 2010, we have repurchased more than $1.1 billion of Synopsys stock. We have simultaneously made a number of important acquisitions to enter new higher growth areas, most recently software quality and security, and prioritized P&L investments to expand our technology leadership. We believe this ongoing strategy will create significant value for our shareholders.","We closed several acquisitions in Q3, as well as Atrenta earlier this month. In addition, we completed the $180 million accelerated share repurchase plan initiated in Q1, in which we bought back a total of 4 million shares. For the trailing four quarters we've spent $220 million buying back more than 5 million shares, and have $200 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Finally, DSO was 50 days, and we ended Q3 with approximately 9,835 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies.","Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the fourth quarter, our targets are revenue between $570 million and $585 million, a wider range than we have provided in the past, to reflect increased variability due to lumpiness of hardware and consulting revenue; total GAAP costs and expenses between $503 million and $521 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $450 million and $460 million; other income between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.31 to $0.38 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.65 to $0.67 per share.","For fiscal 2015, revenue of $2.225 billion to $2.240 billion, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%; other income between $10 million and $12 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $1.43 to $1.50 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $87 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.78 per share, which reflects the slight dilution from our recent acquisitions, largely offset by operational overachievement; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.","While we continue to expect a revenue model that is approximately 90% time-based, going forward we will expand our quarterly guidance ranges to better reflect the variability inherent in hardware deals, for which revenue is recognized upfront, along with the timing of consulting projects.","In summary, we're seeing good momentum in the business. Our internal investments and key acquisitions are paying off, with game-changing new technology and a brand new TAM. We continue to deliver strong results and are well-positioned for future opportunities. And our excellent Q3 performance and Q4 outlook solidify another year of strong cash flow and increased growth and profitability.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Valera with Needham. Please go ahead.","Krysten Sciacca","Hi. This is Krysten Sciacca in for Needham. I don\u2019t know sorry in for Rich Valera. So I am looking at your fiscal 2015 guidance and I just want to know, is the increase in revenues only due to the inclusion of Atrenta or is there some other driving force there?","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, most of that is not due to Atrenta, that is continuation of the execution of the overall company engine so to speak. Atrenta, of course, adds a little bit to it by virtue of having joined us this quarter, but most of it is just continuation of the path that Synopsys has been on.","Krysten Sciacca","Okay. Great. Thank you. And then how is hardware this quarter?","Aart de Geus","We had a very good hardware quarter and so you will see that reflected in both the upfront revenue line as well our COGS expenses.","Krysten Sciacca","Great. Thanks very much.","Aart de Geus","You are welcome.","Operator","We have question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi. I had a few questions actually. First one is, Aart, when I look at your IP system software integrity revenue, it seems like it is down sequentially about 10%. What is going on there that Coverity should be growing at this point, right?","Aart de Geus","Well, those businesses combined have actually a very high degree of fluctuation from a one quarter to another because they are quite lumpy in how we recognize revenue. And this is largely due because many of the large IP deals have a variety of milestones attached to them or even some services. And so that is why these numbers have continued to be up and down. On a trailing 12-month basis, the numbers are actually very good.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And then in the past you guys mentioned how you should be breakeven in Coverity this year and you know accretive next year, but looks like you\u2019re doing some investments. So at what point, will Coverity become accretive to the broader company?","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, we look at it being slightly accretive in '16. The addition of acquisitions may change that as they always do, but fundamentally read that as we continue to invest in the business that we see a very good future for.","Krish Sankar","But at some point next year, you\u2019re saying Coverity would be accretive?","Aart de Geus","Yes. This would be as the -- the Coverity that we acquired, by now we\u2019ve already added I think four different acquisitions. And so this is a very rapidly evolving business unit for us. And so from a philosophy point of view, the way to think about it is that as we add acquisitions, we aim to within I would say 12 to 18 months make them accretive, or if they are technology acquisitions, they get integrated very, very fast into the existing product. And objective obviously is to build a profitable business, but the other objective is to also create a strong footprint in an area that we expect to grow in the future.","Trac Pham","Krish, this is Trac. I think you're referencing what we had originally guided when we bought Coverity in general. As we look at '16, we're looking at that business to be more than $100 billion and accretive, '16.","Krish Sankar","Got it.","Trac Pham","And as you think about the acquisitions that we made in the recent quarter, as you saw in the earnings guidance we have tweaked our earnings guidance to reflect the slight dilution from those deals and we do expect them to be slightly diluted in 2016 as well.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And then if I could ask a big picture question. If you look at the EDA industry, everyone says it could grow at like 5%, 6% topline growth, but looks like next year 10 nanometers have been pushed out from 2016 to 2017. So my question is that with that backdrop, do you still think EDA industry can grow 6% or so, and what is it means specifically to Synopsys given 10 nanometers from some of the biggest customers are getting pushed out?","Aart de Geus","Well, let me take it still in reverse order. Yes, of course, we understand that some deliveries on technology have been slowed down or just feathered in, but that doesn\u2019t mean at all that the work for us has diminished around 10 nanometers, because a lot of people are essentially looking as when do they ship product and that is really the more relevant data from a macro perspective for the semiconductor industry.","But for EDA, the work starts long, long before that. And as a matter of fact, we have a significant amount of work right now already on 7-nanometer to make the technologies, the tools, the IP ready.","So if you look at it as a macro picture, I did guide a bit in my preamble to the fact that the overall semiconductor industry is quite turbulent right now. And if you look at the expectations for this year and for next year in terms of growth rate of the industry, they have gone down somewhat. But it is also true that within these ups and downs of the semiconductor industry, historically EDA has fared quite well, because not only do we attach the more stable R&D efforts, we also are very much the investments that let people come back out of the troughs within a year or two. And so therefore, a high degree of stability.","Last but not least within that, I think Synopsys has done particularly well, because we are -- I hope viewed as a trusted partner and the company that you can count on and we continue to invest quite aggressively in technology to make sure that we\u2019re there tomorrow as well.","Krish Sankar","Got it. And if I can just squeeze one last question. In the last several quarters of for like few years, your R&D as a percentage of sales has been somewhere in the 30% to low 30% range. Is there any chance for that, even if Moore\u2019s Law does slowdown and I understand you still have to do a lot of design work? Is there an opportunity for that R&D as a percentage of sales to come down or you think 30 is the bogey?","Aart de Geus","I honestly think that that is about the bogey and for the simple reason that we\u2019re seeing nothing that says that technology is getting somewhere. In many ways, it\u2019s the opposite. And the reason people go there is because the value is extremely high if you could deliver chips that had even less power utilization with even more computational speed, because in the coming years it will open up a whole new domain of smart devices that literally applies to everything.","Now that complexity comes from at a minimum two sources. One is the advanced silicon technologies that just demand much more sophisticated modeling, and we are well on top of that. And secondly is that very sophisticated silicon is what enabling a lot of these super sophisticated software and the intersection of those two were also well on top of that.","And so, I think, that we are in the right place, while we see an industry that is morphing and changing around us and this happens continually in this industry and has been one of the reasons for its tremendous impact.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Thanks, Aart. Thanks Trac.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to go back to the Atrenta question for a minute. I thought 2014 they were doing something in kind of 55 million range, what did you guys loose for acquisition accounting, it seem like you should get some material revenue for the back half -- even for the one quarter and then moving into 2016?","Trac Pham","Hi, Sterling. This is Trac. Yeah. The acquisitions have a very small impact on our results for this year. If you think about just the size of the deals in general, the timing of when they're closed and you factor in the deferred haircut, the guidance that we gave is, there is very little impact from revenues.","We did tweak the earnings guidance at the midpoint by about penny or $0.02 to reflect a dilution. But overall most of it is in the -- most it is organic business. We -- when we think about the deferred haircut. It can range anywhere from 50% to 80% depending on particular deal.","Sterling Auty","Right. So can you give some guidelines in terms of where you at the upper end of that range on these acquisitions in terms of what the write-down was and perhaps, you can remind people what the business model at Atrenta was in terms of what have been in deferred revenue that perhaps were lost?","Trac Pham","So we don\u2019t disclose the specifics of each individual deal. But, again, where we are operationally, we are still working through the contracts to get evaluation analysis of that and to determine the deferred haircut.","Aart de Geus","But fundamentally, their business model is ratable model or just like ours and so in many ways they had a very similar philosophy both financially and technically, and I think the fit is actually going to be remarkably good.","Sterling Auty","And then looking at the sales and marketing expenses in the quarter, it seems to come in light relative to the street models and our model as well. Any insight into why the sales and marketing expenses were -- what looks to be as much as [$4 million, $4.3 million] [ph] spike?","Trac Pham","Sterling, the difference between where we came in versus the model is really just a function of how you model it. As far as internally that that the sale and marketing line can vary from quarter-to-quarter depending on conditions expense it could vary by customer events or tradeshows. So it does vary quarter-to-quarter.","Sterling Auty","And there is one\u2026","Trac Pham","But there is no issue there. It\u2019s a reflection of the underlying health of the business that\u2019s what you are try to get out the run rates for the quarter and year-to-date were actually very healthy and up.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then, one last high level question, Aart, you kind of talk about the headwinds in the near-term is going to help semiconductors and just the M&A environment? I am particularly interested in terms of some of the consolidations that have happened? Is there a sense over what timeframe you might yield some of impacts of those consolidations and I do agree that I think ultimately will end up with healthier customer. So maybe it\u2019s even better for your long-term? But are we going to go into a six-month, 12-month, 18-month period, where perhaps as you go through contract renewals, you have a little bit of headwind? [Technical Difficulty] could you quantify or give qualitative commentary would be helpful?","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well, in general the reason one looks at consolidation as a bit of headwind for an industry is because none of the consolidators ever says, well, not that consolidated, let me spend more money with you.","They do regroup however and often reassess what is the wisest way to spend their money and in a number of cases this has been actually very positive for us, because we're not only a safe haven in times of turbulence, but also by virtue of driving technology very hard, if this is an advanced user of this there is opportunity sometimes to align better with us making them successful.","So the timeline that you are highlighting around consolidation is correct. It takes typically a number of months for the companies to figure out what they want to do. Many of the EDA companies have multiyear contracts. They can shift based on mutual agreements but there is some stability in all of this.","So I don't want to over dramatize any of this. I think this is part of the industry that is evolving and we are visibly so, there are non-industry-related pressure points by virtue of what we see in the overall markets, in the stock market and some of the currency changes.","And this all comes to their at the very moment that there is also big technology change and as a company, Synopsys, we've been through this many times in our history, and I think, we know what to do, but it is also true that the better we execute here, the better we will do.","Sterling Auty","All right. If I may, just want to squeeze one more in, we watched the technology leapfrog one another between yourselves and Cadence for many, many years, in terms of the industry. I think, Cadence has been very upfront in terms of they believe that they have been gaining share on the software. Aart, you not have that conversation, in terms of percentage of valet. So what I am particularly interested in is IC Compiler II, have you hit that inflection point and do you think we're about to go through a leapfrog back the other way?","Aart de Geus","Well, for starters, let me respectfully disagree with your notion that we\u2019ve seen leapfrogging between our companies. I think that I would humbly submit that for majority of the products for our entire history, Synopsys has been the state-of-the-art and that is not to degenerate anybody else\u2019s products because all of these products are hypersophisticated and at times can get very good results for specific customer situation.","I think said that, it\u2019s a very nature of both companies or all the EDA companies being actually very strong, that has propelled technology forward and is one of the key drivers behind the success of Moore\u2019s Law. And so I expect that race to continue. Specifically, an IC Compiler II, we are getting now very systemically, very strong results. And the challenge that we face is the great opportunity, it\u2019s not the challenge approving that we have strong technology. It is to now help migrate our customers to the next generation.","And we sort of reported to you a number of the chips being done but underneath this, there is actually much more activity in the number of chip blocks that are being migrated with Synopsys actually quite substantial. And so while there is a lot of hard work that\u2019s left to be done, I highlighted the fact that most of our support engineers now are already on IC Compiler II. And we consider that situations where the customer has sort of voted for the long term.","Sterling Auty","Great. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.","Operator","We have a question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yeah. Good afternoon. One more question on the consolidation front. Historically, have you seen the biggest impact in EDA based on the number of engineers or seats that have gone away or is it just the customers get better pricing because of volume discounting?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s an excellent question. I think as far as I can tell, engineers don\u2019t go away. And what happens is that in consolidations, the company that buys other company the minute it closes by nature has to push on efficiency for starters to try to repay or recoup the premium that they paid. And so it\u2019s really an efficiency mechanism in an industry.","Now that efficiency can also manifest itself on the technology side where company say well you know we now have more critical mass in an area or we vertically integrate and we can have a more technical differentiation. And so as an earlier question highlighted, the opportunity space tends to grow after some period of time because the resulting companies are actually in most cases truly healthier and are aimed at the next decade of success.","And so for us, it is be responsive to the customers as they are often in a financial time of need situation but at the same time keep an eye on making sure that we\u2019re in the game for the long term. And most importantly that we deliver something for the customers that truly increases their value and their differentiation going forward.","Tom Diffely","Did they just view that as an inflection points whether there is some share shifting that goes on as well?","Aart de Geus","I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t understand the question.","Tom Diffely","When you look at consolidations, do you look at it as an opportunity for maybe some share shifting going on?","Aart de Geus","Yeah. Absolutely. Sorry. Yeah, of course, there is always share adjustments in various ways. And historically, we have been blessed with having been chosen while often than not in a number of categories to become the lead provider. We hope that will be the case again but that is the discussion of the customer and our job is to make ourselves as attractive as possible to them.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then when you look at kind of midpoint of your fourth quarter guidance, the margins are little bit lower, previous expectations had them. I wonder if the biggest impact there is just increased cost structure from the acquisitions or is it the larger percentage of hardware in the business in the fourth quarter?","Trac Pham","It\u2019s a combination. This is Trac, Tom. It\u2019s a combination of few things, one is just the continued hiring in our business to the head count for the acquisitions and also traditionally Q4 is our historically the highest expensed quarter.","Tom Diffely","Okay. All right. And finally you mentioned emulation in your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're doing well there. We are hearing that there is some pricing pressure in emulation these days. And just kind of curious what your view of the industry is right now and what your longer-term industry growth view is for emulation?","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well, I think emulation is interesting field because it has a natural growth just by virtue of the complexity of the circuits having grown immensely but also because the intersection of hardware and software demands just very fast, stimulation of various forms of application. And so in that context, I think that we've seen good growth in all of the EDA companies that provide these technologies.","Now, when you use the word pricing pressure, you could have used it for last 30 years on any product in our field. The race is always on and so that the pricing pressure is mostly mitigated by saying well therefore, we have to develop better products that are more differentiated than that sort of manages the economic equation. So frankly nothing new under the sun and it applies to any field, be it hardware or software.","Tom Diffely","Okay. You\u2019ve not seen any degradation of that market based on your litigation with Mentor Graphics?","Aart de Geus","No, none so far.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yeah. Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, I would like to ask first about the business impact of the two new markets that you highlighted as opportunities for you, namely automatic and IoT. And the question is two-fold. First, what do you think the relative benefit to your tools, IT and software integrity businesses might be from either of both of automotive and IoT? Do you think it would be mostly a tools play for you, an IT play or software integrity play?","And similarly, how do you think one or both of these markets as they develop for you might change the services intensity or services profile of the company? When you look at your counterparts in engineering software for example that serve the automotive market, those engagements are often very services intensive. We know that Mentor\u2019s won some nice deals in automotive that are largely services oriented thus far. So if you or as you develop in automotive yourself and in IoT, you think there is going to be a significant ratcheting up of the kind of services you are going to have to provide and invest in?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Let me try to answer Part A, B, C and D of your question here. Maybe going backwards which is for starters. Overall initially these areas, the two focuses is bigger than either services or the software integrity just by virtue of -- these are markets that we have already interacted with quite a bit, only not necessarily in a vertical fashion. And so if we take automotive as an example, automotive has the characteristic that relatively speaking, they are not a super big EDA market but they are sophisticated EDA market not because they drive the state-of-the-art or FinFET for example, but because they have a stringent requirements, first and foremost for safety and then for reliability.","When you think that that many of these products have to be in tiptop shape for 30 years, you can imagine that that\u2019s not a trivial task. And so increasingly with the growth of smarts in the cars, I can collect it that and therefore the increase of electronic content. One can see that therefore the attention on this type of conditions has to be higher. And so what we're doing in our tools and you heard in preamble in the IP, we are essentially making it conformant with the automotive standards that apply to the type of areas we touch, which are chip design and other companies may have other aspects.","I cannot say that we see a lot of services there at the present time. But it\u2019s good you mentioned, we will think about it a bit more. On the IoT side of things, the IoT, unfortunately is a little bit of catch-on for the entire industry and Internet of Things, whatever the things are can lead to many different ways. I sometimes like to call it immensely optimized mystic thinking. And that is because right now many of the actual IoT parts are very low cost sensors connected to some data processing, quickly connecting it into the web where the monies made on the application.","On the other hand, I do want to take my little optimistic thinking also in a positive direction, which is I think over time, this is really the root of where smarts will come about, because if all of these IoT devices can have a bit more computational capabilities at low power, over time one will see that they will have to work some degree of artificial intelligence, sounds like a big word. But adding smarts to many devices, which brings me to the software integrity aside because the other way to think about IoT and by the way in many ways cars as well, this is the intersection of hardware and software.","And when you know that there are in advance cars, there is about a hundred million lines of code, as a minimum some shivers need to go down your spine because as you probably have read recently that code too has been hacked by now. And so aside of the traditional, safety and reliability constraints for automotive now security will be on par. And that is where of course our software integrity group will have impact. And the same is too for IoT.","IoT are really hardware, software intersections where they touch the real world and then they create in many cases a lot of data and maybe some reasoning around it. And all of that has software quality and software security issues. So that is how these all ties together for us. It\u2019s early from a business size point of view but it\u2019s certainly very promising.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thanks. And secondly, you said language to describe the guidance was certainly different. You talked about in future having a wider range of revenues, having to do with the variability of IT and hardware. Now those have been variable all along in anyway as we\u2019ve seen and your hardware business to date has sometimes had a good quarter but it's not on the whole have been a particularly large business for you. Has something changed, however, in terms of either market conditions or your competitiveness or both suggesting that over time your emulation business, particularly could be materially larger than it\u2019s been to date and hence the wider range of revenue outcomes?","Aart de Geus","So the reason why we increased the revenue guidance range is in fact driven by both, hardware and IP. On the hardware side as you\u2019ve seen year-to-date, we\u2019ve been doing very well progressively with hardware and that includes both, rapid prototyping and emulation. So, as that business continues to grow and becomes a more material part of our business, we would expect it to be more variable from quarter-to-quarter.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","All right. Lastly, as everyone knows from the last six quarters or so, you focused on ICC II of course and that's going to continue to be a major product event for you. The question is now that that\u2019s undelayable or stipulated or continue to be adopted of course, what\u2019s next on the tool side do you think as a next major driver to the business? If you set aside IT and the new software business, what else in let's say core EDA might also become a next good incremental way for you, not necessarily as large as implementation, but it might it be simulation or something else in verification? What do you think is next in terms of an incremental driver besides ICC II?","Aart de Geus","Well, we actually do think that the other big investment that is now turning to seeing growth and return is actually the Verification Continuum. And the Verification Continuum is coming back because on one hand, it\u2019s many different tools that do get sold individually. But really the value that we are providing here is increasingly inability to use these tools with each other in a fashion that let them be adoptive -- adapted, sorry, adapted much better to the problem that people like to solve.","And so in order to get there took quite a bit of effort, multiple of years extremely sophisticated programming. And in technical terms that means a common compilation platform meaning the description is understood in the same fraction. It also means a common debugging platform meaning that you can see and interpret and analyze your results in a user-friendly fashion.","Those were very big investments. And they are now starting to bear fruit. At the very moment that another angle has started to increase in importance, which is this intersection between hardware and software. Are you there finding the hardware in the context of the software or you finding the software in the context of the hardware, or are you really verifying both simultaneously in order to get to market as fast as possible?","And whichever is the long pool in the tent, you try to eliminate that one. And so that means that the spread that what one verifies is quite broad. Another area that we will see, we expect some good growth in the future is actually the custom area and this is an area that we have invested in for quite a while. We have a number of very new capabilities that we will be talking more about in the coming quarters. But these are all investments that invariably take many years and then when they rollout, the rollout itself is a major enterprise and that\u2019s what we are doing in verification right now.","Operator","We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Well, hi. Thanks for taking my question. So, Aart, in the [indiscernible], you were talking about like a 20% growth rate for that segment. Are you still seeing similar growth rates in that?","Aart de Geus","Yes. We\u2019ve not changed our perspective on the opportunity space. Of course, since then the good news is I think we've learned a lot, including the fact that it's a space that is extremely fragmented with many loud voices and some that actually have impact on customers. And the fact that we have been able to close what we think are some very, very good acquisitions that have strengthened and broadened our position is a sign that we are, I think gaining confidence.","No market is simple or easy, but I think it\u2019s rarely visible to most people that software has reached a stage where it needs the next level of -- I will use the word discipline and therefore the tools to enforce that. And by the time you throw the security in it, now you really have to start paying very systematic attention. And our objective is to provide the toolset that allows people to do that.","Monika Garg","Thanks. Then question on the Atrenta, maybe you can help us understand how to think about the impact on growth and margins from Atrenta\u2019s acquisition next year?","Aart de Geus","Well, normally we don\u2019t breakout individual acquisitions of that size in terms of impact. Obviously, it will add revenue and as the haircut as you know, gradually goes away, it becomes rapidly less and less dilutive. It will be slightly dilutive in \u201916.","But the reason always hesitant, frankly, to speak about that in those terms is, and the first think we do is to try to integrate tools into something bigger and better. And so, by the end of next year, I don't think that the Atrenta as we knew it quite exist. We have something better and that's actually mostly in the Verification Continuum.","And so, we think it's actually fabulous technical acquisition and the customer loyalty and utilization has been very good and so this will also help us with a number of key customers as we look at the overall solution.","Trac Pham","I\u2019d add, even though, we stated earlier that collectively the acquisitions will be dilutive for next year. Our goal is still to drive EPS growth in the high-single digits.","Monika Garg","Got it. Then last one for me. We have seen massive share buyback by one of your peers. Now you guys have a strong net cash position, generated lot of cash then why not accelerate the buyback?","Trac Pham","So, Monika, we think that the combination of buybacks and acquisitions definitely create a lot of value. We -- this particular quarter we happen to emphasize M&A, but overall early this year we did complete the -- we did announce the $180 million of ASR. And when you look back since 2010 to now, we\u2019ve bought back more than $1.1 billion of stocks, so we are very committed to that.","Monika Garg","Got it. Thank you so much.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome, Monika.","Operator","At this time we have time for one more question. It will come from line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Yes. Thank you very much, Aart. Just sure if you can if you can talk a little bit about your strategy on the software security and quality market, you have been pretty active on that in terms of acquisitions? Are we going to see your growth strategy more focused on organic growth or you\u2019re going to be more aggressive on the acquisition side for this market?","Aart de Geus","Both an easy answer, yes. Meaning that the good news is we have a very, very good R&D team here. And it\u2019s quite remarkable how for the technology depth point of view and for many of the concept around calculation, understanding of languages, interpreting things, they are just as deep as the deepest people here at Synopsys and they have lot of similarity.","At the same time, it is also very clear that if we invest in certain areas to broaden the impact they have. For example, with adding some more languages which we are doing, it immediately broadens the potential time of the solutions that we have.","Having said that, the reason we invested in the security domain is because that\u2019s too is the domain of specialists. And specialist at times can be a two edge sword because they are sometime specialist that are very narrow problems, where it\u2019s very important to solve them, but it is very difficult to actually make a business off.","And therefore, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I said that there are many essentially service companies in that space that\u2019s new -- if not a great job at least adequate job based on what is understood today.","Our aim is slightly different. Our aim is to acquire or invest in areas where the problem is systematically growing and where we can offer much more of a platform solution, rather than either a service solution or some very low cost tools. And thus build the business not just similar to what EDA was in the early days for chip design, but now or for IP as a matter of fact, but now do the same in this domain, that is in our opinion still very much emerging.","And so the acquisitions happen to be cornerstone pieces with very, very talented and experienced people, but that we\u2019re relatively small versus the opportunity space. And having the Synopsys machine and in some ways also the brand behind this gives an opportunity for these technologies to be leveraged much more. So I guess I sort of answered your question by not answering it, because we're doing really both.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And one more follow-up on the question Krish asked about the Intel talking about extending the development of the product and you answered. But I just want to simplify that a little bit and see if I understand that clearly. Is it fair to say that even if the technology rollout changes from two years to three years, is that the complexity has increased so much that the rate of consumption of EDA doesn't changes? Is that the right way to look at it?","Aart de Geus","That is exactly the right way to look at, because the way to look at it is, EDA and that includes all EDA companies, we\u2019re running as fast as we can at this point in time. And by the way I think the semiconductor, the manufacturing guys on technology, they\u2019re running as fast as they can and the users are adopting as fast as they can and as fast as is economically reasonable.","And so the reason I make a distinction with the users is because economically reasonable is determined by one more variable, which is ultimately the production yield. And so of course, the manufacturers are trying to drive the yield up like crazy. We are trying to make the designs as yield friendly as possible, and the ultimate volume adoption is a function of that.","But there is no question that, there is no change whatsoever in the speed of drive of the semiconductor industry, it\u2019s at max, it has always been at max and I think that will continue.","Mahesh Sanganeria","All right. Thank you very much.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","At this time, I\u2019ll turn the call back for closing comments.","Aart de Geus","Well, I guess that brings us to the turn of the hour. Thank you very much for a very interesting set of questions. And I hope that you have an impression of Synopsys that captures both the momentum and the opportunity space going forward. And we will be available for further questions in one-on-ones as usual. Thank you so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. And 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Rochelle. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I am happy to report that in Q1, our business, technology progress and customer engagements were strong across the board. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, achieving revenue of $475 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.67. As a result of this excellent start to the year, as well as reinstatements of the federal R&D tax credit, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2013 to a range of $2.35 to $2.40, up solidly from our high single-digit guidance into double-digit growth.","Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. Before discussing some highlights, let me briefly comment on the customer landscape, which fundamentally has not changed much from last quarter but benefits from a slightly more stable macroeconomic outlook.","Against this backdrop, we see the semiconductor industry continuing a very aggressive push, both in terms of technology and efficiency. The technology drive is motivated by companies seeking to differentiate themselves by adopting a wave of emerging new semiconductor capabilities. The efficiency push addresses the challenge of delivering these new technologies under aggressive product cycle and cost requirements. The EDA industry, and Synopsys in particular, is a key partner in these quests.","Increasingly, customers see their EDA relationship as an essential differentiator in their market battles. Although difficult to generalize in our very competitive landscape, we do sense a bit of improvement in the pricing environment and business terms. The corollary to my comment on differentiation is this. Customers and suppliers increasingly realize that to navigate the intersection of advanced technology, unforgiving time to market and intense competition, close collaboration is essential. Synopsys' focus on both points tool [ph] leadership and integrated solutions makes us a desirable supplier, and our collaboration with advanced customers and key partners continues to yield great results.","Just last week, for example, we further expanded our broad collaboration agreement with ARM to include the latest ARMv8 processor models. Working with mutual customers, Synopsys and ARM jointly accelerate product development cycles around ARM's latest processors. State-of-the-art collaboration relies on the constant delivery of new capabilities, so let me provide some recent product highlights.","On the implementation side, Synopsys supports a continued aggressive adoption of more complex design nodes. Simultaneously, we see a fundamental discontinuity in the structure of the transistor. We're closely working with silicon providers to roll out evolving technology to address these challenges. With the structure of the transistor itself migrating from horizontal to new vertical FinFETs, better power and performance open the door to great new applications. It also brings about a slew of technical challenges in EDA and IP, challenges for which Synopsys is particularly well equipped, again making us a key partner in our customers' future differentiation.","As an example of how customers rely on us, 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs today have used Synopsys implementation, while we're already working with some all the way back down to 10 nanometers.","Synopsys is the only EDA company that has been investing for many years in FinFET enablement throughout our portfolio, from 3-dimensional TCAD simulation to photolithography to manufacturing tools, to physical placement, routing, extraction and verification, to circuit simulation and custom design, all the way to sophisticated IP libraries, memories and building blocks.","A good example of multiyear collaboration in this area is with Samsung, where we successfully taped out the first test chip on their 14-nanometer low-power process. Samsung chose Synopsys as its FinFET partner because of our successful 20-nanometer collaboration history and our comprehensive FinFET focus throughout our portfolio.","As advanced transistor research accelerates, demand for our 3D TCAD products continues to grow. For example, during the quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Imec, a world-leading research center, to jointly optimize FinFET technology for 10-nanometer and below design.","Multiyear collaborations have not only yielded a number of advanced tape-outs, but today, we are also selling our own FinFET-based embedded memory libraries and logic IP.","Finally, through the acquisition of SpringSoft, we also have a FinFET-ready custom implementation solution. Notwithstanding the emphasis on advanced technology, our business with customers who are focused on more established nodes is also strong. These customers invariably squeeze performance, power and area out of their chips to be competitive. We recently demonstrated that advances made in our leading-edge tools have great impact on established nodes as well, most notably in run time and capacity, which is a good transition to the topic of verification.","The move to smaller transistors also enables the other side of Moore's Law, many more transistors. Indeed, the overall complexity of not only chips but systems of chips is precisely what makes continued end product innovation possible. Verifying these products is the largest bottleneck in electronics.","Just looking at the latest smartphones, one finds multiple multicore processors with hundreds of millions of transistors coupled with complex operating systems, applications, networking and wireless protocols. Not only is the hardware complex, but so is the interaction of the hardware and the software. Solving these verification challenges has been a major focus for Synopsys for many years.","Today, we are the market leader in both leading-edge digital verification with about 70% of advanced designs using -- utilizing Synopsys and analog simulation, where 80% of the designs rely on our tools. VCS, which continues to grow well, is the fastest simulator on the market today.","With the acquisition of EVE, we also have added the fastest hardware emulator, and combined with our HAPS FPGA boards, we cover the entire hardware validation and hardware software verification space. With the acquisition of SpringSoft, we've added to our portfolio the most compressive open debug system, thus, addressing the entire verification market with outstanding point tools. We have started to combine the best features of these, and we're driving integration of all the elements into a full-line verification solution. Initial customer reaction has been strongly positive, as we have quickly asked for feedback from them. We're now well into the process of developing and communicating combined roadmaps. Both the EVE and SpringSoft integrations are progressing very well.","The third area I would like to briefly highlight is IP and Systems, which now represents 1\/4 of our revenue. We're the second largest IP vendor with approximately 1,400 IP engineers worldwide designing the most complex IP blocks, importing to all key foundry processes.","After 15 years of investment, our DesignWare IP is shipped in more than 1 billion chips per year. Every 2 days, a chip is taped out using our USB. Every week, a chip tapes out with our PCI Express, and customers have already delivered tens of millions of chips containing our 28-nanometer IP.","Today, Synopsys is the #1 vendor in interface cores, analog IP and embedded memories. And the market for more IP, including the sub-20-nanometer nodes, continues to expand. We intend to grow our IP business at double-digit rate while gradually increasing its profitability, as we've successfully done in the last 2 years.","In systems, we're seeing momentum in both software and hardware-based prototyping. This is promising as we've invested in this area for a number of years, believing that hardware\/software verification, as well as the ability to develop software earlier in the process would grow in importance over time. This quarter, 2 large and influential electronic companies increased deployment of virtual prototyping, driving good run rate growth.","As the key enabler to early modeling of chips for software development, we expect virtual prototyping to grow gradually and become more mainstream as system complexity emerges as the weak link in time to market. Bridging between systems and verification, our earlier mentioned FPGA-based prototyping systems, HAPS is doing very well also. With a who's who of customers, our newly launched HAPS-70 Series, which uses the most advanced FPGAs on the market, was named Electronics Design's 2012 EDA Product of the Year.","In summary, Synopsys is doing very well in all dimensions: technology progress, customer collaboration and financial execution. In Q1, we delivered results that serve as an excellent start to the year. And as a consequence, we're raising EPS guidance to reflect confidence in our outlook.","I will now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year.","In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. Q1 financial results were highlighted by double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings. And now some additional detail.","As a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting revenue and total non-GAAP expenses by approximately $25 million and $16 million, respectively. Total revenue was $475 million, an increase of 12% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Normalizing for the extra week in FY '12, revenue grew 19%. Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue.","The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.4 years, affected by a couple of large 1-year add-on deals. We continue to expect the average duration for fiscal 2013 to be about 2.7 years.","Turning to expenses. Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were $414 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $18 million of stock-based compensation. Q1 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $355 million, an expected year-over-year increase due to increases in compensation and other expenses from our recent acquisitions.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the quarter. For all of FY '13, we are on track to expand non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points over FY '12.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.45. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 20% to $0.67, exceeding our target range. Normalizing for the extra week in FY '12, earnings grew 31%. Earnings outperformance was driven primarily by a lower-than-expected tax rate, as well as higher-than-expected other income, along with operational execution.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 18% for the quarter, well below our target range, driven primarily by January's reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The Q1 2013 tax rate includes a retroactive benefit of $6 million for fiscal year 2012, in addition to the impact of the tax credit for Q1 of 2013. As a result, we now think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13.","Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. We ended the quarter with $550 million in cash and cash equivalents with 27% onshore and 73% offshore. As expected, there was a net operating cash outflow. The Q1 outflow of $91 million was due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments. We continue to target operating cash flow of at least $350 million in FY '13.","During the quarter, we paid back $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan. We did not spend back cash -- spent cash to repurchase our stock. However, we will consider buying back stock during the year, the amount and timing of which would depend on acquisition opportunities. We have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","DSO declined 7 days to 52 days. And we ended Q1 with 8,165 employees with about 1\/3 in lower-cost geographies.","Now let's address our second quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the second quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $490 million and $500 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $409 million and $425 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $362 million and $372 million; other income and expense between $1 million and a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% to 25%; outstanding shares between 154 million and 158 million; GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.44 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.63 to $0.65 per share. We expect about 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.","Now our fiscal 2013 outlook. Revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14% excluding the extra week in 2012; other income and expense between $1 million and $5 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23%; outstanding shares between $155 million and $159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.44 to $1.56, which includes the impact of approximately $70 million of stock-based compensation expense; and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40, which represents solid double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million. And as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of at least $350 million. To assist in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be greater than first half revenue, and total non-GAAP expenses are expected to be skewed towards the second half of the year.","In summary, we're pleased with our excellent first quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth and continued solid operating margin. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Aart, you mentioned that you are seeing maybe a slightly more stable macroenvironment. But I would think that government agencies and perhaps aerospace companies that are exposed to government might be seeing some hesitation due to the potential for sequestration coming. And have you seen any of that? And if not, do you think you might?","Aart J. de Geus","Thanks, Rich. It's a good question. We have indeed seen a little bit of that with some of the government-related businesses that are just a little bit more careful before committing to whatever renewal they may have. At the same time, that is a relatively small portion of our business and is completely overshadowed by the much bigger companies, certainly bigger in terms of their EDA spending, that are driving all the commercial markets and the global markets. And so I just happen to know of one case where what you said is true, and that's all I know. So it's not very heavy on our mind.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","No, that's great. And then, Aart, some pretty positive comments with respect to your positioning with respect to FinFET adoption and the move to kind of 3D. Can you say if you think you're seeing incremental purchasing for FinFET implementation sort of above and beyond what you might have seen, if folks have been sticking with 2D? Or do you think this is sort of a normal progression that there's sort of a continuous progression where there's always purchasing being done for sort of the next technology?","Aart J. de Geus","So I do not think it's the normal progression. And actually, one of the reasons I'm bullish on FinFET, in general, is because I think FinFET heralds another decade of Moore's Law. And that's a pretty bold statement given how many people have said, well, it's all getting too expensive, too difficult, which are all sort of true statements. But the fact is from being an interesting idea 2 years ago to at least one company having already a shift in production FinFET capabilities to now all the key manufacturers really raising forward to get this capability, you can, at a minimum, see an industry that's making a big bet that FinFET adds new life to Moore's Law. And in my opinion, there's actually a fairly simple explanation why it's good and it's a difficult explanation on how do you make it work, which is that FinFETs have the potential over this continually and performance power ratio. And power has been one of the key limiters in modern semiconductors. The fact that it's difficult is actually something we love because Synopsys is focused on making problems like that go away. And in that context, I'm not surprised at all that there are heavy investments in simulation, in modeling. I think we have the place and routes and things already completely under control. And so now the next phase is really for the semiconductor industry to arrive at good yields for this, and that will take a couple of years. But I wouldn't be surprised if a number of design companies go fairly light on the 20-nanometer node because they really want to go full bore on the FinFET wave. And so there's a lot of work that we have and can do with those companies. And from that perspective, I think it bodes well for the EDA industry.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then I'm wondering if you can give some thoughts on the emulation market and the growth prospects there. Obviously, you became a sort of a new player in that with your EVE acquisition. Obviously, one of the largest players in that market in their recent report said they were looking for a down year in '13. So I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the medium-term growth prospects for the emulation market.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think that for any given company, you can have up and down years partially because that's just the reality of when people buy something, they may buy a lot and then they don't buy that much the subsequent year. I wouldn't make too much out of these ups and downs. I think in general, there's no question that verification is a big topic, that's going to be bigger as we see even more transistors and even bigger systems needing to be verified. In the emulation field, of course, everybody hopes that they have the gold standard of technology. But the reality there is that there are different needs and applications. And I think we will see steady growth for all the players. So I expect it to be a healthy market even if there may be quarter-to-quarter some ups and downs.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And just one final one, if I could, for you, Brian. I mean, it looks like you guys beat by about $0.12 on the quarter and you mentioned what the different contributing factors were. And you increased your EPS range for the year by about $0.09. So wondering if maybe there was some shifting of expenses out of the first quarter or something that maybe you're figuring or that catch you in Q2 or Q3. Any color on that will be helpful.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, maybe what I can do is just kind of break out some of the significant overachievements in the quarter and how that profiles into the rest of the year. So first off, in terms of the achievements, we had about $0.06 flow-through as a result of the federal R&D tax credits for both '12 and '13. And that means about $0.04 for '12 and about $0.02 for the first quarter of '13. We had some improvements on other income that related to mark-to-market adjustments we had for our currency hedges. And we don't expect that to reiterate again for the rest of the year. And then we had some operational improvements, a little bit higher revenue, a little bit less in terms of spending. And then as you say, we did increase our overall guidance by about $0.09, which reflects that, plus the continuing R&D tax credit for quarters 2 through 4. So that gives us the additional $0.03 just coming from the tax side. So the rest of the year, we look at it. It's still early on. It obviously gives us the flexibility of making the target investments we need to invest in for providing that longer-term growth such as the IP areas. And again, happy to see we now have top line double-digit growth in '13 and top line bottom line growth as well.","Operator","Your next question from the line of Krish Sankar of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Shankar. Given the strong M&A activity in FY '12, I just wanted to get your view on capital allocation this year. Will your primary use of cash still largely be focused on acquisitions? Or could priorities start shifting towards maybe buybacks or potentially a dividend?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, as you know, we have multiple ways to use the cash, and M&A is something that you have to sort of build up towards. And so at any point in time, we want to maintain a certain amount of cash level. We have a little bit of debt that we are very gradually buying back. That is just a good health discipline. In that context, the 2 things that we really trade off is M&A versus buybacks. And we contemplate both pretty much all the time. And so we have an open authorization from the board. We have done it in the past. We are certainly well versed in understanding that decreasing the share count is a good thing. At the same time, doing good acquisitions grows the business going forward. And as you well know, we don't comment much about any M&A we may do. But fundamentally, our strategies at Synopsys have not changed. In terms of dividend, that is not a pathway that we have chosen to date, and we are not really contemplating it right now either.","Brian M. Beattie","And maybe, Tom, if I may just add to that as well. Of course, as you know, buybacks require U.S. cash to be able to enact that. And we're currently sitting after the end of our first quarter with about $150 million in U.S. cash. And again, we anticipate that amount -- apart from M&A discussions, we expect that amount to continue to grow from now until the end of the year as well, which gives us more flexibility on that side, too.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's very helpful. And can you talk a little bit about progress around the integration of EVE? And within your unchanged revenue guidance for the full year, should we still be expecting roughly $100 million from both EVE and SpringSoft combined?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, I think that number feels in the right ballpark, although I don't recall exactly what times we may have given. One of the reasons, to be honest, I don't quite recall the guidance, is once we start integrating, it is quite surprising how quickly the old companies fade away largely because we have the benefit of a much broader sales force and a broader market appeal. And the products get either integrated or associated with other things that we sell. Having said that, I think the progress on integration is actually quite good. We have no big surprises to deal with. We are, of course, looking immediately at areas where we can strengthen the technology or areas where customers are looking at us now having a broader portfolio. And in general, the verification field is one where we clearly added a lot of capabilities. Lastly, the ultimate barometer, of course, is the customer reaction. The initial reactions have been very positive. And so the next 12-month reactions is, of course, in terms of so, how much do they buy, and that will be the metric against which we measure our success.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And final one from me. You talked a little bit about IP. Can you provide us an update on the percentage of IP that is currently outsourced today? And will you see that penetration of outsourced IP reaching over the next year or 2 where it's expected to level off?","Aart J. de Geus","There are a lot of different estimates on that. One of them says that today, about 50% is outsourced. But having literally just had the, not exactly that discussion but a similar discussion yesterday with the product -- the vice president of marketing of group, he was commenting that it's not only that percentage itself that is relevant, it's also the fact that IP we use in general is growing. And so I think right now, we see a good horizon for our capabilities because it is growing, also because the type of IP is becoming more and more complex. And again, that plays well to our strength. So it's an area that, while demanding investments to build the IP, I think the business potential is good for us.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Aart, I'm just kind of curious. For 2013, what do you think are the end markets that are going to pull through that demand, and especially that demand for the smaller geometry and FinFET design chips?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, in one word, mobile, right? Mobile just drives everything still like crazy for a couple of reasons. A, it's super high volume. And so that gets everybody's attention, and therefore, there's also a high attention being put on the price of the chips. But secondly is because everything mobile is limited in its performance by the power consumption. And so any promise that one could have more capabilities with, let's say, the same power, because that's typically what happens, is of high value in future product differentiation. I do not expect that to change at all. Now around mobility, of course, is the whole infrastructure that has to support this. Sometimes people call it the cloud. Sometimes people call it the compute centers but -- or data centers. And they are essentially a reflection of not only the amount of -- the number of mobile devices but also the tremendous traffic that is engendered by them. Both of these -- those will continue. The number of companies that are leading this is not super large but is very, very focused and very aggressive. And so that is why I have a high degree of confidence that as soon as FinFET yields well, we're going to see a lot of activity there.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got you. On the contract duration side, can you give us an idea, if you strip out the 1-year deals, what duration would have looked like? And can you confirm again, did I hear correct, those 1-year deals were only add-ons, they were not renewals?","Brian M. Beattie","That's correct, yes. We had just a number of add-ons where customers already have a 3-year deal. And then they look towards the end of the contract expiry and say, \"Hey, we just need another 1-year addition to what we already have in place to handle some additional seats and applications.\" So that's how they look at it. Our average, again, for the year, we'll say, is the 2.7 to 2.8 years. And just based on the first quarter that came in at 2.4, we think it will revert back to the mean.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right. So stripping out those 1-year, there's nothing that dissuade you from that 2.7 for the year, obviously?","Brian M. Beattie","No, no, it doesn't, no.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then back to the guidance question; the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit and the performance in the first quarter, did you guys decide to increase investment for either the rest of the year or perhaps the second half? Or can you just maybe give us at least the -- some additional color on your thoughts around what the operating margin for the year in terms of what you're thinking about how it trends there?","Brian M. Beattie","Absolutely. Yes, we're still on track on the operating margin question, to be approximately 100 basis points improvement, which builds on last year's 100-basis-point improvement as well. When we look at the profile, again, the R&D tax credit is great and then it provided us that flexibility. As we look at the whole year, we've seen a very good first quarter come through, forecast also a very strong second quarter. And then as we just look at it in terms of tweaking the overall quarterly profile of expenses to maintain that double-digit EPS growth as well for the year. And in the second half is typically where you see the impact coming from compensation increases that are in place from our facilities around the world. We see that factor coming in, some increased headcount as a result of the investments. And these investments in the second half are really essential as we drive continued growth through '14 and beyond. So again, we're just targeting those investments towards the back half of the year, and that's what's factored into our profile.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And last question because I know it's going to come up -- it's already come up in a couple of conversations with investors. Looking at the quarter, the sales and marketing expenses where one area that provided some EPS upside, at least relative to our estimates. And we all think about sales commissions tied to bookings from that line item. Is there anything in the 1-year add-on deals that perhaps leads to lower sales commission expense that could explain it or anything else that we should kind of factor in?","Brian M. Beattie","Not really, no. I'd just stay with the total year expectation around expenses that we were addressing. And it just reflects from quarter to quarter the amount of profile towards the business levels that come through. And other than that, it comes in a little bit this quarter and the next quarter goes back up, that type of thing. It just moves around. So again, it's just some of the hiring, some of the headcount that came in a little bit lighter than we anticipated, and anticipate that picking up again in the second quarter and beyond.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the next question from the line of Thomas Diffely of D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just first, Brian, to clarify, you said there was a $0.02 impact from the R&D tax for the -- in the first quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, that's correct. Yes, for the FY '13 impact.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And what was your expectation then for the full year? Is it $0.02 per quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","No, it's about a $0.01 each over the next 3 quarters. So it's about $0.05 for FY '13 and about $0.04 for FY '12. That makes up your $0.09 profile.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, all right. And then when you look at the kind of the increase in the non-GAAP expenses in the second half, is that more fourth quarter loaded like it typically is?","Brian M. Beattie","It's a little bit more towards the fourth quarter, but almost even, just a little bit higher in the fourth, based on the profile we've got right now. And again, those compensation increases kick in about the June timeframe, and then the rest is profile of the investment and headcount growth that we've got. So it kind of leans a little bit towards the fourth but not too far off the third.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then earlier, you guys were talking about the pricing getting a little bit better. Was that on the core EDA side versus the IP side?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, it's on the core business.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And also, Aart, we've heard from some of the large foundries lately that there's been a ramp-up in 20-nanometer business with some new customers that's actually emerging out of Asia, China, in particular. Is that becoming a meaningful part of your business at this point, some of these new fabless players at the leading edge?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes and no. China has been growing in general over the last few years. And in parallel to that, the technical competence has steadily moved up. And so now there are a few players in China that do very advanced design. And of course, they tend to quickly also become the biggest spenders in that geography. Even so, they are still relatively small compared to the really very large international companies that have been leading the field. But I think this will steadily grow, and we are doing particularly well with them because of the advanced nodes. So I think we are increasingly in a very global world that includes China and the technology just follow suit.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then also earlier, you talked about the FinFET and how that was going to drive growth going forward. Do you see similar trends from things such as 3D NAND that's on the horizon, as well as EUV? How do those technologies impact both your design of your products as well as what the market might be longer term?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, just to clarify, there are 2 types of 3D. One is inside of the chip, which is 3D, often referred to as the FinFET, a vertical transistor. The other 3D that's often used as a term is the stacking in various forms of multiple chips. And for a while, people looked at the second one as an alternative just in case the 3D transistor wasn't coming about. Well, I think the 3D transistor is absolutely coming about, which doesn't negate the need for the second one, but I think that will take its time. When you're talking about things like EUV, you're talking about a whole new form of photolithography. And the jury is still very, very much out in terms of how economically viable this is and when it becomes economically viable. And so most of the investments that go in that direction are in the equipment manufacturing industry. And yes, we touch it a little bit because we have some R&D efforts in photolithography and how to model these things. But from a volume or big deployment point of view, I think it's premature to look at that as a major business.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, on the NAND side, I know memory hasn't been a big driver of EDA tools in general, but when an industry does towards more of the perpendicular -- or I should said say the vertical NAND structure, does that increase complexity enough to kind of kick up the EDA spend?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, if I may slightly correct the perception, we actually have done quite a bit of very good business with memory providers. And there's a lot of simulation that gets done for all of the different memory types. And moreover, memories today are so large that you have to build in all the logic to fix them because almost no memory is perfect. And so they have a lot of self-correcting capabilities, and that actually demands some of the place and route tools. And so it is clearly its own segment. But as a segment per se, we have done quite well with it, and we expect it to continue to grow.","Operator","And the next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer of Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","A couple of financial questions first for Brian and then market questions for Aart. First, Brian, in the fourth quarter, there was a very close correlation between your IP, your services and your Asia Pac revenues. I'm wondering if there was a similar correlation at all in terms of several forms of business in the first quarter? Or at least perhaps you could explain the strength you saw in your maintenance and services line. And then secondly, for you as well, could you talk about your cash flow expectations? You took up your GAAP earnings expectations for the year, but you left your cash flow the same. It's clear your GAAP net income will be higher for the year, plus your depreciation and amortization and your stock-based comp. So is there something in working capital that you're thinking will be negative or adverse to your total cash flow for the year?","Brian M. Beattie","Good questions. Okay, Jay, let me run through that. On the first one about the services business and our IP business. Over the last 18 months or so, we've seen a small shift in the makeup of the business. So we now see a significant amount of what we call percentage completion on contracts entering from a number of the acquisitions we've done. And as we advance to really some incredible technologies, we have to get in and tweak some of the software that goes into the IP. And when you look at things like percentage completion and deliverables of that, as well as the hardware business now related to both emulation and our hardware prototyping businesses, those have a slightly different profile relative to our traditional 3-year businesses. So again, just as I say, tweaking the profiles of that. Hardware is typically taken upfront. The percentage completion on services is exactly that as the job gets done. But it's typically over a 6-months period and not a 3-year window as a traditional license is taken. So apart from that, anything else is just coincidental based on timing of those deliverables and when we make the commitment. On your cash flow question, as we look at the total year, again, still feel comfortable with approximately $350 million of good cash inflow for the year. And relative to tax benefits and other things that go through, again, it just kind of comes into account for where the specific cash flows are forecast originally. And again, this is predominantly a U.S. R&D tax credit. So obviously, it has an impact on our U.S. taxes payable. And we're in pretty good shape based on that, and it helps build up NOLs and other tax elements for us going forward. So no change to the overall forecast. I think it's a good, solid number. And the other point you brought up about amortizations and capital and all the rest, there's really no change in those numbers for the year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. For Aart, a couple of things. I'd like to ask how you're thinking about your organic growth in core EDA. And currently, you have high, if not majority, share in a number of large categories. Systems [ph] is obviously implementation, RTL simulation and most of analysis where you have very strong share. Yet each of those categories is not necessarily growing at or above the industry growth rate. So could you talk about your components or your drivers of getting to your, I think, mid-single-digit core EDA growth assumption? Can you -- do you need FinFET and the other incremental forms of business you talked about to just get to mid-single-digit core EDA? Do you think that what you've been talking about tonight can get you above your prior comments about core EDA growth?","Aart J. de Geus","Okay. Well, let me first characterize where this comes from. We've been talking now for a number of years that we enter a year typically with an objective to be high single-digit growth and that we characterize that over a long period of time as the core being in the mid-single digit and then some of the other capabilities such as IP being in double digit. And this all sort of adds up to high single-digit growth. Now having said that, the last 2 years, we clearly exceeded on that. Right now, we just communicated that we are very solidly in double-digit growth for this year, so we anticipate. And so clearly, we have done better in pretty much all the categories than our steady-state model. We just don't give -- we don't want to give an impression that you can just look at many years out and assume that is always the case. You have to work for it. And so in that context, this year, I think we will do better than these assumptions. Clearly, from an overall market growth point of view, in our industry, we're doing very well. And because of that, our focus is already completely moved towards '14 and '15. And last but not least, much of this is sold in fairly complex schools of technology that mix and match a little bit of everything. And so there's always a slight degree of artificiality to pinpoint the exact growth. But I do you think that in our industry, and specifically for Synopsys, we have a wave of pretty good organic growth.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then lastly, more on the technical side perhaps. Last year at DAC, the company highlighted that you had enabled your critical tools with double patterning as filling an essential need for a design at 20-nanometer and similar advanced nodes. Tonight, you spoke a number of occasions of FinFET and yield of FinFET. Is there some connection between having double pattern enabled your tools and yield on FinFET? Or is there something more you need to do to meet the industry needs for the kind of yield you referred to in this new technology?","Aart J. de Geus","Okay, a very good technical question. Just to -- for the benefit of everybody, let me make sure you understand what we're talking about. When we're talking about FinFETs, we're talking about transistors that right now, most of the industry is focusing on a very small dimension. And I won't go into too much specifics because different companies are very guarded, rightfully so, on what they do. But typically, it is below 20 nanometers. The connections between these transistors, there's a variety of approaches, from above 20-nanometer to below 20-nanometer. And again, different players are looking at different configurations of how to go to market and how to get yields and how to differentiate themselves. As you go below 20-nanometer for many of these dimensions, it becomes mandatory, in many cases, to not have a single flash of light to illuminate a mask, but multiple flashes of light. That's called double patterning. I won't go into any deeper on the technology than that. But it is very sophisticated because it uses the addition and subtraction of light in order to get much more refinement to the picture. You have to think a little bit about how you probably in grad school developed photographs in a dark lab. In order to get it really sharp, you need very good lenses, and we apply all kinds of tricks to that. Having said that, our tools today are completely conversant with double patterning. And that is the necessity to go to the smaller geometries. We're also conversant with the FinFET structures. And so our tools have been used for FinFET chips that are on the market, in production today. They are being used for pretty much all of the tape-outs for the new chips coming out. And so from that perspective, there's a lot of tuning that will happen between now and high-yield FinFETs. But the fundamental technology, as far as Synopsys is concerned, is in place.","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue. Back to you for closing remarks.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, thank you so much for attending this call. As you saw through our results and through the fact that we increased our guidance, we feel that we have good results and a good outlook going forward.

We\u2019re happy to report a strong fourth quarter finish to an outstanding fiscal year for Synopsys, as we enter 2017 with a very solid foundation. We again delivered excellent financial results, while successfully balancing investments for the short and long term. We made very good progress in digital design and verification. ","Our IP business delivered strong results, and we further scaled our Software Integrity solutions, including the acquisitions we announced earlier this month. Summarizing our financial results for the year: We delivered revenue of $2.42 billion, an 8% increase, reflecting strength across all product groups. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.02 or 9% growth.","Our three-year backlog remained very strong at $3.54 billion. We generated $587 million in operating cash flow. We bought back $400 million of our stock and reduced share count. Building on our strong year-end position, and including the impact of the just-closed acquisitions, we\u2019re setting a 2017 revenue target of $2.57 billion to $2.6 billion, a non-GAAP EPS objective of $3.16 to $3.23, reflecting high-single-digit organic growth with modest near-term dilution from the acquisitions, and an operating cash flow goal of approximately $500 million. ","Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. As we head into 2017, we see varying technical and business dynamics for the three customer segments we serve, Semiconductors, Systems, and Software Developers across multiple industries. Semiconductor companies sell chips that they may or may not manufacture, and where design, verification, and in some cases, embedded software drive differentiation. ","From a technology perspective, many push state-of-the-art silicon design non-stop. This means optimizing for performance, power, area, and yield using advanced manufacturing processes and pushing our tools to the limit. While the cost of Moore\u2019s law is tightening the race, the quest for still more complex chips delivering still more performance continues. ","At the same time, whether to drive efficiency through size or to scale up into vertical segments, some companies are divesting parts of their businesses or combining with others to better position themselves for the next wave of growth. While these consolidations initially are a headwind for the EDA industry, Synopsys has thus far successfully navigated some large M&A combinations in a number of cases even expanding our customer relationships. ","Our multi-year business model, combined with our technology, platforms, and market leadership provides an excellent backdrop to help our customers through these transitions. System houses, which contribute about 40% of our revenue, develop products that incorporate multiple chips, their own or someone else\u2019s, as well as their own or third party software. Their differentiation manifests itself in terms of product capabilities and time to market. This opportunity space is great, with exciting new applications such as digital intelligence, machine learning, smart IoT, 5G mobile networks, virtual and assisted reality, and massive cloud-based computing to name just a few. ","Many of these are already visible in newly energized verticals such as automotive, industrial, and health. The challenges at the complex intersection of hardware and software are substantial, yet this is exactly where Synopsys excels. Finally, software developers in many industries grapple with acutely growing security vulnerabilities. ","These exposures can have a dramatic impact on security, safety, and even health, with potentially staggering financial implications. We\u2019re enthusiastic about the step-by-step scaling of our software integrity solutions, which is happening at just the right time to help these organizations take their security strategies to the next level. For Synopsys, our unique position reaching literally from Silicon to Software enables us to help all of these customers, and positions us well for high impact and growth in the years to come.","In that context, let me provide you some highlights starting with the roots of Silicon. The push towards bringing smaller, faster, lower-power chips to market sooner is unrelenting, and FinFET technology continues to advance. Our FinFET-proven flow begins with the earliest TCAD and lithography simulation models, key enablers of Moore\u2019s law. During FY 2016, we announced a new solution that brings TCAD into the up-stream research phase to help manufacturers reduce process development time. ","We\u2019re already involved in 3 nanometer and even initial 2 nanometer research. Our unique position in TCAD is a differentiator that grants us early understanding and access to key models, giving us a head start in terms of product readiness. As the clear leader in advanced FinFET design, we continue to see rapid adoption of 16, 14, 10 nanometer and test chips at 7 nanometer nodes. ","The statistics are compelling. The cumulative number of completed FinFET designs is approaching 300, with Synopsys relied on for more than 95% of those chips. Meanwhile, 48 out of 49 leading-edge tape-outs at 10 nanometer and below are using our design tools. ","During the year, we announced broad foundry certification, including from TSMC and Samsung for our digital and custom\/analog tools at the most advanced processes. In digital design, IC Compiler II continues to proliferate and progress technically to help customers with their most advanced designs. ","Leading adopters including Intel, Samsung, TSMC, Broadcom, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Toshiba, Socionext, Infineon, and Huawei shared some of their most intriguing challenges and IC Compiler II successes during the year. It\u2019s the fastest-ramping product in our history, including a record second half and has been used in approximately 250 production designs on over 25 different foundry processes. ","In custom\/analog design, this year we introduced a brand new product, Custom Compiler. The result of several years of development, it features an innovative approach that accelerates key part of design from weeks to days, targeted specifically at FinFET. While still in the early stages, it has generated considerable interest now converting into adoption by customers including ST, GSI Technologies, and AK Microdevices, with support from leading FinFET foundries. ","Now to verification, an immense challenge that is only getting more difficult, with highly complex systems featuring sophisticated silicon and increasing amounts of embedded software. Our Verification Continuum platform, born out of an early vision and collaboration with our customers, is making a big impact. Built around the fastest simulation, emulation, and prototyping engines, it delivered an outstanding year of growth.","We made great progress on all elements of the platforms and integration, yielding significant competitive displacements in leading customers. One example was a major enterprise-level partnership and expanded commitment to Synopsys by one of the world\u2019s top mobile semiconductor companies. This year we also unveiled a breakthrough innovation, enabling massive parallelism to speed up our franchise VCS simulation product. ","In addition, the SpyGlass technology from Atrenta has exceeded our expectations. Our hardware verification product had a very strong year, with record orders for our ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping solutions. We\u2019re the fastest-growing emulation vendor in the industry. An excellent example of our momentum is NXP, which selected Synopsys as its primary SoC verification and emulation solution for its next-generation automotive, secure connectivity, and smart connected products. ","In IP, we saw growing business momentum through the year and significantly expanded our portfolio and vertical market reach. We\u2019re seeing very good demand for our comprehensive interface IP portfolio. Continuously at the forefront of new standard development, we offer customers high-quality titles, as soon as a new standard is released. TSMC recognized us as Interface IP Partner of the Year for the sixth year in a row, and we were named SMIC\u2019s Interface Vendor of the Year for the third year straight. ","We were first to market with the new USB Type C, and are the only IP company with USB 3.1 certification. We delivered the latest PCI Express 4.0 IP, targeting advanced data-intensive cloud computing applications. We continue to drive the state-of-the-art in the most advanced nodes, winning several important 10 and 7 nanometer projects. Lastly, our embedded vision solution provides a leading-edge, and easy-to-use, processor\/neural network combo that leverages machine learning, one of the hottest applications out there.","Another key focus for us not only in IP, but across our entire Silicon to Software product spectrum, is automotive. We\u2019ve expanded our automotive portfolio, and in FY 2016 made accelerated progress. We delivered several advancements for next-generation automated driving and infotainment, including our newest embedded vision processor. We drove key design wins at major automotive semiconductor companies, thanks to having grown the broadest portfolio of automotive-certified IP in the industry. ","Enabling software development 15 months prior to silicon, we delivered our virtual prototyping solution to a leading supplier of driver assistance systems. We also signed a large agreement with a leading U.S. automotive OEM. Our digital and custom design tools added new design and analysis capabilities focused on ensuring the extreme reliability required for automotive applications. ","Key tools throughout our EDA, IP, and Software Integrity portfolio are certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety measures defined by the ISO 26262 safety standard. Our focus on automotive software security is becoming increasingly well-known. In fact, we\u2019ve teamed up with leading OEMs, Tier 1s and semiconductor companies to drive software cybersecurity standards for automotive through SAE, the Society of Automotive Engineers. ","Our reach continues to expand to include new entrants, as well as traditional leaders such as Bosch, Delphi, and Continental. Stay tuned for continued product advances and new technology milestones this year. ","Next, to our Software Integrity group, which provides products and services to build quality and security into the software development lifecycle and across the cyber supply chain. Building on the acquisition of Coverity a couple of years ago, we\u2019ve added key technologies both organically and via acquisition, while simultaneously unifying the sales organization. ","Our go-forward strategy is three-fold. First, continue to broaden and deploy our Software Sign-off Platform as the foundation of our offering. Second, accelerate our penetration of key verticals in both the embedded and enterprise spaces. And third, drive demand creation, with ecosystem partners, certification projects, and services. ","To that end, we just today completed the acquisitions of Cigital, which specializes in security consulting services, and Codiscope, a spinoff of Cigital with related developer tools. We\u2019re very excited about this combination, as it will accelerate our ability to reach customers and expand our market in new segments. The companies are strategically aligned with a shared vision, and bring complementary elements to the table. ","Synopsys leads with best-in-class products. Cigital attacks security problems from a service angle. Synopsys has a very strong presence in the embedded space, including automotive, medical devices and IoT. Cigital is a leader in serving enterprise customers, with particular strength in financial services. And finally, Cigital brings a demand creation element, with customer touch points earlier in the security strategy development process of our customers. ","Cigital and Synopsys are both named in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for application security testing. In this highly fragmented, emerging market, the combination will enable us to provide the most comprehensive portfolio available in the market today. From an overall company financial perspective, our primary long-term objective remains to drive high-single-digit non-GAAP earnings-per-share growth on a multi-year basis, through a mix of the following:","One, grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single digit range; Two, grow revenue in IP\/Systems and Software Integrity generally in the low double-digits; Three, actively explore TAMexpanding R&D and M&A opportunities; Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range; And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of stock buybacks, M&A, and debt repayment. While the results in any given period may vary, based on acquisitions or other near-term priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent.","To summarize, Synopsys delivered another excellent year, even in the context of a challenging semiconductor landscape. In terms of both total and EDA-related revenue growth, we outpaced the competition in 2016. We continue to invest in the short-and long-term, organically and via acquisitions, operationally and with share buybacks, all to drive long-term shareholder value. Lastly, we\u2019re making good progress in building our software security platform and market segment position. ","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham ","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. As I reflect on the past year, I\u2019m pleased with our results. We again delivered on our near-term financial goals, while investing for sustainable long-term growth. This strategy is paying off. Our EDA and IP solutions are doing well, offering a combination of healthy growth and profitability. ","We\u2019re also building out a new, higher-growth software security platform, which is gaining critical mass. This diverse product and customer portfolio positions us very well, and supports our near-and-long term objective of driving high-single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. ","In 2016, we achieved substantially better financial results than we originally anticipated. The entire Synopsys team executed very well, and Q4 was a strong finish to an outstanding year. We delivered high-single-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth, and generated significant operating cash flow. We bought back $400 million of stock to reduce the share count. And earlier this month we announced two acquisitions to further scale our software security platform. We enter 2017 with a solid foundation and are confident in our ability to achieve our financial objectives.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. We delivered total revenue of $634 million in Q4 and $2.42 billion for the year, an annual growth rate of 8%. There was strength across all product groups, including record hardware sales. Over 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of Q4 and 2016 revenue. ","The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.7 years for the quarter and 3 years for 2016. We expect the 2017 average to be about 3 years. Our three-year backlog remains strong at $3.54 billion, and reflects good business growth and the timing of large contract renewals. ","Importantly, approximately 80% of our 2017 revenue target is already in hand, which provides stability and predictability. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $551 million for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $488 million for the quarter and $1.85 billion for the year. ","2016 expenses increased due largely to higher costs associated with employee compensation, acquisitions, and cost of goods sold for hardware sales. We delivered solid non-GAAP operating margins, 22.9% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year. GAAP earnings per share were $0.47 in Q4 and $1.73 for the year. ","Non-GAAP earnings were $0.77 in Q4 and $3.02 for the year, an annual growth rate of 9%. We generated $148 million of operating cash flow for the quarter and $587 million for the year. We exceeded our original 2016 target due to strong collections and business levels throughout the year. ","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1.1 billion with 15% onshore and total debt of $205 million. Earlier this week, we renewed and expanded our credit facility to $650 million and took out a $150 million term loan, providing excellent flexibility to support our strategic goals. ","In 2016, we used about 80% of our free cash flow for buybacks. As a result, we reduced share count by 3.3 million shares, and intend to slightly reduce it again in 2017. We have $435 million remaining on our current authorization.","Operating cash flow is expected to be strong in 2017, with a target of approximately $500 million, even with an outflow associated with the recent acquisitions. We expect the quarterly profile to be similar to prior years, with a net outflow during Q1, driven largely by 2016 annual incentive compensation payments. ","Before moving onto 2017 guidance, let me briefly comment on some of the details of the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions, which were funded using a combination of U.S. cash and debt. They are expected to be modestly dilutive to 2017 non-GAAP EPS, and reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis by the second half of 2018. ","Now to first quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance which includes the impact of Cigital and Codiscope. For Q1, the targets are: revenue between $630 and $645 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $540 and $558 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $485 and $495 million; other income between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.43 to $0.50 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.77 to $0.80 per share. ","For 2017, revenue of $2.57 billion to $2.6 billion, a growth rate of 6% to 7%. Keep in mind as you model 2017, that hardware sales add variability to revenue, driven by the timing of customer requirements and shipments. Other income between $0 and $4 million; A non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $1.92 to $2.06 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3.16 to $3.23 per share, high-single-digit growth when the modest dilution from Cigital and Codiscope is excluded; capital expenditures of about $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $500 million. ","To help in your modeling, we expect second half revenue to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter; total non-GAAP expenses to skew slightly toward the second half of the year; and second half non-GAAP EPS to be slightly higher than the first half, with Q2 the lowest EPS quarter.","In summary, we continue to evolve our company to maximize long-term shareholder value. Our active diversification and investment strategies are working. We delivered very solid growth in revenue and profitability, and significant cash flow in 2016. We returned $400 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks. And we made the appropriate investments to drive sustainable, high-single-digit, non-GAAP EPS growth. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Operator","Alright, are we ready for questions?","Trac Pham","We are.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Alright. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Krish Sankar. Please go ahead sir.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question, I had a few of them. Aart, number one, if I look at the annual backlog, it was down almost 2% year-over-year, even though the duration went up, can you just help us reconcile that? And then I have a few other questions.","Aart De Geus","Sure. Backlog is completely dependent on the timing of the very large deals, and given that we have a number of large customers that do multi-year deals, typically backlog will tend to go down until it goes back up. And so, from our perspective actually this turned out to be a very strong backlog year, and so we are very well on track with this.","Krish Sankar","Alright. And then the next one is, in terms of your Cigital and Codiscope acquisition, should we assume the revenue generated from that is roughly like $100 million for FY 2017? And along the same path, is this going to be similar to the Coverity from a few years ago where it\u2019s probably $0.10 dilutive the first year and then turns accretive like a year and a half down the road?","Trac Pham","Hi Krish, this is Trac. Yes, Coverity did do about a $100 million for this year as we had expected. As far as Cigital and Codiscope I would model that roughly at half that business, and although it\u2019s modestly dilutive to 2017, we do expect it to be accretive by second half of 2018.","Krish Sankar","Alright. And then, final question of my end is can you give us an update on how your digital landscape is shaping up, because one of your biggest competitors seems to have some pretty good wins or penetrations on the digital side, which has kind of been your strongest forte for several years. So, I want to find out what you guys are doing on that segment in trying to protect your market share. Thank you.","Aart De Geus","Well, in general the digit space is strong for us because the complexity that comes with chips with many more transistors and simultaneously fairly difficult to achieve performance and power objectives, demands the utilization of sophisticated tools, and this ranges by the way from the synthesis to the place & routes to older tools that are around that including of course all the verification tools as well.","So, in that space, we have seen very good results, it is very competitive at any point in time, but we are also seeing that our technology this year has really strengthened substantially. So, this has been a very strong year, especially second half and as we enter into 2017 we feel that we are in a good position.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. I just want to follow up on the backlog question. Aart, you said it was actually quite a strong year from a backlog perspective or presumably a bookings perspective, were you referring to sort of bookings run rate? Just wondered what you meant by that statement.","Aart De Geus","Well, our run rate is up periods, but when we look at bookings there is some years that have more, some years that have fewer large transactions and most of those are somewhat predictable in terms of their timing because of course they have on average about a three-year cycle, and so if in any given year, let\u2019s say for argument sake you have one or two larger transactions that were to happen at the same time that in that year you would see the backlog spike up substantially and then consequently in the next two years after that by a natural utilization of the backlog. If I can call it that, you would see a decline. And so, against that complete understanding of where these things are, our statement is we had a very good year and we are in a very solid position in terms of the backlog that we have enhanced for predictability for 2017 for example.","Rich Valera","Got it. So for the deals you did book this year that were scheduled to book, you were pleased with the run rates of those deals, but there's some large multi-year deals out there that obviously didn't happen in this year. Got it.","Aart De Geus","Yes. And were not intended to happen in 2016, right.","Rich Valera","Right. That makes sense. And then, with respect to hardware, you had a pretty high level of upfront revenue again this quarter relative to historical presumably driven by hardware. Still thinking about the model in the same way, that was sort of 10% or less is still the target model going forward?","Aart De Geus","Yes this is roughly the target model we are moving forward with. And 2016 was very strong in terms of hardware, and so you never quite know exactly when the hardware comes in because it tends to be lumpy, but there\u2019s no question that from a technology point of view we have any solid situation and there\u2019s also no question that fundamentally all kinds of acceleration techniques in hardware are necessary for many of the very complex hardware software products that are coming to market. So, I think it\u2019s going to continue to be a good area for all of the EDA vendors and specifically for us also.","Trac Pham","Hi Rich this is Trac, for modeling purposes you should feel comfortable that we will maintain the 90\/10 model.","Rich Valera","Got it that makes sense. And then, for emulation, I think a quarter ago you mentioned - with hardware in general, a quarter ago you had mentioned not to get maybe too excited about extrapolating the growth you were seeing in hardware this year into next year. I'm wondering what in the end you decided to bake into the fiscal 2017 guidance with respect to hardware. Can you give us any sense of how you're thinking about that business on a year-over-year basis as we move into 2017?","Aart De Geus","Yes, I think that we are not too excited at the beginning of the year apply to Synopsys pretty much every year. We are by nature cautious as we look forward, but at the same time we do not see any decreasing demand for the technology, and so it may be spiky from one year to another. But fundamentally, it's a good business that we expect to continue to see good results in.","Rich Valera","Got it. Thanks very much, gentlemen.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you, good evening. Aart, let me start with you with regard to the semiconductor consolidation effect and how that all played out over the last year or so. So, thinking back to a year, year and a half ago, you and your peers were quite apprehensive when that first wave of mergers were announced and you were quite concerned about what the adverse effects might be on EDA, and now as it turns out, it perhaps wasn't so adverse after all, at least not as much as you might have thought sometime back. So what didn't happen is the question, in terms of what you had originally been apprehensive about that turned out not to be the case. And to the extent there is further semi-consolidations that we're not quite done with that. Do you think that in the future, such consolidation might be the same, not so terrible after all kind of outcome?","Aart De Geus","Well you know, I would almost like to start with what did happen and I think this is a statement that\u2019s probably true for the entire EDA industry, we worked really hard in light of seeing this happen. On the side of what did not happen is there was certainly no slowdown from a technology point of view. And so as much as these consolidations to some degree are set-up to try to reduce the overall cost equation for these companies, more often than not rather than getting the cost reductions what they do is spend the money immediately on just doing more demanding products and taking advanced technologies because they still want to differentiate themselves. ","And so we\u2019re fortunate enough at Synopsys to be positioned very close to the leading edge. Those are people that with or without consolidation they want to be differentiated and that\u2019s how we balance things. In my preamble and I\u2019m sure I must have used the same words a number of times in earnings releases in the past, I would say well you know, a consolidation is momentarily a headwind, but in the long term these companies are morphing or merging because they want to attack a new market and there\u2019s no question that if you look at the overall high-tech horizon that electronics plus software combined in the next decade will have profound impact, how it manifests itself for these companies while that is precisely what they\u2019re raising towards. And so I think we are part of this race one way or another even if during a merger the mandates from the top 10 to be safe money. The mandates then pretty quickly shift to become more differentiated and that\u2019s where we are playing. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Would you be willing to speculate on what the possible competitive effects might be seeing potential - pending, rather, acquisition of Mentor. Is it simply a matter of a new, much larger owner pouring money into R&D and\/or sales that might incrementally make a competitive difference or how do you think about what the effects might ultimately be?","Aart De Geus","Yes, the word speculation is not really part of our vocabulary, I think in this context. I think the only positive is that this acquisition shows the value of EDA and I think hopefully it reflects well on all of us.","Jay Vleeschhouwer ","All right. Wrapping up for me on the technology side, it became increasingly apparent earlier this year that Synopsys was incrementally investing in design compiler. Well of course you\u2019ve always invested in it, but it looks like you were doing it incrementally. And to the extent that the synthesis market has been by and large sideways for the last number of years, what is it that you are aiming for with respect to the incremental investments in D.C? Do you think that there could be some new wave of growth at least for you in that part of the market?","Aart De Geus","I think if I look back at our - the entire history of Synopsys, which by the way in three weeks will be 30 years believe it or not, if there\u2019s one thing that we take some pride in is that for the vast majority 80%, 90% of our products we have in all these years always been at the state-of-the-art. ","Now to stay at the state-of-the-art when you have that rate of change underneath implies a continual rotation of investments from one product to the other and from time-to-time there are bigger steps in many situations it\u2019s just constant delivery of new capabilities and so this is true for our entire portfolio and that certainly includes the synthesis, it includes the timing, it includes the power optimizations, the place & route, etcetera, and so it should not be a surprise that we invest in these tools that are absolutely central to a modern digital design. ","I mean these are the type of tools that has made the Moore\u2019s Law possible from a design perspective. And with our third decade finishing or not, the fourth decade is absolutely aimed at technology leadership and driving the state-of-the-art and making it possible again. So, we will continue to invest at a strong clip in R&D because that is how we have been successful as a company.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks Aart.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line the Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Thanks, hi guys. Let me approach the question this way. With the upfront becoming bigger each quarter through the year, positive comments around what hardware did for you this year, positive comments about IC Compiler II, it would seem like it leaves the rest of the core EDA software portfolio as the area that softened in terms of growth year-over-year. Is that the case, and what areas do you think you have the potential to turn in fiscal 2017?","Aart De Geus","Well you know, for a start 2016 of course was very strong from an hardware point of view so that may balance how one looks at different products a little bit differently. And then individual products themselves go through waves of being more central to the renewal of agreements or not. In general though I would say that we have a really well balanced product portfolio because with a very strong position in the core EDA that is central really the continuation of advanced chip design and system design, around that the verification is reaching into the software, the design tools are reaching deep down into the physics of silicon and the software itself is now an area that is seeing good investments.","And so we very much look at the core EDA as one of the key things that is enabling yet another business, which is the IP business. And so when you look at it more as a portfolio at any point in time the balance shifts a little bit because one technology sort of enables the other. ","Finally, you are looking back at 2016. This was a year where we can literally say and this is as much an aim that the internal team see as any area is that every one of our businesses did very well. And any given year some do better than others. This year we had across the board very good success.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then on the acquisitions, if I heard the answers from the first questions correctly, it sounds like we should assume roughly $50 million in contributions for fiscal 2017 versus the $100 million that they did finishing up the year. Can you walk us through the accounting impacts in terms of the write offs, should that bounce back immediately to the $100 million level when we get to fiscal 2018?","Trac Pham","I don't think we were operating at that level to begin with, but yes, first of all you are right, it should be in that range after the Coverity business, the impact of that is a combination of the deferred haircut and the integration of the business over the next 10 months.","Sterling Auty","And how should that - is that something that we should see a gradual ramp through the year or up front loaded or hockey stick, as we\u2019re layering this in the context of the guidance.","Trac Pham","I would model it more of a gradual rent throughout the year.","Sterling Auty","Okay, thank you.","Trac Pham","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead sir.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking the questions. My first question is on the operating margin, in the past you've talked about operating margin improvement to 25% range over time. And just along the same line, if I think about your operating margin and include stock-based comp in there, you're operating at about a 20% operating margin. If I look at semiconductor industry and new customers in general, they're about 25% to 45% operating margin. I guess like EDA is a pretty consolidated space, so why aren't the operating margins higher and why aren't you aspiring for higher operating margins in general?","Trac Pham","No, we are aspiring for higher operating margins and we remain committed to driving margins through the mid-20s. As you are looking at this 2017 guidance and you separate out this Cigital and Codiscope impact, we would have grown margins very healthy from 2016 to 2017. Now the factoring in the dilution impact of that we\u2019re going to see it roughly flat year-over-year, but the underlying health of the business is good and we are growing margins there.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it, thank you. And did you get a crate like how much is the total net impact to the EPS from the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions?","Trac Pham ","A modest impact to EPS.","Farhan Ahmad","Is it like $0.10, $0.05, any color on the level of impact?","Trac Pham ","Modest impact to EPS.","Farhan Ahmad","Okay.","Trac Pham ","I would say that due to something to keep in mind is that net of that impact we would have been growing EPS in the high single digits.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. Than I had question on custom compiler, you talked about some of the strong momentum in that area. How do you see that product growing and is that a growth driver for you over time and how it can become.","Aart De Geus","Yes it is a growth driver over time, but it starts from a very small base and the company right now round numbers is sort of at that 2.5 billion and so an individual small product does not have the impact to change with the overall revenue line really is markedly impacted. Nonetheless, it is an area that we\u2019re gaining strength in that before we didn't have. And this is especially true in the conjunction with an outstanding analog mixed signal and custom verification set of tools and specifically in the area of FinFET and so we have good hopes actually for some really good results in 2017.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you, that's all I had.","Aart De Geus","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. Quick question on the software security side of the business, so following the two acquisitions, do you feel as though you're at critical mass today or are there pieces or scale that you still need? ","Aart De Geus","It does feel like we are heading towards some degree of critical mass and we are driving the business now towards profitability after the delusion issues that we will be passing and the reason I think we are starting to have critical mass is because we are seeing the deals that we are making grow in magnitude and the number of large deals is growing from quarter-to-quarter, but just as important from an operational point of view is, I think our sales team is now delivering significantly on their own projections, and that sounds like a trivial thing, but it\u2019s actually not. ","It is that we are increasingly on top of the market segment where we know what we are doing and where there is demand that is growing. Now having said that and you all know this, the word security occurs in so many different dimensions, and of course this is a world market with a much larger number of potential users than what we would have seen in EDA, initially of course at much smaller transactions sizes, but in a set of verticals that we have never touched in the past. ","And so just to highlight one aspect of Cigital is they are particularly strong in the financial market, and that is a market that\u2019s while we had a number of successors in the past they were sort of, I don't want to say accidental, but they were not systematic to say the least. This changes that immediately and moreover because of the service nature and because of their ability to help do diagnosis at a higher level in a company of the general readiness for security, I think it gives us an entry point with the CIOs and CTOs of companies that we didn't have before. And so all of these pieces combined as we integrate them, I think we will start to feel like increasingly a critical mass and it\u2019s a word that I like myself quite well.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And when you look into going into verticals like the automotive world, what is the long term business model look like there? Is it consulting, is it licenses is it royalty-based?","Aart De Geus ","Are you talking for security or in general?","Tom Diffely","For security.","Aart De Geus ","Well I think it is will be in many cases the entry point tends to be a bit random because companies are random in terms of how they certainly are dealing with security although if you look at automotive, ever since about 15, 18 months ago you may recall the jeep was hacked. That sent a shiver for the automotive industry that had for literally decades done an extremely good job at driving the engineering to be on top of safety. Well, overnight the software part became the Achilles' heel of safety and therefore very much top-down from those companies all the way from their boards got the mandate off we have to deal with this. ","And this is precisely why the service business is helpful because if you get a mandate top-down in the company let\u2019s say from the board of directors go deal with it first thing you need to do is to have sort of an assessment so where are you, and this is where Cigital has another key asset, which is over many years they developed a mechanism to assess in a number of dimensions the degree of security preparedness of companies. ","And so that is a perfect entry point and that so-called v-sim maturity model can be used to then drive the dialogue to what should be the action taken and hopefully in those action rightfully so there would be a number of interactions with us on our products or additional services. So that is why I think all these pieces gradually fall into place, but it\u2019s in new market and so there is a lot of learning and where there is lot of enthusiasm about what we close today.","Tom Diffely","Okay great. And then quickly on the consolidation of the customer base, so if you look back to 2016 as a whole, do you think there was an impact at all from consolidation on your results?","Aart De Geus ","Well it\u2019s hard to say it didn't have impacts and it\u2019s hard to point exactly at what the impact is because as I said earlier whenever two companies consolidate within three minutes later it is, while we have to save money to pay for the premium that we just gave out. And you know consolidation is fundamentally either a move towards efficiency, strict economic efficiency, or it is a move towards and that\u2019s why I like these words critical mass horizontally be bigger in a market and therefore another way to be efficient or it is move towards vertical critical mass meaning heading towards verticals that before company couldn't reach or with the value proposition is moving up to stack.","And so as companies navigate through just the hard practical integration and money saving phase, very quickly they end at what is it that they want to accomplish and not that means immediately money spending, but it certainly means immediately helping with differentiation. And that\u2019s why as much as these transitions initially are a headwind we've navigated recently well through them, I would say.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg ","Thanks for taking my question. Trac listed on the CFO last year cash from operations was $587 million, you are guiding $500 million this year, shouldn't cash from operations grow in line with operating income?","Trac Pham","Yes over time you should model you should assume that cash from operations should track EBITDA less cash taxes, but as we said in the past it will vary from year-to-year. 500 million we think is still a very healthy level of cash flow for the year. Keep in mind when we entered 2016 we guided to about 500 million and we over achieved that by over $80 million. So the comparison is a little bit tough year-over-year. The second thing to keep in mind is that we think there is roughly $30 million headwind on cash flows this year as a result of the dilutions and cash outflows related to the acquisitions, and then timing of some early payments that shifted from one quarter to next, or year to next.","Monika Garg ","Okay. Excluding these two acquisitions you just announced, how big is software security segment for you and excluding these two, is it possible now?","Trac Pham ","Coverity did end up close to where we expected to end up at 100 million, it was modestly dilutive as a result of some of the acquisitions that we made earlier this year, but it\u2019s trending very well in terms of growth and profitability. The Cigital, I think you asked for the side, Cigital and Codiscope is about half of that business.","Monika Garg ","Got it. Then if I look at IP and systems segment, grew 17% year-over-year, could you maybe split the growth between IP and systems in it?","Trac Pham ","No we won't split that out, but roughly the growth in those businesses are in line with the models that we previously communicated. And in general, I would add that both areas are doing very well and the IP business in particular saw a very, very good growth this year largely because complexity demands alternatives to design in one of the key alternatives is to buy those blocks that you can get on the market and that are cost efficient and while at the same time being super high performance and low power. And that is exactly the collection of IP that we have.","Monika Garg ","Got it. Last one on the emulation you said, it was the fastest growth in the industry cadence, also had a very strong year. Could you maybe talk about what was the growth for your business and emulation, how big is that now?","Aart De Geus","We are well aware of that the overall industry I think is doing very well in emulation, and the reason for that are in some way straightforward, which is the complexity of the chips for those people that provide emulation more on the silicon verification side or the sheer amount in complexity of the software for those people that are maybe more focused on the software side or those that are working in between the hardware and software in all three cases is up substantially. And I don't have to tell you that the value of over the cost of not getting to market on time because the hardware and the software done don't quite work together, it is extremely detrimental. Therefore, I expect that the investments in this area will continue and it\u2019s a very competitive market, but speaking up for Synopsys, I think we are well positioned.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the next question over to Gary Mobely with Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobely","Hi everyone thanks for taking my question. Most of the questions have been asked and answered, but I did have a question about the value of M&A during 2016. I know in the past you disclosed that. I'm not sure if it was in the 10-K filing, or if it is in your supplemental materials published today, but could you share with us what the total dollar amount paid for M&A was in 2016?","Aart De Geus ","Well normally we don't disclose it unless it is material to the overall results. Relatively speaking it was not a super high year of M&A and maybe the best is if we get back to you later because we don't have the numbers in front of us actually.","Gary Mobely","Fair enough. I don't know if this is the right venue to delve into the topic deeply, but could you maybe give a quick overview on your opinion and your assessment of the likelihood of some of the proposed accounting changes in the revenue recognition issues as it impacts Synopsys?","Trac Pham","Hi Gary. So we\u2019ve been actively working on that over the last few years and right now we are fairly confident that we should be able to maintain the rate of a model for our business. There is obviously some details remaining to work that out and actually the implementation of that is going to be fairly complex, but for the most part we are confident that we should sustain the model.","Gary Mobely","Okay. Last question for me, the upfront licensing cost - I'm sorry, upfront licensing revenue that showed up as well in the IP systems and software integrity group and as well showed up in your accounts receivable with the spike there. And so, I was wondering if there were any other factors that drove up the spike in upfront besides emulation? Did you see maybe perhaps spike in IP licensing or maybe a large software integrity license deal?","Trac Pham","Yes the upfront, the strong upfront in Q4 were functioning both hardware and IP that was recognized on a perpetual basis or up fronts.","Gary Mobely","Alright. That is it from me. I appreciate you taking the questions, thanks everyone.","Trac Pham","Gary just a follow-up to your earlier question, the cash outflow for M&A was about 60 million for 2016.","Gary Mobely","Alright. Thank you.","Aart De Geus","I guess we are arriving\u2026sorry.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves.","Unidentified Analyst ","Sorry, quick one and thanks for letting me get on here. So for the revenue guidance you guys are talking about 2,585 [ph] kind of is the midpoint, that implies 4.5% growth if I take out the $50 million. So can you mirror that with your comment about mid single digit growth in Cordier, and then double digits in the IP and systems piece, because I think that would be north of around that 4.5% mark organically.","Aart De Geus ","Obviously there is always variability from year-to-year, remember that in 2016 we had a very strong hardware year and that is quite lumpy, so for your earlier question we want to be a bit conservative given that these things are very hard to predict. But fundamentally, I think we feel ourselves that we are coming into 2017 in a stronger position than we enter 2016. And so now of course the proof is in the putting and there is a lot of work to be done, but that sort of is the way it feels to us right now.","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay, got it thank you.","Aart De Geus ","You're welcome. Well I think we have reached the turn of the hour. So I would like to thank all of you for not only attending this earnings release, but for closing yet another year. We are thankful that we had a strong year, we are thankful to our employees, our customers, our partners, but also to you for following us and reporting on our endeavors. We are heading into 2016, 2017 with a good confidence and a lot of exciting things to do. And so we hope to have you on the next earnings call, sometime next year. Thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you again for using the AT&T executive teleconference service.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and then later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.","In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in today\u2019s earnings press release, financial supplement, and 8-K.","Also included in the financial supplement is detailed information around our long-term financial objective, our transition to ASC 606 and newly disclosed results by segments. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn it over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. Revenue was a record $820 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08, both above our target ranges. Strength was across all product groups, including some large, expanded renewals with cornerstone semiconductor companies. We are confident in our outlook for the year, and are reaffirming our guidance.","Please note that this is the first quarter we are reporting two segments: Semiconductor & System Design, and Software Integrity. In Semiconductor & System Design, results exceeded plan, with strength across the board, augmented by timing of customer shipments. In Software Integrity, revenue was right on plan, and operating margin continued to move towards sustainable profitability, as we build for the long-term in this high-growth space. ","Trac will discuss the financials in more detail. Looking at the overall landscape, solid demand for our solutions has continued into 2019, notwithstanding the somewhat increased uncertainty in the market. While the global narrative focuses on geo-political realities, electronics companies continue to design ever-more-complex chips and devices at an unabated speed.","One notable driver, of course, is artificial intelligence. The development and proliferation of AI-dedicated chips brings great potential for us, as the number of customers and designs is growing quickly. Competition among AI-specific company is fierce, and indeed for anyone incorporating AI into their chips, with an intense race to market and a broad set of competing architectures.","In addition, we\u2019re seeing an escalation of the security challenges in highly interconnected systems loaded with software. This is in part driven by the proliferation of data-intensive IoT devices, and the emerging 5G connectivity standard, among other applications. The power of AI and the risks of security breaches require attention for all the products we use every day. From cars to mobile phones to smart homes to medical devices.","Synopsys provides key technology in the midst of this evolving picture. Our results and outlook are not in spite of these challenges, but rather because of them. Our innovation and technologies become even more valuable to our customers when the stakes are so high. This is evident throughout our business: Our penetration in new and growing AI chip companies has been excellent, and this growth has been visible across our product groups.","In EDA, our fusion technology and platform roll-out is progressing well, and reports show increasingly strong results. IP also continued on a positive path, helped by a particularly strong competitive win rate as we deliver sophisticated building blocks in more and more difficult advanced nodes and challenging verticals.","On top of this, our Software Integrity business continues to broaden its customer base and software security is increasingly recognized as a \u2018must have\u2019 in this era of product development.","With that, let me share some product highlights, starting with EDA. At the leading edge of technology, we continue to see a steady push towards smaller geometries, as Synopsys continues to be the pioneer and the relied-upon supplier for well over 90% of 12 nanometer and below designs, all the way down to 5, 3 and 2 nanometer research and development.","A particularly noteworthy accomplishment was the tape-out of the industry\u2019s first chip using next generation Gate-All-Around transistors. This highly advanced tape-out is the result of an extensive collaboration with Samsung, using a full Fusion Design Platform flow, from synthesis to place & route to signoff. Even at the earliest stages of process development, our unique position at the roots of silicon helps advance the most difficult research.","The latest example of this is the recently announced collaborations with LTAB and IMTAB, important industry innovators to drive modeling standards to 2 nanometer and beyond. Meanwhile our breakthrough Fusion Design Platform continued to make great strides and generated strong results in Q1. You may recall that in November, we introduced not only our next-generation synthesizer, Design Compiler NXT, but also a game-changing new product called Fusion Compiler.","Fusion Compiler, which is architected on a unified data model, is the only system on the market that integrates synthesis and place & route and all the key elements of our gold-standard signoff technology. We accomplished this through a novel way of sharing code among the different functions, thus eliminating the need to move between tools. The value to the customer is better chip results such as size, speed, and power, in shorter and more predictable design time.","After just one quarter on the market, we\u2019re seeing high initial demand, and have rapidly grown the number of active customers, including many of the top 10 SoC design houses. Fusion Compiler was also recognized with a World Electronics Achievement award for product of the year. When we pioneered the fusion concept, our aspiration was to build a platform upon which we could roll out new differentiating capabilities for years to come. Stay tuned as we deliver even more exciting advances over the next 12 months.","Now to verification, where our platform vision and technology execution have yielded excellent business and market share growth. Increasing chip and system complexity means huge verification challenges, in terms of both speed and time-to-market. In addition, the growing desire to run software on top of systems that are still in construction is taxing the state of the art of simulation, emulation, and prototyping.","Synopsys is at the forefront of enabling this to happen, across software simulation, emulation, FPGA-based and virtual prototyping. Our Verification Continuum platform continues to drive excellent demand and competitive wins. This quarter, we saw particularly strong growth in software-based verification at both traditional semiconductor companies and emerging system companies focused on their own in-house design.","In emulation, revenue growth has been significant over the past two years, driven by a steadily expanding number of customers and average run rate. While hardware revenue is quite variable from period-to-period, driven by the timing and magnitude of specific orders, it\u2019s clear that strong industry demand continues.","Our newly launched ZeBu Server 4 product, the fastest, largest-capacity emulator in the market is generating broad-based adoption by customers designing storage, networking and AI chips, as well as a large, global systems powerhouse. Orders for our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping solution were strong, particularly in 5G and automotive verticals. We\u2019re also seeing very promising progress with virtual prototyping in the automotive vertical benefitting semiconductor, Tier 1, and OEM customers.","Verification is an example of a capability that works well on the cloud. While we\u2019ve hosted tools on our own cloud for years, including our ZeBu emulation system, we\u2019re continuing to make good progress tuning our solutions for cloud optimization. Interest is high. We have many customers who use their own or public clouds, some who are already working directly with us, and many others in proof-of-concept stages to see what structures may best work for them.","Now moving to our IP products. We continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth, with strength across the board, particularly in AI and automotive. Our AI-related differentiation was readily apparent in Q1, with wins from several very notable AI start-ups. As an example, Israel\u2019s Habana Labs achieved first-pass silicon success on its high-performance AI-processor-SoC using our PCI Express 4.0 IP.","In automotive, we had a number of major global wins, including AI automotive startup FABU, which selected a broad portfolio of Synopsys automotive-certified IP. Over the past 12 months, we licensed IP to more than 25 leading automotive semiconductor suppliers covering a range of applications such as autonomous driving, infotainment, and connectivity gateways.","Now to our Software Integrity group, which provides products and services to address code quality and security vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle. Over the last five years, we\u2019ve systematically scaled this business, and expect it to reach 10% of total Synopsys revenue for fiscal 2019. ","Our investments in this high-growth market also substantially diversify our customer base into verticals such as financial services and medical, expand our reach in automotive, and increase our business with our well-established electronics customers.","While the need for enhanced security measures has clearly increased, companies still struggle to develop effective strategies on how to get there, given the immense scope of the challenge.","One example is automotive, arguably one of the most vulnerable industries due to the heavy toll that breaches can cause.","A recent survey of global automotive manufacturers and suppliers found that 84% of automotive professionals have concerns that their organizations' cybersecurity practices are not keeping pace with evolving technologies; and that most of them test less than half of the technology they develop for security vulnerabilities.","Bolstered by the acquisition of Black Duck, which was fully integrated in Q1, we offer by far the most comprehensive portfolio of products and services in the market today to help companies solve these challenges. And we\u2019re not standing still.","We\u2019re on track this year to deliver our integrated Software Integrity platform, which will enable both software developers and management to build essential security and quality checks into their software development lifecycle. Stay tuned for an announcement soon.","In closing, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent financial results, and are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2019. Even with some caution around global markets, electronics companies continue to invest in critical chip and system designs, as well as immense amounts of sophisticated software.","We are confident in both our near-term execution and our long-term prospects given our position in the market. We are committed and well on-track towards our mid and long-term growth and margin expansion targets. With that, let me thank our customers for their business and our employees for their dedication and hard work in delivering yet another strong quarter.","Trac will now highlight the financial perspective.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 was a great start to the year. Our financial results met or exceeded our targets in all key metrics, as we continue to execute well across the board. Beginning with this quarter, we are also initiating segment reporting for Synopsys. The investment we made five years ago in Software Integrity has reached critical mass and grown to approximately 10% of sales.","Reporting this segment separately allows us to better highlight the strengths of the two businesses we\u2019re building within and beyond our traditional semiconductor vertical. Our increasingly diverse customer base and our strong product portfolio, combined with our nearly 90% recurring revenue model, positions us well for success in periods of high demand, as well as those of greater uncertainty.","Reflecting this dynamic, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year. Before I begin with the first quarter results, I want to remind everyone that Synopsys adopted ASC Topic 606, the new accounting standard for revenue recognition, beginning in fiscal 2019. All results I provide today will be under ASC 606. For a summary of these results, as well as equivalent financial metrics under ASC 605, please refer to our financial supplement.","Now to the numbers. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise specified. We generated total revenue of 820 million, a 7% increase over Q1 of last year, which included an extra week. Our growth reflects both strong demand and timing of customer shipments. Recall that ASC 606 creates additional quarterly revenue variability.","Trailing 12-month revenue growth was strong across all product groups and geographies. These results reflect both the depth and breadth of our product portfolio, the increasing diversity of our customer base, and the impact of the investments we\u2019ve made to drive long-term growth. Our contracted, but unsatisfied performance obligations or backlog, at the end of the quarter totaled $4.3 billion. ","Turning to our segments, Semiconductor & System Design revenue was 738 million, up 5% year-over-year or just over 11%, excluding the extra week in 2018. Software Integrity revenue grew 29% to 82 million, reaching approximately 10% of total revenue in the first quarter. Software Integrity revenue for the trailing 12-months was $299 million, reflecting a strong leadership position in the application security market.","Moving to expenses, total GAAP costs and expenses were $673 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $619 million and consolidated non-GAAP operating margin was 24.5%. For the quarter, Semiconductor & System Design delivered an adjusted operating margin of 26.5%, while Software Integrity delivered an adjusted operating margin of 6.8%.","Certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level, have not been allocated to our segments. These items are described in further detail in our Financial Supplement.","Operating margin will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, due to normal variability of revenue and expenses. ASC 606 can further amplify this quarterly variance within a given year. For this reason, I want to reiterate that we manage the business with a strong emphasis on full-year and multi-year performance. We are on-track to achieve our margin objective for the year, while driving towards our long-term goal of 26% in 2021, and high-20s longer-term.","To wrap up the income statement, GAAP earnings per share were $1.01. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08. Turning to cash, operating cash outflow was 144 million, reflecting our typical payout of variable compensation in Q1. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $592 million, and total debt of $542 million.","Building on last year\u2019s significant share repurchases of $400 million, we repurchased $29 million of our stock in Q1. Since 2016, we\u2019ve returned more than $1.2 billion to shareholders, and expect buybacks to remain an important piece of our capital allocation strategy.","Moving on to guidance. We remain confident in our outlook for the year and are reaffirming our annual targets. Our targets are based on ASC 606 revenue recognition rules. For the second quarter, we expect revenue between $810 and $850 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $682 and $708 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $620 and $640 million; other income and expense between $0 million and $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.71 to $0.79 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.07 to $1.12 per share.","For 2019, the full-year targets are: revenue of $3.29 billion to $3.34 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.76 billion and $2.79 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.52 and $2.54 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of just over 23.5%; other income and expense between minus $13 million and minus $9 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $3.19 to $3.32 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.20 to $4.27 per share; cash flow from operations of approximately $700 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $270 million, which includes the buildout of our China facility, as well as the relocation of some Silicon Valley offices. We continue to expect CapEx to drop roughly in half in 2020.","To wrap up, we executed very well in Q1 and we are reaffirming our guidance for the full-year. Company-wide, we are delivering robust revenue growth and driving profitability toward our long-term margin objectives. Both of our operating segments performed well and our new segment reporting will provide investors with greater transparency into these results.","Finally, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, investing in the business while continuing to return capital to our shareholders as we focus on driving sustainable, long-term value.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Aart, you mentioned a couple of times in your prepared remarks about the uncertain macro environment and a couple of questions on that, first is, has that any changed from last quarter you reported? And secondly, have you seen this uncertain macro impact your business in anyway at this point, I guess particularly on the hardware side, which might be more susceptible to that kind of pressure?","Aart de Geus","Thanks Rich. Good question. It's always difficult to say if there's a big difference from one quarter to another because these quarters flow from one to the other in somewhat not distinct fashion. The way I would answer it, it has had no impact on our business. I do think \u2013 I do see that some of the reports looking at the forward look and the predictions for 2019 were a little softer than before, but they are also now a little bit better informed.","And so, this pertains to really the chip volume business more than anything else. So, it doesn\u2019t really touch us as the design starts and the design difficulty have continued to grow. As we have been in the past, while we are not immune completely to the ups and downs of the semiconductor industry, we are relatively touched lightly and we\u2019re actually typically a safe haven during those times.","Rich Valera","I appreciate that. And then Trac, lots of nice new disclosure, couple of things. One the backlog which you gave the 4.3 billion, is that something you\u2019re going to discuss more regularly? I\u2019ve never heard you give a backlog number, not at a \u2013 at the end of the year, so just wondering why give that now and then should we expect to be getting the operating margins of the two business segments on a go forward basis, while that you are now breaking out that software integrity for both revenue and presumably operating margins?","Trac Pham","Hi, Rich. On the first question on backlog, we thought it was important to highlight backlog starting this year because as part of the 606 transition we will be including that and disclosing that in our 10-Q, so yes you will see that on a quarterly basis. With regards to the segment reporting, going forward as part of segment reporting we will provide both revenue and operating margin for both those segments.","Rich Valera","Great, definitely appreciate that disclosure. Keep up the good work. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from Mitchell Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitchell Steves","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and thanks for all the new disclosures here. So just, first, kind of on the revenue line, I know you guys already gave out a guidance, but this is kind of the third-year straight where you're talking about a [2H deceleration], and that hasn't happened in the last couple of years. So, I guess, instead of me asking about the conservatism, what's kind of embedded in 2H in terms of the guidance?","Trac Pham","Mitch, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it that way. We actually had a great start to the year with Q1 and given our outlook for Q2. To us the latest [indiscernible] forecast than we entered the year and frankly from that perspective, I'm feeling optimistic and more confident in the outlook that we have, that\u2019s why we reaffirm the guidance for the full-year.","Mitchell Steves","Got it. And then the second one is on the cash flows. If I heard that correctly, you said that the CapEx should come down in half. Does that kind of give you an implied, like I guess, $900 million plus in cash flow for 2020?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s too early to guide on 2020 at this point. We just wanted to give an indication that the CapEx spend for this year is unusually high because of the few items that we highlighted.","Mitchell Steves","Okay. Got it. And then just last one, just on the Software Integrity margins. So, I think there's kind of a bull case here, where that's going to be higher than your corporate average long-term. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be the case if I look out 5 or 10 years?","Trac Pham","We don't want to draw out that far, I guess let me abstract that first at the highest level. We are committed to 26% operating margins in 2021. We will be driving improvements across all areas both on \u2013 in both segments and across all areas of the business. So, you should see improvements there. At this point, we\u2019re pleased to see off the quarter with profitability in software integrity, but it\u2019s a new market for us that\u2019s growing and we\u2019ll continue to invest in building up the software integrity platform, as well as scaling up that business, so it will be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but I think long-term the trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last five years should continue.","Mitchell Steves","Okay, perfect. Great quarter guys.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","And we go next to Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","Great, thanks. Hi, guys. This is actually Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking our questions.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Jackson Ader","First one, there\u2019s been something on investors\u2019 minds today, I guess since last night, Cadence announced a significant new win with a marquee North American semiconductor company. And so, based on their description, it has led to some investors concluding that that company that they mentioned last night maybe Intel. Since Intel is your largest customer, do you have any comment on what\u2019s happening there? Any share shifts that you may be seeing?","Aart de Geus","We never comment about individual customers and Intel has definitely been a very good partnering customer to us and in general it sounds like both companies have done extremely well recently and I hope that bodes well for the overall markets. So, yes, we do compete in many places, but at the same time our objectives are to do well and I think we just did that this quarter.","Jackson Ader","Okay, alright, fair enough. And then a quick follow-up, was there any maybe buying behavior, particularly in the emulation space that maybe drove some budget flush spending around the calendar year-end in December where you maybe saw some pull-forward of Emulation purchases?","Aart de Geus","No, we didn\u2019t see any of that. And a number of people have asked us that question also in the context of China and we didn\u2019t really see that. And so, I think we\u2019re seeing Q1 as just a continuation of now quite a number of good quarters and of a business that is both diversified, well-balanced and growing well.","Jackson Ader","Okay. Alright. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Monica Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monica Garg","Thanks for taking my questions. Firs, I mean you have a very strong beat in Q1 revenue by 20 million almost, EPS $0.10, I guess why the upside not flowing to early guidance both for revenue and EPS?","Trac Pham","Monica, this is Trac. As I said earlier, it\u2019s a good start for the year. The results were a combination of us executing very well and growing the business. Some of it is timing in terms of customer deliveries, so in fact there is a lot of business left to book for the full-year. We feel good about the outlook and it\u2019s nice to have the first half look pretty secure.","Monica Garg","Got it, and then I think last quarter or before that you said that you have a leadership position in Emulation, could you maybe see if that still holds through?","Aart de Geus","Well our Emulation has done extremely well and this is a domain that \u2013 and this is I think good news for many that continues to grow well because the demand around very difficult problems for Emulation as acceleration to simulation is high. In addition, Synopsis has focused on a special case that is extremely important, which is can you run software on hardware that doesn\u2019t quite exit yet, i.e., hardware that you mock up and emulate, and the answer is yes. And more and more customers report that that is absolutely crucial because more often than not when a product is ready, the software is not and you cannot go to market, and that is why our area has done particularly well. And while these numbers are not individually disclosed, we are certainly convinced that we are the market leader in this area.","Monica Garg","Right. Then Aart you provided some commentary regarding the verification usage in cloud, but maybe could you talk about how ready you think Synopsis solutions are for usage in the Cloud, are you seeing interest from \u2013 not only from verification for other product as well?","Aart de Geus","Let me go backwards on the question. The answer is yes. There are number of other tools that are also used in the Cloud, typically things that require or can benefit from big bursts of competition where a user may not want to buy their own computers just for the burst period, and so these type of tools tend to be optimized little bit differently, so that they can run more easily in a public clouds or various forms of private cloud. And so, there\u2019s quite a bit of interest in that.","I don\u2019t think that things are completely back and white though, meaning that there are a lot of practical issues that have to be overcome to make things run very well and there are steady advances on making the various forms of software do that effectively, so that customers can essentially have a more flexible spending on hardware when they want it.","Monica Garg","Alright, thank you so much.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. I guess first Trac, I was wondering if any of the strength you saw in the quarter was driven by concerns at maybe there would be a worsening of the trade war and some of the customers wanted to buy ahead of that.","Trac Pham","We haven\u2019t seen a change in behavior of having that affect our revenues. As I said, it\u2019s pretty balanced in terms of growth, as well as to a lesser degree, timing of customer contracts.","Tom Diffely","Okay, then maybe just a big picture question for Aart. How do you look at the EDA growth when you have a slowing of Moore\u2019s Law, but then you have an increasing of the use of new materials and technologies along the way? I mean, unbalanced, does that scenario provide growth for EDA or stability, how do you look at that?","Aart de Geus","You know, it almost feels like a question that you could have asked in 1997 and 2007, and again, and I don't want to sidestep at all the fact that the complexity of Moore\u2019s Law is increasing and the complexity itself is good for us, but with the complexity of course comes an economic equation that will over time bring some changes for customers and so at this point in time though, the demand for really advanced chips is quite strong and that I have illuminated many times by saying that we have entered a whole new phase of what electronics can do in most products and actually in most verticals and that is the age of condition or artificial intelligence, where the early results and have to be called early because they are literally just three or four years old now are very promising, but the demand for dramatically more computation is unabated.","And so, I think the push will continue and the challenges that continue with it and I think for a company such as ourselves that\u2019s a good thing, because that is our specialty. By the way, this reaches all the way down to the deep physics of Moore\u2019s Law where we do excellent business in providing simulation tools that allow to check out how a brand-new transistor such as let\u2019s say the gate-all-around type models, will function before even manufacture them. So, the food chain of Moore\u2019s Law is actually pretty long.","Tom Diffely","But maybe just bring the food chain down a little further or maybe up little further, if you look at it down to packaging taken over some of the increases in more than Moore\u2019s Law if you will, how does that benefit you from an EDA company and is it meaningful?","Aart de Geus","Excellent question because this is a question that has actually also has sort of ups and downs multiple times in the last couple of decades, every time there was sort of a hint that Moore\u2019s law was coming to an abrupt end, the solution was well instead of putting things in one chip let\u2019s put into to multiple chips, maybe stack those chips on top of each other and the technologies have actually advanced substantially to make that possible, but they are not simple in their own right, meaning that if you can still put it in one chip that is often easier both economically and technically.","Having said that, yes there is progress in various forms of packaging and stacking of chips and we think that that will continue to grow over the years to come and there too a sophisticated EDA tool such as ours will be absolutely necessary to do that. So, it sounds like these are very different things, but from my perspective it\u2019s just a continuation of whatever is the best method to deliver a lot of functionality electronically, we will be full focused on.","Tom Diffely","Okay, great, thanks for your time.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you Aart. Let me start with you regarding SIG and then a backlog question for Trac. So, anticipation of the SIG platform that you have been alluding to, could you talk about what the customer behavior looks like thus far with regard to both the mix of SIG tools that they are buying and services engagements that you\u2019re providing or undertaking for SIG? So, in the case of the product for example, are customers buying multiple solutions are they buying not just Coverity, not just the Duck, but multiple products, and then with regard to the services, would you regard those as leading coincident or lagging indicators for the SIG business and light the platform perhaps mitigate how services intensive that business might be and therefore up margins over time?","Aart De Geus","That\u2019s an excellent question because we of course entered this market as it was just coming about, it\u2019s a highly in development market, there are many different point solutions. And we were fortunate enough to acquire, I believe some of the very best ones. Why do I describe it in that fashion because if you are sitting on the user side, you may have specific problems for which you buy a very specific point tool and may be happy with that? If you are sitting a little bit closer to the IT management of a company that has many users, this is a horror scenario, because now you have all these point tools from all these individual, often small companies, often companies that do not have longevity in being able to support you, may disappear or may get acquired.","And so, we noticed already now, I would say a couple of years ago that the number of companies were positively surprised when they found out that of some of the point tools, we had acquired behind that was a company like Synopsis that were actually substantial had a long history and therefore was probably stable. If you now amend that by the fact that a platform really is a mechanism to bring multiple point tools together to make them look and feel the same, be able to share data between the tools have reports that can both work for the individual user, but also for the management to get good overview, you can see how at a minimum this brings a simplification for the people that have to manage the utilization of all of this in large companies, often companies where their core competence is not the software, but they are highly dependent on some sets of software that need to secured and high quality. ","In that context, the service question is extremely appropriate. We have said, when we acquired it that initially it would give us access to precisely the higher-level management that needed help in plotting their strategies on how to go about security strategy around the software. And in that sense, that would be in your leading category.","Meanwhile, there's a number of services that we provide where on a regular basis, we do certain checks for customers that would be in the coincidental category. And then if there are issues that pop up at a customer, that only they don't know what to do there that would be lagging, but we certainly can provide help in a situation where suddenly an urgency comes up.","So, maybe summarizing this somewhat long monologue here is that we have a number of puzzle pieces that are now being put together and out of that I think comes both a stronger position for us, a more effective utilization on the part of the customer and the opportunity to continually add incremental value to the platform.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","For Trac, you grew your backlog \u2013 and thank you for that Aart. That was good explanation. For Trac, you grew your backlog a quarter, by the amount that you grew your backlog for all of fiscal 2018 about $300 million. So, assuming the usual three-year runoff or conversion that isn't translating into any incremental revenues relative to guidance for this year?","Trac Pham","Look, Jay we don't want to comment on how to extrapolate the backlog. We're going to disclose that so you will see that trend over time. But given that we will have different contracts renew at different points in time I think it's too \u2013 it would be too difficult to really translate that to the health of the business. Overall, I think we'll continue to refer you back to run rate growth in the business and look at that trend. And that tends to be \u2013 that has been up.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Thank you, Jay.","Operator","We have a question from Josh Tilton with Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","JoshTilton","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Have you seen increased stickiness with customers as the Fusion offering integrates many steps of the design flow that may have been accomplished with numerous products in the past?","Aart de Geus","It is too early to be able to check on stickiness because that is by definition something over a long period of time. But the expectation would be absolutely yes, meaning that, one of the key reasons customers will use this is because on a number of cases they will get better results, they will get the better results in a more predictable fashion and in a shorter amount of time.","And so, in that sense, it's really a continuation of our objectives for the last 30 years, which is provide better and better tools for more and more difficult chips. And so, the early adoption has been very positive. We are maturing things rapidly. We're adding already new capabilities some of those will be announced in the not-too-distant future. And so, it is definitely at the core of our platform for the next decade.","JoshTilton","Thanks. And then second question what is Software Integrity's current exposure to auto? And then how big is the potential auto's had for Software Integrity?","Aart de Geus","I don't know the exact number, but I can tell you that we've had a number of very exciting automotive not only interactions, but actually substantial business closures. And just to give a little color to that, in some cases, they have been connected somewhat to the rest of our business as we have moved into automotive. But in a number of cases, it's also that the automotive field has discovered, so to speak, that software is a major issue.","And when I say the automotive industry, I mean the OEM, so the actual car manufacturers, and this is interesting from a different perspective. They have in the last 100 years or so relied on an enormously complex supplier chain. And now suddenly the concerns are directly at their door, because if they move into adding way more software and already the advanced cars have about 100 million lines of code, way more software in order to do autonomous driving or any other form of assisted driving, the risk of vulnerability is actually very, very costly.","And so, we have a number of customers that have now done large deals with us. We expect those to continue to grow over time. And interestingly enough, as we're coming via the Software Integrity Group sort of down from the software, we're moving up from the hardware with the various forms of virtual prototyping, and this is exactly part of the strategic picture that we have seen now for a number of years, which is this pincer movement around everything is sitting on the intersection of hardware and software. And that's where the value will be created.","JoshTilton","Thank you very much.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Operator","And I'll turn it back to our speakers for any closing comments.","Aart de Geus","Well, with that, thank you very much for attending this call. We completed a strong first quarter in the year and thus have renewed confidence in the rest of the year. And we're, as usual, thankful for both your questions and your attention to our company.

Welcome to the Synopsys Earning Conference Call for the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2012. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Tricia. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.  Today's conference call will include commentary regarding our Q1 results and also the closing of the acquisition of Magma Design Automation, which we announced this morning. ","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results, and about the potential benefits of the combination. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our annual report on Form 10-Q for the year ended October 31, 2011, our earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 and our press release announcing the closing of the Magma acquisition issued this morning. ","All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our first quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm happy to report excellent Q1 results and raised guidance for FY 2012, as well as the closing of the acquisition of Magma Design Automation, announced this morning. ","Let me begin with the summary of our results. Our business in Q1 was strong across the board. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, including revenue of $425.5 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.56. We are well on track to meeting our non-GAAP operating margin and cash flow targets for the year. ","As a result, we're raising our outlook for the year, independent of the Magma acquisition, to a new earnings per share guidance range of $1.97 to $2.03. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. ","Regarding Magma Design Automation, we have much work to do as the acquisition literally closed a few hours ago. We're enthusiastic about the prospects for the joint company, as the merger will allow us to accelerate delivery of technology to customers at a time of very rapid system and silicon evolution. ","As we work through the detailed planning and integration, our priorities are the following: first and foremost, maintain complete focus on the continued success of our joint customers and their in-progress designs; second, immediate consultation with our joint customers, as we evolve and\/or revise our technology and product roadmaps. We plan to take the next 90 days for this effort, which we'll communicate further details.  ","And third, rationalize the 2 organizations. Our intent is to move quickly and diligently to optimally integrate the companies with the clear objectives of: one, customer success; two, technology acceleration; and three, continuity in delivering high-value solutions, while achieving economic efficiency. ","Rajeev Madhavan, Magma CEO, will not join Synopsys, but has graciously agreed to be available to advise us as we transition the company. We thank him for his efforts to date towards making this merger a success. ","Roy Jewell, Magma's President and COO, will work with Synopsys management team to ensure a successful integration. From a financial perspective and based on our initial view, we reiterate that we expect the acquisition to be modestly accretive to our 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. ","Due to antitrust-related restrictions in effect until this morning, we have only just begun the detailed planning and integration process, and we expect to provide specific guidance related to the impact of the Magma acquisition when we report Q2 earnings in May. ","Moving to the overall market picture. Semiconductor and systems companies are very aggressively developing and producing advanced new products, particularly in the mobile, cloud infrastructure and 'Smart Everything' market segments. The great potential of these end markets has driven a renewed emphasis on technology, visible from the rapid adoption of the 28- and 20-nanometer silicon nodes, to the focus on new transistor structures such as FinFETs, all the way to system design with an increased focus on broad verification strategies and system prototyping. ","The EDA industry is absolutely central to enabling this wave of end market opportunities, and the fact that these are technically challenging is precisely why our industry will do well. The high level of complexity and the need for our customers to differentiate themselves are driving tremendous demand for state-of-the-art technology, product and support. All of these are fundamental assets for Synopsys, and the timely addition of the Magma strength will only augment our solutions. Which brings me to the highlights for the quarter, starting with our core EDA and manufacturing offerings. ","In Q1, we did very well and utilization of our complete implementation solution has continued to grow. While advanced customers are now moving their major production chips to the 28-nanometer node, much of our focus is already on helping them at 20-nanometer, where we track 30 active designs. More than 2\/3 of these are being done with Synopsys tools. ","In addition, we're already enabling a substantial number of sub 20-nanometer designs. Clearly, from a silicon point of view, Moore's Law is alive and well, even if success requires great focus and sophisticated collaborations. An example of such collaboration is GLOBALFOUNDRIES, who exclusively used our newest IC Compiler-Advanced Geometry solution for its first major 20-nanometer chip. IC Compiler not only addresses the complicated challenges of managing power, performance and capacity, it tackles all the leading-edge physical obstacles inherent in very advanced designs. ","In the area of complex mixed-signal design, rapid turnaround between analog and digital is positively impacted by our recently announced integration of IC Compiler and Custom Designer. Evaluation requests are increasing, as designers see hard evidence of significant time-to-market and performance advantages. With the move to smaller geometries, the connection to manufacturing is even more critical, both for device design and yield optimization. ","Our key cap solution is integral to both traditional advanced designs and the new 3D transistors, or FinFETs. While being used today by nearly every leading semiconductor manufacturer, we're also seeing a number of add-on deals and new logos. ","Our yield optimization solution is also doing very well, particularly at 28-nanometer, as yield is now clearly affected by not only manufacturing or design, but most importantly by the interaction of the 2. This is an area where Synopsys is uniquely equipped to make a positive impact. ","The other ramification of smaller devices, of course, is more devices, and with it the continued high pressure on verification. In this area, too, we not only continue to see great technical progress, but we also saw good business growth in 2012. ","In verification, speed is essential, and our analog and digital solutions continue to lead. Our flagship VCS product is used for 70-plus percent of advanced designs, from processors to graphics to SSEs. ","Another positive highlight is our IP business. The trend continues unabated to outsource IP, or chip building blocks, that are very sophisticated, but may be non-differentiating for our customers. Synopsys is the leading supplier of interface, memory and analog IP blocks. With around 1,300 engineers and more than a decade of investment, we have the resources and expertise to ensure that customers can rely on the highest levels of quality, reliability and support. ","The quarter was strong across the board for IP. For example, USB interface sales were excellent, as the market migrates to USB3.0. We expect more than 1 billion chips containing USB3.0 to ship in the next 18 months, as the protocol supports the speed needed to tackle tasks such as downloading videos. Synopsys was the first IP vendor to demonstrate USB3.0 in 28-nanometer silicon and has been consistently at the forefront of technology development. This applies to a number of other protocols as well. We expect adoption of Synopsys IP to continue to be a significant driver of growth for us this year. ","At the systems level, we're making excellent strides with both software- and hardware-based rapid prototyping as well. Driven by the increase in complex IP blocks, including on-chip processors and graphics and DSPs, the verification tasks, especially as they relate to hardware-software interaction, are becoming central to product success. In that regard, our newly integrated virtual prototyping solution, Virtualizer, is showing great promise, with adoptions by key customers during the quarter. This is particularly encouraging, as the prototyping of the hardware is used to accelerate the software development. Thus, forming the basis for a multidimensional growth business in the future. ","On the FPGA-based side of prototyping, we saw excellent demand for our HAPS solution in Q1, as some keystone systems companies broadened the proliferation of our boards through their organizations. ","In summary, we're off to a very strong start for the year. We delivered better-than-expected Q1 results and are raising guidance. The customer landscape remains solid and the demand and momentum around our technology is strong across the board. With the addition of the Magma technology and technologists, we are poised to move even faster on delivering best-in-class products. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year and give you more detail on the Magma transaction. And as a reminder, I'll be discussing certain GAAP and non-GAAP measures of our financial performance, and we've provided reconciliations and explanations in the press release, 8-K and the financial supplement, which is posted on our website. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. ","Now Synopsys delivered a strong quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in November. Q1 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels and double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings. Today, we are also raising our full-year outlook for revenue and non-GAAP earnings, excluding Magma. ","Let me now provide some additional details on our financials, and as a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and expenses. ","Total revenue was $425.5 million, an increase of 17% compared to a year ago and well above our target range. Even without the impact of the extra week of approximately $26 million, revenue growth was 10%. ","We delivered growth across all of our product groups, with particular strength from our IP and systems products. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of first quarter revenue. ","Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 7% of total. This is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.6 years, larger contracts averaged close to 3 years, while the duration of a number smaller contracts brought the average down slightly. We continue to expect average duration in fiscal '12 to be between 2.7 and 2.9 years. ","Now turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $355 million, which included $17 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16 million of stock-based compensation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $318 million, an expected year-over-year increase and well within our target range. This increase was mainly due to the extra week, approximately $16 million, and timing of quarterly expenses. Excluding the extra week, total non-GAAP costs and expenses would have declined sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25% for the quarter. For all of FY '12, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '11 levels.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.39. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 27% to $0.56, exceeding our target range, driven primarily by stronger-than-expected top line growth and operational execution and, to a lesser extent, better-than-expected OI&E and a slightly lower-than-expected tax rate. We are raising our annual EPS guidance, reflecting our strong first quarter results and our confidence in business levels for the rest of the year, independent of Magma. ","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter. For modeling purposes, we think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2012. ","Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $943 million in cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter, which, of course, was prior to the Magma acquisition we closed earlier today. Of our total cash balance, 21% was onshore at the end of the quarter, and 79% was offshore. ","As expected, there was a net operating cash outflow of $39 million in the quarter. This was due primarily to the timing of prior year annual incentive compensation payments. ","Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $11 million for the quarter. And for the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $50 million. During the quarter, we spent $40 million in cash, as part of a multi-quarter accelerated share repurchase strategy. We have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. ","Q1 fully diluted share count declined 6.5 million year-over-year to 147.1 million, as a result of our share repurchases. We also completed one small acquisition during the quarter. ","Continuing on with balance sheet items. Q1 net accounts receivable totaled $214 million and DSO was 46 days, reflecting the high quality of our AR portfolio. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $723 million, and we ended Q1 with approximately 6,850 employees. ","Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some additional commentary around our acquisition of Magma. As Aart highlighted, we're pleased to have closed the acquisition today. It was an all-cash deal, valued at approximately $523 million, net of cash acquired. The transaction will ultimately be financed with existing cash and up to $400 million of debt. ","As Aart discussed, due to the anti-trust restrictions we have not had sufficient time to gather and analyze all of the relevant information we need to provide specific guidance beyond our organic numbers. Nevertheless, we remain confident that this combination can be modestly accretive to 2012 non-GAAP earnings per share. We will provide updated guidance when we report Q2 results in May, as we complete the detailed integration activities. ","Now let's address our second quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes the Magma acquisition and any other future M&A. Our GAAP targets also exclude any future acquisition-related expenses that may be incurred in Q2 and beyond.","For the second quarter of FY '12, our targets are: revenue between $412 million and $420 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $332 million and $348 million, which includes approximately $15 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $303 million and $313 million; other income and expense between $0 and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 150 million; GAAP earnings of $0.37 to $0.43 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share. We expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.","Now our fiscal 2012 outlook, again, excluding the Magma acquisition and any other future M&A. We're raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.655 billion and $1.675 billion, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%. Other income and expense between $0 and $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%; outstanding shares between 146 million and 150 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.33 and $1.48, which includes the impact of approximately $62 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.97 to $2.03. We've increased both the low and high end of our guidance range by $0.04. And we're targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $300 million. ","So in summary, we're very pleased by our strong first quarter results, highlighted by top and bottom line growth and continued solid operating margins. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Congratulations on closing the acquisition so quickly. I was wondering if you'd be willing to say anything about how you're looking to integrate that, specifically with respect to expense levels. Presumably, I think you'd want to keep R&D pretty well intact based on your motivation for doing the deal, and perhaps the same holds true for a lot of the field sales support. And I would think maybe G&A is an area where you would be fairly aggressive. But any color at all on -- just thoughts around how you might be thinking of expense levels going forward for Magma?","Aart J. de Geus","Sure. Well, in many ways, you just gave exactly the right color in the first place which is, there's obviously some efficiency to be gained by virtue of dealing with the overlap of the companies. It is also very clear that top priority for us is going to be very much the customer. And there are really 2 aspects to that, which is making sure that they are well served today and that all of their existing projects are safe. And that, of course, touches, first and foremost, the field support, but also some of the R&D forces. And secondly, the long-term, being able to take the wealth of technology that is joining our force and evolving our mutual products, or combinations thereof, going forward. We will stand away a little bit from giving too much detail, at this point in time, for a couple of reasons: a, because we are still putting together the overall business picture, and b, because, obviously, our first priority is to interact with the employees, get to know the key people and as many as possible of the whole team and, then, make decisions that are wise and also where our own employees are informed first and foremost.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Aart, so it sounds like business in general was very healthy in the quarter and you did, sounds like, beat all of your metrics. I was just wondering how you were thinking about the bigger picture for EDA. You've talked in the recent past, I think about a low single-digit type of growth rate for core EDA. Is there anything you're seeing that might make you change that opinion to the upside?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we ourselves are in the low -- actually, in the mid to mid-high right now for this year already. And I'm always a little bit careful before changing opinions too quickly on something that is, all in all, very, very stable and moves gradually. Having said that, though, I think we have told you now for a number of quarters that we see an intensifying of the pressure for our customers to really compete on the basis of very complex technologies. And this is complexity both towards smaller silicon and towards the systems area. And so I think their needs to count on EDA to make that actually possible is increasing very rapidly. Therefore, I'm not surprised that a number of the key EDA vendors are reporting good results. And I think that is very positive because it feels like there is a bit of strength in our industry at a time where we, of course, are strengthening our company even further.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then, Brian, just to be clear, so your second quarter guidance does not include any contribution for Magma but, of course, will include some contribution. Do you plan to reconcile that when you report the second quarter so we can kind of understand the underlying business relative to the guidance you just gave?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, we said we would break out the guidance in our next earnings call, but it'll require 90 days or so, as you can imagine, of going through very detailed contract-by-contract analysis and getting the team ready to go and run with it. So that's effectively how we're looking at it. We'll give the guidance. It'll be included in our next guidance for the full year, as we wrap up Q2 and integrate all of the Magma elements around the revenue. The deferred revenue haircut that goes into the purchase accounting piece, the expense management and then some of the one-time costs associated with the deal structure will have to get brought in.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Understood. I was actually referring specifically to the actuals for Q2, not sort of forward-looking. But when you report Q2, will you provide us that sort of the breakout of Magma contribution in the quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, Rich, we don't know yet what the details end up looking like. But again, as you get ramped up for this, we'll -- I believe we're going to break it out for you so can see what the impact is going to be.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just to follow-up on Magma first. So can you just walk us through, in terms of the timing of the close, why you didn't necessarily have the time to give a little bit of a better look, or a least give some rough ranges as to what it might contribute for the year?","Aart J. de Geus","Sure. Well, we do have rough ranges, otherwise we wouldn't be able to tell you that we expect it to be accretive in the first year. But realize that in account-competitive landscape, until you pass the hurdles of government approval, you can essentially not share any knowledge about anything that could impact the competitiveness of either of the entities. And so the closure with the government was just very, very recent. And so, we decided to move right ahead with the closure, and now we will go into much more detail in understanding their business model. Now, having said that, we're not seeing any surprises. As some of you have already recognized, their business model is quite different from ours. We have communicated to you for now quite a number of years that we're in the high or in the mid-90s percentage ratable, and their business is actually quite a bit different from that. Actually, if you look at their latest 10-Q, you'd see that about half of their business is upfront. And so we will need to work through a model shift to align that with our business practices. And these things are just complex to do and will require a detailed understanding of every contract. And these contracts are actually very complex, so that takes some time. But fundamentally, we don't expect any big surprises, we just understand that the details will come together as we work through all the details, literally.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But again, just to be absolutely clear, the next time that we should hear an update on guidance including Magma will not be until the second quarter earnings call?","Aart J. de Geus","That is exactly what we have just said, yes.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. I just wanted to make sure. And then, Brian, when you report, is the intention -- I think we talked about this at the time of the question, but is it your intention to actually report revenue, adding back what you would have to write down for deferred revenue write-down?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, let me talk about that. The -- as we looked at the preliminary balance sheet coming over this morning from their very recently completed Q3 -- as you know, Magma would have announced tomorrow -- we have about $23 million of deferred revenue. And then, there will be approximately -- they way we've typically done it, and again, we've got to get into all the details about cost-to-implement and so on, but we'd anticipate about $18 million of that $23 million is a typical revenue haircut that will go out of the revenues over the next 12 months or so. So it's the first pass at what the impact we expect from that. So relative to how much we're going to see for the impact, I think it's about $18 million. As I look at, then, what the quarterly profile is, which we have get into and work that, it wouldn't be a big problem to say, it could have been -- it could have been higher if we identified what that would be. But it typically is a 12-month reduction in the revenues that are taken, but the specific quarter, it's, again, looking at when the anticipated revenue and delivery of the products were going to happen, and that will help give some visibility to the impact in the quarter.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Let me ask one more now and I'll get back in the queue. You can use up to $400 million of financing to finance the deal. What are your kind of factors in determining how much debt you're going to pull down to finance this? And when would you anticipate making that decision by?","Brian M. Beattie","We've made that already, Sterling. When we looked at -- again, looking at our cash balance, we have about $200 million in the U.S. A majority of this transaction will come out of U.S. cash. We have an upgraded credit agreement in place that we filed, up to $350 million. And one of the -- very light on covenants, but one of them is that we maintain $300 million in total for the company in cash, both onshore and offshore. So effectively, the way we see it, we'll use about $100 million of our U.S. cash to complete the transaction, which has already happened. And then the balance of, as I've said, about $400 million, is coming from the debt side of it in the U.S. And we're leaving a majority of all the cash offshore and not repatriating that. And so that debt is in place. We have both a term loan that's structured for $150 million, and then a regular line of credit, which we can pull down and put back up at any point in time. And that's the way we're going to be managing cash between now and the end of the year is just having the minimum amount of debt on hand to finance both our ongoing operations, to pay for the anticipated debt with the close, and that's already happened, and we'll just keep that balance on hand. But it will be about $400 million and then we'll be coming down.","Operator","And the next question, excuse me, is from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Thomas Yeh calling in for Krish Sankar.  Looking at the broad-based strength in the first quarter, can you provide some additional commentary on what drove the strength in bookings during the quarter? Are you still seeing some customers coming back for early renewals mid-contract, like you did last year? And how should we think about how revenue flows through for the next few quarters?","Aart J. de Geus","Okay. Well, in general, what you're saying is correct. It is mostly customers that need more capabilities, more of our existing tools or that are growing more aggressively in reusing IP. And so, it is a little bit all over the map. But I wouldn't say that it's necessarily early renewal, it's more a broader renewal from the business that we've been doing. So it feels like strength across the board.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And your competitor highlighted 2 key displacements that they achieved in their digital business in 2011. I know there is historically some back and forth among competitors, but can you provide some details in relation to any shifts that you have seen at your top 10 semi customers? And any specific areas where you might be targeting share gains for the coming year?","Aart J. de Geus","To be honest, not really. I'm sure there are, at any point in time, many shifts one way or another throughout the customer base as people continually readjust what they use. I'm not aware that there would be any major dislocation or shift where we lose a massive market share or gaining massive market share. These things are relatively stable. I can only say that we did very well in the last quarter. And so from that perspective, I think it's more a picture of there may be individual skirmishes, but so far, we're growing just fine.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And finally, can you talk a little bit about how you see new technologies, specifically trigate devices and UV lithography. How could that impact the EDA industry in general and the timing around that?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, anything that touches the very small dimensions, first and foremost, has ramification to what we would call the manufacturing side of things. And so there lithography is certainly very pointed, so are the new transistor structures and so is, by the way, all the issues that touch the yield, which is now increasingly are due both by how design is done and how the manufacturing come together. Now some of these areas are very pointed, such as double or even triple patterning, very complex, but the good news is, our tools can support this in such a fashion that the design community does not need to know about those details, except a few specialists that tune the tools. And so we expect that, notwithstanding whatever transistors are used or whatever geometries are used, the design community will just continue to see this as an opportunity to get more transistors in lower power and in smaller area. And that is fundamentally the job of EDA, is to isolate the manufacturing from the design.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Tom Diffely with DA Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Aart, I had a couple just quick questions on the industry itself. When you look at the strength you see in core EDA, do you have a sense of what node is driving the majority of that business right now?","Aart J. de Geus","Absolutely. I can absolutely tell you that most of the heavy-duty production design is moving to 28-nanometer, that is where most of the spending is because those are the hard, difficult nodes, while being in production, right? So you have a combination of difficulty and volume. Now there is quite a bit of spending, as far as EDA is concerned, going into 20-nanometer, but that is really preparing the landscape for the next wave of designs. And then, really, the third bucket is all the people that design at older nodes which, by the way, does not necessarily mean that it's slouchy design, not at all. It's people that actually can squeeze an enormous amount of value out of something that's already more proven. And there, the tools are essential, but the tools also are very mature. And so we look at all 3 of these camps as being of high importance to us. But clearly, the leadership in most advanced nodes gives us the best position for the long-term future.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So is it normal to see the most EDA business in the currently ramping node then, as opposed to the next-generation node?","Aart J. de Geus","I would say that the -- actually, I don't -- I can't say exactly where the economics come down. My guess would be that, if you look at the 3 buckets, it's sort of 1\/3, 1\/3, 1\/3, would be a pretty good approximation.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then when you look at the memory market, in the past they haven't been huge users of EDA on a relative basis. Are there any changes at the 2X or 1X node that might require them to use more EDA going forward?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, the memory market is highly specialized because, by definition, it's sort of, excuse me, on one hand, all about the transistor. How can you maximally optimize a single memory cell? But on the other hand, increasingly, memories are very sophisticated subsystems because they have to self-correct, as invariably some of the transistors don't work when you have a very large collection of them. So the ability to put the logic around that, to make that work, requires very, very high sophistication, in timing, for example. And so we have seen that in the last few years, the memory market, as a consumer of EDA, has gradually grown and we think that there's more opportunity there.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, looking at the IP market, what's your sense, when you look at your served market inside the IP market, with memory and interface, what percent of the market do you think that is? And how much -- what percent of the market are you and how much growth is left for you in that space?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, the reason this is actually, in practice, a pretty difficult question is because what we are absorbing is really a market that has been completely internal. And as much as people say they want to do reuse, the reality is, they tend to do not that much reuse for old stuff that was designed previously, partially because nobody has time to revisit these things, partially because, let sleeping dogs lie, so to speak. If it works, it's amortized and don't touch it. For all the new generations, though, I think that picture is very different. And it's different not only because, economically, it's a much better deal to reuse commercial IP, it's also different because some of these new cores are much more difficult to design. And now you have to make a decision, if you want to use your own top designers for something that's difficult, but not differentiated, or can you use them on something that will differentiate your product. And I think we are absolutely seeing that many of the design managers are very conscious of this choice. Having said that, I think we are still far below the 50% point of outsourcing of IP and we certainly see a number of years of excellent growth there.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, Brian, when you look at the tax rate of going slightly down to 25%, is that just based on geographic mix? Or is something, kind of a long-term reason for that?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, it is the geo mix, the products. It's just effectively about a 1% drop from the range we had anticipated last quarter. So it's just fine tuning with some of the way the Q1 results have come through and then the geo mix of the products.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then, finally, for LAVA, at this point, there's no requirement for the report, their January quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","That's correct, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Aart, you and I have talked about systems companies beginning to do their own IC design. I mean, some are moving, perhaps. Cisco is a good example of somebody moving the opposite way. But I'm curious if your view is similar to that of your major competitor, which is that this is a net expansion of the market rather than system companies just beginning to do what their ASIC suppliers historically did. Is this a big, material trend for you? Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing?","Aart J. de Geus","I think it is an important trend, but not just as an expansion. It is also a trend that illustrates that the necessity of multiple companies to work well together to get an end result that works, is becoming more and more important. And let me give you a specific example that -- where we see literally systems companies working straight with foundries and design companies. It is all around the term, yield. For many, many years, yield was mostly the result of the manufacturing prowness (sic) [prowess] and cleanliness of the fab, et cetera. Well, the dimensions now are so small that the variability on physics and on small deviations in manufacturing rival the variability of timing on a chip. In other words, depending on how you design the chip, you will get different yield results on a given technology. Well this is a perfect example where technology and economics meet head on, because if one can understand that and bring these parties together, they have a chance of ramping up the yields much faster than if it's sort of throw it over the wall and hope that the other party will do the right thing. And this is, of course, particularly true, also another dimension around the systems guys, which have the challenge of not only delivering the hardware, but making sure that the hardware is ready at the same time as the software, or vice versa. And so, to me, these are all good examples of what I call systemic complexity, in contrast to scale complexity, which is just more transistors, call it Moore's Law. And systemic complexity demands for the different partners to understand enough of what the other parties are doing in order to be able to work well together. And that, in my opinion, is the key reason why a number of system companies that absolutely invested in having increasingly high competence teams within their own house.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So you -- just so I'm clear, you view that as, therefore, an expansion of the market, not just taking from one bucket and putting it to another, because it's an increased capability the systems guys need, regardless, even if they're engaged with third-parties to help do some of the ASIC-like work. Am I reading you correctly?","Aart J. de Geus","Absolutely. And actually, it helps EDA because the reality is, we have delivered, over many, many years, an incredible increase in technical capabilities. The very fact that it's now potentially spread among multiple users, increases our ability to get rewarded for that. And by the way, that also has the potential to increase the number of engineers that touch what we do. And I'm not even going too far here in the whole notion of the software engineers that, by definition, are quite a large number. As a matter of fact, in semiconductor companies, more than half of the engineers now are software engineers. And so I do think that it is an expansion of the space at the same time that you see an increase of the challenges of design. And it's in that context that adding the Magma team is yet another asset in technology moving us forward.","Brian M. Beattie","And just -- this is Brian. I just wanted to follow up on Tom's question, too, relative to the Magma revenues in the last quarter. As we said, it's not going to be reported based on the rules of the 10-Q filing requirements. So just let you know as well that as we looked at the results that are just coming in, that it looks very similar to the top line results that the company saw on the second quarter, which were released. So we just wanted to let that known. And EPS came in fairly close, a little bit light, just based on some of the one-time closing conditions and other expenses relative to the transaction that was in play. So again, we're watching the results closely and now it's into our books, as of today, moving forward. So again, no surprises, and it came through pretty straight.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Aart, I just wanted to follow up on an early question on multiple patterning and EUV. Just wanted to clarify, did you suggest that, as the customers decide on each layer whether to do multiple patterning on EUV, or they slowly introduce EUV, that your software is able to handle that irrespective of what the final decision is? Or other way, the software basically incorporates both solutions and the customer or designer does not have to worry about what's being used?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, fundamentally I'm suggesting that, because the software that is relevant here is, of course, the place and route and the verification systems that make it possible for people to lay out chips without necessarily having to understand exactly how any form of multi-patterning occurs. Multi-patterning is very complex, from a computational point of view, and there's no way that humans could do this. And certainly not on the sizes of chips. Now EUV, I think, is going to take a little while before it really has a major impact in practice on many chips. And there we are really much more involved at the leading edge of R&D in terms of what is needed for the photolithography. But the people that should be concerned, or should not be concerned, are precisely the designers that use place and route systems where, today, we have double patterning, for example, in utilization. So none of these problems are easy but fundamentally they are solved.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then the other question on design starts on newer technology. I know that you have always tracked the design start different technology node. Going forward, are you seeing the design starts -- are you seeing a shift, from a historical perspective, that more design start is driven by mobile space relative what you saw in the historically?","Aart J. de Geus","Oh, no question whatsoever. I think, if you were to compare the leading edge design starts 10 years ago versus today, you'd see a world of difference because there would be such a large number of design starts coming from the mobile side of the world in sort of the most advanced node minus one. The processors will continue to drive the absolute state of the art technology because they're after raw speed and increasing the raw speed at low power. But the next nodes after that are nodes that invite a high degree of integration. And there, too, of course, speed and power trade off. But the main bulk of the companies that are going there are, today, the mobility companies. And as you know, of course, the world of computation and mobility continues to merge more and more, so I don't expect that to change all that much.","Operator","And your next question is from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Aart, if I may, a couple of questions to start about what Magma projected for its results in the proxy filing back in December. I understand, of course, those were bare numbers, you're not beholden to them necessarily, but they had projected through their fiscal '17 some pretty considerable average growth rates, looking out to about 15%, 16% over a 5- or 6-year period for their revenues. In addition to which, they were projecting that their non-GAAP operating margins would be not dissimilar from yours, in the low- to mid-20s, even though their revenue base was quite a bit smaller. So the question is, do you think that, even with the considerable degree of overlap between your products and theirs, that those revenue projections, even if they included some market share gained by them, should, in the end, result in some net acceleration of your growth? That is to say, aside from inorganic effects, do you think that there's something in their portfolio that led them to those kinds of significant growth rates, or in their contracts, so those growth rates, that would have a net incremental effect on the combined growth rates?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, 2 comments. First, per your preamble, we do not feel beholden to their projections. We have to make our own. As mentioned earlier, our business model is different than what Magma had. And it's not for me to say which one is better, but we will continue on the business model we had. I highlighted earlier that the quarter they reported, half was upfront. The quarter that was just finished was below the expectations that certainly the market had set. Some of you had highlighted already earlier that the pressure on upfront deals was probably an indicator that it's -- that life was not quite so simple as it looked like. Be it as it may, that is not the key driver for us. The key driver for us is that, notwithstanding the economic challenges that always come with such a transition or with the company, there was also a lot of very good technology and great technologists. And as much as we will be very, very diligent in managing the transition both quickly and efficiently, our objective, clearly, is to precisely aim at the growth opportunities that come with acceleration of technology, with broadening of the need for customer support and the very things that we just discussed one or 2 questions ago, which is that there's an enormous, enormous need for what EDA has to offer today. And that is very encouraging. Meanwhile, of course, we have work through the ratable model changes. And what this also brings for us is going to be an increased broadening toward some analog capabilities. So there's a lot of really good things here, but we need work through the specifics of the numbers before we give you exact guidance.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Irrespective of the acquisition, there was a conversation before about the role of systems customers. And I'm wondering how, longer term, that might have affected your model, or is affecting your model anyway? I think it was at your analyst meeting that you spoke of your sales and support model having 3 to 4 engineering and field sales support people per sales rep, covering named accounts, for example. And I'm wondering, as the market expands, as you do more with systems-type customers and the foundries for that matter, how does that change that kind of field model and that going forward?","Aart J. de Geus","I don't think that it necessarily changes that model all that much. I think that we will continue to see a pressure and, therefore, potentially, opportunity in customers just wanting more and more and more support. And I think this is actually an opportunity for the EDA industry to gradually evolve a business model where the support does not just naturally come with the product, because that's economically not viable. And the reason for this desire to get more and more support is because our customers are very, very competitive with each other today. Many of the markets are very fast-moving. They tend to be a little bit more winner-takes-all. And technology is a differentiator. So I believe for the whole EDA industry, this is an opportunity to evolve the business model going forward and realize that we have a lot of value to add to this competitive landscape. Now how we get there? Just take one step at a time. But the opportunity space feels pretty good.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Figured I'd come back around and focus on the business rather than the acquisition. When you look at the contracts that you renewed, can you give us some qualitative color in terms of what you saw on the annual run rates on those renewals?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, the run rates kept going up, so that is a good sign. We saw many -- we didn't have, I think, many very, very large renewals this quarter. That statement itself, incidentally, is not all that meaningful because these things happen whenever they happen. And so we keep moving the entire customer base gradually forward. And so the business was a lot of smaller transactions this quarter and actually quite typical over Q1.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, Brian, you had talked about the timing on the expenses, given the 53-week year. Has any of that impacted on sales and marketing? It seems like you got a little bit more leverage there than what I've seen over the last couple of quarters. Was there any change in terms of timing on some advertising or marketing or any other type of items that may have benefited sales and marketing.in the quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, not really. As we said, the expenses would have been lower from Q4 to Q1 if it wasn't for the additional week. And so they're very -- just very typical accruals that are tied to the expenses that we're incurring. And running in a very normal mix. All the expense levels are on track for the full-year budgets we've established. So again a good, I think, very good positioning and lower spending in the last quarter on a year-over-year basis.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And last question, Aart, you talked about large deals, kind of 3-year average duration and shorter, smaller deals with much shorter, so it's kind of hard to roll all that together, but I'm still going to ask anyway. Your 2.6-year average contract duration, we've seen that number across industry shorten up a pretty consistently over the last 18 months. Do you think we're getting to the point of stabilization? Or do you think that can go much further on the shortening side? I understand what you've already implied in your guidance, but just from a high-level, how do you think about what customers are telling you around how long they're willing to commit to these contracts?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I wouldn't overread sort of a 0.1 change here. Our own expectation right now is still that we will do overall year between 2.7 and 2.9 years. In general, I would agree with you that, if you look at it 2 years ago, it's down a little bit. I think that is probably more a reflection of the last 2 years having been economically up-and-down and up-and-down. Greece has sort of become the symbol for economic uncertainty. But I wouldn't read too much into that beyond that. We certainly, in our shop, are not doing super-long contracts. So there's not much of 5 or 7 years. Actually, I don't think there's any. And so in that sense, I think we're sort of at the balancing point. It may go down a little bit, may go up a little bit. I'm sensing I'm meandering because I don't actually have any more value to add to this question.","Brian M. Beattie","Sterling, in last year the average -- in FY '11, the average was 2.7 years. And so this year with 2.7, a 2.9, with a 2.6 Q1, is still where we think average comes out. Again, all down to the specifics of which contracts and the duration by customer.","Operator","And at this time, I am showing we have about 5 minutes left of the allotted time. And we have a question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Brian, I was just wondering if you'd be willing to give the ratable verse upfront split in Magma's just completed quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Rich, honestly, I don't have that right in front of me. We just got the P&L's in the last day or so. So I've got the full financial's balance sheet, but we still have to do the analytics on that profile.","Operator","There are no other questions in queue.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, in that case, let me wrap it up. Thank you very much for the time you spent with us. I think that we had not only a very strong quarter, but a very good outlook for the rest of the year. That is, of course, amended by the fact that the Magma team will now be joining us. We have a lot of work to do there, but we sense that this is actually a great addition, at exactly the right time in our markets. And we will do our best to turn this also into a strong shareholder value-creation opportunity. Thank you very much for your attention today.","Operator","Okay.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentations, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I am happy to report that our second quarter results were excellent. We delivered double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth. Revenue came in at $777 million, with strength across all product groups and non-GAAP EPS was $1.08. We repurchased $35 million of our stock, bringing the total so far this year to $235 million and we are raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","The landscape around us continues to thrive, with semiconductor growth pegged at 10% plus for 2018. We see new chip and systems companies entering the market, as big data and AI are driving new compute and chip architectures optimized for machine learning. Substantial investments are being made as the AI digital intelligence push is increasingly evident in verticals such as automotive, medical, industrial and growing networks of connected IoT devices.","The automotive vertical is particularly interesting, as AI-enabled autonomous driving has the potential to revolutionize the very notion of car ownership, while simultaneously requiring massive amounts of electronics and software in cars. These deep transformations rattle the well-established safety practices in one of the most sophisticated supply chains ever built and software security is rapidly becoming paramount to shipping modern vehicles. Synopsys is ideally positioned in these evolutions. The three customer groups we serve semiconductors, systems companies and software developers are all investing significantly in very advanced chips, massively complex systems and large amounts of software. Consequently, it\u2019s imperative that they increase their efforts to test for or better preemptively avoid security vulnerabilities.","Over our entire history, Synopsys has invested in the most advanced technologies, paired with unmatched global customer support and has been privileged to team up with customers who have changed the world. This is happening again now. Our EDA design solutions are helping design brand new AI engines. Our IP is broadly used in the most advanced silicon technologies ever built. Our verification and emulation tools help bring up and test software on prototypes long before silicon is available. And our software security and quality tools assist in making that very software less vulnerable to threats.","This quarter, all of our product groups did well. EDA revenue growth continues to outpace the competition and we\u2019ve begun to rollout breakthrough digital design capabilities through our new Fusion Technology. IP continues its double-digit growth, driven by our broad portfolio that is already on pace to enable the 5-nanometer IP needed in the near future. And lastly, our software security and quality group, which has reached economic critical mass and is executing very well with the integration of Black Duck, continues to deliver excellent organic growth.","Let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. In Q2, our EDA revenue was strong across the board. Synopsys is the essential partner for the most advanced designs. Customers rely on us for more than 95% of their FinFET designs. Our track record at 7-nanometer is unrivaled, with nearly all of the 120 plus designs we are tracking impacted by our digital tools. At 5-nanometer, our deep collaborations with customers and ecosystem partners are resulting in early successes. Here too, customers are relying on Synopsys digital for nearly all designs. Our expertise and influence reach down to 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer, where we are already involved in preparing for still more advanced technology nodes. Foundry support and ecosystem partnerships are critical to enabling joint customers. During Q2, TSMC certified our full digital and custom flows for their 7-nanometer FinFET Plus and emerging 5-nanometer processes. Together with ARM, we announced a multiyear extension of our long-tenured collaboration, spanning all Synopsys tools, to best enable advanced ARM-based SoCs.","In digital design, we saw revenue growth accelerate over the last two quarters. In 2Q, we announced our new Fusion Technology, which represents a completely new level of integration of our market-leading products in synthesis, place and route, and signoff. A systematic sharing of algorithms, code and data representations across multiple tasks opens the door to previously unachievable levels of performance and quality of results by redefining conventional product boundaries. An example of the power of our Fusion solution is from Samsung Electronics, which experienced 10% better quality of results and significant reductions in turnaround time. They joined ST, Toshiba, and our product partner, Ansys to share the benefits of Fusion Technology with fellow customers at our Silicon Valley user conference. Our digital design vision and roadmap are already driving expanding customer relationships, including a key long-term agreement with a very high-profile global systems company. We delivered strong growth in custom as well and launched an enhanced custom design platform, with 2x faster simulation for FinFET and automotive designs.","In verification, we continue to see outstanding results and a strong outlook for the year. Demand is high for our Verification Continuum Platform, built upon the fastest engines in the industry and our number one position in both software and hardware-based verification. Q2 was a record quarter for hardware. Customer adoption of ZeBu emulation was broad-based, with substantial growth in existing accounts and a competitive win at a top 10 semiconductor company, driven by ZeBu\u2019s significant speed advantage. Cambricon, a global leader in intelligent processors, adopted our FPGA prototyping solution for its AI processor product. HAPS-80 delivers the performance, capacity and scalability needed to enable Cambricon to accelerate software development and system validation.","Now to IP, which had another strong quarter and is poised for an excellent year, our strength is driven by multiple customers, regions and application segments. For example, several key agreements were for mobile chips focused on next-generation processes. We saw excellent success in cloud computing. A number of important deals were with automotive companies, for interface IP and our new safety-certified ARC embedded vision processor. And overall, business is strong worldwide, notably in China, where many companies look to third-party IP to maximally speed up their time to market. In order to ensure that the latest IP titles are available from Synopsys in the customers\u2019 desired manufacturing processes, ecosystem partnership and intense bleeding-edge investments are critical.","During the quarter, we announced collaboration with TSMC to deliver key memory IP and logic libraries for TSMC\u2019s 22-nanometer ultra-low power processes. We are also collaborating with Samsung Foundry to develop DesignWare IP for its 8-nanometer FinFET process, particularly benefiting low-power, high-performance applications. To address the growing needs in data-intensive applications such as machine learning, cloud computing and networking, we continued our investments in high-speed SerDes IP with the acquisition of Silicon and Beyond. At this point, it is worthwhile to note that we continue to make excellent progress in the automotive vertical as well. One of the requirements to participate in this market is product certification for a number of safety standards. We offer the broadest portfolio of IP that is certified for safety and reliability, ranging from embedded vision processors to embedded memories to the industry\u2019s widest selection of interface IP.","In EDA, our design portfolio achieved the industry\u2019s most comprehensive ISO 26262 certification by exida, the leading automotive functional safety certification company. Certification spans our custom, analog\/mixed signal, digital implementation, signoff and library development flows and of course, automotive safety also implies software security, which brings me to our Software Integrity Group, which serves a third customer base, software developers across many industries including, but also well beyond, semiconductors and systems. We provide products and services that help developers build security into the software development lifecycle and across the entire cyber supply chain.","Software Integrity is a key differentiator for Synopsys and has substantially expanded our TAMs. In recent quarters, we have reached critical mass with significant growth both organically and through acquisitions. Our Software Integrity platform is making good progress. We are step by step combining key technologies and will continue to rollout incremental advances over the next 12 months and beyond. We are excited about the very positive impact that our broad solution will have on our customers\u2019 efforts. The addition of Black Duck provides another compelling set of products addressing the ever-expanding open source content in today\u2019s software. While still early, the integration is proceeding very well. The combined team is energized, the roadmap planning is on track, we are benefiting from the brand recognition of Black Duck, and we are beginning to see some cross-selling benefits.","Finally, for the second year in a row, Synopsys was named a Leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for application security testing. The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers, who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors. We have seen a definite increase in our customer interest since first being recognized last year. To summarize, the company is hitting on all cylinders. We had a very strong quarter. We are raising revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the year. We are making excellent progress with our leading products in design and verification and our investments in IP and software have broadened our market reach, TAM and company outlook.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In delivering another excellent quarter, we achieved record revenue with strong growth across all geographies and product groups. We delivered double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth and we returned cash to shareholders by repurchasing $235 million of stock in the first half of 2018. Based on the strength of first half results and better visibility to an increasingly favorable second half, we are raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance.","Now to the numbers, as I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 14% to $777 million, reflecting strength across our product portfolio. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.6 years and we expect the annual average to be about 3 years. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $650 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $587 million, resulting in an operating margin of 24.5%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.67. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.08, a 23% increase over the prior year. We are in the process of preparing our 2019 plan and will not have more definitive guidance for next year\u2019s tax rate until after Q4. Based on what we know at this point, we currently expect our non-GAAP rate to be below our previous 19%, but higher than our 2018 rate of 13%. Operating cash flow was $63 million for the quarter, including a one-time tax payment totaling $33 million related to our 2017 repatriation of offshore cash. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $571 million, 23% of which is onshore and total debt of $524 million.","We are committed to investing in the business to drive sustainable growth and managing our balance sheet to increase long-term shareholder value. In Q2, in addition to completing our previous $200 million ASR, we also repurchased $35 million of stock in the open market. On a trailing-12-month basis, we have returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks. We have $490 million available on our current repurchase authorization. Black Duck, which we acquired in Q1, has been a very successful addition to our Software Integrity Group. It\u2019s on track to meet our 2018 target of $55 million to $60 million in revenue, which reflects a purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million. Consistent with previous guidance, we project Black Duck to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS and to reach breakeven in the second half of 2019. In addition, we closed two small acquisitions in the quarter that will enhance our photonic design and high-speed SerDes IP solutions.","Finally before moving on to guidance, a reminder regarding the transition from Accounting Standard Topic 605 to Topic 606, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019 beginning in November, because of the new rules, we do expect a loss of backlog at the time of transition. However, based on our current estimates, we expect the impact on revenue to be immaterial. The precise impact will be affected by future bookings and business transactions through the rest of the year and we will provide more definitive commentary with our fiscal 2019 guidance.","Now to the third quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance, for Q3, the targets are revenue between $760 and $785 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $669 million and $685 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $605 million and $615 million; other income and expenses between minus $3 million and minus $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.65 to $0.75 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.89 to $0.93 per share.","For 2018, the targets are revenue of $3.07 billion to $3.1 billion; other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million; GAAP earnings of $1.66 to $1.76 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3.76 to $3.83 per share; capital expenditures of about $110 million; and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million. As we look to the remainder of fiscal 2018, you will note that our guidance implies higher revenue in Q3 than in Q4. This reflects the inherent variability associated with hardware and IP and is based on our best visibility at this point. Earnings will also be higher in the third quarter reflecting seasonally higher operating expenses in Q4.","To summarize, we delivered our strongest revenue quarter-t-date and we are on track for a record revenue and earnings year. We continued to complement our investments in our core businesses with incremental spending in our newer higher growth products to support sustainable long-term growth. Finally, we have achieved these results while maintaining our commitment to a balance of organic investment, M&A and the return of capital to deliver strong results for our shareholders.","Let me now turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Let\u2019s just verify few things more so than anything. Your implied fiscal year \u201818 EPS guidance assumes I believe 500 basis point sequential dip in operating margin and operating margin of the year is somewhere in the neighborhood of 22% on a non-GAAP basis. And you did in fact show 600 basis point sequential dip in operating margin in the fourth quarter of last year and as you described it\u2019s a function of seasonally weak revenue and continued increases in OpEx, so should that be the way we normally model the way your fiscal year unfolds a large sequential dip in operating margin just given the away seasonality trends?","Trac Pham","Hi, Gary, this is Trac. For this year that\u2019s the case. It happens to be similar to last year, but I would call that as a normal trend over time. It really depends on the quality profile of our business and so you will see variable comp or commissions accruals vary from quarter-to-quarter. As we said for this year given the revenue profile and our hiring trends and then what is an expected true-up for a variable comp in Q4, it just happens to be our lowest EPS quarter.","Gary Mobley","You mentioned that Black Duck is roughly $0.12 dilutive in the current fiscal year and just doing some calculations, it looks like it\u2019s like 200 basis points operating margin dilutive and I am assuming there is some dilution contribution from the other two acquisitions, Silicon and Beyond and Phoenix and whatnot. Can you verify that\u2019s approximately the amount? Can you verify that maybe operating margin in 2018 will be on par with what was in the prior year if not for the acquisition dilution?","Trac Pham","Your calculation on the operating margin impact of Black Duck is in the right neighborhood. In addition to that, we have also made some investments in IP and EDA this year given the opportunities that we are seeing in the market. With regards to the operating margin changes from year-to-year excluding the impact of Black Duck, it would have been up marginally or marginally flattish year-over-year. We do expect to drive operating margins to the mid 20s as we stated in the past. And as although we are in the midst of planning FY \u201819 right now, we do plan on driving it up next year.","Gary Mobley","Last question, is the Software Integrity Group still on pace for roughly $260 million revenue this year?","Trac Pham","You are in the right range.","Gary Mobley","Alright, that\u2019s it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Impressive increase in your annual revenue number there, $150 million, is there any other color you could give on kind of where that\u2019s coming from I mean, is it predominantly hardware or is it a mixture of all the products? And then just sort of looking at the incremental flow-through of that to the bottom line, it looks like it\u2019s kind of that about half of the implied corporate operating margin. So wondering what\u2019s going on there is there some incremental dilution from the acquisitions or are you doing maybe some incremental reinvestment from some of the upside you expect to see on the top line? Thank you.","Aart de Geus","From a growth perspective, there are three things. First, it was broad across the board all businesses did very well and then I would say standing out beyond that was the IP and the hardware both did very well. It\u2019s a little lumpy as these things occur, but at the same time I would say overall, these are healthy businesses. In terms of the ongoing management of the profitability, this has been absolutely been a year where we have made investments, we see opportunities. Black Duck of course has its own investment via M&A. And so I want to just state exactly what Trac was saying we did this on purpose knowing that we have great opportunities to grow well. And looking forward to \u201819 without giving specifics, we will pay more attention to the ops margin moving it up again.","Rich Valera","That makes perfect sense. And then just the service and maintenance revenue line this quarter, Trac, was this pretty strong as that, was there a meaningful contribution from Black Duck in there or is that \u2013 can we kind of expect that line to stay at those levels going forward or is there any other color you could give on that? Thanks.","Aart de Geus","Yes. So the consulting services business for Software Integrity is actually doing very well. However, the quarter-on-quarter increase was largely driven by the IP business, particularly the percentage completion revenues.","Rich Valera","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much, gentlemen.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we go next to Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Darren Chen","Hi, this is Darren on for Farhan. My first question we kind of gone on this already a little bit, but when we look at sort of your guidance for 2018 last quarter, you basically had implied second half \u201818 of down 10% year-over-year and now we are getting par about 10% up year-over-year. Could you give us some color again on what\u2019s changed your outlook and maybe you provide some idea of linearity across your business segments?","Trac Pham","Yes. The starting point is that overall the businesses are doing well, so that gives us very nice baseline for the year. But what really changed this quarter was based on the strength of the business that we booked in the first half and the visibility that provided to stronger IP and hardware revenues, that\u2019s why we are increasing the second half, but it will remain very \u2013 as those businesses grow both IP and hardware we will see more variability in the business. And what we are provided right now is our best visibility of that.","Darren Chen","Got it. And then also sort of on the margin question again if I keep the gross margins and then sort of the SG&A flat and I see that R&D is probably where you could probably get more expenses, is it right to think that the R&D should go up in the second half, maybe up 17%, 18% when you look at half over half or should I be looking at expenses coming somewhere else in terms of diluting the margins as a seasonality?","Trac Pham","I can\u2019t \u2013 I haven\u2019t looked at the year-over-year increase. I can\u2019t quote the 72% increase that you are driving, but we should see a combination of expense increases in R&D as well as the sales and marketing line as we ramp up both hiring those areas as well as the sales and marketing line, it\u2019s going to be a variable comp or commissions increase.","Darren Chen","Understood. And then final question on the Black Duck and software security platform, it\u2019s doing really well. I am curious a little bit about sort of the cross-selling aspects going forward? And then also do you see possible customers coming outside of the semiconductors in terms of just being interested in the Software Integrity platform overall? Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Well, let me start with the end. Absolutely, we are seeing growth in the customer base that we knew existed, but didn\u2019t touch in the past. And so remember when we started in this direction with acquisition Coverity, at that point in time, it was roughly 50-50 balance between semiconductor systems on one hand and software development in areas that were certainly not in our purview. That balance has continued to shift to become broader and broader as we touch very different segments be it from oil reserves to health to financial sector as industrial you name it. And fundamentally, the problem of security vulnerabilities is really anywhere in software. And so from that perspective, we do feel that we have tapped in a broader TAM. The fact that the different acquisitions I think were well chosen because they are so nicely adjacent and supportive of each other, I think you are starting now to prove itself true. And in the middle of that, Cigital added a service component that also allowed us to engage at high-leveling companies that were frankly looking themselves as to what they should be doing and by being able to provide multiple aspects of the solution, we are more attractive, we are low risk and we have sort of the steadiness of a large company that\u2019s going to be there for the long run. So I think it\u2019s fair to say that there is many open questions for the future, but that all-in-all we are very happy with how this is developing.","Darren Chen","Got it. Thank you for your time.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Couple of quick questions. First, given that you mentioned Black Duck couple of times, can you just give us what was the organic growth rate in the quarter?","Trac Pham","I am sorry, the organic business versus Black Duck?","Sterling Auty","For the company and for the whole, so what was total organic revenue growth?","Trac Pham","Sterling, we don\u2019t break that out.","Sterling Auty","Okay. Usually, I think about hardware as having upfront revenue recognition, so you talked about the strength in both hardware and IP helping the revenue in the second half, why is the hardware bookings in the first half spilling over? Was there an increase in lead times?","Trac Pham","No, typically hardware, sometimes you can ship if you have inventory ready to go or if you are expecting certain orders and they indeed came in at the right time. The challenge with hardware is that it is lumpy in terms of size and it is somewhat unpredictable in terms of timing and then the shipping is on top of that a function of availability and of desire of the customer frankly too. So, all of these things is a grab bag of things that are all not quite predictable. I want to just come back to the previous question, because I think it wasn\u2019t quite clear we understood the question. We certainly don\u2019t want to leave the impression that the organic growth rates of the integrity business was \u2013 Software Integrity business was not very good, it was actually very good, just that we don\u2019t break it out anymore between M&A and the res. What we have said in the past and it continues to be so is that we expect the profile of acquisitions to gradually become profitable in about an 18 to 36 month timeframe. And so that\u2019s the other financial aspect to this and the overall growth rate of that business we have in the 20% pointish neighborhood.","Sterling Auty","Got it. And then one last one kind of following on question I think Rich asked, so based on the strength in hardware and IP and how that\u2019s impacting the second half business. How should we think about the different revenue line items, because one of the things that we have had I think more challenges in terms of forecasting, I think the total revenue estimates have been good, you have come in and beat, but our mix of time-based license versus maintenance services etcetera, I think has been more difficult to kind of pin down and I think that\u2019s created some noise. So any help that you can give in terms of clarity to help us on those line items would be great?","Aart de Geus","Yes, I will in general, it won\u2019t be precise for some of the nuances of it, but in general, hardware will typically show up in upfront line. And then on the IP business two-thirds of it is going to be time-based with the third being more upfront and then time-based you will see it in the time-based line as well as the consulting and maintenance \u2013 with the services and maintenance line.","Trac Pham","Maybe the comment I would add to that, you must have heard at least in the last six or seven earnings releases that we used the term lumpy, more difficult to predict in terms of to that effect. None of these terms are negative in regard to the business, but they do highlight a little bit to why we go into a year with a certain degree of caution in terms of how we predicted, because in general, we like to be able to deliver what we guide towards. At the same time, if you look at the evolution of Synopsys over now quite a number of years and you just look at the revenue line, you see that it\u2019s fairly consistently going in the right direction even from quarter-to-quarter it may not be perfect or maybe little bumpy overall I think the company is in good shape.","Sterling Auty","Understood. Thank you.","Trac Pham","You are welcome.","Operator","We go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is open.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks and good evening. Aart, let me start with hardware, in 2017 and now for the trailing 12 months it would appear that Synopsis is total hardware business based on our calculations, we are about half of the combined EDA big 3 hardware when we look at emulation and prototyping together in fact by quite a good margin on a trailing 12 basis. So when Mentor said that they were number one in emulation for Q4 that does seem to have been the case. My twofold question on that is first, what are you seeing in terms of the breadth of the hardware business which is basically a concentration question? And secondly, are you seeing more and more customers taking or with same customers taking both emulation and prototyping? So, that\u2019s first part of the question. Thanks.","Aart de Geus","Okay. So, everything about hardware, I think the first comment is we are doing very well in this area and there is a reason for it. The reason is that the area of focus that we have zoomed in on is the intersection of hardware and software, specifically the notion of can you bring up the software, can you run the software in other words on hardware that doesn\u2019t exist yet and therefore you use a prototype such as an emulator or FPGA board or we have some other forms of that as well. And the answer is that is a growing need because both the complexity of the hardware and delivery times and the software that\u2019s running on the chips is demanding an earlier exercising of software and that is where we do very well. Our own sense is that yes, we have grown our market share and that we are in the lead, but Mentor does not disclose its number. So, I don\u2019t know if they are doing something great and good for them if they do. In terms of the breadth of the product line, we have talked for quite a while about the fact that we have a verification continuum. So, the hardware pieces, emulation, HAPS boards are actually working very well in conjunction with our software tools, the simulator, the debuggers and so on. And yes, a number of customers tend to use multiple pieces and assemble them, because each one of these solutions have different characteristics, some are really good for running large amounts of software that are really good for directly interacting with real life situations, for example, the HAPS boards would be that. And in that sense, we are a very complete solution and we do see both growth in depth and in breadth and in repeat business.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Second question has to do with the next generation chips that you talked about in your prepared remarks for AI and so forth. Can you talk about any meaningful differences in terms of the consumption of your core EDA software in terms of mix and\/or numbers of licenses for the next generation of chips? When you think about synthesis, power, timing, you name it versus what the leads would have been 5, 10, 15 years ago for the then-hot generations of chips, any fundamental differences in any of those kind of dimensions?","Aart de Geus","Actually, not really and this is one of the reasons we have articulated for a while that we believe there is whole wave of new opportunities is actually great for semiconductors, because the minute you can get some AI algorithm to run and do something useful, the next minute you think boy, it\u2019s so slow, can I just make it faster? And so these chips will in no time drift forward to the most advanced Silicon Technologies. And by the way also too in a number of cases to the largest chips to be built, I mean, these are truly quite exceptional. Now, I want to quickly also say that of the many AI companies that are doing chips, they span a broad spectrum from super advanced to how quickly can we get something on the market for IoT that is using more established technologies that are narrower in their capabilities. And so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually all that different than the ways that we have seen in the past be in the computation age or in the mobility age or the networking. And there is no question that the foundries are very much focused on making sure that they continue to deliver increased transit accounts in smaller dimensions.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Lastly if I may, your press release refers to Synopsis hitting on all cylinders, which is I guess confirmation that you really are an automotive company now. When you think about the various pieces of the portfolio, can you rank the relative impact on each from automotive, in other words, you think the largest relative impact might be on, let\u2019s say, IP or SIG or core EDA, how would you think about that?","Aart de Geus","Well, actually I can say that there are four areas that are touching it quite substantially. The design tools touch it, because the chips have to ultimately be certified on ISO 26262 and a number of those chips have some very sophisticated timing and power demands. The verification most definitely touches it and will touch it more as prototyping in the cars is going to be absolutely necessary, because the complexity is growing so fast that unless they prototype much more and that could be virtual prototyping to be really fast, they will not be able to ship the cars. The preferred areas, IP, because in these new systems, there is a lot also interface IP, there is a number of embedded processors, those two aside of having to be certified are things that people just don\u2019t design themselves anymore, they put them in the chips. And last but not least coming from above is our Software Integrity Group, where the notion of security had a rude awakening a couple of years ago when the Jeep was hacked. And instantaneously, many decades of diligence around safety were put into question as people realized that they have sort of forgotten by the software. So in that sense they are all moving forward. Lastly, to your well-pointed clip that we are working on all cylinders, I would like to say we are working on electrification of ourselves here and so hopefully it won\u2019t just combustion engine, but will be autonomously running the company.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, Aart.","Operator","And we will go next to Monica Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monica Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Aart, specifically in your comment, you kind of talk about AI application that\u2019s kind of one example of growth, maybe talk about what kind of used cases you are seeing in the market and how much revenue we could see from these applications going forward?","Aart de Geus","Yes. I don\u2019t think that we can be very precise on the revenue partially because we wouldn\u2019t disclose it partially also because there are many companies that do many things and so it\u2019s a little bit subjective, but there is no question that there is a lot of effort in a lot of chips and also that there are quite a number of companies that 3 years or 5 years ago did not exist. And that is certainly a good sign and maybe over time, some overheating of that as all of these things tend to be above all, but at the same time, I think this is going be a long bubble, because the minute a company sees that they are not in the right direction, they will get absorbed by somebody else and the investments will continue. And so if you look at the used cases, there are quite a number of companies that are going sort of in the generic AI direction essentially trying to provide capabilities that could be used in the cloud, typically a full learning, some are very visible and so you certainly would know about an NVIDIA that has done extremely well in that, but there are many others on the way. And then there is a large number of companies that are looking at the type of things that you could put on in the edge. So it\u2019s not the learning, but the interpreting of the learned behaviors or learned characteristics and they range from all kinds of facial recognition, voice recognition, pattern recognition of course for autonomous driving and so on, but also analysis of vibration patterns to see if machines are going to brake, identification of cracks inside of pipes. I think there is going to be a lot of very interesting creativity here and I believe that as fast as this is moving we are still very much in the beginning of this major phase.","Monica Garg","Alright, thanks. And then I have operating margin question if I look back Synopsis like 10 years numbers like in 2008, revenue was somewhere $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and operating margins was like 23%, now fast forward 10 years, revenue has increased more than 150% to $3.1 billion, what you are guiding, but kind of margins similar to slightly lower. I guess the question is when we are seeing some significant and great growth in revenue, why we are not seeing more leverage in the margins?","Aart de Geus","That\u2019s a very good question. And so we have always said that if we needed to do it we would push growth above ops margin, but I certainly set the price with the fact that it\u2019s time for us to put more emphasis on the ops margin going forward. I would highlight something else though. We have been a company that has attempted and I think being successful now twice in broadening our TAM for the long-term and the first of those was in the early 2000s building the IP business, which is not a substantial part of our portfolio. And then 4 years or so ago, we decided that we would invest in what we see as a continuity from hardware into the software world and invested in the Software Integrity business throughout a number of acquisitions and also quite a bit of organic investment. And I would say that in 2018 we can say I think that has been successful. And so we are very grateful for that, because that gives us some of the opportunity to touch many, many customers that before we never have had any interaction with. It gives a different level of stability to the company in the long-term when you look at potential ups and downs in markets over many, many years. And in that sense I think it has brought an outlook to Synopsis that is more in the many years space than in the next year outlook. So in that context, your point raises the right issue, which is can we now improve the incremental improvements towards the profitability, but I would like to highlight that we are actually very happy as to where the company is now based on those investments.","Monica Garg","Thank you so much, Aart.","Aart de Geus","You are most welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go next to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys. Thanks for your question. A few kind of small ones. I guess, I will start with the easy ones first. So just with the two quick acquisitions you guys did, is it fair to assume that didn\u2019t contribute much to the July quarter guide meaning that it\u2019s somewhere under 1% to the revenue line?","Trac Pham","Yes, Mitch, this is Trac. They were immaterial to the results.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. And the second one I realize that people are going to poke around a bit on the operating margin line, but am I doing this math correctly that essentially the core business is growing faster, because if I add $0.12 to your FY \u201818 guide, it looks like EPS is outpacing revenue growth, which implies that the core business is essentially expanding operating margins. Is that correct?","Trac Pham","There is a few things in the results. If you break it out, clearly you have highlighted the Black Duck dilution. We do have the benefit of the tax rate which we knew some of that benefit to invest back in the business and we have mentioned earlier that we have seen pretty good opportunity in the IP as well as in the EDA space. And so those things are some of the drivers of the operating margins, but overall you separate all those things out, we are holding margins relatively flat year-over-year versus \u201817.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. And then the last one just in terms of the chip complexity in the security side, so we are seeing more and more news about people essentially finding hardware hacks and things of that in the chips. So where exactly are you guys seeing the cross-selling? I mean is it basically the cloud vendors like Facebook or something like that or who exactly is a cross-selling opportunity for the Software Integrity plus the core EDA tools?","Aart de Geus","Well, so we are talking two different cross-selling opportunities. The first one is actually within the Software Integrity space where the quality tools, mostly coming from Coverity, and the security tools, Cigital, Black Duck and a few other acquisitions, they are starting to cross-sell quite nicely and it\u2019s becoming increasingly a very coherent domain. And you may have heard in the preamble that we will also continue to invest in gradually building a platform where all of these tools work better and better together. The cross-selling from the software security to the hardware security is a little bit less direct, it is much more brand positioning and understanding of the topic. And there we do have a number of opportunities to focus more mostly through the IP business. In creating security within that, we have encryption tools, we have capabilities to build route of trust. And I think it will \u2013 that area will gradually grow, because yes, hackers have figured out that hardware could be vulnerable too and a lot of companies understand this and now are investing and improving their solutions. And I think that will continue for many years.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. One last small one, just on the IP business, that was running below corporate average, is there any sort of kind of revenue run-rate you get to where the IP piece of the business would be essentially in line with the operating margins?","Aart de Geus","Yes, we don\u2019t disclose the specifics. Structurally, it is certainly a bit more difficult in the IP, because IP is sort of a better cost between products and service business. There is certain amount of customization. There is a number of things that we do early on for certain customers and their statement of works and that describes a little bit how that works. But having said that, there is also no doubt that over the years we have gradually grown the ops margin nicely and actually certainly last quarter IP had a very high level of orders, actually the whole quarters was very strong from an order perspective and we see the steady state of our run-rate growing against.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.","Aart de Geus","You are welcome.","Operator","And I will turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Aart de Geus","Well, I think at this point in time hopefully you\u2019ve taken away that we had a strong quarter. The run-rate is up. The business is looking quite solid for the second half of this year. And you got a sense of where we are looking at in terms of results for \u201818 and also the beginning of a sense of how we are thinking about \u201819 although it will hold back on further comments until we get a little bit closer. Thank you very much for your attention and your support. And as usual we will be available for the Q&A afterwards.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today.

Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma'am.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.

All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com.","In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I'm pleased to report another excellent quarter and with it an outstanding year for Synopsys. In fiscal 2019, a year in which we successfully navigated several external challenges, we once again exceeded our plan. We generated $3.36 billion in revenue and are well on track to our next milestone of $4 billion. Our backlog grew to $4.4 billion. We expanded operating margin significantly and delivered 17% non-GAAP earnings growth to $4.56 for the year, while returning $329 million to shareholders through buybacks. Business was strong across our Semiconductor & System Design segment and strengthened as the year progressed. Software Integrity achieved profitability and grew 19% to $335 million. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","Against a challenging global market backdrop with geopolitical stress and unevenness in the semiconductor industry, design activity remains strong. Growth in machine learning, automotive 5G, IoT, cloud and the proliferation of Smart Everything is considerable. New entrants including AI start-ups and cloud hyperscalers are pushing the boundaries of technology and time to market. Synopsys is at the center of this wave of innovation and growth, and we are uniquely positioned to enable electronics design from the intricacies and complexity of silicon to the power and pervasiveness of software.","A year ago, I communicated our strategy for our next phase of growth. First, sustain and grow our technology and market leadership in EDA and IP. Second, continue to scale and grow Software Integrity in a diverse customer base at new TAM, while steadily moving to solid profitability. And third, further drive operational excellence towards multi-year operating margin expansion. During fiscal '19, we made very good progress on all three.","Let me provide some highlights beginning with EDA and IP, where we substantially expanded relationships with our customers and ecosystem partners. TSMC, for example, recognized Synopsys with Partner of the Year Awards for the ninth straight year. Award this year were for Interface IP, joint development of 6-nanometer design infrastructure, joint delivery of innovative 3D chip stacking and cloud-based productivity solutions. In addition, some of the world's largest and most influential companies expanded their reliance on us. One key example is the US mobile systems leader, who significantly expanded its business with us across both EDA and IP.","In EDA, our platforms increasingly stand out as the strongest they've ever been. This year, we began proliferating several game-changing new products that already have significant momentum. Notably, our unrelenting innovation push in digital design is driving benchmark wins and increased competitive displacements. Our Fusion platform, including our new Fusion Compiler product launched last November is achieving widespread wins and growing deployment, exceeding our initial business targets.","Fusion Compiler is winning head to head benchmarks with consistently better results and run time across many applications. Breakthrough competitive wins have ranged from the largest global communications, processor and graphics firms to high impacts cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential system houses such as a large global consumer electronics company for image sensor designs, a leading automotive semiconductor company for autonomous driving SoC designs, and expanded competitive displacements at a leading mobile company for 5-nanometer and sub 5-nanometer designs.","Benchmark wins at a US-based graphics company with superior quality of results and turnaround time, a large cap US systems company selecting Fusion Compiler as its primary solution for digital implementation, and the US semiconductor leader who is aggressively expanding deployment of Fusion Compiler for its mission critical programs representing more than 95% of its business. While still early in our multi-year product cycle, these important wins represent significant momentum and usage share gains, setting the stage for revenue share gains going forward.","Turning to custom design, Custom Compiler revenue nearly doubled this year, fueled by multiple full-flow competitive displacements. Our expansion is driven by key wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets, including a Tier 1 North American server company, a large US high-speed communications chip maker and complete full-flow competitive displacements at a large IDM in Japan and a major DRAM company. We also announced a full-flow Custom Compiler platform deployment at Samsung for its five LPE process and are seeing good momentum with start-ups, who are not locked into a legacy flows and demand modern technology.","Let me now move to our Verification Continuum platform, where we hold the Number 1 market share position in both software and hardware. Benefiting from native integration of the fastest engines on the market, our verification software products continue to drive competitive wins and proliferation. Contributing substantially to growth are broad set of system houses and chipmakers ranging from cloud hyperscalers in North America to AI, automotive, mobile and memory leaders around the world.","Hardware-based verification was strong as well. Despite our largest hardware customer delaying delivery of a substantial number of emulators due to near-term spending priorities, we finished the year with a record hardware revenue. We maintain the Number 1 market segment position for the third year in a row. Our hardware products are particularly well suited to today's complex designs with unmatched speed, highest capacity, lowest cost of ownership and lowest power consumption. As a result, we significantly expanded our customer base, adding nearly 40 new customers and more than 80 repeat orders in 2019. We saw major expansions and share gains at influential customers ranging from prominent global systems companies to growing hyperscalers and leading semis. AMD, for example, standardized on ZeBu, expanding the emulation capacity to accelerate time to market for processor, graphics and gaming chips.","Now to IP. With strong market demand and our rich portfolio are driving double-digit growth. We had a record year, reaching more than $750 million in revenue, with prominent engagements across all major markets, including AI, automotive, cloud and 5G. As the Number 1 provider of interface, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest portfolio to address today's most complex design requirements, accelerate time to market and lower risk for customers. We have particular strengths in USB, memory interfaces and PCI Express 5.0.","This year, we achieved the significant milestone of $1 billion in cumulative USB IP bookings, bolstering our position as the Number 1 USB provider by far. And our new 56 and 112 gig SerDes IP is gaining good market traction. During 2019, momentum accelerated in automotive where we've achieved nearly 230 automotive socket wins and advanced FinFET processes across approximately 30 major semiconductor companies. We announced the collaboration with Infineon to incorporate the ARC embedded vision processor into their next-generation Rx controller to accelerate AI in automotive applications. From the embedded vision alliance, we were awarded the Best Process Award for 2019.","Finally, our track record of delivering IP and advanced process nodes continues and is highly valued by our customers. We achieved more than 250 IP wins on TSMC's 7-nanometer FinFET process and announced the collaboration with TSMC for development of IP on their most advanced 5-nanometer process, where we signed yet another significant multi-year agreement with a very large global customer. We're also seeing great momentum with Samsung Foundry process down to four LPE and global foundries across a range of processes.","Now to Software Integrity, the tools that test software code for security vulnerabilities and quality issues. We entered this new TAM in 2014. By the end of 2018, we had completed a number of significant acquisitions, integrated them into Synopsys and enhanced our products with new features and broader language coverage. In 2019, we completed Phase 1 of our Software Integrity strategy by delivering 10% of Synopsys' revenue and achieving approximately 10% operating margin. Although orders were a bit softer than planned, we outpaced the market with 19% growth. This was achieved through progress in driving multi-year multi-million dollar agreements, a steady increase in the number of customers adopting multiple solutions and growth in all of our key verticals.","In 2020, we are now moving to Phase 2, scaling the business to $0.5 billion and beyond. The opportunity is vast as companies must embed security testing into their software development process without compromising time to market. Synopsys is well positioned to enable this evolution with a great combination of high-value products and consulting services.","Our scaling efforts for 2020 span three areas. One, expanding Polaris, our cloud-based Software Integrity platform. We announced Polaris in Q2, including a compelling road map of product integrations and new capabilities over the subsequent 12 to 18 months. We've had a growing number of adoptions thus far,, including a Fortune 500 insurance company and customers ranging from financial services to networking to medical and industrial digitalization. Stay tuned as we expand the Polaris capabilities and enhance support of large deployments.","Two, scaling consulting engagements. This is where we help our customers with high-level benchmarking, program development advice, as well as large product deployments. It's a key Synopsys differentiator in the software and DevOps market.","And three, refining our channel. We've realigned our sales organization to better serve large enterprise customers, key market verticals and new regional business. In FY '20, we intend to further increase both our sales and support capacity. We believe we are on track to exceed market growth in this business, delivering approximately 15% to 20% growth over the next couple of years as the market evolves. For 2020, we plan to hold non-GAAP operating margin roughly steady then resume expansion in 2021 and beyond.","For Synopsys as a whole. In FY '20, we expect solid revenue growth even as we exclude from our forecast any revenue from companies currently on the US government's Entity List. Furthermore, we plan substantial non-GAAP operating margin expansion, mid-teens earnings per share growth and strong operating cash flow.","In summary, we executed very well in 2019, delivering financial results substantially above beginnings of year targets. Market demand is strong and we are well positioned. Our product platforms are driving benchmark wins and competitive displacements. And we are driving continued financial execution and growth. As we move into the holiday season, I want to thank our employees for their innovative and hard work and our partners and customers for their continued commitment to our products and trust in Synopsys.","With that, I'll turn it over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. 2019 was a very strong year. In spite of what was at times a tough macro environment, we achieved record results in all key metrics and finish well ahead of our initial expectations. We delivered these results despite multiple unique hurdles, including the operational transition to ASC 606, the US Entity List and general geopolitical uncertainty around the world. We delivered strong growth in revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow, while expanding non-GAAP operating margin by almost 3 percentage points.","We're entering 2020 well positioned to continue our momentum. Our product portfolio is as strong as it's ever been, which in combination with healthy design activity is driving robust demand. The result is reflected in our backlog, which ended the year at $4.4 billion up from $4.1 billion at the end of 2018 despite the ASC 606 backlog deduction. Our results speak to our solid execution and the durability of the business we built. Within approximately 90% recurring revenue model, a diversified customer base spanning multiple key verticals and geographies and a product portfolio consisting of mission critical tools, we are confident in our ability to deliver growth even in the context of an uneven macroeconomic environment.","I will now review our full year 2019 results. We generated total revenue of $3.36 billion, 8% growth or 9% adjusting for the extra week in fiscal 2018. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $3.03 billion, an increase of 7% or 8% adjusting for the extra week with both product groups contributing to the strong results. IP reported a strongest year-to-date and EDA software continues to grow well within our mid-to-high single-digit target range.","Revenue had another record year, reflecting the broad-based strength of that business. We again earned the Number 1 market segment position as growth in our diversified customer base more than offset a decline in emulation revenue from our largest hardware customers. Excluding hardware, revenue from that customer grew very well. The Software Integrity segment generated revenue of $335 million, 19% growth or 20% adjusting for the extra week. As Aart discussed, 2019 marks the key milestones, as we grew the business to approximately 10% of total revenue, a solid profitability.","Returning to the consolidated level, total GAAP costs and expenses were $2.84 billion, which includes approximately $47 million in restructuring costs as we work to optimize our resource allocation for sustainable long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $2.52 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25%. For our segments, adjusted operating margins were 26.7% for Semiconductor & System Design and 9.6% for Software Integrity. GAAP earnings per share were $3.45 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $4.56, 17% growth or 19% adjusting for the extra week.","Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was $801 million. We completed buybacks of $329 million in the year and $1.8 billion over the past five years, returning approximately 75% of our free cash flow to investors over that period. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $729 million and total debt of $138 million.","Now to our targets, which assumed no change in the US government's Entity List during the year. Based on our current assessment of the timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect the first half, second half split of roughly 45%, 55% for revenue and 35%, 65% for EPS, due to more evenly distributed expenses. For fiscal 2020, revenue of $3.6 billion to $3.65 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.934 billion and $2.983 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.63 billion and $2.66 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%, other income and expenses between minus $16 million and minus $12 million. Our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $3.72 per share to $3.90 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share and $5.25 per share, cash flow from operations of $800 million to $825 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $180 million, as project timing costs some of the spending plan for 2019 to push into 2020. We expect expenditures to decline in 2021.","Now, to the targets for the first quarter. Revenue between $805 million and $835 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $715 million and $744 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $635 million and $655 million, other income expenses between minus $5 million and minus $3 million, our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.43 to $0.54 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.89 to $0.94 per share.","In summary, our results this year reflect our strong execution and the resiliency of our business model. Our strength came from across the portfolio as we exceeded our near-term commitments and made significant progress on our longer-term operating objectives. As we look to 2020 and beyond, our focus remains consistent, strong execution to deliver on our long-term targets of high single-digit revenue growth, sustained margin expansion to the high 20s in FY '21 and 30% longer-term, double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth and strong cash flow. These metrics, combined with the capital allocation strategy built on balancing internal investments, M&A and buybacks give us confidence in our ability to continue to drive sustainable long-term shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we first turn to the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Good afternoon. Based on your annual profile or half-to-half profile, looks like you must be expecting significantly stronger hardware at least beyond the first quarter. Can you talk about if that's the case and what kind of visibility you have to that hardware ramp and if that includes a significant pickup from the large customer that was down last year and the hardware shipments?","Trac Pham","Hi, Rich. That's part of it. Yes, it's a combination of both IP and hardware deliveries that is affecting the quarterly profile.","Rich Valera","Got it. And can you just talk about your visibility to that, is that something that's kind of in backlog or how -- what are sort of underpins the visibility, particularly the hardware since that tends to be a little more volatile than the subscription revenues?","Trac Pham","Yes, you've taken a good point, which is that hardware and IP generally is more variable from quarter to quarter. And the way that we're projecting revenues for this year is no different than how we have done in the past. It's a combination of what is in backlog, as well as our assessment of our ability to close the deals that are in our pipeline and both in IP and hardware. So, it really does reflect our best estimate of the profile at this point.","Rich Valera","Great. Just quickly, it looks like SIG was a little bit light in the fourth quarter and you've moderated, I think, your longer-term target that had been 20% is now 15% to 20%. Is there anything structural you're seeing in that business? Or there is sort of large numbers as you grow it? How should we -- what accounts for that sort of moderation of that growth target there? Thank you.","Trac Pham","Yes. Rich, that's a good point. I'll start with the second half of your question, which is, is there any fundamental change in the business? And we don't see it that way. Certainly, we're very optimistic about that business and we do see a good outlook for it. We did see some challenges this year, which we were quick to address and we feel good that we should be able to continue to grow at the market rates or higher. And it is natural to us, it's a -- the natural ebbs and flows of growing the business.","Rich Valera","Great, thank you. Congratulations on a good year.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mr. Steves, your line is open. You might have your phone muted.","Mitch Steves","Hey, sorry about that. Can you hear me?","Trac Pham","Hi, Mitch.","Aart de Geus","Now we can.","Mitch Steves","Sorry about that. So, I have really two questions. Unfortunately at the pick on track a little bit here, but, so if I look at the numbers from the guide you guys are giving us like kind of like 21%, 22% operating margin for Q1, but that implies the kind of the rest of the year that Q2 to Q4 is going to be around 28.6%. So wouldn't that mean that basically by '21, you're kind of getting close to high 20s starting the year or am I doing the math incorrectly there?","Trac Pham","Well, certainly for the full year, we expect to be around 27% operating margin. As we've said in the past, the quarterly profile is really an outcome of the plan. Candidly, when I think about the budget for FY '21, 99% of my time is really been focused on the full-year plan and making sure that we've got an outlook for revenue growth that is sustaining where we are and are accelerating some areas, and then making sure that we're investing in the appropriate places, while simultaneously improving margins for this year. The outcome of the quarterly profile really is just the timing of these deals. So I wouldn't read too much into the quarterly profile, and I'll close it out by saying, we remain committed to our long-term commitment of high 20s in FY '21 and we will comment on that further as the year progresses.","Mitch Steves","Okay. And the second one to add is you guys did have done a few smaller acquisitions lately and that includes employee headcount. And so all of that is encapsulated in the full year guide, you guys are giving correct meaning that there's going to be no additional OpEx in that number?","Trac Pham","Yes, that's correct.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Trac Pham","All right.","Operator","We turn to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Tom Diffely, you might have your line on mute.","Tom Diffely","Yes, hello, can you hear me?","Aart de Geus","Yes, we can.","Tom Diffely","All sorts [indiscernible] comes today. Yes, so just a quick question. When you look at the outlook for 2020 and the nice margin profile, if you look at it on a year-over-year basis, how would you split the margin growth from product mix versus overhead absorption versus potentially a fine tune cost structure?","Trac Pham","It's really kind of across the Board. The progress that we made this year in 2019 in terms of improving it by 3 percentage points really came across all areas of the business. We saw it across the different business groups from sales from the G&A functions. And it's really a continued and broad-based effort. For 2020 and beyond that we'll continue to do the same thing. It's really fine tuning across all areas of the business.","Tom Diffely","Okay, great. And then when you look at items like IP and hardware that tend to be a little lumpier, is there any other -- are there any trends in 2020 we should know about as far as it can be fourth quarter weighted, it can be even after the first quarter, any other kind of trends on a quarterly basis?","Trac Pham","We could probably help you with the quarterly profile in detail, but Q4 would likely tend to be the highest quarter for us given what we are -- what our visibility is at this point from both IP and hardware.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then final question. Is IP fairly seasonal at this point? I feel like it's always a little bit higher in the second half of the year.","Trac Pham","We're not really seeing much seasonality in the business. And as we said, it really depends on the timing of when the IP has delivered or when the IP is pulled down by our customers. And you're going to see that variability increase due to 606. So, just keep that in mind, but overall, the demand drivers for IP continues to be really strong and that's reflected in our outlook for 2020.","Tom Diffely","Great, thanks for your time today.","Trac Pham","All right. Thanks, Tom.","Operator","And next, we turn to the line of Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Adam Gonzalez","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Can you just help us understand, I don't know if you guide out this far, but the revenue growth you expect by product group for fiscal '20, is it kind of in line with the longer-term targets you set out or is there any substantial deviation in any particular product group? Thank you.","Trac Pham","No, our long-term model spells it out pretty well between EDA, IP and Software Integrity. And typically, we don't break that down quarterly or on an annual basis. Our view is we do manage this business over a multi-year horizon and the beauty of it is that we have been pretty good about managing it within that range over time.","Adam Gonzalez","Got it. And the reason why I guess I asked that is because, there has been some weaker data points on enterprise spending overall. I'd imagine you are a bit more insulated from that given the relative size of your SIG business but are you seeing any kind of impact from that going into fiscal '20 or again, are you insulated from that? Thank you.","Trac Pham","Those sort of concerns are certainly factored into our guidance. I would reference you to how we performed historically and that's the great part of having a business that is close to 90% recurring is that there is adapting effect when things go through different cycles.","Aart de Geus","The other thing I would add to that is, certainly, if you look at the Software Integrity business, it's a business where we're actually very young in an emerging situation and so there are many, many customers that we haven't even touched yet. And so I think that is a fairly open space. Now overall, obviously, we're are subject to the fluctuations of the global markets. But from a technology utilization point of view right now, I think the demand for technology is quite high. And so the rates continues to be quite fast.","Adam Gonzalez","Great, thanks. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","And next, we turn to the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Hey, everyone. I appreciate you taking the question. It looks like you're not going to file your 10-K until January 1. So I was hoping that on this call, you can share with us your next 12-month backlog, which excludes non-cancelable FSA and future royalties?","Trac Pham","We actually don't disclose that information. What?","Lisa Ewbank","In the K.","Trac Pham","In the K, we will discuss that. Do you have that number? I'm sorry, I don't have that number off the top of my head.","Gary Mobley","Okay. Part of the question is, is that it looks like you could take you next 12-month backlog as you've been disclosed in your recent SEC filings and you divide that by your next 12 months revenue expectations, which is I think the critical juncture now. It looks like you're generating more revenue or expect to generate more revenue from next 12-month backlog. So, just hoping that maybe you can speak to, why you guys are sort of modeling in lower turns business as it relates to that?","Trac Pham","Well, I'll give you some specific numbers around that. The backlog that we have scheduled for FY '20 is roughly 65%, that's lower than it's traditionally been, mostly because of the transition to 606 and with a hard -- higher mix of hardware and IP. From a modeling perspective, when we take into account what we have visibility to from hardware and IP. The range and -- the range of how we're building the business between backlog and turns and what we have visibility to is pretty consistent with what we've been managing to over the last few years.","Gary Mobley","Okay. And could you give us an update on the degree of the impact from the Entity List, not specific to maybe the one big customer, but maybe in the entirety?","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, as you know, we don't disclose the specific customers, nor do we disclose the subset of customers. Obviously, it has a negative impact, but at the same time, the guidance that we gave, which I think is rather strong has fully encompass the facts that we assuming zero return or zero revenue from the Entity List customers. So if things change for the better, we will let you know of course immediately. But for right now, the wisest path is to not comment much more about the situation.","Gary Mobley","Okay, alright. Didn't you comment in the past that it could be 100 basis point impact to the top line?","Trac Pham","No, we have not provided specific numbers around that.","Gary Mobley","Okay. Alright, that's it for me. Thanks, guys.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","Next, we turn to line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","Thanks. Good evening, guys. First question is on the delay in the emulation and hardware, is this something that's just absolutely single customer specific or is it possible that it could be some symptom of a broader trend?","Aart de Geus","It was single customer specific.","Jackson Ader","Okay. Any -- just to follow up on that, any additional color on that, I mean, why the delay? Do you expected in, I think Rich asked earlier, what -- you expected in the first half or when the actual delivery will be, but any additional color you can give there?","Aart de Geus","No, we don't want to give color, because as you know, we always very cautious to not comment about specific customers. Maybe I can give a little color in a different dimension, which is we were quite diligent at finding opportunities to grow in a broader set of markets. And actually, if you look at our verification area and specifically the hardware, we did really, really well. And so, we have no doubt that the capabilities we offer, the very need for a lot of customers to run their software on prototypes where they don't have the real hardware yet, continues to be a great opportunity for us and we continue to both invest there and are bullish about the broader customer sets that we have.","Jackson Ader","Okay, thank you. That is actually helpful color. Then, switching gears to the Integrity business, the refining of the sales channel and looking to scale this thing to $500 million and beyond. So what do you think in the sales channel or sales processes needed to be refined relative to what you're doing in 2019? Any additional specifics you can give there?","Aart de Geus","Well, let me just take a first step back, given that we've had the unique experience of growing Synopsys literally through these phases as well. And I'm always thrilled by the fact that enterprises do go through different phases. And so, the $50 million company is very different than the $100 million and that in term is very different than the $0.25 billion [ph], and $500 million again is different. And the difference is essentially the complexity of how you manage not only internal product development and management, but also the external relationship with the customers. And this is certainly also true in the case of the Software Integrity group, because there too, there is also a bifurcation between large enterprise customers that typically are cautious and slow in adopting, but when they adopt they keep adopting and keep adopting and so they become over time the biggest spenders, versus many of the smaller agile companies that very quickly buy a few copies and then it's more ad hoc, how they expand. On top of that, you have the gradual broadening of geography, any of the startups that we acquired originally had certain geographies that they were focused on, we of course, are a global company and therefore open up broader domains.","And then the third one, which is maybe more marked here that was in the semiconductor domain we originally was in -- were in is that they deal with individual verticals. And so, dealing with automotive is different than dealing with the financial sector or the health sector and so on. And so, you have sort of these multiple variables and now the question is, how do you deploy and manage your salespeople and support people, I should say against that backdrop of multiple dimensions? And that's just another way of saying, one continually learns and evolves and as we are looking now to Phase 2, which is the crossing of the $0.5 billion and beyond, that is essentially what we are talking about when we are saying, we have the opportunity to optimize our go-to-market again. And no doubt in 1.5 years, we will say it again.","Jackson Ader","Okay, all right. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","And next, we turn to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. I'll ask both questions at the same time. First for you, Aart and then for, Trac. Aart, following up on the conversation we had when you were here in New York a couple of months ago, regarding the next big thing in EDA, you answered that prototyping, broadly speaking and new requirement and extraction would be the next growth driver for EDA. And by that you meant of course, not just hardware prototyping. And my question is, is this already showing itself in new business and how are you investing towards that since it's likely to be a multi-year phenomenon? And then secondly for Trac, you spoke of your largest customer in two separate ways, but we combine that and could you talk about the total business from the largest customer? In fiscal '18, according to last year's K, it was 15.4% of your business which worked out to just over $480 million and that was flat with '17, which have been up very strongly. So, many and now everything you just said about customer, did your business in fact grow either proportionately or in absolute terms? Thanks.","Aart de Geus","Okay, Jay. The next big thing and of course, next is always a function of short-term, long-term, medium-term, you name it. But we have to say, I sort of agree with my answer that I gave you a number of months ago, which is that the more systems we complex, the more it's necessary to essentially build mark-ups, we call those prototypes of them to see how well they work, because the working is often illustrated on how well the software runs and the challenges may very well be inside of the hardware. But in other words, you always have a very complex modeling proposition of how do you create a prototype of the hardware, the level of abstraction of the hardware to use that word and then run software on its agency, how fast is it? How much power does it consume, or there weird stops? What happens if something breaks, can you restart it if it's in the middle of some lock-up of things like that. And these things become a dramatically more important if the systems also impact life dangerous situations, such as driving a car or operating as some machinery. And it is very clear that a lot of the world is going is actually in that direction. So, how well have we done with that. Well, initially, we went after some markets that was considered to be extremely slow moving in stodgy and that was the automotive market, and that's quite radically changed a few years ago when two things happened. One is a car [indiscernible] Jeep and it was literally driven off the street by somebody using a cell phone. And secondly people suddenly saw the coming about of autonomous driving with all the potential and the challenges for security and safety.","And it's been quite remarkable to see how the OEMs. So these are the end car companies have in term pushed on their Tier 1, which is their supply chain, which in terms pushes on the semiconductor guys which is their supply chain to now start putting all of these capabilities in model, so that they can assemble at long before the car is actually already has a prototype. And so we've been central to that and it's been quite rewarding to see how quickly this has advanced on an industry that fundamentally for good reason has to be slow, because it has to be safe.","Now the concept I just described, actually happens in all of the more sophisticated electronic systems and this is only true also for a cellular phone that has a very short time to market where one can run the software on an emulator for example and actually discover surprises before I actually ships the product. So, that is one of the many directions that we are going into and it literally takes advantage of our entire stack of relationships in the supply chain and stack of relationships in the technology levels.","Trac Pham","Hi Jay, this is Trac. So to your second question, you will see in our 10-K filing in a couple of weeks that the revenue for our largest customer will be down in 2019, and that is strictly a function of the hardware decline. The rest of the business, EDA and IP, grew very well in 2019.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Got it. Thank you. If I could squeeze in one more, perhaps, regarding your headcount. Your number of AE openings has increased significantly and particularly in the Americas where they've nearly tripled over the last year and up by about 60% over the last year in Asia, flat in EMEA. So, maybe comment on what's driving that growth in AE rex? And is it coincidental indicator or leading indicator? How are you thinking about filling what is your second largest function by openings after R&D?","Aart de Geus","Jay, you always give me the best summary of our hiring practices. But the increase of AEs invariably has to do with either products that are in deployment and need support as we harvest the opportunity and that's certainly the case in areas such as Fusion Compiler, custom and many of the place of verification, or it is a gradual rebalancing of the geography make up as different parts of the world grow different rates or have different needs at various times. It is rarely the needs to increase specific skills, because our teams are actually quite strong and very broad, but every so often, bringing in some specialists, let's say, for example, in the prototyping or in the intersection of hardware and software can be quite beneficial as well.","So, the fact that we are hiring, I think you can take as a positive in general and adding much more, it probably enters the competitive knowledge space, I'll refrain from that. Thank you.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we turn to the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino","Hi, thanks for taking my question. One, kind of tying back to Aart's comments about the SIG margins, 27% operating margin guidance for full year, on track to do the high 20s in fiscal '21. But how should we think about the design margins versus SIG margins? Because I think, Aart, you said that margins won't be as expensive in 2020, but then ramp again in 2021.","Aart de Geus","Yes, that's correct. I think we said that we hold SIG probably roughly flat and now of course that means if the rest of the ops margin for the Company growth and everybody has to chip in. And we have obviously multiple parts in the Company, everybody is sensitized to the operating margin that we want to achieve for the Company. And so all of the BUs and subgroups are all focusing on how do we get there, while at the same time not making any compromises for future growth. And so, you are probably aware that somewhat loosely, we used the rule of 40 as a guideline and so there is room for people to make improvements to get there. But on a strongly positive note, I think, Synopsys throughout management is not only sensitize to this desire, but very committed and has budget and plans to get there. So, from year to year, I think different BUs will get a little bit more or less of a reprieve as a function of the investment needed or corrections or whatever else we need to do, but in aggregate, we all know that we want to deliver on the numbers that we are guiding you towards.","Jason Celino","Okay, great. And then maybe a little more clarification if you can on some of the fiscal responsibility you'd see in your EDA side, because the guidance would suggest most of that improvement would have to come from that business?","Aart de Geus","Well, realize, of course, that if figures roughly 10% of Synopsys is tuned by definition, the rest of 90%, and we have multiple very different efforts in EDA and we have a relatively large, but still less than a quarter of the Company IP business. And so obviously, between those different groupings, they all have to contribute. And if I'm not mistaken, all but one of the businesses are heading towards improving ops margin, one of them is heading a little bit more towards growing the revenue, but in aggregate, and it's sometimes difficult to measure because they intertwine in the deals and so on. But in aggregate, it's all heading in the same direction, which has put a dent in the rule of 40.","Jason Celino","Great, thank you. I appreciate the color.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","Next, we turn to the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Aart, I think in your prepared comments, you said the SIG group could be $0.5 billion in revenues next year. If that is the case, it looks like your Semi and Systems division going to grow only like 3%, which seems lower than historical. Is that a function of the Entity List or is there anything else going on there? And then I have a follow-up.","Aart de Geus","Sorry, if I was not clear enough, but my statement was that the next milestone is to pass $0.5 billion. I did not say that it would pass $1 billion next year. And so, we gave you a sense of the growth rate for SIG at 15% to 20%, which we think is a bit above the markets that it is in right now. And so, fundamentally, there is no real change in the past that Synopsys is on and all its components from what we did this year and the past year. We're fortunate to have a set of businesses that are all doing well, some are very profitable also. And so it's an aggregate improvement that manifest itself in the financial result largely because of many years of big investments and a number of, I think, really good acquisitions that got integrated well. So, we are continuing the pathway and if you want to get a different sense of Synopsys, then just graph our results over the last 10 years and then you'll see a very different level of stability of how we manage the Company.","Krish Sankar","Got it. It's very helpful, Aart. And then just as a follow up, a much more longer-term industry question. Given you guys have a good portion of FPGA, HAPS, hardware and also you completed the acquisition of the DINI Group recently, I'm kind of curious from your vantage point and it looks like five years or more than five years out, where do you stand on the durability of FPGAs for AI applications? Reduced down on the FPGA versus SIG debate.","Aart de Geus","Well, the AI field itself is a field that has its own specialty and many, many companies that all making different bets. And it's useful to take a small step backwards, which is fundamentally, AI has one need, which is much, much, much, much, much faster computation. Well, no matter how hard we push on Moore's Law and so on, that's hard to achieve. And so the answer by definition has to be therefore, architectures will become optimized for different applications. Now, architectures can mean chips, it can be groups of chips, it can be FPGAs, it can be a combination of things. And actually a number of the very large suppliers who provide combinations of processors together was graphics processors together was FPGA pieces, all with one objective optimize for an architecture that's appropriate for specific situation.","And so, in many ways, we ourselves have been a user of these capabilities, because of course, we use a lot of computation for our software tools. But the hardware tools that we provide is our own way to say for certain tasks, such as for simulation, we can do much better on an emulator or FPGA board. So, I expect all of these technologies to continue to evolve to continue to be available in various combinations and the race will continually be on of how do you build machines that can do really well.","My last comment is, we ourselves are the provider of tools to a vast, vast group of emerging AI companies. And this is encouraging, because I think those people will not give up for quite a while in trying new architectures and some will ultimately go into very large volume. And so, in many ways, we see a number of those companies as hard technology drivers for Synopsys. And business wise, we're doing very well with them.","Krish Sankar","Thanks, Aart.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","And speakers, we have no further questions in queue.","Aart de Geus","Well, given that, as you heard, we had a very strong '19. We have a great outlook for '20. The market around us, which was a bit soft last year, looks up slight bit. There are a lot of uncertainties as we all know, but meanwhile, I think we're executing well and this is also a good time to say thank you to you for your support. You're often provocative and stimulating questions and we'll be back with some of you in the next half hour or so. Thank you.","Operator","It does conclude our conference for today.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thanks Anna. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings Press Release.","In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings Press Release and financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today.","All of these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsis.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that synopsis continues to execute very well and delivered excellent Q3 results. Revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow were all ahead of plan. As a result of Q3 over achievement, and broad-based strength, we're raising guidance for the fiscal year. ","These achievements reflect our increased momentum, evidence invisibly strong results and outlook, product differentiation and technical strength and demand for advance solutions throughout our business. We're progressing rapidly on our journey towards $4 billion and beyond, while increasing value with operating margin expansion already visible in our bottom-line results.","Before I discuss the broader landscape, let me say a few words about the U.S.-China situation. The government\u2019s entities ban has affected our revenues somewhat. However, even assuming the ban remains in place for the rest of the fiscal year, we're raising our targets. Given the sensitivity for our customers we\u2019ll refrain from making any further comments.","We're confident in our outlook, despite the geopolitical and economic backdrop, as global design activity and customer engagements are thriving. AI, automotive, 5G, IoT, cloud and the proliferation of smart everything are not only growing segments, but also very competitive thus requiring the advance solutions that Synopsis has to offer.","After five years of substantial investments, our product platforms are the strongest they've ever been, putting us in an ideal position to benefit from the dynamic market trends. Notably, our new EDA products are winning share with competitive displacements at leading systems and semiconductor companies. We also had a record quarter with our broad portfolio of IP building blocks. Our IP offering is highly differentiated in driving time-to-market advantages for customers ranging from the largest market making companies to fast growing AI startups. ","While investing heavily in both EDA and IP, we've also diversified our business and customer base into the high growth software security TAM. Our products and services are increasingly mission critical for the massive amounts of software that permeates our everyday lives.","Our Software Integrity business is now at 10% of overall Synopsis revenue, is profitable and continues to scale well. We've accomplished all this, while beating our financial objectives, and raising our near-term and long-term financial ambitions. Building on our track record and the stability of our recurring revenue model, we're delivering significant margin expansion and solid double digit earnings growth.","From the perspective of our product platforms, let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with EDA. As a result of our intense multi-year innovation push in digital design, including new game changing products and major updates. Our technology is winning benchmarks and driving increased competitive displacements, especially at advanced nodes. This is evident in our results as revenue growth for digital has accelerated.","In particular, fusion compiler continues the strong momentum that began with its launch in November. It has won all head-to-head benchmarks completed to-date, with consistently better quality of results and runtime across multiple applications, be it mobile, 5G, high performance computing, data servers, automotive, AI, networking or graphics. We had several breakthrough competitive wins at noteworthy large semiconductor companies, including a significant competitive adoption at a leading U.S.-based mobile 5G company.","We also won a decisive benchmark at a very large Taiwanese semiconductor company and achieved the win for 5-nanometer arm based hyper computing designs at a new well-funded European customer. Also in Q3, the internal IP core group of an international mobile company standardized on fusion compiler for all CPU and GPU designs at current and upcoming advanced nodes.","A U.S. large cap systems company has selected Fusion Compiler as its primary platform for digital implementation. Finally, a premier U.S. semiconductor company is aggressively standing deployment of Fusion Compiler for its mission critical programs, representing more than 95% of its business.","Turning to custom design, Synopsys is gaining share, bolstered by 30 plus percent revenue growth for Custom Compiler over the last four quarters. Our expansion is fueled by key wins in the 5G, AI and server chip markets, including a Tier 1 North American server company.","We've also began multiple full flow competitive displacements, including at traditional analog our customers, and during the quarter we won yet another major contract at the large U.S. high speed communication chip maker. These wins are a result of powerful innovations that are driving 3x to 5x productivity benefits, especially for advanced node design, and a unique technical advantage by partnering with our world class mixed signal IP team.","Moving on to our Verification Continuum Platform, where our early vision and technology strength have led to our number one market segment position. Verification software growth is strong, reflecting the impact of tight integration of the fastest simulation, with static and debug engines on the market, contributing substantially to this growth are large, influential cloud hyper scalars in North America notable evidence of the power of our solution.","Hardware verification is strong as well. For the third year in a row, we stand as the number one provider in hardware verification overall, as well as in the emulation and FPGA based prototyping subcategories. By delivering the fastest, highest capacity and lowest cost of ownership solutions, with a preferred choice for complex hardware software designs.","Hardware based systems have broad based appeal, from large processor companies to market leading systems houses, to emerging companies optimizing their software on hardware that is still in development.","In addition to high secular market demand, we are winning important design slots, and customer adoptions continue to grow substantially. In the first three quarters of this year alone, we added 32 new customers and have 74 repeat orders. The significant broad base growth has offset a year-over-year decline in hardware revenue from our largest emulation customer, driven by the timing of product shipments. We expect that total hardware revenue this fiscal year will match or even exceed the banner results from last year.","Now to IP, where strong market demand in our unmatched portfolio are driving double-digit growth. Q3 was a record quarter, including largest single IP order in our history with a prominent U.S. semiconductor company. We expect to deliver a record here as well. We see especially strong momentum in interface IP, where we are four to five times [ph] larger than our nearest competitor, along with memory and logic IP where we also lead the market.","We're proud of our long positive track record of providing early availability of high quality IP at the key manufacturing processes. This commitment to vital technologies has driven our ongoing success from one IP generation to the next. As an example, our USB titles alone, past 1 billion in cumulative bookings this quarter.","Cloud computing, particularly AI accelerators and hyperscale data centers is driving substantial growth. Market makers in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific are adopting IP across our portfolio at a rapid pace. Also strong our processers, particularly machine learning and AI engines for embedded vision, driven by top semi and systems companies.","After significant investments to enhance our portfolio for automotive reliability and safety standards, we achieved another important milestone with ISO 9001 Certification of our IP Quality Management System, setting the foundation for further growth.","Finally, we saw continued strong momentum in mobile, with multimillion dollar agreements at multiple global leaders. Which brings me to Software Integrity, where the combination of rapidly growing market needs and our wide-ranging and evolving portfolio are driving approximately 20% growth this year. We not only offer the broadest portfolio of tools and services, we're moving to the next level of impact and ease of adoption with our new Polaris Software Integrity Platform.","Announced in Q2, it's a cloud based platform with a compelling integration roadmap for continual rollouts over the next 18 months. Polaris is drawing positive and growing interest from a wide range of customers. Building on the first adoption by a Fortune 500 insurance company in May, we received several new orders in Q3 from customers ranging from financial services to networking to a highly recognized beverage company.","The acquisitions and integration of Black Duck and Cigital have been essential in building the leadership position we have today, as recognized by Gartner and Forrester. Addressing fundamental code quality and security, analyzing and flagging suspect open source code and engaging with enterprise customers, both technology up and management down are enabling high level strategic relationships.","Renewal rates are up and we continue to see longer duration multimillion dollar agreements. Building off the current base of more than $300 million in revenue and increasing profitability we're enthusiastic about the long-term potential of this business.","In summary, strong execution delivered excellent Q3 results, and we\u2019re raising our annual revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow guidance. Design activity continues unabated. Our product platforms are the strongest they've ever been and they're driving technology wins and competitive displacements. Finally, a sincere thank you, to our employees for their continued commitment to our customers and to the long-term success of our company.","With that, I'll turn it over to Trac.","Trac Pham ","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. In Q3, we executed another strong quarter, delivering record results for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow. We also implemented a $100 million buyback bringing our total repurchases for the year to $229 million. Further, we continue to expand operating margins and expect to deliver nearly 300 basis points of expansion for the year, reaching approximately 25% non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of guidance. We are on track for another outstanding year, reflecting the strength of the first three quarters and a robust outlook that I will provide shortly.","First I'll review our Q3 results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated consolidated total revenue of $853 million or 9% growth with a broad based strength across both our segments. Semiconductor & System design revenue was $769 million, while Software Integrity revenue was $84 million. This quarter, our Semiconductor & System Design segment was bolstered by strong customer demand and the timing of customer pull downs of our IP products.","EDA software continues to perform very well within the Semiconductor & System Design segment. Although EDA hardware revenue declined year-over-year against a strong Q3 in 2018. Despite quarterly hardware variability, we do expect our total hardware business for the year to meet or exceed last year's record results.","Consolidated total GAAP costs and expenses were $725 million, which includes approximately $19 million in restructuring costs. As we work to optimize our resource allocation for sustainable long-term growth. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $636 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25.4%. At the segment level adjusting -- adjusted operating margins were 27.1% for Semiconductor & System design, and 10.5% for Software Integrity.","Note that certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level have not been allocated to our segments. GAAP earnings per share were $0.65 and non-GAAP earnings per share $1.18.","Turning to cash, operating cash flow was $370 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $687 million and total debt of $142 million. Now to our targets, which excludes any revenue in Q4 from companies currently on the government\u2019s Entity List. ","For fiscal 2019 revenue of $3.34 billion to $3.37 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.8 billion and $2.852 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.5 billion and $2.532 billion; resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of approximately 25%; other income and expenses between a minus $4 million and minus $2 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; operating margins -- outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $3.11 to $3.24 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.52 to $4.57 per share; Cash flow from operations of approximately $750 million; and capital expenditures of approximately $230 million, as $40 million of spending was shifted to fiscal 2020 due to project timing. ","Now to the targets for the fourth quarter: Revenue between $830 million and $860 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $701 million and $733 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $630 million and $650 million; other income and expenses between minus $2 million and zero; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million; GAAP earnings a $0.69 to $0.82 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.10 to $1.15 per shift.","To conclude, our execution to three quarters demonstrates our ability to pursue growth in a variety of macroeconomic conditions, while maintaining focus on our longer term operating objectives. We continue to execute very well, both financially and operationally. We are significantly exceeding our beginning of the year objectives with high-single digit revenue growth, substantial operating margin expansion and solid double digit EPS growth. ","And we continue to return a large portion of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of buybacks. With the power of our portfolio and business model, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable, long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Maybe just to start off, your tone on the digital side was perhaps surprisingly positive, you mentioned that you basically won I guess all of your head to head benchmark, which is pretty significant. So just wanted to sort of get a your sort of state of the market there in digital and thoughts on how that's going to play out over the next year or two. I think you sort of admittedly came from a position of perhaps being behind and obviously invested a lot here. So just wanted to sort of get your updated thoughts on the digital marketplace?","Aart de Geus","Well, we've had the lead position actually for multiple decades. And at any point in time, one has to look at when to make big investments. And over the last few years, we made some very big investments, because we have come to the clear conclusion that individual products would gradually start to not get as good results instead of bringing them together. And so Fusion Compiler is the prime example for that, where the intersection of synthesis with place and route and a few other capabilities, is now generating really good results.","And of course, you have high hopes for such a thing, but it's until you have actually real results that customers pay attention. And even then they go through benchmark and then to trying a few blocks and then to gradually institutionalize plan of record utilization over much broader set of chips.","And so we introduced Fusion Compiler, I believe, last November or so. And so far, the results are truly stellar. And we're making very rapid advances. So that doesn't mean there's not a lot of work to be done. But it also means that I think we have still better results to deliver because this is the new platform for us.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then just on Software Integrity, it sounds like you're seeing what you hope to see with Polaris, which is more sort of larger and longer duration deals, but it does look like the growth may have slipped a little bit in the third quarter. I'm assuming that's just sort of lumpiness and that you still see this as a 20% growth business sort of medium term here?","Aart de Geus","Yes, that's the way we're looking at it. Of course, from quarter-to-quarter, it can vary. It is useful that you highlighted Polaris though. Because I'm a strong believer that right now there's so many companies all dealing with sort of snippets of security all over the place. And for all the large companies at some point in time, they want to have some more stability in how the Head of IT or the CSO, or anybody else who's in-charge of all the software in a company, to have an ability to not only bottom up, bring productivity, because you can destroy productivity if you're not going after security particularly well.","But just as much bring some degree of controllership top down as to what portions of the code have actually been verified. And so it's in that context that, while the development of Polaris is a multi-year effort, and we will gradually bring in more and more of our products. The vision is clearly viewed positively and the first implementation with the Coverity tools is actually doing well.","Rich Valera","Got it. Thank you very much, Aart. ","Aart de Geus","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davison. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. I was hoping to get a little bit of clarity on, how you see customers during times when business slows down a little bit? What is the normal course of action that comes again trimming the number of concurrent projects they work on? How long does that take to impact you? And is that being completely offset by just the complexity of designs today?","Aart de Geus","Okay, this is a multi-faceted question. But generically speaking, in the semiconductor industry, the variability as a function of up and down revenue is highest for people that supply everything that has to do with volumes or equipment, for example. And is actually lowest for people that have to deal with R&D, because all the R&D plans are multi-year plans. And just because a year is particularly strong or weak, doesn't really change that all that much.","Now I\u2019m the first one to say, rich customers are better than poor customers. But nonetheless, the fact remains that we are in a segment and Synopsys particularly has benefited from that, of bringing stability in times of questions, and the ability to really scale rapidly when things go well.","Now, simultaneously, I think you asked also a question on the growth of complexity. And there, in many ways the good old Moore's Law [ph], more transistors we sort of know how to do that. And not that it ever gets easier, but it never gotten easier and we've always managed just fine.","I think, the interesting new problems that is at the intersection of semiconductors and systems, specifically, when you also connected to software. And we are investing substantially in that. To be honest, I forget if I mentioned, the automotive effort, where we're doing very well. And that's a perfect example of people wanting to test the automotive software before the electronics are done. So systemic complexities is as much of an opportunity for us as anything.","Tom Diffely","Okay. So you don't see kind of major material impact to R&D budgets, when customers go through a tough period like they\u2019re right now, semiconductor world?","Aart de Geus","Well, everybody, when they go through a tough time, they do look at their budgets, and they reorient towards what will have the most impact. But it's actually fairly rare that people would cut R&D people. And so it's more that they prioritize those things that have the biggest potential as a downturn fades away to come back up.","The other maybe comment to make is that this is also a good time where people relook look at the IP, because a lot of companies do their own IP still and they discover that we can provide a large number of extremely sophisticated blocks. And that accelerates their ability to go to market, while not having to use their most valuable engineers on these difficult blocks. So downturns actually have interesting enough opportunity for us because fundamentally, we are a productivity enabling company, and that's what they need.","Tom Diffely","Okay, thanks a lot. That clarity helps.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. So I got two, but the first one, I'm going to start off is kind of the tougher one, given the accounting changes. But when we look at the core EDA business that\u2019s actually down year-over-year for a couple quarters now. Can you maybe help us one understand the accounting behind it? And then secondly, how we get comfortable around high-single digit growth considering it's been down for a couple quarters now?","Trac Pham","Yes, let me start with -- answer your question directly. The -- when you look at the profile for EDA, what you're seeing this year is just the variability in emulation hardware. Keep in mind that the hardware piece shows up in two places emulation is in EDA, and then half the FPGA prototyping should show up in IP and systems integration. And so you're seeing variability in that number.","If you were to adjust for the hardware piece that's showing up in EDA. And keep in mind that last year was a record year for emulation, you should see a very good, mid to high single digit growth in that area. And that's very much in line with the -- the EDA software is growing in that range, pretty much in line with what we've previously communicated.","Mitch Steves","Okay, perfect. And then the second one I had is just more of a technical one, maybe this is more for Aart, but meta [indiscernible] chips we came out with some other interesting design, including these large platters of 1.2 trillion transistors, and they kind of made their own tools or EDA tools. So, I guess, maybe you can comment on that, if that's a viable model in the future? And then maybe how Synopsys would fit into potential designing or something like that in the future?","Aart de Geus","Well, we happen to know them very well. And so I'd be careful what we comment. You may know that I think it\u2019s already in the 80s that there was sort of an effort to see could one make essentially chips that would cover whole wafer and connect them creatively. And at that time, the yields were just too questionable to be able to do that, effectively.","Depending on what node you pick now, the yield can be actually very, very good. And so the fact that they're attempting to put such an astronomical number of transistors on a wafer is to say the least one for the Guinness Book of Records. But it will be interesting to see how well this finds utilization by the customer. And I've not yet seen any of the results that you can get in terms of using this on AI machine learning problems. But that's clearly what they're going after. ","And generically speaking, I think there is no doubt whatsoever that in the next multiple decades, the hunger for more machine learning computation will be unstoppable. The challenge is going to be, so how do you actually do it in practice, how do you do it at manageable levels of power, how do you connect all of those things? And there's a plethora of efforts with different packaging forms. And the whole wafer approach, I think, at least the pictures I would say were pretty cool. I must say that.","Mitch Steves","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi guys. Wondering, if you could just go and give us a little bit more color on you mentioned the strength in IP was from the timing of IP drawdown. Any additional color as to the areas and if we should think that that strengthened drawdown will continue into the fourth quarter?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think in general, what we've seen now over multiple years is that the reason IP is growing, is not only because reuse of IP is completely acceptable. So there's no longer any sort of form of macho has got to do my own IP that there is a -- use your best people to solve problems that you can solve by acquisition, as long as the price is right, of course. And so that has continued from a different -- two different dimensions. ","One is that many of these IP blocks themselves have grown in complexity dramatically. And so the USB family that I mentioned went through different versions. And the first ones look pretty simple. But the last ones aren\u2019t most definitely not simple.","And then on top of that these different generations of computation and these blocks are implemented in the most advanced silicon technology. And so you get sort of a multiplicative effect of difficulty. And this is precisely why I think this is a very strong business for Synopsys. Because, we've gone through pretty much every challenge and difficulty in getting these things to work. ","And far from me to say that it's perfect, but we have a trust relationship with the customer where at the end of the day, we make things work. And I think we are great provider to continue to see that.","Maybe one more comment. Large companies have used IP often on and now starting to grow their IP utilization. And actually, it ties directly to the previous question of how -- can you increase productivity in market times that may be more challenging. But the other observation is that new startup companies, they never think twice about it, it's immediately what can I put on the shopping list. ","And now I have to do all the rest. And suddenly, all the AI startups fall in that category. So I do think that we have a very good run path or roadmap for this. Not that these IP box will ever be simple, but I think the very fact that they're complex is good for us.","Sterling Auty","Sounds good. And then one just follow-up Trac for you, looking at the buildup to cash flow in the quarter. It looks like deferred revenue was actually cash outflow for the second straight quarter. Anything that we should think about either in terms of timing of renewals or anything the outset would have contributed to that?","Trac Pham","No, I wouldn't look at the deferred as an issue. When I look at the business for Q3, and the quality of our bookings, run rate was up healthy. And we'll -- we're going to show this in our Q next week when we report it that backlog was actually steady from quarter-to-quarter. So from that perspective, the business is growing very nicely.","Sterling Auty","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Hi, everyone. I want to start with a question about the repeatability of the IP strength. And you mentioned a largest order in the company's history, I presume this was some sort of multi tens and millions dollar platform license agreement with a key U.S. customer I think you specifically cited. ","So I'm just curious if there's going to be more of these types of license agreements? And related to the increase in IP revenue, specifically, the mix was up rather substantially in spite of that. You showed a sequential improvement in the operating margin for the Semiconductor & System design business. So I'm wondering, what's the -- what was the catalyst there? ","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, we do think that the IP business will continue to grow. You don't get every day very, very large deals but -- or transactions. But in general, yes, it is multi-year and it's also broadening in terms of the offering that we\u2019ll make available to customers. And, think about it a little bit as they go to a restaurant, and they can sort of pick from the menu, but it's prepaid. And that makes everything simpler over multiple years.","Now, having said that, the investments will continue quite heavily in this area, because the evolution is so rapid. And that also means that we have to be well aligned with the semiconductor foundries that provide the silicon technology so that things are ready on time. I thought there was a second half of the question, I forgot what it was?","Trac Pham","Yes. There was a question on margin.","Aart de Geus","Yes, on margin.","Trac Pham","Let me address that, let me address the margin piece. Overall, when you look at the margin profile for the business, we've been running pretty steadily at 25% for the year. And when you look at the midpoint for the year, we're on track to hit that number for FY 2019. So there's a pretty strong increase in margins from last year to this year. So what you're seeing is less a mix as opposed to a deliberate and concerted effort to increase the operations. ","Gary Mobley","Okay. Just a follow up to the operating margin question. One thing that is glaring is no mention of the goal to achieve high 20% operating margin for fiscal year 2020. So I'm wondering if that was a conscious omission, or are you guys still committed to that?","Trac Pham","Yes, when we last talked to investors in April, we talked about driving margins to the high-20s by FY 2021 and the 30%. over the longer term. We are -- we remain committed to that. There is no mention specifically about FY 2020. Because we'll come back to you in December and give that more specific guidance, but there is no change to our margin outlook. ","Gary Mobley","Okay. Last question, if I can, your cash flow from operations, and maybe not so much the free cash flow this year. But you're definitely generating more cash flow than you're buying back in stock, almost a glaring amount. And so your debt, presumably be paid off in four or five months' time? And with maybe a slower pace of acquisitions? Should we think about your capital allocation as increasingly being skewed to stock buyback?","Trac Pham","I think we've done a pretty good job balancing the use of cash for the last few years between M&A, organic investments and buybacks. Our history has shown that we're pretty diligent about returning a substantial amount of free cash flow to -- via buybacks. We haven't changed our approach to that. From quarter-to-quarter, it may vary depending on the situation, but our overarching approach to capital allocation and capital returns remains the same.","Gary Mobley","Okay, congrats on the results. Thanks, guys.","Aart de Geus","Thank you. ","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you. Good evening. Trac first for you just to clarify the answer you gave to Sterling earlier, you're saying that your backlog as of the end of Q3 was again $4.3 billion. ","Trac Pham","That's correct. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Aart and Trac, you mentioned, I believe that you're anticipating that the hardware business for the year will match what you did in fiscal 2018. Given the magnitude of the declines in hardware year-to-date, for combined emulation and prototyping, would it be fair to say that you are in effect anticipating in fourth quarter a record for hardware revenues that would impact the substantially beyond the prior record set back in Q2 of fiscal 2018?","Trac Pham","Actually Jay that's not the case. The -- hardware is actually been fairly steady throughout the year, the mix routine emulation and the FPGA prototyping is different than it was last year. But it's -- we're not anticipating a steep ramp up in Q4.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. And related question though, on hardware. One of the things that we've observed for all of the big three, so you mentor and cadence is longevity of demand for aging systems, hardware versions that have been in market for some time, cadence have seen this mentor has had quite strong quarters over the last couple of years, even though the longe has been out or the current version of the longe has been out for some time. ","So my question is, what is it that induces customers to order or reorder somewhat older hardware technology? And when you look at the possible refresh of your hardware, earlier today, Xilinx [ph] announced a very large FPGA, which would seem to be the kind of chip that you would want to incorporate in a next generation chasse for both ZeBu and HAPS, but it's not coming out till fall of next year. So assuming you want to incorporate that particular chip into your next generation of hardware, how do you sustain the demand for hardware over the next year or so?","Aart de Geus","Well, starting at the beginning of your question, one of the reasons at least for us, and I think we are a little different than our competitors, because we are focusing really very hard at the intersection between hardware and software, we think that's where the biggest opportunity space is. Now that our machines cannot also be used with just simulation acceleration. ","And so that space on its own, in my opinion, is going to continue to grow because more and more people want to run software on systems where the time to build the systems is long, and the risks if they don't check it out early is that they will miss the windows, on the market. So therefore, the software and the hardware has to be developed in parallel. And so we support that I think extremely well, and literally from day-to-day better.","And again, maybe the most visible simple example is automotive, where putting a car together takes five to seven years. And so if you start to software at the last hour, this thing will never go to market.","The second comment is now specifically on our technology. We are FPGA based and so we have the benefit of being able to move forward with the different generations of FPGAs, we have excellent relationships with the people that provide those. And so we are any point in time well clued in as to what will matter and what will not. And our developments just continues. ","Lastly, you said that old systems can hang around for a long time? Yes, they do. And I think nothing wrong with that it's great return on investment for our customers. But at the same time new systems are substantially faster and have more capacity. And that is precisely what Synopsys has driven for a number of years in unexpectedly successful ways.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Lastly, with respect to services, you may recall I think with one or two calls ago, we talked about the role of services, particularly in the context of Cig and the introduction of Polaris. My question is, can you comment on how your services engagement pipeline looks, not only for Cig, but perhaps for IP as well, particularly given the magnitude of demand you're seeing now for IP. How are you looking at your services engagement pipeline, not only for that, but again, for Cig?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well for Cig, there's no question in our mind that\u2019s the acquisition of Cigital, but most importantly, the integration of Cigital with the product lines of Coverity and Black Duck and a few others, who have been absolutely essential. Because the Cig team is extremely capable of engaging with high level people and companies that are looking at how do they start getting a handle on security, as software is being developed. And that is precisely where we're focusing.","And so, I think that that integration has gone in many ways better than we would have hoped and is now in full utilization to continue to sell other product. It's interesting that you use the term services in IP, and I think it's probably right on, because IP is something between products and services. A number of the IP cores get optimized for specific customers or specific technologies. And increasingly, we're assembling subsystems under the directive, or together with the customer to drive their capabilities forward.","And so, while we don't really call out a particular service business, these multi-year IP transactions invariably have all kinds of development plans associated with them.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thank you very much. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome Jay.","Operator","our next question is from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer ","Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I'm just kind of curious, just given how critical your IP and products are to the semiconductor supply chain and just given how visible Huawei has become as to what could happen. What's the risk that other Chinese chip makers are kind of buying ahead or accelerating their plans, just out of fear? Do you see any evidence of that? And if that were happening, what evidence would you see? And then I have a follow up?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think it's a little hard to predict what's going to happen in that situation. And as we said, early in the preamble, we are sort of cautious to not make too many comments about China, as a number of our customers really need a certain degree of, let's say, privacy on that situation.","In general, not just China, any place in the world will be happy to sell things that people want for a longer duration and assets. Most of the larger IP transactions are multi-years, because the delivery of these large blocks themselves take some time. And secondly, the integration of those blocks into very sophisticated chips need support. And so multi-year transactions are absolutely the norm.","John Pitzer ","And then, Aart, there was another conversation about sort of basal [ph] level chips, I'm going to spend you think about the desegregation of the dyes that are going on with the chip of strategy, because some of the packaging technologies, and we even talk this week about building stacks upon stats on chips, where you have both memory and logic, how does that benefit your business over time?","Aart de Geus","We're sort of in the category the more the merrier, right? Leaning that, we are believers that the demand for electronic capabilities is insatiable. But the technology limits are very real. And so, while conceptually, it sounds relatively straightforward, why don't you just stack them on top of each other, like a high rise. We often forget that there's a big difference between a memory and a processor, because the memory is already a stack device today. Whereas the processor is also a massive heat source.","And so when you stack things, and there's also a lot of heat, you need -- suddenly it becomes complicated. Now, out of that, nonetheless, there are a lot of efforts to look at different forms of packaging. And we've seen this before, by the way. And we've seen that in the early 2000s, when the world was, hey, we're never going to go to smaller transistors. And then out of nowhere came, 15 years of FinFET. And then suddenly the interest for stacking was a little lessened. But I think he's going to come back and we're very involved in that. But it is truly a set of decision making that has both technology and economic constraints. ","And I do have high hopes that because of the demand that will overtime actually pay for some of these more expensive approaches. That's why we're all in on this.","John Pitzer ","And then my last question guys, just kind of the Software Integrity business and the ops margins, still a small part of the business but it\u2019s still about a 200 plus basis point drag on the roll ops margins. That make sense given that you guys are driving scale and revenue growth. I'm kind of curious, what's the scale volume level on the Software Integrity business when you start to get some more op margin more my vision is the march to 30. So the overall company part of that or is that separate?","Trac Pham","John, the way that I think about is that over the next couple of years as we drive margins to the high 20s by FY 2021. I would expect that Software Integrity would be approaching closer to the corporate average. Structurally there's nothing in that business that would prevent it from reaching that kind of margins with scale. But the key for us as we evaluate that business, it's still a very nascent opportunity, dynamic opportunity with a lot of competitive environment. So we want to make sure that we're making the right tradeoffs between growth and profitability.","John Pitzer ","Perfect. Thanks, guys. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","Our next question is from Gal Munda from Berenberg. Please go ahead.","Josh Tilton","Hi, guys, this is Joshua, hoping on for Gal. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on digital, you mentioned competitive displacements, is Fusion the key driver of that? And then are you starting to see signs of Fusion tech making customers stickier due to its forward and backward looking capabilities?","Aart de Geus","Well, I'm using Fusion as the best example, because it's the most powerful conjunction of multiple technologies, working extremely well together. Synthesis creates the structure of a circuit, place-and-route determines the actual location of everything. And those are the fundamental problems. But there are more technologies in that and surrounded by it. And so for example, you also want to optimize for timing for the lower power, maybe for some degree of yields and so on.","And so you can already see from that discussion that you have multiple forces interacting. And I think the strength of the approach that we have taken is that we have created an environment that allows us to bring all of these forces to bear at the same time. And what is exciting is that we are now winning hard benchmarks on the basis of putting this to use. ","What is also exciting is that I think it still has a long way to go in terms of further advances. But, our customers are pretty pragmatic. They've worked very hard to optimize circuits even a little bit. And so if you can get truly better results, and you can get them much sooner, they will move pretty quickly.","Josh Tilton","Thank you, that was helpful. And then just a follow-up real quick on China. Is that a fair assumption that the 60-40 split between semis and systems companies hold in that region as well? It just seems like a lot of the focus is on Huawei. And we don't hear much about the Baba, Baidu and Tencent chip initiatives?","Aart de Geus","The split of 60-40 is nothing new. We\u2019ve had that in the late 90s. And it's all a question of what do you call a systems company and what do you call a semi company. Typically, semi is when you stop at the chip, you finish the chip and then you sell it to somebody else. A system company tends to move from there and add to the chip, the software, the package, whatever all the electromechanical things.","And now -- so a phone company, a phone -- mobile phone provider would be a system company. And so the -- it's sort of a continuum between those. And what is interesting from our perspective is that, while many years ago, we clearly started in a very chip centric fashion. The importance of software was recognized by Synopsys already about 10 years ago. And we started at that time to invest in the verification and prototyping to verify things together. But we, by the way, also about five and half years ago invested in software, because we realized that software could become the killer in terms of getting to market with something that actually works.","Trac Pham ","Hi, John, this is Trac again. I just want to clarify my remarks earlier. I may have left you with the impression that Software Integrity was going to hit the corporate average by FY 2021. It certainly will progress to that, but not necessarily be at the same corporate average in the high 20s.","Operator","And our last question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino ","Hey, guys. Thanks for fitting me in. One question around your QTronic acquisition. I just want to clarify that that's not in guidance? And can you maybe provide some color and how that fits in with the rest of your portfolio? And then I have one follow up.","Aart de Geus","Sure. Yes, that's an acquisition that's not closed yet and therefore we would not put it in guidance, but it's also not material in terms of size. But it is an exciting acquisition, because it fits right into the center of that picture that I just painted of automotive companies looking at the software and the hardware simultaneously. And this company in particular has very good technology and experts in looking at how you test situations like that.","For the aficionados in the room it\u2019s called software in the loop, but that's probably going too deep on this topic.","Jason Celino ","And I mean, can you -- how many employees would that be adding?","Aart de Geus","About 60 or so. ","Jason Celino ","Okay, great. And one quick follow-up for Trac, the Cig margins were 10.5%, up 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, which is pretty good. But from a seasonality perspective, is there anything about Q4 from an investment or spend perspective that would be different than any of the previous quarters that we've seen?","Trac Pham","No, I don't see seasonality affecting that number at all. I think, while we've reached critical mass with that business being about 10% of overall revenues is still fairly small. So from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the profile of revenues or expenses, you're going to see that bounce around. But the good news is that over the course of multiple years, it's heading in the right direction.","Jason Celino ","Great, thanks. That\u2019s all for me. ","Trac Pham","You\u2019re welcome.","Aart de Geus","Okay, I guess that brings us to the end of this earnings release. Thank you so much for spending time with us. Hopefully, you took away that we sense a quite good degree of momentum and push forward. And that notwithstanding some of the turbulences around us, Synopsys is actually doing both very well, I think very stable in this context. So thank you for your support and questions.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Synopsys again delivered strong business, technology and customer results in Q2, meeting or beating every target we communicated last quarter. We achieved revenue of $499 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.66 and considerable operating cash flow. As a result, we're raising our non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal 2013 to a range of $2.37 to $2.42, representing solid, double-digit growth for the year. We're also raising our operating cash flow target to $375 million to $400 million. Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute.","Before discussing some highlights, let me comment on the customer landscape, which I would characterize as steady. Semiconductor companies continue to face significant competitive challenges. And while cognizant of ongoing uncertainty in the macro environment, the race for differentiation and time to market, product functionality and advanced technology continues unabated.","Synopsys has collaborated closely with market leaders for many years. With the high-value, but also, great technical challenges of the latest silicon technologies, more and more customer executives are sharing their future direction with us and how Synopsys is needed to get them there. As a result, we see continued successes and business strengths across key customer segments, the foundries, top IDMs and key fabless customers, particularly in mobile and cloud-related systems companies.","Let me provide a couple of examples. First, during the quarter, we renewed a significant multiyear agreement with Intel. Second, we've made excellent progress with a large semiconductor company, who had been a competitor stronghold for more than a decade. For a number of years, we have worked closely with them on their most advanced designs. This quarter, with a substantial long-term commitment, they moved to Synopsys as their main partner because of our technology excellence and dedicated support.","The common denominator driving the largest semiconductor and systems companies is their unrelenting demand for still faster, lower-power and broader-functionality chips. There is increasing commitment to the most advanced processes, as a growing group of customers joined the leaders in migrating to 20-nanometer, 14- and 16-nanometer and even below. The race to 3D FinFET design is very promising, as it has opened another decade of Moore's Law. Specifically, the low-power characteristics of FinFET transistors will impact end-product differentiation and is enabled by Synopsys' leading-edge design tools and IP. There's a rapidly growing set of engagements with customers designed to migrate to FinFETs. Production delivery of FinFETs designed with Synopsys tools has already passed 100 million chips. Our clear and longstanding focus on advanced technology not only positions us well for the future, but has already driven significant design and customer successes.","To date, 90% of 20-nanometer and below tape-outs have used Synopsys implementation, and we're already engaged all the way down to 10 nanometers. Because of the breadth and maturity of our tools, we believe that we have at least 1 year head start over any competitor.","To support this assertion, let me comment that we have been working on FinFET enablement for half a decade, and almost every FinFET design to date has relied on Synopsys. Our solution is truly comprehensive, ranging from TCADs to design tools to IP to sophisticated support. TCAD is used by foundries for simulation at the earliest stages of technology in FinFET development, giving us 6- to 12-month early access to foundry models. The resulting information feeds into the foundational technologies or HSPICE in extraction, where Synopsys tools are the gold standard.","From there, our IC Compiler, which is clearly the most advanced and production-proven FinFET physical design system, creates the layout of the chips. In addition, our analog\/mixed-signal designer verification tools are well ahead in terms of readiness and qualification for FinFETs.","We have been engaged in developing FinFET-based IP for several years now and have production-class memory and interface IP ready to integrate into our customers' SoCs. We're engaged with 5 foundries on developing a full range of production-ready IP for them.","Lastly, our IP design engineers have taped out multiple FinFET test chips for several customer processes. One example of our leadership is the announcement last week that FPGA provider, Achronix,  has standardized on IC Compiler and IC Validator and has taped out the industry's first commercial FinFET-based SoC using Synopsys tools.","At our Silicon Valley User Group meeting in March, more than 600 engineers attended a standing-room only FinFET panel, featuring Samsung, QUALCOMM, Cavium and GLOBALFOUNDRIES, sharing their early experiences in collaboration with Synopsys. In addition, you may recall that already in December, we announced a successful tape-out of Samsung's first 14-nanometer or low-power test chip. Samsung chose Synopsys as their FinFET partner because of a successful collaboration history and the comprehensive capabilities throughout our portfolio.","Now let me turn to verification, which is the largest bottleneck in system and chip design today. Synopsys has been developing verification solutions for many, many years and is the clear leader in both leading-edge digital verification, with about 70% of advanced designs utilizing Synopsys, and circuit simulation, where 19 of the top 20 semiconductor companies rely on us.","Verification is rapidly evolving, as chip complexity moves into its next phase. Two principles remain. Tool performance is key, and a complete home solution is increasingly a must. Today, our VCS simulator and ZeBu emulator both have the fastest run time in their respective categories. In combination with virtual prototyping and our FPGA-based prototyping system, we cover the entire hardware\/software verification space. With the addition of the most comprehensive open debug system, Verdi, and our next-generation verification IP offering, we now address the entire verification market with outstanding tools.","During the quarter, we delivered the first product's release of Verdi under Synopsys. The first is an aggressive roadmap of advanced SoC debug technology. Our integration is progressing very well, and customer reactions to our complete verification solution have been very positive.","The third area I would like to highlight is IP and systems, which represents about 1\/4 of our revenue and continues to see strong business. Synopsys is the second largest IP provider in the world, with 1,700 engineers designing commercial IP blocks, that give us the #1 position in interface, embedded memories and analog IP.","According to Gartner, Synopsys is the largest provider of physical IP, more than double the nearest competitor. We expect this area of our business to continue to yield double-digit growth. Top 20 semiconductor vendors continue to outsource more IP to Synopsys, trusting us to deliver high-quality blocks into their critical chips. The amount of IP these companies consume has increased by 5x over the past few years and now represents almost half of our DesignWare IP revenue.","This quarter, we also surpassed our 3,000th USB design win. Last year, our USB solutions shipped well in excess of 500 million units. And finally, our PCI Express solutions are well ahead of the competition. We are approaching 1,000 wins in our PCI Express family and recently passed compliance with 20-nanometer silicon.","In systems, we had our strongest bookings quarter ever for FPGA-based prototyping, with broad-based demands by some of the largest semiconductor and systems companies in the world. The promise of earlier development of software, as well as robust hardware\/software verification is driving continued demand for our outsourced solution.","In automotive, as software content and complexity continue to grow, our customers are taking advantage of our leading virtual prototyping technology, so they can start their software development earlier and accelerate system integration, test and validation.","Finally, our partnership with ARM continues to bear fruit as we released an ARM Cortex-A57-based virtual design kit, enabling our customers to create software for ARMv8-based designs up to 1 year before silicon is available.","In summary, as we reach the halfway point of the fiscal year, Synopsys continues to execute very well. Demand for technology is strong, customer momentum continues, and we again delivered very solid financial results. Consequently, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q3 and the full year. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise.","Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in February. Q2 financial results were highlighted by strong business levels, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. In addition, the revenue run rate is positive.","Now some additional detail. Total revenue was $499 million, an increase of 15% compared to a year ago and at the high end of our target range. Greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was greater than 4 years, reflecting a mix of contracts, including the impact of a large contract renewal. As a result, we now expect average duration for fiscal 2013 to be greater than 3 years.","Turning to expenses. Q2 total GAAP costs and expenses were $420 million, which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $16 million of stock-based compensation. Q2 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $365 million, an expected year-over-year increase, due primarily to increases in headcount and expenses from our recent acquisitions.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 27% for the quarter and 26% for the first half of fiscal 2013. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed towards the second half of the year. This is simply due to timing of expenses, such as employee compensation, some hiring that shifted to the second half and traditionally higher Q4 expenses.","However, for all of FY '13, we're still on track to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points over FY '12 levels. Our ongoing goal continues to be a focus on operational efficiency, with annual operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.44. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 25% to $0.66, slightly exceeding our target range, driven by expenses at the lower end of guidance and higher-than-expected other income. We are raising our annual EPS guidance to reflect our strong second quarter results and our confidence in the rest of the year.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter, and we continue to think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23% is a reasonable estimate for FY '13, reflecting the benefit of the R&D tax credit for FY '12 and '13. As a reminder, the reinstatement of the R&D tax credit has an impact of approximately $0.09 to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings.","Turning now to our cash and balance sheet items. During the quarter, we generated $134 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $375 million to $400 million. We paid back $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $120 million. We also purchased 1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $35 million, and have approximately $237 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.","As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $681 million, with 39% onshore and 61% offshore. We'll continue to optimize the use of our strong cash flow, whether on M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.","DSO declined 6 days sequentially to 46 days, and we ended Q2 with 8,195 employees with about 1\/3 in lower-cost geographies.","Now let's address our third quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $475 million and $485 million, a year-over-year increase of 8% at the mid-point. As a reminder, we do expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue going forward, driven by factors such as growing hardware business in emulation and prototyping, but continue to expect a 90% time-based revenue model. Total GAAP costs and expenses between $411 million and $428 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $365 million and $375 million; other income and expense between $1 million and a negative $1 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 24% to 25%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.28 to $0.34 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.53 to $0.55 per share; and we expect about 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.","Now our fiscal 2013 outlook. Revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14%, excluding the extra week in 2012. We've been able to maintain our revenue targets even in the context of the yen depreciation this year. Other income and expense between $5 million and $9 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 23%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.48 to $1.56, which includes the impact of approximately $67 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.37 to $2.42, which represents solid, double-digit year-over-year growth; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and as I mentioned earlier, we're targeting cash flow from operations of $375 million to $400 million.","So in summary, we're pleased with our strong Q2 financial performance and continued execution, which was highlighted by top and bottom line growth and solid operating margin. We're also pleased to provide increased EPS and cash flow guidance for FY '13.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Brian, just a question with respect to one of the comments you made. I think you said the revenue run rate was positive on the quarter, and I wondered if that also applied to the bookings run rate versus the prior years on average.","Brian M. Beattie","That's in fact how we do measure the revenue run rate, and so we're looking at the bookings and compare that to the beginning of the year, looking at revenue that we'd be expecting to get in the deals as we go forward.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So that exactly is your sort of standard measure of run rate?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and that was positive on -- in aggregate. And then, Aart, just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the IP business, which is clearly a big focus and a nice growth driver for you guys. Want to try to understand where the margin of that business is today. I believe it's below the corporate average. But where you see it today and where you see it going? And does that require any meaningful upfront investment for the move to FinFET, to sort of crank out all the different FinFET versions of these products which, obviously, you would benefit from down the road?","Aart J. de Geus","Okay. In general, that business is strong and we have continued our push to improve its profitability, at the same time balancing it, I think, well, with the amount of continued investment in creating the products available for next year. The good news is on the FinFET side, we have actually invested already quite a while ago. And so I think we're going to start to see the benefits of that, as the early investments will start to turn now into growing revenue from that. So I actually see it as a very positive outlook for that business.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And with respect to the Intel renewal, a couple of questions. First, was it really exclusively the Intel deal that drove up the average duration for the quarter? Were the -- was the rest of the business kind of in line with your norm? And two, would have thought that, all things equal, your deferred revenue would have gone up sequentially with that renewal in the quarter, but it actually went down a bit. Just wondering if you could comment on those couple of items.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, as you know, in general, we are very shy to comment about anything regarding a specific customer, and that includes Intel. Needless to say, this is an important customer for us and a significant agreement. Let me not break it out further, given that we really don't want to comment about the specifics of the transaction.","Brian M. Beattie","And to your question on deferred revenues, Rich, just recall that increases in deferred revenue happen only when we're able to invoice the customers.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","So could I take it that maybe you didn't yet invoice for that particular large deal?","Brian M. Beattie","Same comment in terms of providing, we don't provide the details of the individual accounts.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And I understand you don't want to provide the duration of that specific deal, but can you say if we should be expecting any change in duration going forward? Any other -- whether -- any other change in your average duration other than that one deal?","Brian M. Beattie","What we do is look at the total weighted average renewal lengths that we've been able to close in the quarter. And the impact, as we said, for Q2 was that it became greater than 4 years, and then the impact, as we look at bookings perspectives for all of FY '13, will be just over 3 years as well.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There are a few of them. Aart, in the past, you have spoken about growing your IP business in the double-digit range, or the low-double digits. Is this still the target for this year? And can you talk a little bit around the competition now that Cadence has Tensilica?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, we have not changed our outlook. We think that this is a part of our business that is growing in double-digit range. We foresee it to continue to be there. And of course, at any point in time, we're dealing with a variety of competitors. And I think that is more an indication that it's a healthy business than anything else.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, all right. And then, on the emulation side of the market, after you guys purchased EVE, can you talk about what kind of trends you're seeing there? I know that everyone believes in it being a secular grower. Are there any cyclical trends within that, because 2 of your competitors have 2 different views, at least for this year on how the emulation revenue is going to trend? And along the same path, when I look at your operating margin or the margin profile, you're going to improve your margins in IT business. How was the margins on the emulation business? And where do you think it can get to?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, let me go backwards. We actually do not break out the margins of any of the individual businesses, partially because there are some fluctuations as we decide to invest or not. The key objective, of course, is to manage the overall profitability of the company to be in line with our even higher-level objective, which is to grow the earnings per share in high-single-digit range. And so all of this fits together nicely in that regard. As we look at EVE particularly, we are now in the very interesting phase of integrating it, while we simultaneously are integrating the debugging capability acquired from SpringSoft. And so our aim and objective is really to now take what is a fabulous collection of really best-in-class technologies and deliver a well-thought-out integrated platform. And EVE absolutely is a key piece in that. And so far, I think that's going very, very well.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And then the final question, on the FinFET side, clearly, you guys have a lot of experience on the FinFET design. When you contracted [ph]  the foundries, most foundries are expected to start manufacturing FinFET-based chips some time next year. I don't think there's any specific timing quite yet. But when you look at it, is the challenge in FinFET more on the design side? Or do you think its more on the manufacturing side?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I don't want to be not humble and say, \"Well, it is hindsight. We have it sort of under control.\" But the reality is I think it is both, meaning that these are new structures that are simultaneously being introduced with much, much smaller nodes. So that's sort of squaring the complexity of the problem and simultaneously achieving much higher density of transistors, which brings a lot of challenges for the tools. The only reason that I speak with, I think, a fairly high degree of confidence is we have already helped customers tape out chips that are on the market today with this technology. And in that sense, the proof of concept is beyond concept, that is absolutely in production. Now having said that, there's no question that there are multiple players that are all racing forward to deliver their own version of this technology, and that requires adjusting to their specific technologies, adjusting to how they would like to see the designs come together. And we are extremely engaged in -- with all of them, which, from my perspective, is a really, really positive sign because I think that FinFET is one of the enablers for truly a next generation, meaning a decade or so, of advanced design. And I think this is moving at super high speed.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if we could approach it this way, if you take out your largest couple of deals, was the duration of the rest of the contracts below 3 years or above 3 years.","Aart J. de Geus","I think, let's not go too much into trying to reverse engineer all the numbers. Fundamentally, our business has not changed. And in aggregate, we have always said that the balance of transactions that we do is in the 3-year range. In the last few quarters, it was a bit lower. Before that, it was a little higher. But fundamentally, there's nothing that would indicate to me that our business is changing. Everything else, I think, we're not going to go into further, if you don't mind. Thank you.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And what year -- as we think about the collections through the year, you do have a seasonality to it. Given the increase in cash flow for the year, would you say that your second half collections are going to be above seasonal as compared to the past?","Brian M. Beattie","You're right on it. They're typically higher in the third quarter. That's what we've seen every year and still expect then, we have a second half which is stronger than the first half. And with the confidence we had and the business activity, we had increased confidence in cash flow, primarily around collections. And so that is looking better for this year and allowed us to raise guidance.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You mentioned the FX impact. You've been able to hold the revenue guidance. As you look at the pipeline for the back half of the year, is there any concentration in terms of either bookings in the pipeline or other that we should think about being -- coming out of Japan?","Brian M. Beattie","I think let's just align on the question. It's really a perspective for foreign exchange, is that we typically hedge off all the expenses as we operate around the world. But in this past 6 months or so, we have seen a notable devaluation in the yen. It affects the revenues, most of the revenues out of Japan, not all of them. And as we look for the year, we've been able to offset that impact. We have not had a material impact to any of the key line items, in particular, in terms of earnings per share, and just been able to offset that with good operational performance. We've been able to hold our revenues for the year. And just good hedging, the natural hedging, and managed it to have a very minimal impact to the year and even allowed us to raise guidance. So this year has been very good from a yen perspective. We typically don't have any fluctuations to the budgets we set for the year because of all these programs that I just went through. And at the end of the day, with Japan and the economy is expected to pick up as a result of this devaluation in the long run, we think that's good for our customers as well.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","All right, great. Last question, Aart, can you just kind of maybe characterize where we are in the transition? It seems like 20-nanometer might be a little bit of a transition node. Do you agree with that? And kind of where are we in the move to the next big node in terms of tooling?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we are definitely seeing the number of designs growing in the 20-, 22-nanometer node. I concur with the general feel of somewhat of a transition from 28 to 14, 16. And the reason that's a little bit of a misnomer is because the transition to FinFET is actually the important driver, not necessarily the node size, although the 2, of course, interact. And the reason the transition to the FinFET is so enticing is that it really changes the performance power nature of the transistor, and that has been one of the increasing or the difficult bottlenecks in semiconductors. And so, that being the opener to a next volley, so to speak, the race is obviously on. But it is also fair to say that a number of customers will land, at least temporarily, on the 22 -- 20-, 22-nanometer just because they want to pipe-clean their design flow, they want to sort of minimize the risk in the transitions, and that makes a lot of sense. But we definitely see both behaviors.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Brian, looking at the operating or, I guess, the margin expansion, the 100 basis points this year perhaps a little bit more in the out year. Is that driven by kind of the ramping IP and better margins in IP? Or just an overall revenue growth in the company that's driving the operating margin expansion?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, Tom, it's all of the above. It's really that our revenues are up very nicely this year. We're looking at revenue growth in the range of 11% to 12%. Spending is not growing as fast as that, and we are seeing good improvements across the board in the operating margins of the company. At the same time, we've got to retain dollars to invest in leading-edge technologies. So again, still on track for the commitment for the year to see approximately 100-basis-points improvement in the margins.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And when you look at the -- all the acquisitions last year, is there an opportunity to have operating expense improvements as integration happens over the next few quarters? Or are we pretty much at the ongoing level at this point?","Brian M. Beattie","So there's still, in a number of the product lines, still some of the integration activities underway, getting best-in-class performance features out of all of the various products and bringing those to market as quickly as we can. So again, there could be some opportunities there. But again, overall, the company does need to stay invested in leading-edge technologies and continue to drive EPS at the same time.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And what was the actual impact of the yen over the -- during the quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Really not very material at all. As you saw from an impact through the yen on the revenues because of our hedging and the other activities and overachieving, as well as other income and expense, where we are able to recognize some of the non-hedge accounting impacts to the company. So bottom line to the company was really minimal, nothing almost.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, great. And then you talked about tax rate of 23%. That includes the, I guess, the $0.09 impact of the R&D tax credit already?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, it does.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","It's already embedded in your guidance.","Brian M. Beattie","Absolutely, yes, that's factored in. We -- that came through in our first quarter. There was about $0.04 impact related to FY '12 as a retro catch-up that we had in Q1. And then, we had forecast an additional $0.05 to come through in earnings per share for the balance of FY '13 which, again, we're just building on. So we saw the $0.09 increase in Q1, primarily coming from tax, and then we're adding on another $0.02 improvement in EPS coming from operational improvements this quarter.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And your long-term view without the tax credit going forward in the out-years is still that 25%?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, at 25% to 26%. Because when you look at, I said 23%, it's a roughly 3 percentage points change. So 25% to 26% is a good, long-term planning model for us.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, just finally, on the technology side, is the move to some of these advanced technologies for memory, like the 3D NAND, are they big drivers as well? It sounds like FinFET and the fact that the fabless guys are, in conglomerate, all of your biggest customers per se. Are you going to see much of an impact once the industry moves to some of these other memory technologies?","Aart J. de Geus","Oh, absolutely, although they're not completely linked. And there's a key reason for that, which is that the largest portion of the industry that has -- that sees the biggest benefit in changing the performance power segment is clearly the mobile side of the industry. Now the power equation is starting to impact the cloud side as well, because these very large centers of servers are heavily eating up too much power. But that's going to be a little slower. So mobility is driving this, and mobility is just incredibly hunger for -- hungry for even more performance. We're essentially limited by battery power. And since most of the computational energy goes into the core processors, that is where the emphasis on FinFET is going to be first. Now memories are following their own track of technology development, but they have the very same need of being very, in this case, being very, very price sensitive. And so we are going to see more and more push there, as well, in parallel to the processors. By the way, when I say processors, I should clarify that I mean not just the apps processors, but any other form as well. The graphics processors are key, the DSP processors as well.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And so once you guys -- it really comes down to just battery life as the main driver of the mobile consumer today.","Aart J. de Geus","Yes. In many ways, largely because I think battery improvements, and don't quote me on the number, but I think is maybe in the 10% to 15% per year, which is woefully insufficient versus what we wish our phone could do. And therefore, I think any advances in semiconductors are going to be of very high value. And by the way, I think this is going to continue in years to come because the demand for more compute power will, if nothing else accelerate with the type of applications that are possible. Therefore, over time, I certainly have hopes that we will see some more migration of capital and money flow into the semiconductor industry, precisely because there's such a high leverage on being able to improve the performance power ratio of a number of these chips.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Brian, to start with you, just to reconcile some revenue numbers here. You had an unusually large increase in your Asia-Pacific revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, but your upfront revenues declined sequentially by a fair amount. So was the increase in Asia Pac largely tied to the increase in TBL revenues generally? And was IP and\/or services the main driver to that increase in Asia Pac?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes. Let's go through a couple of your points here. One is that APAC did have a very strong quarter and, when we look at trailing 12 months, is doing very, very well as well, so a very strong region for the company. In terms of the mix of products, of course, it fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. When we look at -- now that, of course, we have an increased hardware business, we have more business coming in the areas of percentage completion or milestone-based accounting for our revenues. And also, that we see from time to time, royalty is coming through in a quarter-to-quarter basis. So there will be some natural fluctuations from quarter-to-quarter. And I don't link it specifically to the region but, overall, for the company. But APAC is very strong for us, and looking at very strong year-over-year growth.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to clarify on that, so it was a variety of things. It wasn't necessarily a single, large, scheduled TBL payment or anything like that.","Brian M. Beattie","Right, that's correct.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. For Aart, let's see how far we can take the Intel discussion. When you last publicly disclosed a renewal with them, which was August 2007, there were some comments you made at the time with regard to technology collaboration and work with them. So perhaps you could comment in what ways the arrangement now might, in any way, be different from what you talked about back then. Also at that time, in 2007, your quarterly revenue run rate with them that you disclosed was roughly, let's call it, $34 million a quarter. Now based on recent disclosures, you're up to over $50 million a quarter. Some of that's inorganic, of course, but would you foresee a prospect of further material increases in the run rate with them as we've seen over the last 5 to 6 years?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, if nothing else, Jay, you're keeping very good notes. But unfortunately, I'm not going to add much to the notes because we don't comment about the business relationship with -- we have with our customers. Intel is obviously, visibly so, an important technology driver and has been a very good partner to us, and all I can say is that, that relationship continues on that basis.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. On the IP business, I think you've mentioned in an earlier call that you have something like 1,400 engineers now in that business. Could you just remind us what proportion of that headcount is inwardly focused in terms of R&D versus customer engagements where you're doing projects for customers that -- apart from the internal R&D work that you do?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, the number I mentioned was 1,700. And I'm not quite sure how to answer the question because these are engineers that are essentially developing IP for customers. Some of the IP is very generic. Some of the IP gets tuned specifically for the customers' technology. And whenever an IP is not fully synthesizable, you have to do that in order to take advantage of the specific nature of their silicon node. And the node is not only single node, it often has different characteristics being optimized for performance or low power, for example. And so the breadth of the type of these engagements is quite broad, but the number I mentioned is all really fundamentally in the development and delivery of IP to the customer.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, a couple of last things. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you had a win in Japan. Could we speak about Japan a little bit more broadly? Because it's been obvious for the last number of years that it's been shrinking in importance to EDA as a percentage of EDA spend. And yet we've seen, in the last couple of quarters or so, some renewed momentum among other technical software companies. And I'm wondering if this particular win is indicative of all. Are they a reinvestment cycle that may be occurring in Japan vis-\u00e0-vis EDA as a whole and not just this one particular success that you've had there?","Aart J. de Geus","Just for the record, I did not mention any specific win in Japan. But on the general topic of Japan, it is very clear that over the last -- no, actually, more than a decade, but visibly so in the last half decade or so, that the Japan economy and the semiconductor industry, in particular, have been under enormous pressure, while we, as a company, are doing quite well. I'd like to link to one of the things that Brian said earlier, which is this very change in the valuation of the yen is viewed in Japan as at least the beginning of a ray of hope that they become more competitive on a worldwide basis. And with that, the opportunity for their business to sort of restart themselves beyond the somewhat stale situation that the industry has been in. Now having said that, there are a number of companies that have taken very aggressive steps in consolidating or in streamlining their businesses. And like any other part of the world, these changes are difficult to do. They take some time. But after a while, they -- the positive impact starts to show. So we certainly hope that the industry in Japan, in semiconductors, will grow again and potentially also refocus on some of the newer opportunity spaces. And the indications are a little bit better than they were, actually, just 6 months ago. But having said that, these are macroeconomic events that are certainly far beyond our control as a company.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, would you care to comment on the announcement earlier this week by Cadence of a potentially competitive offering versus PT?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, of course, this is DAC season. And you will see a wave of announcements of products that are all better than what was ever built before, and the reality will sink in over time. So no, I don't think that there's anything more to be said right now. We will have to see what the reality is. And obviously, we have a strong competitor in Cadence, and we will compete equally strongly back.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Aart, can you comment on the design win you talked about this quarter you had was -- which product area that was in and what was the driver for your design win?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think, I mentioned the term design wins when summarizing how far our USB franchise and delivery had gone. Because it's quite astounding how the IP business for us has evolved over a number of years. And sometimes, we work so hard that we don't realize how many designs have actually utilized our IP. And in that context, I think the 3,000th design win of USB was actually, I think, quite remarkable. Having said that, the other aspect where there were design wins comes in is literally every day, meaning that no matter how good a company we hope we are, we have to prove every day again that we're worthy of the responsibility of being on the top chips for tomorrow. And therefore, we do have a very active engagement in the field through our technical support team. And the good news is, I think we are really massively involved in all the new advanced chips. And in that context, every day, there's, somewhere in the world, some good news of being selected again to continue that journey. But it's also the responsibility and the fun challenge to actually have to deliver on chips that are driving the boundaries of what we can do. And so in that context, I think the FinFET efforts, be it through the tools that are very much on top of it, I think already, the IP that is in very rapid development and now, increasingly, the technical skills in our field to support our customers, these are all very positive indicators for the future that we have with the people driving the most important design wins.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And just a follow-up on the FinFET. You mentioned that you have experience designing with FinFET. Can you give us a little bit more color, where is the more profound impact in terms of the different tools? Is it more in the device simulation or placement or power closure? Where is the most profound changes you had to make in the tools to enable the FinFET?","Aart J. de Geus","Good question. It's actually very much across the board, because it starts with really the design of both the technology, which, by the way, is moving to a very, very small node, 14-, 16-nanometer. And with that, there's a lot of lithography type of issues, but there's also lithography creeping into the place en route by virtue of what's called double-patterning. Secondly, the entire layout space is highly impacted, because the nature of the transistor will change the timing and power calculations. But the layout is also influenced greatly by all the rules that you have to follow to place these things on the chip just right. And when I say rules, we're talking essentially a doubling of rules of 2,000 to 4,000 rules that you have to follow. And then, indirectly, it really impacts, or it will impact, I should say, going forward the entire verification space. Because all the way down to the SPICE level, simulation of the transistor, all the way up to the sheer number of transistors, and therefore, complexity of chip verification from a functional point of view. So it is quite remarkable the breadth of it, but it's also quite rewarding because that is the very, very reason that we can see how much impact this will have on design and on electronics going forward. Then summarizing all of that, it also impacts every one of the building blocks. And again, you can look at the transistor as being literally the smallest atomic building block, all the way to the large pieces of IP that have to be tuned for these technologies. And as I mentioned in the context of an earlier question, we have been working on IP developments, be it in memories or libraries or building blocks, now already for quite a while. And in that sense, I think we are very much in sync with the foundries as they roll out their production-ready solutions.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then one more question I'd like to follow up on, the topic that was discussed, is the 20-nanometer being a transitory node. Will it be possible for you to give us a quantitative sense on what will be the -- what is your expectation for big design starts on 28, 20 and 14, so that we can get an idea for how big or how small this 20-nanometer is going to be?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, let me give you a little bit of sense. For the 28 -- 28-, 32-nanometer node, we actually have stopped tracking. And what that means is we count the early chips up until 500. After that, it becomes completely untrackable. And so that node, I think, will continue to be a big node in the sense that a lot of designs will aggregate there. On the 20-, 22-nanometer, we have, I think, about 100 designs and growing on the radar scope. And then we do not communicate the 14-, 16-nanometer, partially because there's too much confidential information in that. But I can only tell you that there are some very hard-driving folks engaged in both test chips and production chips there.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Farhan Ahmad","This is Farhan asking the question on behalf of Satya. Question on the fragmentation in the foundry. Like, recently there's been some large companies which have indicated that they are entering the foundry space. Compared to 3, 4 years ago, there are more companies doing foundry works. How does that effect the EDA world? And does that imply that you have a greater amount of OpEx now needed because you have to support multiple design flows? And also, is that leading to more design activity because people have to design for different foundries?","Aart J. de Geus","To be honest, the -- acoustically, it was a little hard to understand. So let me try to formulate the question and see if I answer the right one, which is, as the foundry landscape is changing and a number of the foundries are -- and a number of their users are trying to use multiple foundries, what all do you have to support? Because in that context, the number of nodes sort of multiplies in the dark, so to speak, meaning that, not only do you have these smaller and smaller nodes, but you have variations on each one of those for performance, power and maybe cost. And so it is certainly true that this puts a fairly heavy burden on us, but also on the foundries, to have the complete ecosystem ready. And the good news on our side is that we have designed our tools to be extremely flexible for a variety of parameters. And therein lies actually one of the differentiating essences of what Synopsys has built, literally for the last 20 years, all the way starting to synthesis and through the physical implementation, which is we can read in the characteristics of different technology nodes and their variations, and then optimize the circuit based on that. And so if a certain node, let's say, may have some better capabilities in low power, we will take advantage of that automatically in the tools. Now having said that, the one area where the -- that is sometimes challenged is as you develop IP, that has to be individually optimized, in some cases, almost manually for best results because it's going to get reused so much. Now we need to have working contract with the customers so that we can invest the resources to do that, deliver it on time. And they have a strong interest that their IP looks really good because that will attract their customers to go to them. And so there's an economic relationship there that has to jive. And moreover, there's a temporal relationship because they want to have their technology ready at the same time as the tools being ready at the same time as the IP being ready and at the same time as the support being ready. And of course, you are talking about things that are really state-of-the-art. And so predicting the right arrival time is not always trivial. But we're working closely with, as I said, all of the top foundries on that. And again, I think it's both a privilege and an opportunity to be at the center of gravity of this whole next wave of capability.","Operator","And I'll turn it back to our speakers for closing remarks.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, at this point in time, thank you for attending the call. I think we communicated to you that we had really an excellent quarter and, moreover, are making really great progress in many of the technology directions that, I believe, will profoundly impact semiconductors in the years to come. And so, from that perspective, as much as the pressure is on us to continue to deliver, the privilege is here to be part of that, right? And we're looking forward at finishing our year well within the targets that we've given you. Thank you so much, and we'll be available for questions afterwards as usual.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","","Thank you, Sandy. Good afternoon, everyone. Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, the financial supplement and the corporate overview presentation that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q4 was a strong finish to a very solid year; a year that was significant from at least three perspectives. Specifically, we released several game-changing new EDA products that will drive a multi-year product upgrade cycle.","We further broadened our IP offering, solidifying our position as the number 2 IP provider with a strong business outlook into FY15. And last, but not least, we embarked on a transformational journey into the software quality, test and security space with our acquisition, and integration, of Coverity.","Let me briefly summarize the financial results for the quarter and year. We delivered Q4 revenue of $539 million and $2.057 billion for the fiscal year. We reported non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.64 in Q4 and $2.53 for the year. We generated $551 million in operating cash flow, bought back $120 million of our stock, and grew our three-year backlog to $3.5 billion.","Building on our strong year-end position, we're setting a 2015 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.67 to $2.72, a revenue target of $2.185 to 2.225 billion, and an operating cash flow target of approximately $450 million. Brian will discuss these in more detail shortly.","As we head into 2015, it\u2019s clear that global demand for electronics continues unabated. From the newest mobile phones and tablets; to a cloud infrastructure that requires unprecedented amounts of data storage, transportation and analysis; to a whole new wave of innovative electronic content in Internet of Things applications - technology is king!","In 2014, we have seen hard-driving adoption of the most advanced FinFET technologies, with already more than 170 active designs and tape-outs as far down as 10 nanometer.","Meanwhile, designs at the more established 20, 28, and 40\/45 nanometer nodes are also increasing in complexity as designers drive performance while squeezing out power and cost.","In other words, the technical essence of Moore's law is alive and well, and the term system on a chip coined in the late 90s is in full swing. This product wave is also increasingly complex. Billions of transistors in massive numbers of interconnected chips, all with enormous amounts of embedded and applications software is, simply stated, very hard to do.","Synopsys is at the vortex of this process. While 2014 semiconductor industry growth looks stronger compared to last year, the market remains extremely competitive, driving a number of customers to seek efficiency and differentiation through consolidation and restructuring.","For the EDA industry, this brings some headwinds, but also great opportunities. In this context, Synopsys is the only vendor offering state-of-the-art solutions from Core EDA, to IP, to software quality tools, positioning us well to be the partner of choice.","Given these dynamics, let me state our priorities for the next several years. While we continue to build on our strengths in EDA, we plan to accelerate our expansion into a more diversified set of customers and solutions. We\u2019re driving three priorities:","Priority number 1: Maintain our clear technical, business and support leadership in core EDA.","Our strategy for mostly organic growth is the following: First and foremost, invest in technology focused on continued leadership in FinFET solutions at 16 nanometer and below, as well as highest productivity for advanced design at the established process nodes.","Second, drive customer success on a global basis. Today our support teams are integral to the completion of virtually all state-of-the-art chips. Synopsys will continue to provide highly skilled and trusted EDA experts at our customers' global locations.","And third, deploy and proliferate the new game-changing design and verification products we introduced in 2014, and additional products to be announced in 2015.","Priority number 2: Drive continued growth in IP and Systems, leveraging the confluence of increased outsourcing of IP, growing technical complexity, and the essential customer need for trust and reliance on its partner suppliers. In this area, our strategy for organic and potential M&A growth is the following.","First, invest in and proliferate new titles across the portfolio, both in the most advanced silicon technologies and in more established geometries targeting the Internet of Things. With an offering that features interfaces, memories, embedded processors and analog IP, Synopsys is a cornerstone partner in the deployment of any new silicon technology generation.","Second, provide increasingly complex, pre- configured IP subsystems to help ease integration into our customers' SoCs. And third, provide software-and hardware-based prototyping solutions to enable earlier software development and system validation with today's software-intense devices.","Which brings me to our third strategic priority: Expand our presence in the software-quality, test and security space by building on the excellent technology from Coverity. Our strategy for organic and potential M&A growth is to leverage the just-completed Synopsys field integration, while focusing on fast and agile execution.","We expect to grow in: A, the directly adjacent embedded software market, where we already know the electronic and semiconductor companies well, and can leverage Synopsys' global relationships built over many years.","And, B, the large untapped software-applications market that reaches from financial to health, energy, retail, social media to virtually any company doing sophisticated software and having quality, security and testing issues.","From a shareholder value perspective, these priorities drive a diversified and coherent product portfolio in both mature and growing markets, balancing both growth and profitability for Synopsys.","Specifically, core EDA is very stable, with solid profitability and cash flow; IP delivers higher growth with increasingly good profitability; and the software quality tools are in a brand new TAM with an even better growth opportunity, with expected profitability in 2016.","Let me provide some highlights for each of these, beginning with core EDA. In core EDA, the demand for the most leading-edge technology is unrelenting. I mentioned earlier the latest breakthrough process FinFETs. Of all the designs and tape-outs we\u2019re tracking, Synopsys is integral to over 95% of them.","Being the leader makes a difference: customers can rest easy, knowing that they're relying on the most technically advanced tools, and support teams, in the world.","Earlier this year, we launched a breakthrough in implementation: IC Compiler II. We indicated at that time that ICC II is a game-changer delivering a 5X speed-up and 10X throughput improvement.","Now, six months later, we have even more hard evidence from many customers with excellent results. With a rapidly growing number of engagements, designs, tape-outs and now working silicon, we see our multi-year adoption and deployment progressing even faster than with any previous products.","The benefits are equally compelling for both very advanced and established nodes. One such example is Panasonic, who achieved such excellent results with a high-performance multimedia design at 40 nanometer, that they\u2019re expanding use into other 40 and 28 nanometer designs.","Moving to verification, where approximately 80% of advanced designs use Synopsys as their primary simulator, customers have responded extremely well to our Verification Continuum vision and first deliveries. Just as the name implies, the Verification Continuum platform spans all the key components, from our franchise VCS functional verification, to static and formal analysis, to verification IP, to emulation and prototyping, all aligned on a common infrastructure, with best-in-class, common debugging.","With a 3X near-term and 10X long-term productivity improvement, our vision, plans and deliverables are already having impact on customers. The first deliverable, Verification Compiler, launched in Q2 with brand-new static and formal verification, the integration of software-based simulation and debug tools, and key verification IP, all in a single product. It is currently delivering 3X productivity improvement.","Also launched this year was the next-generation ZeBu Server-3 emulator, which is the fastest, highest-capacity emulator on the market today. Stay tuned as we roll out additional components over the next year, starting in Q1.","Around our tools, Synopsys continues to support, and benefit from, strong ecosystem partnerships, as evidenced by several announcements in the quarter. We expanded our long-standing collaboration with ARM to benefit our mutual customers with optimized tools throughout the flow for designing with ARM IP. This very broad, multi-year agreement gives us early access to the latest ARM processors.","On the foundry side, we achieved broad certification for TSMC\u2019s 16 nanometer FinFET-plus process, for both digital and custom implementation tools. And both companies entered into a 10 nanometer FinFET collaboration.","In addition, TSMC selected Synopsys as Partner of the Year in two categories: Joint development of 16 nanometer FinFET-plus design infrastructure, and for the fifth consecutive year, Partner of the Year for interface IP.","Which brings me to highlights for our IP products, where demand is strong. Let me give you some examples: In Q4, we closed a multi-year agreement for 16, 14 and 10 nanometer IP outsourcing with AMD, and hired 150 of their engineers to augment our team. The advances in the most leading-edge technologies are progressing well, with the first 10 nanometer IP business wins with two industry leaders.","Our interface IP is evolving continuously. Our USB 3.0, for example, has been shipped in more than 100 million production SoCs, while in Q4 we already launched our USB 3.1 controller with double the data rate. Finally, our IP is already used extensively in Internet of Things applications. During the quarter we announced a new Sensor and Control subsystem, and also an enhanced memory offering for embedded flash used for IoT and Automotive.","Lastly, let me update you on Coverity. As a brief reminder, Coverity provides essential testing software used during code development. This software finds, and fixes, critical defects and security issues. Coverity is an ideal TAM expansion for us: About half the business addresses software embedded in chips and electronic systems from customers we know well; and half is aimed at a new, very broad set of application software customers.","We\u2019ve spent the last two quarters learning about Coverity\u2019s products, customers, and market dynamics. The quality of the technology and employees is outstanding, and","Coverity\u2019s results under Synopsys were in line with the initial expectations we communicated back in the spring. We expect to reach break-even in the second half of fiscal 2015, while being accretive in 2016 with revenue over $100 million.","From an overall financial perspective, our primary long-term objective is to drive high-single-digit, non- GAAP earnings-per-share growth through a mix of the following elements: One, organically grow traditional EDA revenue generally in the low-to-mid single digit range. Two, organically grow IP and Software Solutions revenue generally in the low double-digits. Three, actively explore TAM-expanding R&D and M&A opportunities.","Four, focus on global operational efficiency to deliver solid non-GAAP operating margin in the mid-20s range; And five, optimize the use of our strong cash flow, through a balance of M&A, debt reduction, and stock buybacks. While the combination of elements may vary, based on business cycles and in-period priorities, our long-term driving principles remain consistent.","Before I conclude, let me also highlight today's organizational announcement. As we scale the company into its next phase, I am pleased that Brian has been promoted to Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Administrative Officer, and while continuing to lead finance, operations and IT, he will also head up human resources, facilities, business development, and strategy.","Trac Pham, who has worked closely with Brian for many years as a key member of the finance team, will step into the CFO role. Many of you will meet and get to know Trac over the coming months. Brian will remain available in investor relationships as well. Congratulations to both Brian and Trac in their new roles.","To conclude, Synopsys is in a high-potential position. Propelled by yet another decade of technology advancements, the electronics industry is gunning for the next wave of far reaching products. Synopsys is a cornerstone company enabling this new wave of innovation.","In 2014, we built a very strong financial foundation, and we enter 2015 with a good deal of momentum. Our newly launched game-changing products are expected to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle, IP demand is strong, and our expansion into a new higher-growth software quality and security space enters its next, exciting phase.","Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian Beattie","Thank you, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year and provide you with our targets for Q1 and the full year of 2015. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over year unless I specify otherwise.","Synopsys delivered very good fourth quarter and full year results, highlighted by strong business levels, solid growth in both revenue and earnings, and considerable free cash flow generation. We significantly exceeded our original 2014 target for operating cash flow, entered an exciting new market segment with our Coverity acquisition, and continued our stock repurchase program.","Q4 total revenue increased 7% to $539 million and annual revenue grew 5% to $2.057 billion. Revenue contribution from Coverity was modest and met our prior expectations. About 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and we had one approximately 10% customer for both Q4 and FY14.","The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.8 years for the quarter and about 2.9 years for all of fiscal 2014. We currently expect weighted average duration for FY15 to continue to be approximately three years.","Three-year backlog increased to $3.5 billion from $3.1 billion due primarily to the timing of large contract renewals, business growth and to a lesser extent, acquisitions. Looking ahead, we have approximately 80% of our target fiscal 2015 revenue in hand for the coming year.","Turning to expenses, Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $482 million, which included $33 million of amortization of intangible assets and $21 million of stock-based compensation. For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.81 billion, which included $126 million of amortization of intangible assets and $79 million of stock-based compensation.","Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $423 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.58 billion, well within our expected range.","Non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 21.6% and 23% for the full year, which reflects the approximately one percentage point impact from our Coverity acquisition and the standard purchase accounting haircut that is applied to deferred revenue. For all of FY15, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY14 levels by approximately 100 basis points.","We continue to drive company-wide operational discipline, as well as implementing targeted cost savings initiatives, including a voluntary retirement program and some additional severance in the current quarter. As a result, in Q1 we expect to incur a one-time, GAAP-only restructuring charge between $15 and $19 million.","Our strategy is to reduce expenses in certain areas so that we're able to allocate resources to our higher-growth areas such as IP and our new software quality and security arena.","Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.39 for the quarter and $1.64 for the year. Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share increased 14% to $0.64. Full year non-GAAP earnings grew 4% to $2.53 and again includes the dilution from Coverity, which came in within our target range.","Our non-GAAP tax rate was 14% in Q4 and 18% for the full year, both below our targets, due primarily to a cumulative favorable transfer pricing adjustment for 2014. For modeling purposes, we think that a more normalized non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2015.","Now turning to our cash flow. We generated $173 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $551 million for all of fiscal 2014. FY14 operating cash flow exceeded our original expectations, due primarily to strong business levels and collections throughout the year.","During FY14, we borrowed and paid back both our outstanding $200 million revolver, initially drawn to acquire Coverity, and $30 million of our term loan, leaving $75 million of debt outstanding on the term loan.","During fiscal 2014 we purchased about 3.1 million shares of Synopsys stock for $120 million that included 1 million shares for $40 million in Q4. We have $380 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. Our goal is to accelerate our buybacks in FY15 to keep our share count roughly flat with FY14 levels.","We also closed a number of acquisitions during the fiscal year, putting our balance sheet to work. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $986 million with 16%, or $162 million, onshore and 84% offshore.","We plan to continue optimizing the use of our very strong cash flow through a balance of M&A, stock buybacks and debt reduction. Each quarter we will evaluate the best uses of cash, but our ongoing goal is to allocate capital to where we think it can generate maximum long-term shareholder value.","At this time we're targeting operating cash flow of approximately $450 million in FY15, which reflects about $35 million in one-time disbursements due to our voluntary retirement program and additional severance, and one-time benefits changes.","We're also expecting cash taxes to be somewhat higher in 2015. And finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to prior years, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, due primarily to the timing of prior year annual incentive compensation payments.","Capital expenditures were $45 million for the quarter and $103 million for the year, reflecting the increased facilities related expenditures, including the ongoing two-year build out of our newly leased Bay Area facility, along with facilities and other expenditures due to past acquisitions.","DSO was 55 days, reflecting strong business levels and the timing of invoices, and we ended Q4 with approximately 9,440 employees, with over one third in lower-cost geographies. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily by planned hiring and Coverity, along with the IP engineers we hired from AMD as part of our recently expanded IP partnership.","Before moving onto guidance, let me provide some additional commentary on Coverity. As you recall, at closing, Coverity had about $69 million of deferred revenue, of which $47 million will not be recognized due to standard purchase accounting.","As a result, FY14 revenue contribution would have been approximately $24 million higher without the deferred revenue haircut, and FY15 would be approximately $15 million higher. While we are not breaking out Coverity product sales, we believe we are on track to grow revenue in this space to more than $100 million in fiscal 2016.","So now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the first quarter of FY15, our targets are: revenue between $535 and $545 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $482 and $505 million, which includes approximately $21 million of stock-based compensation expense and the one-time restructuring charge.","Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $415 and $425 million. Other income and expense between $0 and $2 million. A non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%, outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million. GAAP earnings of $0.18 to $0.25 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.61 to $0.63 per share.","Now our Fiscal 2015 outlook, revenue between $2.185 and $2.225 billion, a growth rate of approximately 6% to 8%. Other income and expense between $2 and $6 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 22%; outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million. GAAP earnings per share of $1.22 to $1.35, which includes the impact of approximately $88 million in stock-based compensation expense.","Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.67 to $2.72, which reflects Coverity being on track to reach break-even in the second half of 2015. Capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, and we are targeting cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.","And then finally, to assist in your modeling, second half revenue and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be slightly higher than the first half. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly toward the first half of the year.","In summary, we're pleased with our very good fourth quarter and full year financial results, was highlighted by solid top-and bottom-line growth and strong cash flow generation.","So with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Rich Valera","Thank you. First congratulations Brian, on the promotion.","","Brian Beattie","","Thank you very much Rich.","Rich Valera","So Aart, just first wanted to take your pulse on the environment. It sounds from your prepared remarks that it is quite similar to last quarter but just wanted to hear in your words sort of how you would view the environment if there was any change quarter-over-quarter?","","Aart de Geus","You characterize it right, which is its similar to last quarter. I think if you look at the year, semiconductor is looking a little stronger than last year but the reality is, it's an on and off and the rate of change is very high in the field that we're in, which is a good thing because that means that the technology adoption is raising forward.","And we definitely see a number of companies looking at, at the coming years as opportunities for strong new product. So, one hand same old, same old. On the other hand, same old has always meant very rapid progress.","Rich Valera","","That's great. And then with respect to ICC II it sounds like your \u2013 you're kind of on track with where we wanted to be. I'm assuming on track for GA end of this calendar year, is that still correct?","Aart de Geus","","Well we have brought release at the time. We are very careful of how to roll it out so that we can support to people that are adopting it very effectively which means that we're controlling quarter-by-quarter how many people we pick up.","But definitely the customer interest is not an issue, its well on schedule. And what has been particularly rewarding is that the, there are really hard evidence on all the results is absolutely at least as good as what we have said it would be and so that is very encouraging.","Rich Valera","And I know you don\u2019t like to talk too much about share because its little tricky how it's measured and seems like everyone sort of gains share. But, when you look at the digital space where your - certainly the digital design space where you have quite high share. Do you think ICC II could enable you - to reflect the gain share or willing to make that go at this point.","","Aart de Geus","","Your comment is right. Everybody always claims that they\u2019re gaining share. The reality is things shift very gradually in the field that we're in and for starters, what of course ICC II does, it solidifies strongly on the places that we\u2019re in.","But, given the substantial advantages in terms of productivity, this really gives us the opportunity to gain over time. And given that, many of the agreements that we have are multi-years, that is how this will roll out. The adoption is very, very rapid.","","Rich Valera","Great. And just one final one, you had a very nice increase in backlog year-over-year despite a drop in duration. Wondering if you can give any more color on what drove that particularly if you\u2019d be willing to say how much Coverity contributed to that?","Aart de Geus","Well, for starters, yes, it was a very - a very good increase and actually the most relevant in all of that is actually a different number, which is the very fact that we\u2019re entering the coming year with a very strong coverage, 80% or so.","And, but you're right, that's the - Q4 grew the backlog substantially. I hadn't even noticed that\u2019s the duration has slightly changed because it's - from my perspective it\u2019s sort of all in the same ballpark. We don\u2019t really see much change there.","So I think, we just had a very strong business result in Q4 that will manifest itself over the coming years. I guess that's called momentum","Rich Valera","That's great.","Brian Beattie","Rich, I think - just adding to that, it\u2019s just again reflective of a strong year with good level of business coming in, a very strong fourth quarter. And we just saw good renewals, good momentum on that and then it set us up nicely for 2015.","Some of the acquisition work we did had a smaller impact but was also a contributor to that growth about $400 million on the three year backlog space.","Rich Valera","Brian, just quickly on the CapEx guidance. There still seems pretty elevated by historical standards is that still in relation to the new facility build out?","Brian Beattie","It is, Rich. If we you can think back at the beginning of 2014, we thought our CapEx profile would be about $135 million, and it came in just over $100 million. So again, as we try to optimize the actual cash disbursements to as late as we can allowed us to come in just over the $100 million mark. And then looking ahead to next year some of that related to our new leased facility, we\u2019ll just extend into 2015.","So, the rest is normal. It\u2019s really only related to IT, related to giving us state-of-the-art capability and computing and networking, and then still some of the build that related to finishing off our new facility and also relative to some of the new acquisitions that we've completed so the rest of it is all related to facility side.","I had forecast ahead that 16 of that number would come down at this point because our major leased new facility in Silicon Valley will be completed by then.","Rich Valera","How much it might come down the several 100 - not willing to go there at this point?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, I think, just for that facility, it's going to come down on $10s of millions just on that facility itself but what we\u2019re calling our 690 middlefield set up.","","Rich Valera","Great. Thanks very much, gentlemen.","Brian Beattie","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Krish Sankar with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them, number one, Aart, where do you think you have the share in emulation is today? And given the fact that, in the past you\u2019ve spoken about more of the softer wrapping being used by \u2013 using emulators. Have you seen any traction to the platform and where do you think it is today versus a year ago?","Aart de Geus","Yeah, we don't disclose the individual share of product. But, you're correct, to say that a lot of emphasis is going into the software dimension. In general terms with a number of three in the emulation market, but in the overall prototyping space I think we are in a strong leadership position, and we see that in some of the other product.","And while we open the door of the software, of course verification is heading there but so is the Coverity move. And you can sort of see that as a natural adjacency to that whole space of verification.","Krish Sankar","That's very helpful. And for FinFET side, how would you characterize the progress? It seems like you guys have been qualified at pretty much all the major FinFET manufacturers. How would you characterize its progress compared to like maybe six or nine months ago given that they had some starting issues. Do you think most of those are behind us and the yield improvements are getting. Or do you still think there is a long road ahead.","Aart de Geus","Yes, and yes, meaning that, I think the progress has been excellent. I think that in general people will say, well you know there have been quite a number of challenges to overcoming yield, which actually is not a surprise at all, this is very sophisticated technology.","But the adoption rate and the number of new designs I think is well on track to rival the previous major generations. And so, Synopsys specifically, we are very much on top of this because we\u2019re engaged very early to the tea CAD, the three dimensional modeling as the transitters are literally being invented.","And then all the - in between steps of being ready with the tools, we\u2019re there, designs are being done and the majority actually is our tools.","And then of course, the IP position is very important as well because for all the advanced chips, you can't design a chip today unless you use major IP box, and those have to be highly tuned for the advance technologies. And Synopsys is absolutely leader in that area as well.","So, I would characterize it as moving forward well. I think it will be a number of companies or customers that will hold on at 28 nanometer until they see the other side of the bridge so to speak, that FinFET\u2019s are really stable and then they will move as well but all the advanced guys are already there.","Krish Sankar","Thanks. That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And the next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sterling Auty","Thanks. Hi guys. Wanted to start with \u2013 how would you characterize employment growth or headcount growth in design engineers and its impact on your growth that you saw in 2014? And what do you think that looks like for 2015?","","Aart de Geus","","That's very difficult to characterize because there\u2019s not much in terms of hard numbers there, but I would say, that in general it feels very stable to me with the exception of the Far East where the headcount is still substantially growing. And one can also see that a little bit watching how customers battle for key employees and how some of the salaries are moving up.","So, fundamentally I think it's a positive message, there is some geographies as you would expect, such as Japan and Europe, that are lagging, I think the U.S. is in very stable, maybe even strong position and the Far East is going.","Sterling Auty","And how would you characterize - we did a number of questions about the moves that China is making to become a bigger and bigger player in the semiconductor industry. How that might help your business in the coming year or more?","Aart de Geus","Well, for us that is not a surprise at all because we have been very active since literally the middle 90s and strange to say, but that's almost 20 years ago now. And in the process, we\u2019ve seen a tremendous evolution in terms of the gradual competence to now superb competence in semiconductor design and system design.","And in the last few years one can literally see how the adoption of the most advanced silicon technologies has progressed more rapidly in China than other places. It is all not a surprise, this is obviously a country that is rapidly becoming one of these very large economies, and modern economies are big users and developers of advanced technology. Electronics is absolutely at the vortex of all of that.","Sterling Auty","And then Brian, just two quick ones for you. Talking about the 80% of this year\u2019s guidance revenue already on the balance sheet, if I do that calculation and say okay what percentage, what does that mean in terms of percentage of the backlog that it actually would come through the income statement this year? It\u2019s actually a smaller percentage than what we saw last year. Is there any mechanics to that or is this too nuanced?","Brian Beattie","No. I would highlight if we want to compare it to this time a year ago, we indicated we had more than 75% of the year's revenues in hand for 2014. And this year we're back to 80% level of the coverage, and again, we base guidance based on what we have in hand and how we can actually convert that through.","So, it's a more traditional profile than what we had just in 2014. And again the high levels of confidence obviously in delivering that much. And so you can look at $3.5 billion backlog, you know that relative to our revenue guidance that we just provided, we have 80% of that in hand, that's the amount that comes out of that year-end $3.5 billion backlog.","Sterling Auty","And last question on the cash flow so, the [75] [ph] million of one time, you mentioned the higher cash taxes but if we would believe that bookings would hopefully knock on wood grow why wouldn't cash flow at least be flat year-over-year? What's the other elements or moving parts that perhaps could cause us to a down year in cash flow?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, again, we look - the number one thing we look at very specific collection profiles by customers just as you mentioned we have 80% of the year, we also have a significant amount of collections scheduled with a very high probabilities of collecting that.","The additional amount comes from new bookings which again we tie in very closely with our sales team on the projected profile of that, and then of course disbursements are something we control.","So, every year we look at specific forecast based on that and that produces our approximately $450 million, and in the long run our operating cash flow really tracks extremely close to our EBITDA line.","And when you look at where we ended up in 2014, was significantly over what we had forecast again our trading line with that EBITDA and the fact we did nicely and overachieved on the timing of those renewals and good cash management and good disbursed management.","Sterling Auty","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","","Tom Diffely","So Brian, there was just about a time if we \u2013 but congratulations on the promotion.","","Brian Beattie","Well, thanks Tom, I\u2019m really looking forward to it.","Tom Diffely","So, maybe I'll take this chance to ask you few question and any impact you\u2019ve seen from the Euro, Yen in the current quarter and what you think maybe an impact in that year?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, again when we factor all of this into our guidance range, and we did see an impact - slight impact in terms of revenue in 2014, but again based on our really solid hedging program and the fact we do of course have expenses in Japan too, it had really a non-material impact on the total year.","As I look ahead to 2015, I see about 1% headwind on the Yen, just checking this morning, we\u2019re almost at 1.20 and it continues to weaken of course in Japan with a lot of forecast going forward.","We\u2019re very fortunate that we\u2019ve hedged about 60% of our revenues at a rate of about 102 for next year, and so we feel again comfortable we\u2019ve got it but you\u2019re only able to really hedge about 60% of revenue.","So, all-in-all it's our typical management program, that\u2019s how we manage and it give us really, really good predictability. And if you did look at our Japanese performance on the year-over-year basis, all of that dealt is just due to the Yen itself.","So, I think again the company is performing nicely in Japan but unfortunately we do all we can to offset that impact of the Yen and we're well setup for 2015, on that.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And just as a reminder, do you hedge four quarters out in both Euro and Yen?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, we do on - remember, just our only currency we hedge for revenues is the Yen, everything else is U.S. dollar based and with our spending profile in Europe with declining Euro, we also hedge basically everything a year in advance, one quarter at a time, it\u2019s a revolving hedging program that we constantly have in place.","It's not that we can predict better but we can give better visibility and know what the actual result we\u2019re going to get solidly locked in for a year in advance.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Great. And then when I look at the GAAP projections \u2013 the guidance for that year, the first quarter has impacted while the restructuring but it looks like the lesser year is lower as well, so I'm curious what the difference is there? Is there a tax rate or more expenses you expect?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, the GAAP tax - the GAAP earnings per share forecast for 2015 is lower, all really related to taxation, and when we look at how we optimize for our global transfer pricing, we look at a number of acquisitions that we put in place so we make sure that our IP is allocated to those right locations.","So, GAAP basis, we will see some higher taxes related to those acquisitions. On a non-GAAP basis we\u2019re forecasting a rate of about 22% for the full year which is right back to kind of the normal standards for us.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Can you build on the GAAP tax rate at this point \u2013 single numbers that too variable for the year?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, it's up from our management rates, but I don\u2019t have that in front of me.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then Aart, when you look at the emulation business, the Zebu, does the new Zebu came out this, does that reflect kind of the synergies you would expect to get from working with the Synoposis team or is that just kind of the last generation of the prior development team?","Aart de Geus","Well, yes and no. It does reflected because obviously this has been an enormous amount of work to get this machine to this state and get it ready for release, and that is under Synopsys, leadership of course.","The no part is that we have another much larger project which is the integration and the verification continuum. Given that, this is an extremely fast machine but it's compilation times, not as competitive as we want them to be.","And so part of the integration we are working on improving that substantially. And in FY2015, you will definitely hear about progress.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then finally in your prepared remarks you talked about IP subsystems. Are those shipping to date as more of the future projects we take individual components and bundle them together?","Aart de Geus","We're shipping today, and the notion of subsystem is interesting because we have them in audio and in the sensor part. Subsystems are not just couple of building blocks but there also many, many rules that you have to follow in order to connect these building blocks correctly, the embedded software, some of the verification capabilities.","And so what we\u2019re aiming at here is to really optimize the entire process of integrating these blocks into much larger SOC systems on the chip. And I think the desire from customers is quite high to get help from us in that.","As much as I am the lover of calling all these building blocks, Lego blocks because it conveys exactly how you can assemble things. The reality is little bit more complex than Lego blocks to connect and so the more we can automate that better.","Tom Diffely","Do you think the innovative things type chips going forward are going to be the biggest user of this subsystems?","","Aart de Geus","Not necessarily. I think the very large chips that are being built today are all available on the premise of substantial amount of IP reuse and the IP can come from - can be at many different level, very low levels such as gates and memories but highly sophisticated level such as entire memory subsystems for example.","And I think in the situation of Internet-of-Things, yes there will be certain subsystems that will be of particularly high interest. This is still a very early field in terms of scoping what will be all the possibilities, what is in no doubt though is that it will be a massive number of things that are interconnected.","And those things will gradually need more and more smarts and our objective is to be part of providing those embedded mark.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And the next question is from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. Good afternoon. Brian let me start with you, let me forward you change business cards. Let me ask a couple of financial questions. First in terms of margin expansion outlook for fiscal 2015, could you talk about the contribution of any additional margin scaling in the IP business or from the IP business?","Secondly in terms of cash flow for the year, you had a more than $100 million negative swing in accounts receivable. On the other hand you had $100 million positive swing for differed revenue. So it looks like the bulk of both of those changes took place in Q4 and therefore commence with it unusual large increase in bookings and backlog last quarter?","","Brian Beattie","Okay, Jay. Let me answer those two questions.","First on the IP margin impact. So you stated that right. We\u2019re targeting at about 100 basis point improvement in operating margin in 2015 over 2014. And really, IP is \u2013 again still on track for what we\u2019ve indicated as those multi-year goals, low double digit growth and those are the type of things we\u2019re building on and that of course will contribute to margin dollars of income and some margin improvements coming from that side as well. So, a lot of success with IP and lot of momentum going into 2015.","Over on the cash flow number itself, yes it did come in. We hit the record level of operating cash flow for 2014, and a lot of it is timing on a very strong fourth quarter. Right, we had already well over throughout 2014 we got the fourth quarter and did really well with the timing of the renewals coming in, with some good run rates on them and so seeing it up really nicely for cash collections.","And then when you start looking at details like receivables are up, that\u2019s about the strong level of business that came in, when you look at payables and other accrued liabilities that\u2019s taking into account a number of expenses that are already booked and have purchased some of the variable compensation.","So again, we\u2019ve given some good details relative to that cash flow guidance. And things like deferred revenue, as you know for us that\u2019s just timing and not a great metric for indicating ongoing performance that moves from quarter-to-quarter just based on timing of when we can invoice customers.","So lot of information there, does that answer your questions?","Jay Vleeschhouwer","","Yeah. Thank you. Actually one more for you. With respect to your largest customer you\u2019ve almost always described it as being over 10% of revenue to one degree or another. You didn\u2019t say that explicitly this time, so perhaps just to fine tune that you didn\u2019t quite get over 10% from your largest customer in the most recent quarter?","","Aart de Geus","","We did.","Brian Beattie","","We\u2019re just over the 10% mark.","Unidentified Analyst","","Aart, when you look at the last one to two years in terms of the evolution of your customer base, perhaps you could talk about how the proportion of contribution from the semiconductor companies, the AMDs and TIs of the world may have changed for you and how at the same time the so-called systems customers may have evolved for you proportionately and how are your guidance for the next year or so things about any additional evolution in that sort of customer mix?","","Aart de Geus","","Well, really to answer this question, well one should go back already multiple years because it is multiple years ago that the system companies or at least some of them decided to invest more in their own semiconductor based design for a couple of reasons. One, because they really wanted to drive performance and power down more than what their suppliers are offering them.","And two, because they wanted to be much more on top of optimizing the overall system and negotiating directly with the manufacturers given the high quantities they were after.","And so for us we have now for quite a while over 40% of our business from so called system companies. And just to clarify, there are system companies that do system design, there are system companies that do system design and semiconductor design, and there are some companies that do those two and manufacturing.","And so sometimes the terminology is little bit confused but at the end of the day the most important customers are the ones that do the most sophisticated and the largest volume business and that has not changed for us in a number of years but it has evolved over the last decade.","Unidentified Analyst","And then maybe just to wrap up with you Aart, think about the contribution of IC Compiler 2 for fiscal 2015 with somewhat following up on Rich\u2019s earlier question, what has been the reception so far to the note based pricing that you\u2019ve introduced with IC Compiler? And to what extent do you expect incremental payment or revenue from the more advanced capabilities as compared with merely propagating it via maintenance but not necessarily for more money?","","Aart de Geus","","Well, I think you heard Brian say earlier that certainly in Q4 we had a number of renewals with good growth and as a matter of fact the run rate for the company is up. Again, and that is how successful products mostly manifest themselves because for all the large customers they have of course many products and when there is a product that\u2019s particularly attractive such as IC Compiler 2, they want to quickly have the opportunity to add that to their contract to upgrade and invariably that\u2019s an opportunity to reup the contract for the next three years and the run rates go up.","So, so far only positive impact and I expect that to continue because the adoption rate is as said very high and for the people that have now not only taped out but gotten silicon back, they have been remarkably positive on the impact it had on their time to market.","And so at the limit that\u2019s converting technology advances into true value for the customer.","Operator","","Thank you. Sir, we are at the five minutes marked. Our next question is from Mahesh Sanganeria. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","","Hi, this is Shawn [ph] for Mahesh, thanks for taking my questions. Aart, I think in your prepared remark you had said about 80% [indiscernible] verification tools. I am just wondering can you comment on your market position in each component within verification, say, software, hardware, and verification IP?","","Aart de Geus","I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t quite understand the second phrase of your question. In what type of components?","Unidentified Analyst","I mean in the software part, hardware part, as well as verification IP.","Aart de Geus","In the verification area. Well, the verification area is one under very rapid evolution because the stall word tool, is simulation, has been simulation, and will remain simulation for a long period of time. And the reason for that is because if you don\u2019t verify the fundamental larger behavior of chips, all the other sort of Moot point.","At the same time there's no question that if one can accelerate simulation, the emulation techniques or FPGaxe techniques that is highly desirable, and that is especially desirable as the software content increases because not a surprise more and more companies are discovering that the software is actually less reliable as a design process than the hardware which has been incredibly automated.","And so from our perspective this is all good news because we have invested in a continuum that moves from the hardware stimulation to the software verification and as you know on top of that we are now also investing in the whole process of how to develop code in the first place that is higher quality and also more imperious to security issues.","So in many way this is sort of a Morphing of our own value proposition from absolutely a set of state-of-the-art advanced tools to now the next generation platform and I think much of the positive revenues we get from customers is on the basis of that change and its absolutely driven by the people that are at the most advance edges of technology.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks. And as a follow up, I remember last quarter you said that for verification compiling [indiscernible] pipeline is higher than expected. I am just wondering, can you provide an update in that area, how does the pipeline looks like now versus three month ago?","Aart de Geus","","Yes. Let me first remind people what verification compiler is, it is a product that contains many of the what we now call sub-products but it has for example the software simulator and the debugger and the IP and some of the more advanced static checkers.","And so that product itself has actually seen good momentum and we have seen a number of sales on that basis already. To be honest, I don\u2019t know where the pipeline is right now. My focus has been very much on the overall continuum that sees a lot of momentum but verification compiler is very good solution for people that use all of these tools together.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks, Aart.","Operator","","And the next question is from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Monika Garg","Looking at fiscal 2014, total revenue growth organically, my estimation was just about 3.6%, right. But the IP is expected to grow low double digit and your core EDA low to mid single digit. So maybe you could help us understand why the growth was low last year?","","Aart de Geus","","Well mostly it is due to lower growth rate in IP because a lot of its business was either pushed out or had deliverables that sell into 2015. And you may recall that during the year we commented on that saying that our own assessment was that the IP business was growing at low double digits on a multi year basis and all the evidence based on what we know today about FY15 supports that to far.","So definitely in 2015 you will see a much higher components due to the IP growth.","Monika Garg","The indication in Coverity, your last investor webcast you talked about Coverity growing north of 20%. Is that still the fair assumption for 2015 and 2016 for the growth rate of Coverity?","","Aart de Geus","","That is the ballpark that we are aiming at. Of course this is all complicated a little bit by this notion of haircuts. But in general that is the objective that we\u2019re shooting for and that is the premise against which we are predicting that that present business would be over $100 million in 2016 and profitable.","Monika Garg","","And was there any revenue kind of recognition impact even in fiscal 2016 for Coverity?","","Aart de Geus","","You mean is there any hair cut left for 2015, I think minimally so. There\u2019s a little bit smaller.","Monika Garg","","Okay. Got it.","Brian Beattie","Remember, it's $15 million in 2015. So we have to take that into account. That\u2019s built in our guidance, and then by 2016, there\u2019s just a little bit left.","Monika Garg","Thanks. Then the question is if you look at, you have raised strong cash balance more then close to $1 billion, more than 900 million net cash. Why not accelerate share buyback to reduce your outstanding share account?","Aart de Geus","Well, that is always a valid question. We prioritize the utilization of our cash in terms of M&A, making sure that when we have debt obligations, we live up to those and then of course, buyback. Just like you are suggesting, one of the things to not forget is that the balance of the cash between domestic and international is fairly massively. So, that tends to bring a bit of a practical limiter unless one uses other mechanisms.","But you may have heard that, Brian, suggested that this year we want to pay much higher degree of attention on keeping the share count flat. And so we will certainly do a buyback.","Brian Beattie","And Monika, just to clarify the numbers, we were significant buyback in 2014, to keep the share count very close to the 2013 levels, and then again committing for 2015 to hold it there. So you\u2019d see through 2013, 2014, and 2015, roughly a fair share count through all three years.","So, again it\u2019s putting our money to work, doing the appropriate level of buyback while as I mentioned leaving enough for strategic M&A opportunities in front of us.","Monika Garg","The last one here from me Aart. We all have seen design complexity growing which is thus really benefiting via companies. Do you think is it possible that we could see higher operating margins right, R&D expenses very high for industry. So do you think [indiscernible]?","Aart de Geus","We are at the heart of the heart of high-tech of the world, and so R&D expenses will stay a key component to be successful to bring this about. At the same time, we reiterated that our objective is to continue to move towards a solid mid-20s operating margin. And I think, Brian gave you the initial guidance for where we would land in 2015.","So that general direction has not changed. Obviously it\u2019s a function of how competitive do you want to be in the different areas. And also what opportunities do we see in some of the new areas, specifically IP which has a relatively fast turn around on investments turning to revenue, and then still very open ended and promising area of software verification. And we certainly have good ambitions.","Monika Garg","Thanks a lot. That\u2019s all from me.","Operator","And there is no one else in queue. Please continue with any closing remarks.","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well, almost perfect timing here. Thank you so much for attending this earnings release. Thank you also for all your support during FY14. We don\u2019t spend much time looking back or looking forward, and as we look forward we see a company that has three main businesses that we will continue to optimize totally for. And we\u2019re entering 2015 with a good degree of momentum.","We look forward to speak to you after this call for some of the analysts and otherwise at the next earnings release. Thank you so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay today after 4 p.m. Pacific Time through December 17 at midnight.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Ryan. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.","We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were strong. We delivered revenue of $680 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.88, both at the top of our target ranges. We executed $100 million share buyback for a total of $200 million so far this year. And we-re raising our revenue, non-GAAP earnings per share and operating cash flow guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","The landscape around us is solid with what feels like a continuing stable outlook for 2017. Our 3 customer groups, semiconductors, systems companies and software developers, continue to invest significantly. This is driven by the dawning age of digital intelligence which is both exciting and evolving quickly. Everything around us is becoming smart, connected but also complex. Mounting software content, whether integrated on a chip or as an app, creates huge functionality, development and security challenges. This, in turn, drives growth opportunities around machine learning, automotive, augmented and virtual reality, networking infrastructure and the soaring need for more cloud-based computation and storage.","With the unique portfolio reaching from the roots of silicon all the way up to software, combined with best-in-class global support, Synopsys continues to demonstrate that our vision, strategy, investments and execution are right on the money. This is evidenced in all 3 product groups. Core EDA revenue growth has outpaced competitors over the past years. IP continues its double digit growth and our software quality and security group is scaling to critical mass with excellent revenue expansion.","Let me provide some highlights from the quarter beginning with core EDA. Synopsys is a mission-critical partner for the most advanced designs. Our EDA and IP collaboration with TSMC illustrates this. During Q2, we announced full flow certification for TSMC's 12- and 7-nanometer processes as well as broad IP cooperation for 12-nanometer FinFETs. Customers today rely on Synopsys for more than 95% of their FinFET designs. Meanwhile, we-re already partnering on early R&D of 5-nanometer and below.","Our design platform is generating solid results and notable customer successes. IC Compiler II, our place and route solution, is used on highly complex chips, some as advanced as 7-nanometer, by companies such as Xilinx, NVIDIA, ST and Broadcom. IC Validator, our physical verification product, has already performed final sign-off of more than 100 FinFET production tape-outs, a significant accomplishment given the historical reliance on competitors.","Meanwhile, intensive R&D across our digital platform is delivering new high-impact capabilities at a very rapid pace. In custom, our long-time leadership in simulation and our new Custom Compiler design solution are generating high interest. Custom Compiler's FinFET optimizations and our close collaboration with UMC, for example, enabled customers to use Custom Compiler in their new 14-nanometer process. At our March user group conference, ST, MediaTek and Renesas shared their production successes with engineers from more than 40 companies.","In verification, we continued to see excellent results and a strong outlook for the year. Our Verification Continuum platform is in high demand for 2 reasons, first, we have leading-edge verification technologies ranging from simulation to emulation to prototyping to static techniques to powerful, well integrated debugging; and second, our coherent platform is solidly centered at the intersection of hardware and software, the very intersection enabling Smart Everything and addressing the time-to-market urgency of this dynamic market.","We continue to see great progress ranging from excellent customer interest in our new superfast VCS simulator to platform-wide adoption and proliferation. Over the last several quarters, leading mobile, graphics and processor companies have aligned with us through expanded multi-year strategy -- strategic agreements, including simulation, verification IP, debug, formal, emulation and prototyping technologies.","In Q2, broad demand for ZeBu emulation continued with 6 new logos and expansion in top accounts. For example, Spreadtrum standardized on ZeBu for its advanced mobile SoCs and Wave Computing adopted ZeBu for its machine learning products. While lumpy from quarter-to quarter, we expect 2017 to be another record year for hardware revenue, driven by industry demand and the robustness of our solution.","On top of this, virtual prototyping which enables early software development and architecture assessment, resonated particularly well in the automotive market. During the quarter, we announced support for chips from Silicon Mobility Inc., a leading semiconductor provider for hybrid and electric vehicle control systems.","Let me pause for a moment on automotive, where, over the past several years, we've deployed a wide range of targeted solutions. With touch points ranging from functional safety to autonomous driving to the next-generation of infotainment, all the way to lighting simulation, Synopsys is growing into a crucial participant in the automotive ecosystem. Elements throughout our EDA, IP and software integrity portfolio are now certified for the most stringent level of automotive safety defined by the ISO 26262 standard.","In IP, for example, over the last 8 quarters, we significantly extended our portfolio of certified IP. More broadly, in Q2, we saw strong demand in IP with particular momentum in advanced technology and security. We announced an expansive portfolio of IP for TSMC's 12 FFC process and taped out multiple 10- and 7-nanometer IP test chips with advanced foundries. We're systematically building out our portfolio of security IP for mobile, automotive, IoT and cloud computing markets. In Q2, for example, we delivered a high-performance, hardware-secure module that protects sensitive information and data processing within SoCs.","The need for security is, of course, much broader than IP which brings me to our third customer base, software developers across many industries. The focus in our growing Software Integrity Group is to provide products and services that help developers write high-quality code that can withstand security vulnerabilities. This as a key differentiator and new TAM for Synopsys and I'm happy to report that it's scaling well both organically and via acquisitions.","Our software sign-off platform is making good progress and we have expanded our road map to reflect the acquisition of Cigital. We're strong in the embedded space with growing transaction sizes and are gaining good traction in the automotive industry with our security solutions and well-respected expertise.","With the acquisition of Cigital in Q1, we're accelerating penetration in other key verticals such as the financial services industry. Our objective is to drive demand creation at early stages of security strategy development. The Cigital integration is already delivering examples of our first combined services and product agreements and cross-selling opportunities.","Finally, Synopsys was named a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for application security testing. The Magic Quadrant is an important indicator for customers who often use it to narrow their list of potential vendors. We've already seen increased customer interest as a result.","In closing, as we look to the second half of the year and beyond, our priorities remain centered on generating long term shareholder value. We do this by investing organically and through M&A and EDA, IP and software integrity to realize our Silicon to Software vision. We do this by executing with a clear intent to sustain technology leadership while simultaneously growing revenue and profitability throughout our business. And we do this with a clear bottom line objective and many year track record, of driving ongoing high single-digit EPS growth and returning cash to shareholders.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. In Q2, we closed another outstanding quarter and continue to execute very well. We met or exceeded all key financial targets, delivered strong revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth, completed a $100 million share buyback and generated significant cash flow. Our first half was very strong and as a result, we-re raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year, unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 12% to $680 million, at the high-end of our target range, with particular strength in hardware and IP. About 90% of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and 1 customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 2.7 years and we expect the 2017 average to be slightly less than 3 years.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $626 million which included a $38 million accrual related to the ongoing Eve-Mentor litigation. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $513 million, within our target range.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.6% for the quarter. For the year, we expect solid organic margin expansion over 2016, moderated by the impact of the Cigital and Codiscope acquisitions. GAAP earnings per share were $0.34 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.88, at the high end of our target range.","Operating cash flow was $123 million, driven by strong collections and business levels. We-re again raising our 2017 cash flow target to a range of $580 million to $600 million. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short term investments of $1.1 billion with 11% onshore and total debt of $418 million.","In Q2, we returned $100 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program and we have $235 million remaining on our current authorization.","Before moving onto guidance, let me briefly update you on ASC 606, the new revenue recognition rules that we'll implement in fiscal 2019. We-re preparing for the rule change and are confident that our predictable model will remain substantially intact.","Now to third quarter and fiscal 2017 guidance. For Q3, the targets are, revenue between $685 million and $700 million which reflects both strength and timing of hardware sales; total GAAP cost and expenses between $574 million and $593 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $517 million and $527 million; other income between negative $1 million and $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.69 to $0.78 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.91 to $0.94 per share.","For 2017, we're raising our revenue target to $2.65 billion to $2.67 billion, a growth rate of 9% to 10% which reflects underlying strength in our business, including record hardware sales; other income between $2 million and $6 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $1.84 to $1.97 per share. We're raising the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings target range by $0.03 to $3.24 to $3.29 per share, a growth rate of 7% to 9%; capital expenditures of approximately $90 million; and cash flow from operations of $580 million to $600 million.","As we look to the remainder of 2017, we expect Q4 to be the lowest revenue and EPS quarter due to the timing of hardware shipments and seasonally higher operating expenses. Investors should expect continued variability in revenue due to the growth of our hardware products and their upfront revenue recognition. Excluding hardware, our 90-10 time-based revenue model remains in effect.","Finally, we're in the early stages of planning for next year and we'd encourage investors to wait until we've provided guidance before updating estimates. That said, we believe the current 2018 consensus non-GAAP EPS estimates look reasonable. This is consistent with our long term objective of driving high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.","In summary, Q2 was a great quarter. We delivered strong growth across the board. We're raising our 2017 outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and cash flow and we continue to drive long term shareholder value by investing in the business both organically and through acquisitions and by returning capital through share buybacks.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Rich Valera of Needham & Company.","Richard Valera","I wanted to ask about the strength you're seeing in the core EDA business. Aart, you've been on record on numerous occasions saying you thought that was kind of a low single-digit growth business, yet it looks like you're growing that close to double digits last couple of quarters. I just wanted to get your sense of what's driving that with any more color than you gave in your prepared remarks and kind of how sustainable this well above kind of industry growth rate might be.","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, I think we're in a phase of the industry around us and ourselves that tends to be strong and when we give you directions on growth rates of the different areas, we always look at it from a perspective of a multi-year outlook because that's sort of the only fair way to do it, all the more given that we have a multi-year agreement. Having said that, there's no question that the push towards more advanced chips is actually continuing strong and I think the reason for that is relatively straightforward which is that the new opportunities in technologies and products are using any of the existing computation and mobility techniques but now amended by increased digital intelligence requirements, will continue to be very strong after that enormous amounts of data generated by a happily growing set of sensors. And you can see that the entire field is really poised to demand more computation. And so it is natural, therefore, for people to come to our products. And while there are some up and down from quarter-to quarter, they are driving the leading edge and they need the tools to support that. So I think we're fortunate to do well.","Richard Valera","Got it. And then just more specifically for the quarter, the service maintenance line was very strong. I'm not sure if you could give any commentary on what that was and how we should think about that line for the balance of the year.","Trac Pham","Rich, on -- you're referring to the P&L with the split?","Richard Valera","Correct.","Trac Pham","On the services and product line, that includes the Cigital acquisition as well as strength in underlying IP, right? That's where the PoC revenues flow through as well.","Richard Valera","But was that -- that was an unusually strong quarter. Should we think about that as a [indiscernible] ?","Trac Pham","No, IP tends to be pretty lumpy, but we-re doing -- if you look at the results from a product mix, we-re doing well in IP. But it does tend to be lumpy and then you add that to the Cigital acquisition where we've got a full quarter of that now. That's driving a quarter-on quarter change.","Richard Valera","Got it. So higher than historical levels but maybe not quite that high going forward. That makes sense.","Trac Pham","Yes. We keep it in -- as we said publicly, the -- we expect IP to go grow in the double-digit rate and it could be lumpy from quarter-to quarter. But our goal is to drive that growth sustainably in the double digits.","Richard Valera","Got it. And then just with respect to hardware you've obviously had a great run of demand here in hardware and it looks like Q3, probably not expecting any different, but you're currently modeling it, sounds like, for Q4 to maybe see a -- take a breather in hardware. Is that something you really have visibility to? Or is that just out of an abundance of caution? Just trying to get a sense of how much visibility you actually have to that Q4 sales hardware?","Aart de Geus","It feels like repetitive in the last 3 or 4 earnings releases. We must have used the word hardware is lumpy every time and that is an indication that the visibility is not complete, meaning that some of these things come in and then the customer wants immediate fulfillment or delayed fulfillment. So the timing can be somewhat arbitrary. There's no question that we have done well in the hardware area and I think that correlate directly to what we said earlier which is growth in complexity of chips but also more and more chips and the affiliated software needing to be verified together. And that is only a center of strength for Synopsys.","Trac Pham","Rich, you bring up a good point in terms of Q4. The profile of Q4 is impacted by the variability of hardware. As you've seen in the results across geos, across product mixes, we're doing well. And going forward, you'll see more variability quarter-on quarter. So I think focus on the full year. And just as you brought up, the Q4 profile is down, but that's just mostly on hardware.","Operator","The next question is from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely","First, I was curious what are the specific drivers of the hardware IP. Is it the core semi business, the system players or perhaps new customers in Asia?","Aart de Geus","Actually, the first two groups because in order for emulation and other hardware isolation methods to be useful, it is really in the proximity of the intersection of hardware and software which means it's the high-end chips that invariably drive a lot of software or it is the systems companies that integrate multiple chips around building apps or building entire product. And so the distinction between semiconductor vendors and system vendors sometimes is a little blurred because they tend to increasingly do stuff for each other or demand from each other that, that sits at this intersection. So both of those, I think, sort of grow hand in hand.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. And then on the IP side, [indiscernible] the new customers are looking to fast track some designs now.","Aart de Geus","Yes. Actually, sorry I forgot that part of your question. IP is directly related to efficiency and productivity. And with continuous complexity of chips and by the way, continued complexity of the IP blocks, delayed collection of these blocks just continues to grow and the efficiency with which people can put together large chips is directly a function of which blocks are available, how easy is it to integrate them and how much do you trust the vendor because, obviously, you're highly relying on who provides you those blocks. And so as companies design large chips or larger systems, increasingly, they put their engineers on those aspects that they can't purchase but where they can provide additional differentiation while outsourcing increasingly blocks that, in the past, they would have done themselves. And I think that bodes very well for us.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. So for both of those groups, too, have you begun to see any kind of a seasonality pattern with them? Or is purely just project based and can be fairly random through the year?","Aart de Geus","I have not seen any seasonality. I think it is very much project based and it has always a little bit the characteristic that the minute they figure out what's going to be in the project, they would like to have the IP the next day which, of course, not possible because a lot of this gets developed as part of agreements and service development sets. But the projects come and go. The companies have no aligned time line for these projects and so I don't see any seasonality. But one could have the configuration that, for some reason, there are some quarter, there are more project finishing than others or deliveries that we could do. So it could be somewhat lumpy, but it's not because of seasonality.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. And then moving over to the core EDA market. Are the tools, the software tools now ready, completely ready for the 7- and 5-nanometer nodes? Or are there still challenges to be overcome?","Aart de Geus","They are completely ready for the 7-nanometer. 5-nanometer is not on the market and 5-nanometer is still in deep development. That will take a little while. And even when I say for the 7-nanometer -- 7-nanometer is really leading edge and what that means is that the foundries that provide the technology and that manufacture these chips will keep refining their technology on ongoing basis because they constantly are trying to tune the yields that they get because if you have a little higher yields, meaning a higher percentage of chips that work on a wafer, that has enormous economic impact. And so we-re in constant interaction with foundries. Every time that they tune it a little bit, we tune our tools and in some cases, we also tune our IP a little further.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. And in your answer, they do include the IP and the 7-nanometers being ready as well?","Aart de Geus","Yes, we have a number of efforts in these advanced nodes and the word ready is not a black and white, meaning that there are certain things that are already earlier. There are certain things that are already with 7-nanometers, not quite there, for test chips, for example. And so there's a very complex multi-year process to bring something to market. But from my commentary, you should read that we-re well exercised in trying to align as much as possible with the foundry train so that we arrive at the station at the same time.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. And does your answer there either include or not include EUV? Does it matter to you?","Aart de Geus","It doesn't matter that much. There are some very fundamental IP that's impacted by EUV. And as you may know, EUV is sort of now just slowly seeping into potentially some production manufacturing in the coming years and that is only for a few layers of the chip. And there are many, many layers, so EUV will be for the very refined ones initially. And so we're well on top of that, but it does not mean a big effort nor a big issue.","Thomas Diffely","Okay. And then finally, Trac, you said that the accounting rule changes should have just not much impact on your model. If you were to see the impact, where would it be?","Trac Pham","There are some portions of it in the IP business that could be affected and fortunately, we have got time to work through how to structure those contracts. And then there's a small portion on some elements of FSAs related to the software contracts, the FSAs being the equivalent to gift cards that you buy certain amount and then draw down over time. Those things will be challenging as we work through the rules, but fortunately, we know what they are. And they're relatively small portion and we've got some time to address them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Sreekrishnan Sankar","I had a few more easy questions for you, Aart. Number one, on your IP business, can you guys say how much of it is actually ratable versus upfront?","Trac Pham","Roughly 60% is ratable.","Aart de Geus","Yes. Just to clarify, when we do IP, people buy existing functionality but very often wanted to be delivered in a very specific form, maybe with some alterations or with some tuning for their versions of technology. And so this is why the IP is accompanied by a statement of work which can be viewed essentially as a service business. But it is service business around an existing product. And the reason you saw us hesitate is because we rarely think about it in those 2 categories. But it is a good question. It is sort of a balance between the 2.","Sreekrishnan Sankar","Got it. That's really helpful. And then a couple of other ones. Obviously, there's been a lot of chatter about activity in China on their own semiconductor investment front. Have you guy started seeing any purchases for EDA tools from the indigenous Chinese companies?","Aart de Geus","Yes, we have seen those since like the middle 1990s. We've been in China for a long, long time and they have been, for now many, many years, many design companies. Many have not been successful. And so I would say, we're at least already on the third or fourth generation of companies where a bunch have disappeared, reconfigured and so on. And now there is a significant segment of strong Chinese companies that are -- that have, year after year, become closer and closer to be at the state of the art and we would certainly say that there are a few companies that are designing with absolutely state-of-the-art silicon technology. And so they have been broad users of our tools. China has been a growing market for us and we continue to see expansion of that market.","Trac Pham","Krish [indiscernible] doing well across our entire portfolio. So we've been doing -- selling EDA in China for a long time as Aart described it. IP is a very good opportunity and we've seen growth there. And then even with the Software Integrity business, that's been emerging over the last few years as well.","Sreekrishnan Sankar","Okay. All right. Let me -- I'm going to try to ask the question a different way then. If I look at, historically, for Synopsys, memory has been about 15% to 20% of your business and China has this huge plan to get into like memory with new 3D NAND factories. And from those customers, have you actually started seeing any -- are you guys having any conversation with this new 3D NAND investment in China? Or have you guys started seeing any early POs or anything of that nature?","Aart de Geus","Definitely yes. I mean, memory development is development that requires pretty deep understanding of semiconductor physics and device construction. And so with the number of companies we have now been working for a while on the development of those, you're absolutely right that, in the last recent period, I would say maybe last 2 years, there has been an increase in attention and effort. And that is the direct response to the fact that most economies are seeing an enormous amount of data coming about, that the big data will be analyzed and therefore, the -- be it in the cloud or be it the devices around it, are all going to use massively more memory and that their strong desire to make that memory a lot faster so that you can do more processing. And so in that sense, while China may be new to this game, the push in new memory technologies is quite interesting and that fits well the overall picture of a semiconductor business that is going to be an enabler to many other high-tech capabilities.","Sreekrishnan Sankar","Got you. Got you. And then the final question I had is if I look at your fiscal first half or the last 2 quarters, your R&D as a percent of your sale, it's kind of been running at the low end of your historical range. I'm curious to know, is that the new fundamental shift on how you're going to be more effective with your R&D? Or are 2 quarters just not too big a data point to like extrapolate?","Trac Pham","I wouldn't extrapolate off of 2 quarters. I think what you're seeing in first half is mostly the acceleration of revenues. We expect to maintain R&D investments in the 30%-ish range. And depending on how -- what you're seeing this year is just the lumpiness of revenues and the quarterly profile will skew that. But overall, we expect to maintain the model in that 30% range.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Sterling Auty, JPMorgan.","Sterling Auty","I'm wondering, with the acquisition of Cigital on top of all the other elements that you've pieced together in some of the software assurance, et cetera, how much of your sales and marketing headcount is now focused outside the core kind of systems and semiconductor industries.","Aart de Geus","Good question. I don't know the exact answer, but I can venture that it is probably half to a little bit more as outside. And the reason for that is that the marketing needed in our core semiconductor space is not that high because we have many very good connections and we can relatively easily access people that need security and quality tools for their software. Whereas in the rest of the space, there are many different market segments. And you mentioned Cigital which is a really interesting acquisition because it's not only that it brings to us a service business, that allows us to engage at a higher level with customers that are looking at the strategy of their -- of how to deal with quality and security. It is that they're also very strong in the financial market. ","And so the way you communicate with financial market is very different than, let's say, the health market or the embedded software market and that is why some marketing effort has to be specialized on that. From a sales point of view, there, it is much more a question of global access and how quickly can we grow this and be in a situation where we have high-quality salespeople. And that is an ongoing effort and going well. We're growing well, but there's no end to that one yet.","Sterling Auty","And then on the IP business, you mentioned the strength that you're seeing there. We look at the gross margins. Obviously, the gross margins relative to expectations was probably heavily influenced on the mix. But specifically to the IP, how would you characterize the gross margin contribution at this point and the thoughts of where that could trend?","Trac Pham","Sure. This is Trac. The margins on that are pretty healthy, but directionally, they're slightly below the corporate average. And that's about where we'd expect to drive that.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then last question, you mentioned 606 on a couple of areas, but I didn't hear one of the attributes of 606 is the backlog disclosure. Any thoughts around the structure of how you're going to disclose the backlog? And specifically, I know it has to be done quarterly, but there is the commentary that goes with it describing how you go from backlog into revenue. Is there any conclusions at this point in terms of how that would be -- how those disclosures will come?","Trac Pham","No. We're still assessing that, but I would say that we've done a pretty good job disclosing backlog in the past. And the metrics that we provided, I think, gives investors a pretty good sense of the health of the business. Going into any particular year, we do aim for about 80% visibility of backlog, scheduled revenue in backlog at the end of the year. Secondly, we try to enter the quarter -- each quarter with about 90% of backlog in hand. So I think those 2 metrics combined with anything else we provide should give pretty good color on the health of the business.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Trac, let me start with you. You raised the midpoint of your cash flow expectation for the year by $80 million. Is that pretty broadly based in terms of numbers of customers driving that? Or is it fairly narrowly based in terms of perhaps there's a small number of customers with a large amount of collections driving that number? And then secondly, for you, before I turn to Aart, given the scaling that you're seeing now in hardware, could you comment on the margin or mix trends vis-\u00e0-vis hardware profitability?","Trac Pham","Okay. Let me start first with the broad -- the cash flow, whether it's broad based. It was, yes, definitely broad based and that would be consistent with the health of the business that we're seeing in the first half. As I mentioned, when you look across, the growth was pretty broad based across geographies and product mixes. So that -- the cash flow is consistent with that. And then from a hardware perspective, we-re definitely doing well with hardware revenues and the profitability on that certainly is improving and it is [indiscernible] profits.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Is it improving as a percentage of the hardware revenue?","Trac Pham","Yes.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. For Aart, a couple of things for you. We often hear over the years from EDA companies when new hardware is introduced, particularly emulation of course, detailed descriptions about the hardware specifications and most particularly about the design capacity that the hardware systems are capable of. We don't typically hear that sort of discussion around the software tool capacity. And this issue has come up for you and others over the years in terms of design size capacity that you could put through, DC, for example and the issues of that kind. As you move now to 10-nanometer and below, could you talk about whether or not there are any capacity issues that you need to resolve for any role of your tools to adequately handle the design sizes that you're likely to see? You mentioned new version of VCS, so perhaps that's one example.","But anything you can address with regard to the capacity on the software side would be helpful. And then lastly for you on the technology front, are you beginning to see any kind of conjoined usage of your prototyping hardware with software integrity, in other words, is the software to bring out capability of hardware being used somehow with the Software Integrity business? And then similarly, is the prototyping business being used increasingly along with emulation as part of your Verification Continuum?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well, so for being at Synopsys for 30 years, I would say our capacity has always been less than the customer wanted and more than they thought they would get, meaning that the state of the art is limited typically by a few things which is, one, is how fast can you run; and two, how much can you run at the same time. And so it has been actually quite remarkable how, over all this time period, these numbers have continued to increase. And I'm certainly on record of having argued many times that we-re the other half of Moore's Law which is if they can manufacture it, we will find a way to simulate it, to design it and so on and that goes hand in hand. But for the most state-of-the-art situations, one has always had the limit of what one can do. The second comment I would have for that, it is quite remarkable how, over all these years, over and over, there have been redesigns of architecture of utilization of compute environments, of utilization of multiple computers, multiple cores, multiple threads that have managed to keep your question in check.","So we're always chasing the horizon in other words and this is true on the hardware side in emulation or prototyping. It is certainly true for software for a long time. And expect that to absolutely continue and we will stay at the leading edge of that. Secondly, regarding the intersection of prototyping and software integrity, I expect that we're going to start seeing some of that in the not-too-distant future. So far, there's not been a lot of evidence of that, but we have not really pushed on that front yet either. The intersection between prototyping of emulation, we have already seen quite a bit of that. And by the way, it's intersection of prototyping, emulation and simulation and in some cases, even virtual prototyping. And that is because the system people would like to simulate software on larger systems that have many components that may be defined at different levels of abstraction. So all of this is being done. I don't want to give the impression that this is routinely easy. This is sophisticated stuff. But we-re in a very strong position with this and the most advanced customers are very literate about this type of problems.","Operator","Okay and our next question will come from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg","First, just if I look at your guidance, even if you've modeled the high end of revenue guidance, since Q4, you were guiding almost $50 million down Q-over-Q. Historically, your Q4 is at least flattish to modestly up. So what is leading to such high kind of revenue down Q-over-Q? Or is it just you're being conservative?","Trac Pham","No, Monika, it's really the hardware business. As we mentioned, it will vary from quarter-to quarter. The underlying -- outside of hardware, the business -- all the other businesses are doing well, so it's not offsetting anything. But hardware is driving the quarter-on quarter comparison.","Monika Garg","$50 million?","Trac Pham","I'm sorry?","Monika Garg","So the downside is about $50 million, 5-0. The others are up.","Aart de Geus","We have very strong hardware business.","Monika Garg","Okay. And a similar point, your operating margins, if I have to model for the guidance, it's going to be like 17%, again, down like almost 700, 800 basis points year-over-year and Q-over-Q. Hardware is down. Operating margin should be better, right?","Trac Pham","As we mentioned at the earlier comments, expenses are seasonally up in Q4, so we've got the offset of revenues coming down because of the hardware trend and the expenses going up in Q4.","Monika Garg","All right. Then, can you just remind us how big your software security business now? And when do you expect it to be breakeven?","Trac Pham","Well, as we mentioned last -- in previous calls, we were guiding to about $100 million last year which we met and a -- the overall growth in that business is about 20% which is tracking, too. And then Cigital, when we acquired them, was roughly half of the existing business. And then the underlying business, we mentioned that the acquisitions would be dilutive to earnings this year and would affect margins. But on the classic software integrity business, we-re on track to do breakeven at second half of the year.","Monika Garg","All right. Then, going forward, what is the growth rate you expect in the software security business, including the Cigital acquisition?","Trac Pham","We're looking at the 20% range.","Monika Garg","Okay. Then, Aart, we saw like, over the weekend, a big security breach. Could you maybe talk about how this could impact the security -- software security business? Have you seen any...","Aart de Geus","Yes. For starters, we're fortunate that our own processes around upgrading our firewalls, of making sure that all of the patches have been applied to software have been effective, so we have not had any issues with this. Very clearly, every time there is a big story, in this case, massive number of stories, the attention level around the notion of security goes up. And we-re sitting in the space where the idea is to design security in the first place, not to just fix all the things that went wrong in the past but make it essentially correct by construction. And so from that perspective, I think we-re in a very healthy situation. If you amend that by the fact that Gartner which tracks many, many security-related companies such as ourselves, are now putting us in the leading quadrant for the activities that we do, obviously, the attention that this is getting is positive for our business even if it's negative for the world and so we-re seeing that with the acquisition of Cigital, with the commentary that Trac just gave you on the existing business.","I feel that we can now state that this business has, for lack of better term, reached critical mass. And what I mean with that is that a number of years ago, we made the decision to move up from the silicon to the software. We made a decision to bank beyond the hardware and software intersection and that, moreover, this new TAM that touches many companies that, in the past, we have no business with looks very promising. There were many execution challenges in getting there. I think we've navigated well through those. And I'm very encouraged with where we-re in the middle of 2017 because we see this vision materializing. And hopefully, it's not on the back of catastrophes around us but more on the premise that building correctly for the future is really where the software industry should go and that is where our contribution will be.","Monika Garg","Got it. Then, the new administration has talked about making it easy for cash repatriation. If that happens, how could you think about the usage of cash?","Trac Pham","Monika, we-re staying on top on what's developing as far as tax reform in the U.S. If it does occur, I mean, obviously, we -- I think when you use cash the same way we've been using over the last several years. Over the last, trailing 12 -- 4 quarters, we've bought back close to $400 million in stock. We've acquired companies in the software integrity space and we'll continue to use the cash to drive growth in terms of acquisitions and then return cash when it's appropriate via buybacks.","Monika Garg","Last one for me on IP, growing double digit. Is double digit the right way to look at going forward? And then you've been building ADAS IP for autos for some time. Are you seeing inflection in that?","Aart de Geus","Well, for the first part of your question, yes, we think that it is in the low double digits. So far, the team has been executing particularly well and if you look at it from the complex chips, our expectations are that we will continue to see good growth and healthy business there. I'm sorry, I couldn't acoustically hear your second part of the question.","Monika Garg","You've been building the ADAS IP for autos for some time. Maybe are you seeing inflection in that?","Aart de Geus","Oh, yes, sure, sorry. Yes, automotive has been an interesting area because it's having so much attention, frankly, by a whole number of people that may create a bit of a bubble there. But at the same time, there's a good reason it's getting so much attention which is it is the showcase for what modern hardware software will be able to do to fundamentally transform a field that has been relatively slow in evolving. It is now evolving very, very rapidly. And so we have invested quite a bit over the last few years not only to make sure that the tools are capable of dealing with this type of designs, but our IP portfolio has grown significantly in the realm of having certified IP.","And certification of IP is for one key reason which is automotive demands a certain set of checks to make sure that what you're doing is actually safe. And in the past, safety has been actually developed quite well in automotive. With this very, very rapid increase of both hardware and software, the complexity that comes with that is going to be a challenge for safety and the fact that we have a portfolio that is now massively certified, I think, bodes very well for our position there.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets.","Mitchell Steves","Two questions for you if I could. First for Aart. Just in terms of the core EDA business, that's continuing to grow at double digits now. So I know you guys have talked to low to mid-single growth. But what exactly has changed there? I mean, I know the CAD business or the CAD industry to be growing faster. Could you maybe highlight some changes that have happened over the past year or so?","Aart de Geus","Well, one of the key pieces is that the intersection of hardware and software has been driving verification extremely hard and a subcategory to that is really emulation and prototyping. We refer to that as hardware. And that growth has just been exemplary because so many people would like to run software on hardware they don't have and so instead, they use an emulator to sort of fake the hardware if you like. And I expect that to continue because if you want to go to market, you want to start the software development as soon as you possibly can and make sure that it's going to work with the hardware that takes a long time to manufacture. So that has really been one of the key variables in this game.","Mitchell Steves","Got it. And then secondly for Trac on the financial side. I'm having a hard time getting to the kind of Q4 EPS because if I look historically, typically from Q3 to Q4, your total expenses go up by $20 million or so but in order to get to the new midpoint that the full year guide implies, if you're going to be $30 million plus or a 50% increase, so I guess, what's kind of in the financial model for Q4 that's abnormal from the past?","Trac Pham","Well, normally, the -- as you highlighted, the expenses do ramp up from Q3 to Q4. What we would normally see this year is an increase in hiring. That's per our plan. You would see a ramp-up in variable comp as we accrue for where we think we're going to end up the year. And then, historically, the numbers I think -- well, we can model with you, offline, but your historical numbers in terms of growth might be a little aggressive. And then the offset to that is how you model the Q3 revenue to Q4 profile, but we can work with you afterwards.","Operator","Okay. And we have no further questions in queue and we do have 5 minutes remaining. I'll turn it back to the executive board.","Aart de Geus","Well, thank you very much for attending this earnings release. Hopefully, you took away that we had a very strong quarter, that the outlook for the coming quarter is strong, the overall year is looking extremely solid. But most importantly, I think the alignment around our Silicon to Software strategy appears to be working quite well and all the individual businesses have contributed strongly to our present success. So with the intent to continue on that trajectory, we thank you for your support and attention.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference.

And welcome to the Synopsys Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter Fiscal Year of 2018. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last for one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference [Technical Difficulty].","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Susan. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year as we delivered double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings. Revenue was $769 million and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.10 both above our target ranges. We continue to return capital to shareholders initiating a $200 million share repurchase and we closed the important acquisition of Black Duck Software. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","The market we serve through our three customer groups; semiconductors, systems companies, and software developers had a very strong 2017. The semi industry grew 19% and I'm always forecast a positive outlook for 2018 and beyond with growth expectations in the high single digits. Driving the market are three important dynamics; smart everything, sophisticated hardware software interaction and the universal need for software security.","First, the new age of smart everything or digital intelligence is unfolding rapidly. Applying machine learning to massive quantities of big data requires dedicated high-performance processing, huge storage capacity, and broad connectivity bandwidth. Innovation and investments in AI chips are growing rapidly moreover digitization and early results in verticals such as automotive, industrial, medical, financial, virtual reality and many others are readily visible.","The race is very much home and Synopsis is front and center with tools and IP to support the development of extremely advanced machine learning chips. Second, the intersection of dedicated high-performance hardware with vast amounts of sophisticated software is at the core of both challenges and opportunities manifested in particular with systems companies. Simply stated, faster compute enables more sophisticated software and rapidly advancing software demands still faster compute. The intersection of hardware and software is the center of gravity of Synopsis strategy and verification, emulation and prototyping.","And third, the proliferation of connected devices across virtually every aspect of life makes finding security vulnerabilities early in the software development process an imperative. This is certainly paramount for systems that touch human life society's infrastructure and high value industrial and financial system. Here too Synopsis has carved out a unique technical and market leadership position and our Software Integrity Group has been growing well.","Summarizing the opportunities, Synopsis is in a position today to address all of these dynamics and participate in this exciting way. We have a unique combination of leading technologies reaching from Silicon to Software with particular emphasis on the intersection of the two. Our company is global with a strong and experienced feel and support team and over the years we've executed well while having the courage to invest in adjacent growth opportunities ahead of the curve.","Now to some Q1 product highlights spanning Silicon to Software. At the foundation of Silicon, Synopsis continues to help drive the development of state of the art new technologies enabling the most complex chips. FinFET designs require highly advanced performance, area, yield, and low power capabilities. As a pioneer and leader in FinFIT the design enablement, we are relying on for over 90% of these chips. Supporting development of the most advanced devices, our TCAD, technology computer aided design continues to advance to smaller and smaller circuits. Now including five, three and two nanometer nodes.","These dimensions traditional TCAD needs to evolve in order to simulate individual layers of atoms. Over the last two years, Synopsis has invested in this capability and our TCAD is now capable of doing so-called atomistic simulation. Our digital design platform centered around synthesis, place and route and sign off continues to drive advanced customer results and growth.","During the quarter, we won a business-critical AI targeted design and had a significant competitive displacement at a high-profile US systems company both driven by excellent low power results. Success with advanced process technology also continues. One example was a competitive win on an ARM CPU implementation in China driven by better total power consumption results. Reflecting the compelling benefits of integration of physical verification into our core digital flow IT house known for its A6 for industrial automotive and medical technology selected IC Validator replacing incumbent tools.","Our custom analog product group also posted a strong quarter. Custom Compiler continues to grow, we've made inroads into larger Asian semiconductor companies expanding our footprint versus the incumbent. In addition, demand for our mixed signal simulation in memory and automotive segments is high as customers accelerate their move into next generation DRAM and 3D NAND memory design.","Now to verification where we continue to deliver outstanding results and grow. Our Verification Continuum platform is the most comprehensive solution in the market today utilizing the fastest engines across the board and with the number one position in both software and hardware verification. In Q1 our franchise VCS simulator displaced the incumbent at a marquee US systems company and a large broad-based semiconductor provider.","Our hardware based ZeBu emulation and HAPS prototyping again delivered very strong growth and broad-based customer adoption. In Q1 ZeBu deployments included leading companies such as AMD, Broadcom, HiSilico and NXP.","In addition, we announced a partnership with the French alternative energies and atomic energy commission, a key player in technology research. The partnership enables advancements of ZeBu as the leading SOC emulation tool for the European automotive industry. Moving to our IP product, we continue to deliver double-digit revenue growth with strength across the board. Our excellent results are derived from the high reliability and quality of our broad portfolio of interface, memory, analog, security and processor IP along with our very skilled and dedicated global support teams.","Over the past several months, we further expanded our IP portfolio with the acquisitions of Kilopass and Sidense augmenting our non-volatile memory offering. Solid adoption of our security IP continues, with significant wins at several leading semiconductor companies, one of which is using our IP for its high-value autonomous driving SoCs. Also in automotive, we see continued traction of our embedded vision processor and certified interfaces.","Let me pause for a moment on automotive. While many verticals are racing towards a world of smart everything, automotive is simultaneously moving to car electrification and autonomous driving, while having to maintain and extend safety and security requirements. The tongue-and-cheek quip of the car becoming a computer on wheels is actually not an exaggeration at all. In the last few years, we have therefore significantly increased our focus on this sector.","Today a growing customer base, ranging from car OEMs, to tier 1 suppliers, to semiconductor providers, to AI chip and algorithm specialists, rely on Synopsys across our EDA, IP and Software Integrity platforms. Synopsys tools are used to address critical safety and security requirements across the automotive development lifecycle, including virtual prototyping and verification to aid in system development, safety-standard certified IP, ISO certified EDA tools, optical solutions for automotive lighting, and software security testing to drive secure, high-quality code.","Which leads me to our Software Integrity group, whose goal it is to provide products and services to build security and quality into the software development lifecycle, and across the entire cyber supply chain. Our strategy to accomplish this is two-fold. First, offer a Software Integrity platform that covers a broad range of programming languages and security testing solutions. In this highly fragmented market, with scores of point tools for sale, a comprehensive platform from a global, reliable supplier is highly valuable.","And second, provide company leaders with high-level consulting and benchmarking to help them assess their current threat environment, and devise plans of attack to address the security problem throughout their software development process.","In the last four years, we've systematically built our Software Integrity Group to critical mass through both organic execution and strategic acquisitions. Top off by the acquisition of Black Duck this quarter, our brand is solidifying, and industry experts are recognizing the strength of Synopsys' strategy and portfolio.","At this point, we've been rated by Gartner as a Leader in their Magic Quadrant for application security testing. Just last quarter, we were also named a Leader in the Forrester Wave for static application security testing, while we also achieved a Leadership designation in IDC's Marketscape for quality analysis. These recognitions make a difference, as they facilitate gaining access to the top levels of company executives across many industries. We experienced product strength across the board and continued to close large new and renewal contracts with companies and industries ranging from financial service to automotive. Our consulting business group is working at capacity, and the value of our engagement is steadily increasing.","As mentioned, we closed the acquisition of Black Duck, a leader in open source testing for both security vulnerabilities and license compliance. The integration is progressing smoothly with bookings and revenue well on track. The highly respected Black Duck brand and market position have also brought further positive attention to Synopsys as the emerging software quality and security company.","In summary, we started fiscal 2018 on a strong note, exceeding expectations and raising our full-year guidance; we're seeing very good momentum with our EDA platforms, continued strength and expansion of our IP portfolio, and excellent progress in Software Integrity as we continue to invest and broaden our TAM in this emerging market.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 results were very strong and we continue to see good momentum in the business. Our financial results met or exceeded our expectations across all key metrics. Let me provide a few highlights from the quarter. We achieved our highest quarterly revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share to date, even when excluding the impact of an extra fiscal week, which contributed $46 million to revenue and $0.07 to EPS.","We also initiated a $200 million accelerated share repurchase, continuing our commitment to a balanced strategy of internal investments, M&A for long-term growth, and buybacks. Based on our record Q1 operating performance and the favorable new corporate tax rate, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, we are raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS outlook.","Now to the numbers, as I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 18% to $769 million. The results were above our guided range and reflects strength across our broad product portfolio. Excluding the extra week in Q1, revenue grew 11%. The weighted average license duration was approximately three years, which we forecast to be our annual average as well.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $662 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $573 million, with operating margin at 25.5% percent. GAAP earnings per share were negative $0.02 cents, reflecting a one-time, GAAP-only expense due to tax reform. The impact was two-fold; a $46 million write-down of our deferred tax assets to reflect the new U.S. statutory rate, and a one-time transition tax of $73 million on our offshore earnings that remained after we repatriated cash in Q4. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.10, a 17% increase that includes an $0.08 benefit from a lower non-GAAP tax rate.","Let me pause for a moment on taxes. Because of the reduction in the U.S. statutory tax rate, our non-GAAP rate decreased from 19% to 13% for fiscal 2018. As certain parts of U.S. tax reform and various international changes take effect in fiscal 2019, we expect the non-GAAP rate to increase next year. At this time, we expect the rate to be below our previous 19% normalized rate, but we are still working through the details and will provide a more definitive projection later in the year.","Operating cash outflow was $59 million for the quarter, due to our normal year-end incentive ","compensation payout, partially offset by strong collections. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $606 million with 24% onshore, and total debt of $572 million. Including the $200 million ASR that we launched in Q1, our trailing twelve-month buyback as a share of free cash flow is greater than 100%. We have $200 million remaining on our current authorization and are reaffirming our goal of using buybacks and keep share count roughly flat with last year.","M&A was also a significant use of cash in the quarter, as we closed two acquisitions, Black Duck and Kilopass. As we mentioned in December, we expect Black Duck to contribute roughly $55 million to $60 million in revenue, which reflects a purchase-accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million to $25 million. We expect it to be $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS, reach breakeven in the second half of 2019, and be accretive thereafter.","Before I turn to guidance, I'll briefly comment on the upcoming transition from Accounting Standard Topic 605 to Topic 606, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019 beginning in November. Because the actual impact of the transition will depend on future bookings throughout this year, we cannot provide concrete guidance on the expected impact. However, based on what we know now and our expectations for the year, we expect the revenue impact to be immaterial. We will provide more definitive commentary with our fiscal 2019 guidance. And as a reminder, this is an accounting change only, and will not impact our cash flow or how we think about our business.","Now to second quarter and updated fiscal 2018 guidance. As we mentioned in December, we expect first half revenue and earnings to be greater than the second half. Because of a shift in timing of customer hardware requirements, Q2 is expected to be even stronger than our original expectations, creating a more pronounced difference between first and second half. As you've seen in the past couple of years, as our hardware revenue has grown, the profile of revenue has become more variable and will fluctuate due to changes in customer schedules.","For Q2, the targets are revenue between $765 million and $790 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $637 million and $653 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $575 million and $585 million. Other income between minus $1 million and positive $1 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, outstanding share between $153 million and $156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.69 to $0.77 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.06 to $1.10 per share.","For 2018, the revised guidance are revenue of $2.92 billion to $2.95 billion, an increase of $40 million over our previous target. Other income and expenses between minus $6 million and minus $2 million, and annualized non-GAAP tax rate of 13%, outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $1.59 to $1.69 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $3.67 to $3.74 per share, due to the favorable effects of tax reform. Capital expenditures of approximately $110 million, and cash flow from operations of $500 million to $550 million.","To summarize, we delivered a record quarter for revenue and non-GAAP earnings. Based on our excellent Q1 performance and strong 2018 outlook, amplified by favorable tax reform, we're raising our guidance for 2018. Finally, we continue to execute well on our capital allocation strategy striking an appropriate balance of organic and inorganic investments, plus returning capital to shareholders, to drive sustainable, long-term value.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong start to the year.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Gary Mobley","So, if I do the math right it looks like if you adjust for the additional week in Q1, your guidance implies the second half that is what 6% lower than the first half and could you give any - confirm that first of all and give us the parameters that is causing you to be so conservative with respect to second half?","Aart de Geus","That's right Gary, you are looking at the first half that is going to be stronger than the second half. I would characterize the second half has been weak as more just a fact that the timing of our hardware shipments has skewed more to the first half as a result of what the customer schedules are requiring.","Gary Mobley","And just to confirm, so Software Integrity Group on pace for what roughly $260 million considering the purchase accounting headwind and what roughly $300 million without the headwind.","Aart de Geus","Well, we haven't disclosed the exact numbers. We've given you pretty good hints as we acquired different companies over the years. All of this area is growing above 20% per year organically and of course the acquisitions have accelerated to that. Fundamentally you're in the right ballpark, but we don't disclose the specifics. But I would say that our sense is that this business has definitely reached critical mass, meaning that the ingredients that we have, the technical position but also our ability to leverage the acquisitions well in the field support the customer as well on a global basis has definitely strengthened substantially and this quarter for us was a very clear sign that the group is well managed and that we see upside going forward.","Gary Mobley","Okay. I'm assuming your guidance included the consideration for the additional week, so considering that it looks like you reported roughly by 2% of revenue upside and organic revenue growth of 11%. And can you point out one or two factors that are driving the revenue acceleration of the revenue upside for the quarter?","Trac Pham","Gary, you're right. The guidance did include the extra week and your calculations in the ballpark. I would say that across the board is very good quarter, we had good growth across all the business lines. We did see little bit more strength in the Software Integrity business and to a less extent hardware as well.","Gary Mobley","Okay. I'll hop in the queue. Thank you, everyone.","Aart de Geus","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Rich Valera. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Just following-up on that same line of questioning. Core EDA was particularly strong in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. Can you highlight what were some of the drivers of the strength in the core EDA business?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think it's useful to start with the big picture which is fundamentally we're still in a very strong high-tech market and specifically semiconductor related market for really no surprising reasons the acceleration towards the world changing towards a smart everything investment sets that will literally impact every vertical is continuing.","Now, I think we will over the year see some up and down for semiconductors which is normal but in aggregate it's sort of a strong phase of the industry within that every aspect of our business is putting to tasks to actually help with this and it starts with the fact that there's a whole bunch of new chips being designed specifically in AI on the premise that while general computing has brought us reasonably far and graphics chips have moved it even further.","If one could create chips now that we're still much faster one could still do much more AI and I think that will continue and so that's where we see new entrants, we see investments in sophisticated chips and across the board both in the design side in the IP and the verification all of this is pretty much all in the state of the art FinFET group. So that drives pretty much the whole front.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then Trac was any of the $40 million that you raise the guidance by from the couple of small acquisitions you made I think Kilopass and Phoenix?","Trac Pham","No, it was not. I mean, I'm sorry to a modest extent but from the most part organic growth.","Rich Valera","And sort of similarly, it looks like if you lower the tax rate by the 6% roughly there that you'd get around I think $0.26 of benefit. You're raising your EPS guide by a bit less than that. Are you kind of electing to reinvest a little bit of that upside from the tax rate into the business or is there may be a little dilution from those acquisitions?","Trac Pham","I wouldn't turn it to the dilution. From the most part, we're off to a good start for the year with the results in Q1. We're giving the best outlook we have at this point based on our visibility. And I think that's pretty early in the year, so we've got several questions left to deliver on.","Rich Valera","Fair enough. Thanks. Congratulations on the nice quarter.","Operator","Thank you. And I apologize Mr. Valera was from Needham and Company. The next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Brent Thielman","Hi, good afternoon. This is actually Brent Thielman for Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on your IP business, how much of it is it currently ratable up front?","Trac Pham","I'm sorry, we missed that question.","Brent Thielman","On your IP business, how much of that business is currently ratable versus upfront?","Trac Pham","I would say more than two-thirds of that is time based and I'm being specific about time base rather than ratable because there's a good portion of consulting or consulting business that is recognized on a percentage of completion basis.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Thank you. And then Asia Pacific was actually the only reason that declined sequentially during the quarter, can you give us any color as to how China is doing in particular in the Software Integrity business side and then are there any emerging trends that are perhaps different from the rest of the geography?","Trac Pham","You know, I think looking at the quarter-by-quarter in our business while may be giving you some insight is actually not the best way to look at Synopsis. Everything we ourselves always look at is at a minimum of trailing 12-month basis and if you did that for Asia Pacific, you would find that it's far and away the highest growing region and China in general is one of the hard drivers, positive drivers for that.","So, I would not read anything into a specific quarter at all. Fundamentally, we're doing extremely well in those areas.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Great, thank you. And then one last question regarding M&A. Over the past year and a half given opportunistically acquiring a few companies in IT and software. How are those trailing under your current portfolio and then how are those being integrated at this time?","Trac Pham","Well, you know the integration is something that we already look at during the process of doing the acquisition because fundamentally we try to follow what we call the rule of adjacency which is trying to find businesses that are different from what we have, but close enough to minimize risks and leverage what we have and the adjacency falls into the technical adjacency, channel adjacency or customer adjacency.","And so, from that perspective, the minute a new team joins us we try to integrate quickly all the infrastructure functions, all the business functions when it makes sense and when it goes to the same customers typically the same sales people deal with it and this is a process of making sure that that it's like two trains in movements merging at the same time and doing that without losing any of the speed, I guess there is some Olympic analogy here somewhere.","And so, I think we've done quite well with these acquisitions and to take the largest one that is ongoing Black Duck right now, while it is not all that long ago that we closed. We can already say that it has had a very positive impact on our relationship with customers because Black Duck has an outstanding market position, but also an outstanding brand. And it fits very well and is extremely complimentary to what we already have and so that's a good example of what we try to do in the different areas and you were correct to highlight that we did a number of those in the Software Integrity Group as well as in the IP group and it's essentially the same story there.","Brent Thielman","All right great. Thank you and then one last one if I, one quick follow up if I could. I guess with the amount of cash that you have right now in hand, what are the pieces of technology are you looking to acquire over the next several months?","Trac Pham","Well this is one of those questions where we always mumble our way through it, as we don't really want to indicate what our next steps are. Let me just generalize it, as you know over the years we have never been shy to acquire but we're also not shy to invest ourselves and so we try to do balance between R&D investments and acquisitions to keep us on the leading edge and also to allow us to sometimes enter domains that would take too long to do on our own.","And this is only possible if one continually looks at the opportunities around the vast majority of the things that one may be interested in actually never materialized and such a relatively small percentage that ultimately gets acquired but that percentage is harvested over a long period of time. And so, we're on the lookout but we won't necessarily give you the next names yet.","Brent Thielman","Alright. Thanks a lot.","Trac Pham","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Farhan Ahmad with Credit Suisse. Your line is open please go ahead.","Farhan Ahmad","Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the result. My first question is regarding the tax reform. We have the tax reform passed recently and as part of that now you have access to all your ongoing free cash flow generation without worrying about what's onshore versus offshore. So, how are you thinking about the capital structure of the company and is there any change in how you view the business given the tax reform in the onshore versus offshore cash submission?","Trac Pham","Hi Farhan, this is Trac. So, you're right. The tax reform does provide more flexibility to us however, if you look at our history over the years we've done a pretty job of balancing on between investing in the business while doing buybacks and acquisitions. That's been fairly successful to-date, so I would expect that we continue on that path.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And then one question just on the linearity of the yields and I look at the guidance, the guidance for the full year, the second half fiscal seems like you are pretty much flat year-on-year for revenue growth. How much of it is conservatism versus just something really going on with the hardware business, because it seems like the growth has been more than 10% for about six quarters and now suddenly you are going from like 14% implied in the quarter you have brought to basically 0% in second half of the year?","Aart de Geus","I would first point you to the guidance for the full year where we've raised our revenue range for the year from 7% to 8% growth. I think that's very healthy growth. What you are seeing in the second half is just the shift of the time in hardware, I wouldn't characterize it as being conservative or just anything wrong with the software business.","As I said in our initial remarks we're seeing very good execution across all of our businesses whether you're talking by products or by region. So, it's just a function of profiling of course in the quarter.","Farhan Ahmad","Got it. And just one gridlock question. Have you given any thought to starting to report your Software Security business? It's obviously becoming almost like 10% of your revenues and it's not yet profitable. So, it's kind of I would argue that we are not getting any credit for it in terms of how investors are looking at the business.","So, have you given any thought to just expediting the business or at least in the sense from a segment reporting point of view?","Trac Pham","Yes, this year we are very much focused on integrating Black Duck and executing that plan. We're excited about the fact that we are hitting critical mass in that space and throughout this year as we evaluate how best to manage that business the reporting I think will fall out of that. So, we'll have more to describe later in the year as we have more clarity on that.","Farhan Ahmad","Thank you. That's all I have.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Just want to start with the upfront revenue just want to make sure you talk strength in ZeBu, was the hardware the main component in the upside and the upfront revenue in the quarter or was there strength in other parts as well?","Trac Pham","As I said previously, there were strength across the board. But when, if you're looking at the upfront portion specifically that's where hardware will show up.","Sterling Auty","Okay. But relative to your expectations how would you characterize the strength in that revenue line. How much do you see or you think was hardware versus other items?","Trac Pham","Marginally. I think most of the upside was across very good strength across all of the businesses.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then given the transition tax and other, can you just talk about the cash flow in the quarter what items may have kind of weighed down the cash flow in the quarter and obviously a good deferred revenue contribution. But what were the things that maybe took away from some of the cash flow strength?","Trac Pham","Yes. For Q1 specifically, keep in mind that's when we payout our variable comp from last year. So that really weighs mostly on the Q1 results. Sterling is that what you are referring to?","Sterling Auty","Yes. But even looking at it on a seasonally adjusted basis, it was more than I would have expected. So, I don't know if there was actually cash tax payment timing with repatriation or other items that maybe would have weighed on cash flow in the first quarter.","Trac Pham","No, the biggest part is that we typically do see a negative outflow in Q1 related to variable comp. There are some other puts and takes, but that would be the largest component of that.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then last question again, just around cash flow. You are raising the full year revenue by $40 million, but you're leaving the cash from operations range unchanged. Is there anything to be read into that?","Trac Pham","No, it's really frankly early in the year and cash flow typically is the hardest one, hardest metric for us to project. Keep in mind that when you look at the full year that there's a few unusual items, last year we had a one-time benefit from a $30 million for a top tech and then this year we've got a couple of unusual items that we've highlighted before.","So, at this point we're off to a good start but it is pretty early to make a call on cash flow.","Sterling Auty","Okay, thank you.","Trac Pham","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities your line is open. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. Good evening. Aart let me come back to the question regarding core EDA software momentum, Rich asked about that earlier. And the question is this historically if you go back over the last two or more decades in EDA, when there's been a good product category the momentum was lasted rough average two to three years and then things begin to cool for a particular category at least that's the history. We've now seen for the last one to two years or longer some good momentum and implementation for synthesis which specifically helps you and a couple of other categories.","And so, the question is, is there something different now that might suggest that certain categories that have already had one or two good years of momentum might just keep going contrary to perhaps historical trends with regard to specific categories?","Aart de Geus","Well, in many ways we have long moved beyond the individual products determining what quarters look like or even years as companies such as ourselves our defacto providing much more complete solutions and an intersect with our customers on the basis of multi-year agreements.","And so, both of those comments both lead to the same thing, which is its fundamentally smoothest curves and makes them more stable and that is also supported by the fact that for some of the very large customers stability of relationship in both directions is very important because one tends to not see under the numbers the fact is also very big human interaction by virtue of support and being on the most advanced projects almost on equal terms with the employees of the customer.","And so, well certainly certain technology drives are related to new needs I don't think that the renewal of certain products are necessarily driving big waves. If I can highlight an example of a new need though, in verification we have seen substantial high growth rate now for multiple years in the whole area of trying to prototype systems in a combination of software and hardware or more and more hardware and that's relates to truly a problem that is growing and that is the problem of can you get the software to run on the hardware before you have the hardware because once you have the hardware, you don't want to wait for the software to be debugged or fully optimized.","And I think that is an area that will continue to grow and is of super high interest also when you look at all the AI processors that have one objective, run software faster than before. And so, that would be essentially the gradual coming about of a new category but even there it's sort of grew out of software simulation before it became hardware. But overall, we've seen a continual growth of our run rate across the board and I think it's just we are in good technology times right now.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","I'll ask my two remaining questions together so both for you. So, number one, one of the things that we've seen from the geo-perspective that's really interesting over the last one to two years is the recovery in Japan. Your numbers are looking better sequentially and year-over-year on a trailing 12 basis in Japan and it broadly true for the industry and certainly if that's the opposite of what had been a very long draught for EDA in that market. And so, the question is what's changed there and you think that keeps going?","And then lastly, just a year ago you bought Cigital as a necessary step to provide services for SIG and how are you thinking about the long-term services intensity of that business? You got the nucleus of services just over a year ago with that acquisition, but do you think over time or for at least the time being SIG becomes more services intense or perhaps might have become services intense over time?","Aart de Geus","Well, two very different questions. Starting with Japan, you are absolutely correct that it used to be called the lost decade and I think the added and it became the lost decade in which Japan went to really really tough hi-tech times and a renewal of workforce recombination or consolidation of many companies that had many cuts and itself a little bit like the beatings will stop when the morale improves. I think the good news is, I think the morale has improved, they are in the number of companies' sort of fresh, more modern, more western organized managements that is looking at growing the businesses.","And so, it feels better in Japan still if I look at our numbers it's still the slowest growing region in the world over at least trailing 12 months area. I think that there is more rebound possible in Japan, but it took literally a redo of the hi-tech industry I would say.","Regarding Cigital, the service group is very much focused on managed services which is the ability to not necessarily be physically apt a customer but deliver it over the crowd. And secondly, I think the services will continue for quite a while because the problem statement of what does security mean and how do you do it is one that is not only evolving rapidly by a constant new vulnerabilities that also demands a degree of sophistication that many companies don't half and therefore the quality educations of the seventies and eighties are now replaced by the security educations of the 2010 and with that I think we can not only align better with customers but ourselves or learn what it's like to have to modify companies from within with our tools and I think it's very well aligned with the rest of our business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from KeyBanc services. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Monika Garg ","Hi, thanks for taking my question. First track on the operating margin side, you've raised your revenue guidance 7.5%, the midpoint somewhere 7.5% to 8%. But if we model as what you've guided your operating margins would be down almost 130, 140 basis points year-over-year. Why are we not seeing more leverage in the margins?","Trac Pham","You know Monika, we can go through the model with you in more specific details. But right now, the way we're managing is to keep margins relatively flat with last year. And then excluding the impact of Black Duck as we've commented previously organic margins would have gone up to absorb that dilution.","Monika Garg","Okay. And then, if I look at all those software security acquisitions you have done Black Duck, Cigital all the previous ones. If I add all of them together, when do think this company, this whole business together it could be breakeven and profitable?","Aart de Geus","Well, we are essentially executing on the same business algorithm with each acquisition, which is these acquisitions typically come in either not being profitable or needing substantial investments because there's great growth opportunity and we followed the sort of same recipe which is a; we have to deal with the accounting haircut and b, with the integration cost and the potential desire to invest have always the same objective turn each of these acquisitions positive from a profitability point of view within the first 18 to 24 months.","And I would say we're on track with all of those. And at the same time, this is a business that clearly has great long-term opportunity and having been able to assemble in about four years a really strong position, I think bodes really well for the long-term return of value to the company.","Monika Garg","And then the last one here, Aart you had talked about some new cases in autonomous driving could you talk in detail how Synopsis is looking to deploy and develop AI machine learning solutions and then can you talk about IP vision processing, talk about if your customers who are looking to develop solutions with the same any design wins you can share? Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well let me take the gel topic of AI and we are both a participant and user ourselves and of course a supporter in many ways of the development and the advancement of AI. As a user, we have a number of projects that we apply to our own tools with an objective to see which one of the AI algorithms can actually make the tools run faster or better or diagnose things more smoothly and there's a host of projects that I won't go into here but look promising.","And at the same time, I think there's also a learning curve to see which one of these projects has the highest return on investment. As a supporter, we touch many aspects and for starters, I mentioned it earlier we have now seen a rapid progression of some successful AI algorithms on general processors to the graphics processors to now specialized processors. And I was talking just two weeks ago to one of the CTOs of companies that's developing one of the most advanced AI processor cores in the world for sure and he was saying a lot unbelievably promising because here they can do our computations that are probably going to be 100 to 1000 times faster than what was possible before except they really want another billion times faster.","And that certainly [ph] how I feel about it which is that we have opened the door to a category of computations that in the long long term aims to rival what's fundamentally the human brain can do and in order to do that you need a degree of computation that is not anywhere close to what we have today and therefore I think the enhancements are going to continue at a very very rapid pace for a long period of time. So, in that context these people all very quickly navigate to the most advanced silicon to the launch largest possible chips they can design and by the way they wanted on market yesterday therefore they're in a hurry and those are perfect customers for our tools, for our IT, and for our support.","In addition to that, in order to check this thing out, they want to run software on mock ups of prototypes and by the way the software has to be secured too. So, sort of everything we touch is somehow in the soup and we're trying to stir it as fast as we can. But it's certainly very interesting to see how rapid the evolution of learning is in this field.","Monika Garg","Thank you so much.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I had two, kind of first on the Software Integrity side. So, now that you guys have a lot of assets and there you are getting close to kind of a $0.25 billion dollars of revenues. Is there any sort of seasonality to be aware of in terms of the combined entity just so we get a clarity on kind of the seasonality except for the full year?","Trac Pham","Hi Mitch, the Software Integrity business won't really effect seasonality. It's mostly time based and so, you will see variations driven by that business on the margin.","Mitch Steves","Yes, does that include the deferred write-off in all that as well?","Trac Pham","Yes.","Mitch Steves","Okay. And then the second one was kind of just in terms of the overall markets. So, based on what Aart was saying it sounds like the entire industry is kind of hits critical mass, so what would be the rough market share you guys think you have and then what is the total addressable market the entire Software Integrity portfolio at this time?","Trac Pham","You know, I was just looking at That a few minutes ago and I concluded for myself over and over again. Even determining what the TAM really is, is virtually impossible. We can put a number right now at about $2 billion or so, but to be honest I'm not sure that how many of the software companies in the world this encompasses that sooner or later are going to run into the necessity to have their software checked out for vulnerabilities.","And this is where it ties actually indirectly to electronics. Electronics in simultaneously connecting pretty much everything in the world to everything else therefore everything is a potential entry point for vulnerabilities and no matter how innocuous sales from software is in some coffee maker or god knows what you know once it's connected to a network somewhere it can be an entry point.","And therefore, I think that the notion of software quality and security will continue to just broaden itself. Now having said that of course the market doesn't grow infinitely fast and I think we are in a good position because we have found this combination of organic growth from M&A growth, but most importantly to try to build a position that is strong for the long term and is trusted for the long-term. And that implies being able to execute well against needs of the customer. [Technical Difficulty].","Operator","Hi, this is Susan, the operator. I apologize I got disconnected. It is at the five-minute mark, so I'd like to turn the conference back over to your host.","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well, let me apologize for what happened, we have no idea what it was but you probably heard the same beeping and I just came down, I guess this is the beeping of the end of this event. So, let me thank you for participating you heard hopefully that we executed well this corner and feel good about Q2 and the year's outlook.","And as usual, I will be available for the individual comments in the aftermath. Apologize again for the abrupt ending, but we appreciate your participation.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our conference. We thank you for your participation today and for your patience and also for using AT&T executive teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss plans, forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company, its business and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q and today's earnings press release. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm happy to report that we closed an excellent Q4, achieving very strong fiscal 2012 results. We completed several important acquisitions during the year, and we're positioned well and feel momentum as we head into 2013.","Let me begin with our results. In Q4, we delivered revenue of $454 million, resulting in $1.756 billion for the fiscal year, a 14% increase over 2011. This revenue reflects both excellent organic growth and momentum from key strategic acquisitions.","With non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 in Q4, we delivered $2.10 for the year, 17% growth and substantially above the target range communicated at the beginning of fiscal '12. Simultaneously, we increased our non-GAAP operating margin over 100 basis points to 23.6% for the year while generating $486 million at operating cash flow. Our 3-year backlog grew to $2.7 billion, and we have approximately 80% of next year's revenue target already in hand. This provides us a high degree of stability in a difficult-to-predict economic environment.","In summary, it was a very strong year with double-digit growth in both top and bottom line and excellent momentum into FY '13. We therefore reiterate our intent to deliver ongoing high-single-digit earnings growth and are setting our FY '13 non-GAAP EPS objective of $2.26 to $2.31. Brian will provide more detail in just a minute.","Looking forward, let me briefly comment on the customer landscape. While the overall economy is certainly filled with question marks, the semiconductor industry is racing forward through a combination of technology pushes, efficiency drives and competition as our customers vie for share in ever-changing and demanding end markets.","While challenging in terms of both technology and support for EDA suppliers, we're observing that customers increasingly see EDA as a differentiator rather than a cost factor. This is very positive for our industry. Meanwhile, design moves forward aggressively, new technology nodes and even new transistor type are rapidly being adopted, and overall complexity demands a strong reliance on leading EDA capabilities. The heightened value of EDA bodes well for our industry. And as tool consumption and demand for new technology continues to rise, Synopsys is clearly benefiting. Our strong financial and backlog position anchors our ability for continued investment, our R&D focus continues to deliver the technology leadership needed by our customers to differentiate themselves and our recent strategic acquisitions form an excellent springboard to deliver some great next generation solutions.","From a technology perspective, our customers count on us for 3 fundamental task sets: one, the implementation of designs in smaller and more complex technologies; two, the verification of designs of enormous size and complexity; and three, the availability of a broadening set of the most important IP cores. We have made significant progress in all 3. Let me give a bit more detail while also highlighting the impact and opportunities created by the key acquisitions we closed this year.","Starting with the chip implementation flow, we see an unabated push for new technologies in terms of both smaller geometries and the emergence of a new type of vertical transistor called a FinFET. Looking at the now stable but still quite advanced 28-nanometer node, we find that over 90% of the tape-outs use the Synopsys Galaxy Implementation Platform. While much more design will be done in this node, the most advanced companies are now migrating to the 20-nanometer node and below technologies. This migration is done with extensive help on Synopsys' part, and we are now assisting on approximately 100 20-nanometer designs.","Leading edge companies such as Samsung and ST have described 20-nanometer designs using our tools for more than 2 years, attesting to the early robustness and reliability of our solutions. As a result, Galaxy has been used in approximately 90% of 20-nanometer tape-outs thus far.","Recognizing our leadership, TSMC named Synopsys a Partner of the Year for 2012 for joint delivery of the TSMC 20-nanometer reference flow, which includes the entire Galaxy Platform. In this context, it is also worthwhile to note that the acquisition of Magma brought a number of new technologies and the opportunity to strengthen several customer relationships. After first conducting and listening to our customers, we delivered technical roadmaps within 90 days of closing the acquisition. We aligned with a number of key customers to accelerate their move to more advanced nodes, and we integrated the joint R&D teams to immediately fuse the best capabilities each company had to offer. For example, in the December release of our timing tools, we are delivering substantial accelerations and new capabilities resulting in part from the combination of best-in-class algorithms. This also holds true in the analog\/mixed signal space where customers are already responding to the strength of our new FastSPICE roadmap.","The other technology drive is around FinFETs, which I mentioned are the leading new type of vertical transistor, enabling Moore's Law to continue to smaller nodes while dramatically reducing power consumption.","After investing for many years with the technology leaders, Synopsys is far ahead an EDA FinFET enablement. The technical challenges of FinFET require new approaches in the manufacturing area. Our market-leading TCAD products are used to perform 3-dimensional simulations of these new devices, and our mask synthesis products enable foundries to perform highly advanced corrections. Our sense of collaboration with all the partners within the ecosystem, including foundries, early adopters and research institutions, has led us to deliver best-in-class technologies throughout our portfolio.","We have developed and successfully deployed our own FinFET circuits in the form of FinFET-based embedded Memory and Logic IP, with a broad range of IP in the pipeline for 2013. Our Galaxy Platform is not only FinFET-ready, it has been extensively used for a number of successful production FinFET take-outs.","With a continued push towards smaller devices come the benefits but also the challenges of significantly more complex chips. Nowhere this more visible than in the growing amount of verification needed, which has become not only the biggest design time consumer but often the bottleneck to completing designs period.","Synopsys was already well placed, but the 2 acquisitions, EVE and SpringSoft, now enhance our portfolio and open the door to delivering a complete next generation verification solution. Even prior to these acquisitions, Synopsys was the clear leader in both advanced digital verification, in which 70% of advanced designs utilize Synopsys and analog simulation, where we serve approximately 80% of the market segment.","SpringSoft brings the leading debug environment, addressing what today takes up about 35% to 50% of engineers' verification effort. With EVE, we acquired the fastest hardware emulator in a rapidly growing industry. The feedback from customers has been remarkably positive. They see Synopsys as a company that has all the pieces, from simulation to emulation to rapid prototyping to verification IP to debugging, and also the track record of delivering a much better integrated overall solution.","Two more comments about the acquisitions. SpringSoft also brings an analog\/mixed signal design solution that has broad and loyal penetration specifically in the growing Asia Pacific geography. Combining the SpringSoft product line with our existing efforts in custom tools increases our critical mass and gives us more momentum in an area where Synopsys is steadily building a market position.","The acquisitions of EVE in France and SpringSoft in Taiwan were financed by our international cash and on top of the significant Magma acquisition, were executed and integrated very efficiently. Even more important have been the extremely positive customer reactions, and the resulting business momentum is clearly visible and very encouraging.","The third area I would like to briefly highlight is the continued growth and breadth of our IP and Systems business. As chips contain still more transistors, the importance of commercial IP is twofold: improve designer productivity by providing a catalog of highly optimized and verified building blocks and reduce risk and effort by having these IP blocks available in the latest technology nodes when customers need them. Our portfolio of high-quality production proven IP is a clear differentiator for Synopsys as evidenced by excellent growth during the year. While the breadth of our offering continues to increase with new titles, such as the newly launched support of the emerging DDR4 memory interface standard, so does the span of silicon nodes supported, with much of our R&D efforts on migrating our cores to the 20-nanometer and 14- and 16-nanometer nodes while supporting FinFET technology.","Customer adoption of these advanced nodes is accelerating. Today, Synopsys is the market segment leader in interface IP, embedded memories and analog IP. Our position is appreciated by our foundry partners, and TSMC also recently awarded Synopsys its 2012 Interface IP Partner of the Year for an unprecedented third year in a row.","We're also highly complementary to the other IP providers in the processor and graphics space. Where in Q4, we announced a major agreement with ARM to broaden our collaboration through expanded access to key ARM technology and delivery of optimized implementation flows to speed time to market for our mutual customers. To give a sense of the importance and continued growth potential of our business, it's interesting to note that our DesignWare IP is shipped more than 1 billion chips per year and counting, that every 2 days, a chip is taped out using our USB. That every week, a chip tapes out with our PCI Express, and our customers have already shipped tens of millions of chips containing our 28-nanometer IP. Our objective is to continue to grow the IP business at a double-digit rate while gradually increasing profitability as we've successfully done in the last 2 years.","In summary, against the backdrop of rapid technical semiconductor and overall economic change, Synopsys is in a very good position with both product and market momentum. Our commitment to customer and partner success is built on a foundation of excellent financial execution. Our ongoing multiyear objective is to drive annual high single digit non-GAAP earnings per share expansion. This objective, formulated a couple of years ago, has actually been substantially exceeded in the past 2 years.","We plan to achieve our goal through a combination of the following: one, drive traditional EDA organic revenue growth generally in the mid-single-digit range; two, achieve IP and Systems organic revenue growth generally in the low double digits; three, continue to focus on operational efficiency with operating margins moving solidly into the mid-20s; four, continue to explore value and TAM-expanding M&A; and five, optimizing the use of our strong cash flow with our own M&A, debt reduction or stock buybacks.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and fiscal year, provide you with our 2013 guidance for Q1 and the full year and provide some financial details on the SpringSoft and EVE transactions. In my discussions, all my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.","Now, as Aart mentioned, Synopsys delivered excellent fourth quarter and full year results highlighted by an increased run rate, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we significantly exceeded our original 2012 targets for revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow.","Q4 total revenue increased 16% to $454 million, and as expected, revenue contribution from SpringSoft and EVE was not material but came in at about $9 million. Annual revenue grew 14% to $1.756 billion. This, of course, includes the revenue contribution from our 2012 acquisitions, including approximately $60 million from Magma as expected. Even excluding these transactions, our organic business was quite robust.","For the year, we delivered growth across all product groups, with particular strength in IP and Systems. Greater than 90% of Q4 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of Q4 and fiscal year revenue. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.8 years for the quarter and about 2.7 years for all of fiscal 2012. We currently expect average duration in fiscal '13 to be about 2.7 years.","Three-year backlog increased to $2.7 billion from $2.5 billion due to our 2012 acquisitions and also reflects a solid base book-to-bill of about 1. Finally, we have approximately 80% of our target fiscal 2013 revenues in hand for the coming year and more than 90% for the coming quarter.","Turning to expenses. Q4 total GAAP costs and expenses were $415 million, which included $28 million of amortization of intangible assets, $17 million of stock-based compensation and $8 million of acquisition-related costs.","For the year, total GAAP costs and expenses were $1.566 billion, which included $100 million of amortization of intangible assets, $71 million of stock-based compensation and $44 million of acquisition-related costs.","Q4 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $358 million. For the full year, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $1.342 billion, an expected increase due mainly to our acquisitions, the extra fiscal week in Q1 and year-over-year cost increases such as employee compensation.","Excluding our 2012 acquisitions, total non-GAAP costs and expenses were slightly below our original expense budget. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21% for the quarter and 23.6% for the full year. This represents an increase of more than 100 basis points over full year 2011, even as we work through the integration of a number of 2012 acquisitions. For all of FY '13, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '12 levels by an additional 100 basis points.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.19 for the quarter and $1.21 for the year compared to $1.47 for all of 2011. FY '12 GAAP earnings reflect $44 million or $0.30 per share of acquisition-related costs compared to $1.2 million or $0.01 per share in FY '11.","Q4 non-GAAP expenses -- earnings per share were $0.47, and full year non-GAAP earnings grew 17% to $2.10. FY '12 earnings growth was driven primarily by top line growth, including the extra fiscal week and operational execution.","Now turning to our cash flow, we generated $103 million in cash from operations in Q4 and $486 million for all of fiscal 2012, which exceeded our original expectations as higher business levels and better payment terms resulted in strong collections. As you recall, we also took on $250 million of debt in Q2 due to the Magma acquisition. Since then, we paid back the $100 million revolving debt along with $15 million of the term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $135 million term loan outstanding.","We also completed several important acquisitions during the year, which enabled us to use approximately 45% of our beginning-of-year offshore cash for acquisitions. As a result, we ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $700 million, with 28% onshore and 72% offshore. At this time, we're targeting operating cash flow of at least $350 million in FY '13. And since cash flow tends to be lumpy from year-to-year, we continue to believe a fairly good indicator of operating cash flow over time is EBITDA.","For the 3-year period ended in FY '12, our cumulative operating cash flow was $1.267 billion, just slightly more than EBITDA over that same period. And finally, we expect our operating cash flow quarterly profile to be similar to last year, with a net operating cash outflow during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 due primarily to the timing of prior year's annual incentive compensation payments.","Now DSO was 58 days, reflecting the timing of invoices. And we ended Q4 with 8,135 employees, about 1\/3 in low-cost geographies. Approximately 1,120 of the 1,335 employees we added during the year were from acquisitions, with the majority coming from Magma, SpringSoft and EVE.","Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some additional commentary around the SpringSoft and EVE transactions, which were both funded with offshore cash. On October 1, we acquired a 92% controlling interest in SpringSoft, and their results are included in our consolidated financials as of that date but were not material. We subsequently closed the full transaction on November 30. We also closed the EVE acquisition during the quarter, and as expected, the transaction did not have a material impact on our Q4 financials.","We expect the combination of SpringSoft and EVE to contribute approximately $100 million of revenue in fiscal 2013 as we work through the SpringSoft transition to the Synopsys 90% time-based model, and we expect the 2 transactions to be slightly accretive to FY '13 non-GAAP earnings per share.","Now let's address our first quarter and fiscal 2013 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. As a reminder, Q1 of FY '12 included an extra fiscal week, affecting both revenue and total non-GAAP expenses by $25 million and $16 million respectively. For the first quarter of FY '13, our targets are: revenue between $468 million and $478 million, an approximate growth rate of 18%, excluding the extra week in 2012; total GAAP costs and expenses between $403 million and $419 million, which includes approximately $17 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $356 million and $366 million; other income and expense between 0 and a negative $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% to 26%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 157 million; GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.35 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.54 to $0.56 per share and we expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.","Now, our fiscal 2013 outlook: revenue between $1.955 billion and $1.975 billion, a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%, or 13% to 14% excluding the extra week in 2012; with the additional hardware revenue from EVE, we would expect some increased variability in quarterly revenue but continue to expect a 90% time-based revenue model in 2013; other income and expense between 0 and negative $4 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 25% to 26%; outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.32 to $1.46, which includes the impact of approximately $69 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.26 to $2.31, a growth rate of approximately 8% to 10%, or 10% to 13% excluding the extra week; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and we're targeting cash flow from operations of at least $350 million.","And finally, to help you with your modeling, let me provide some brief commentary on our 2013 quarterly expense profile. At this time, we expect Q1 expenses to be lower than the rest of the year, with quarters 2, 3 and 4 at about equal levels.","So in summary, we're pleased with our excellent fourth quarter and full year results highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation. We enter 2013 with a unique combination of stability and growth, which positions us well in many macroeconomic scenarios.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Richard Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Aart, just first wondering if you could comment on the environment you're seeing, if there's been any change in customer behavior, whether there's any tightening up at all as it relates to perhaps things going on in Washington or just the choppiness of semiconductor revenue as we head into '13?","Aart J. de Geus","I think we can say that we have not seen any change whatsoever regarding EDA. We suddenly feel that customers are speaking with a little bit more caution about the end of this year and maybe the first 2 quarters next year with a little bit more hope or confidence beyond that. But that's the nature of the industry that we're in. And I would say yes, there is a tightening in terms of competitiveness, but that is really not new. And we've seen that in the last 2 to 3 years. And so the uncertainty is something that people just reflect on, that's just the situation around us. But meanwhile, they're forging ahead at high speed.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then you mentioned you had a book-to-bill of about 1 in the quarter. So in backlog, it sounds like it would've been about flat x acquisitions. Wondering if you could comment at all on revenue run rate coming out of backlog x acquisitions. Would we have seen any increase in run rate x acquisitions year-to-year as we enter '13?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, you would.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Brian, with respect to cash flow, you mentioned lumpiness. And obviously, you had significant outperformance this year, and you're guiding for, at least at this point, lower next year. Was there anything that was favorable in terms of timing for cash flow, things that maybe happened earlier than you might have thought that helped this year at the expense of next year?","Brian M. Beattie","I just look back to the fourth quarter, and we saw very strong cash flow as we came through into the fourth. And then we're able to overachieve the fourth quarter just based on the timing of when customers paid and looking at the profile of our disbursements. So it came in about $35 million to $40 million higher than we expected in the fourth quarter of FY '12. So naturally, you have to take that into account as you look at the expected operating cash flows for 2013. Still a very strong number though in '13, and at this point, feel being at least $350 million is a very good number.","Operator","And next, we'll go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Thomas calling for Krish. Based on FY '13 guidance, you're estimating sales growth of about 12% year-over-year compared to EPS growth of about 9% at the midpoint. How should we think about margins within this framework and the levers around margins, and whether the ongoing integration of acquisitions is baked into this full year assumption?","Aart J. de Geus","Yes, it is. They're completely baked in because by the time we go into a new year, we sort of uphold the numbers as a function of whatever acquisition we did. Just be aware that meanwhile, there's a number of license transitions, maybe some haircut leftovers and things like that from the acquisitions. But overall, our objective remains the same, which is an ongoing basis deliver high-single-digit EPS growth. And that is really what we're optimizing the business for.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And so the linearity of the operating expenses, you're saying that it's probably going to remain at these relatively higher levels?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, we're essentially managing a, really, multiyear business model. And so by definition, all in all, our business model is extremely stable. And so as we make gradual improvements to the ops margin, they gradually reflect themselves, obviously, in the bottom line. But the singular most important aspect is really the ongoing growth on the top line. From quarter-to-quarter, things can be lumpy and somewhat unpredictable. And certainly for me, I\u2019ve always heard that the way we reflect on the business is on sort of the rolling averages basis, which looks very solid.","Thomas Yeh - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And last one for me. Your IP and Systems segment show a very strong growth in FY '12, up 25% year-over-year. What outlook do you have baked in for this segment for FY '13? Is it safe to assume it's around that same level?","Aart J. de Geus","No. Specifically, actually we said that we were looking forward to a low-double-digit growth rate for the IP. Now that may be a little lower than the average, partially because this year or the end of the year was particularly strong. And so this is overall a very good growth business, so doing very well. Just from one year to another, it can be a little lumpy, and so we wanted to be on the conservative side and really manage as a multiyear perspective.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just want to circle up on a couple of housekeeping here. On the backlog, how much of that backlog was organic, if you can say?","Aart J. de Geus","It was the $200 million growth, up to $2.7 billion, was all from the acquisitions we completed during the year. And the rest of the organic business was a 1:1 book-to-bill ratio for the year. So again, very solid in line with the revenue growth and booking that nicely.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it. And you said even though they're immaterial, can you give us a sense what -- I think you mentioned the revenue on one of the acquisitions, but what was the revenue and, just as important, the expense contribution for the quarter from the acquisition?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, the revenue impact from the 2 acquisitions that were closed in October were approximately $9 million. The expenses were about the same level. So again, it was not a material impact to EPS during the quarter just in view of the integration work that was ongoing and transition to a new business model and so on.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I heard the comments on cash flow, but I'm curious, it looks like there was a spike in accounts receivable here. Again, the DSOs were up in the 50s. Was that from acquisition contribution or what else is happening on the AR side?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, it's -- AR is in very good shape. It just reflects the profile, the timing of our billings out at end of the year. Our fourth quarter was very strong, and as a result of invoicing at the end of the year, during the month of October, those collections just didn't come in. So you see us typically running kind of a mid-30s type of DSO levels. And just for this particular, given the business was so strong and the timing, it came in over 50. It'll go back down, though.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And last question, then I'll go back in the queue. Magma hit your expectations for the year. How are you thinking about the contribution to the coming year granted you're going to get to a point where you'll annualize it? And I know you're not running it separately. But in terms of how you think it's going to grow and contribute, as you started to get maintenance contracts that come back up for renewal, contracts that come back where you're getting opportunity to upsell? So what have you kind of factored in, in terms of what Magma can help in this fiscal year?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, one of the objectives is actually to have FY '13 with there not being a old Synopsys or old Magma. And I think we're already well on our way with that. And we ourselves at times find, therefore, it's difficult to look back on acquisitions and say, \u201cHow well did \"the acquisition\" do?\u201d because the whole point is for the acquisition to help the overall company do well. And that means that we transition customers as fast as we possibly can to the resulting product portfolio. But the tradition -- that transition has 2 other components. One is the fact that in that also comes the opportunity to come out with better products that have more capabilities or are better integrated or that accelerates some area, and I think we've already seen positive impact of that. And I mentioned some of the things in the preamble. And the second thing, just as important, is how does it give us an opportunity to improve or broaden or accelerate the relationship with customers. And there's no question that the Magma acquisition has helped us go back to those customers, look at the roadmaps together and actually plot a path that turned out to be better for the customer than either scenarios they would've had with us individually. And so that is probably the best accomplishment that we've had to date with this. So looking forward, we think actually it is very much part of growing the company to the high-single-digit EPS number for this coming year.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","First, I was wondering if your view of the -- just the overall EDA market has changed as far as growth for the next few years. Are you still kind of in that mid-single-digits range?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think the ramp of our -- on our industry is a little bit that it's in a good phase in the sense that precisely because customers are so competitive and precisely because they are adopting new technology, maybe faster than what many of the providers of the technology even would have expected, the need and demand for a really strong EDA tool has increased. And so in that context, we certainly think that the core can be very solidly in the mid-single-digit growth. Some of the other areas we've said are in the low-double-digit growth. And so for us, we keep essentially setting the same objective over multiyears, which is high-single-digit growth on EPS as the final result. And as mentioned, ever since we started to do that, we have certainly beaten up that objective. But every year is a new year, and so we'll try again.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And you talked about you had low double digits for the IP side. Is that where you think the market's going out as well, is that you just taking a little share, getting a little bigger in that space?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think the market is doing well across-the-board for us. There's no question that our field is very competitive and Synopsys is doing well. But the impression initially I get is that overall EDA is in a good position.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then now that you're in the emulation business, are you also seeing strength? And as we're hearing from Mentor and Cadence that it\u2019s a pretty strong market right now.","Aart J. de Geus","Well, obviously, we were aware of that before we acquired emulation, otherwise we wouldn't have done so. We are now going through the very same process as we have with some of this other acquisition, which is this very fast, go to the customers, understand exactly what matters most to them and then come back to them with very strong roadmaps. And this is particularly relevant to the area of emulation because it is not standalone. It is very much part of the overall verification solution. You heard from the initial introduction that we also acquired SpringSoft, which brings also a lot of verification technologies specifically in the debug area. And, of course, Synopsys is very well known for the superfast simulator. And so you take some of those things together, you have the potential for really a next generation solution. And that is really what we're driving at. Emulation itself is very promising to us, and the next few quarters, we'll probably demonstrate that quickly.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I mean, emulation is strong today. Do you also view that as a leading indicator for the industry, if you will, that...","Aart J. de Geus","No, I do not, partially because there are many variables on an industry, and the type of people that use emulation have a particular set of challenges that some will actually in a downturn accelerate their investment, some in a downturn do just the opposite, which is stop buying hardware. And so I do think that, as with all the other technologies that we provide, at the end of the day is how much can we accelerate the competitiveness of our customers. And that is why it's actually good for us to take the time with these new technologies, and by the way also some fantastic technologists in the team, to really visit the most important customers and plot out how we can help them over a multiyear outlook. And so far the resonance is quite positive.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then finally, when you look at the range of the share cap that you typically give, is the variable there just share repurchases?","Brian M. Beattie","It's both sides. The issuance of new equity, and again, there we see our stock overhangs dropping below the double-digit points and moving that in good condition. And it's really a function of what we issue and what we buy back. Our last buybacks were back in Q1, and it's a factor that given the significant levels of M&A in 2012 specifically, that is the ongoing top priority for use of our cash in that period. And finally, the last thing is the price of the stock is also reflected in the fully diluted share count as well.","Thomas Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. Maybe just one more here. You talked about a 100-basis-point improvement in the operating margin over the next year. Is that benefiting from both IP and the core space or is it mainly the core space?","Brian M. Beattie","It is both, actually, we've had very nice in our 100-point improvement in 2012, all product lines contributed to that operating margin improvement, and we'd expect that again in '13.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Brian, would it be fair to say that for the fourth quarter, the strength of your maintenance and services business was highly correlated to the strength of your IP and Systems business and that both of those in turn were highly correlated to the strength of your Asia-Pac business as well in the fourth quarter?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, good connection between the dots. There has been a very significant growth in our IP and Systems business this year overall, almost 22%. Of that, the level of maintenance and support provided by the business unit has also been very, very strong, reflecting increased positioning we've got in the market and the ability for us to offer a small level of customization to make sure all of those products will continue to work in that way. And it's not necessarily just Asia, but it really is growth across the -- all of our regions for growth in IP and Systems and growth in services, too. But Asia was a very strong grower this year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And over the past 2 years, particularly since you bought Virage, would it be fair to say that the profitability of the IP business has increased more quickly than the overall corporate growth and profitability? And if so, would you think that can continue into fiscal '13?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, it has. Very strong growth in our profitability levels. We continue to indicate that overall operating margins for that business are less than the corporate average. But it just reflects the fact that it is more resource-intensive as we port the IP to various geometries and all of the manufacturing platforms. So -- but very, very good growth in Systems and IP profitability, a very good contributor.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. For Aart, technical question regarding EVE. Could you comment at all on whether you foresee expanding the range of functionality that they've been offering to date in emulation to give broader coverage of various types of emulation and simulation that those kinds of hardware perform? And then related to that, how do you see the positioning or prospects of your emulation business versus your prototyping business?","Aart J. de Geus","Excellent question. Obviously, we have a set of capabilities within Synopsys that is very strong specifically in the compilation side of things. And the reason that's obvious is because we were first and foremost a very, very strong simulation company. And so bringing some of those capabilities to the emulator dramatically broadens its appeal because while it is well known to be the fastest emulator in run time, from a mapping to circuit onto the emulator, we can certainly improve and we have all the technology in-house to do that. Now with that, obviously, comes the opportunity to do many other types of checks, embed various testing schemes for example. The other aspect is the relationship to prototyping, and that's also a very good question because it illustrates that in all of our solution, we really have a very broad continuum of solutions that range from completely software to completely hardware. These things are extremely complementary. And we have actually customers that use both in the same solution. And so in different phases of the verification, one tends to use one over the other for different types of tasks. But the fact that we can essentially reduce the risk of moving from one to the other going forward is actually of high benefit to our customers.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. A couple of last ones. For Brian, for the $100 million of combined EVE and SpringSoft revenue in fiscal '13, could you talk about how much each might contribute within the $100 million, and what the deferred revenue hit was, if any, that you're baking in?","Brian M. Beattie","We're not breaking out the financials for EVE. As you know, they were a private company. The element of SpringSoft, again a publicly traded company in Taiwan, we wanted to highlight that the combination of both of those would contribute about $100 million in revenue only to ensure that we get aligned on the Synopsis model. SpringSoft is a little bit more upfront revenue, and again, we're moving all of that into the Synopsys model of how we've got it lined up. The deferred revenue haircut was not a meaningful impact, given the various accounting standards being used in Taiwan and France and had a minimal impact in terms of deferred revenue adjustments for those 2 transactions.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. If I could just follow up on a question Sterling asked earlier about the LAVA expectation for fiscal '13, early on right after you bought them, I think you had targeted something close to $100 million for LAVA in fiscal '13. I didn't hear if you reaffirmed that number or not.","Brian M. Beattie","It's at the point where we have fully integrated, again, the businesses as we try to extract the both ongoing backlog of products acquired from Magma and integrate that with the integration of our new Synopsys\/Magma product integrations. It's something we're -- again, we're reconfirming, it's about $100 million run rate on that business. That's the amount we expected when we started with the acquisition. It was about $60 million in 2012, and we anticipated the impact of that on Synopsys would be about $100 million. And we're still on track for that, and that's factored into the 2013 guidance.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next, we'll go to the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Aart, a question on several OEMs entering the design market more recently, LG and Apple is a well-known one, is that driving an incremental growth to the EDA industry?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, in general, it's an indication that some of the end users would like to have a stronger tie from their system solutions all the way to the silicon technology and\/or may want to become more proprietary about the secrets of what they're putting in their devices. And so the way we look at this is this is all part of a very, very competitive landscape with an enormous amount of very rapid changes. The good news is that Synopsys is used in all of the very advanced solutions extensively and that our support teams are actually very instrumental at helping people be successful. And so in that context, the answer to your question is yes, we do see this as an additional opportunity for growth in those systems houses that in the past didn't do all that much design but now are certainly very, very dependent on it and actually banking on it for their differentiation. So these are good opportunities for us.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And one more question on your revenue guidance. Is it fair to say that you're building in a lot of conservatism? I mean your historical pattern has been you have most of the time beat the guidance. So I would think that you're probably airing on the side of conservatism because of -- the organic growth is more low single digit in your guidance?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, that's a judgment call you have to make. If there's one thing that we have been very steady on is that we're setting roughly the same guidance partially because we want to adhere to a general multiyear driving of the company, which is to achieve high-single-digit EPS. Now if we can do better, obviously we'll do our best to do that. But at this point in time, we just started the year. There's no reason to be more aggressive. But we did mention that we feel that we're entering the year with strong momentum. We've made some fabulous acquisitions. There's a lot of work to do in an unknown landscape. So the company, I think, is in a very good shape.","Operator","Next, we'll go to the line of Satya Kumar with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was having a similar question. If I exclude the acquisitions' contribution of $200 million from Magma, EVE and SpringSoft, the core business is roughly flat for fiscal '13. And that is a fair bit lower than the mid-single-digit type growth you mentioned for the core business. I just wanted to make sure that, that was more conservatism from your part or is it some reflection of what you're seeing that customer trends? We've seen at least one customer, TI, talk about reducing some of the design activities. I was wondering if it's customer-driven or more conservatism.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, Satya, let me run with that one. First off, I don't know if I misheard you, but I think you might have said $200 million of revenue from Magma, right? We're saying...","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","No. Magma, EVE and SpringSoft, all 3 put together.","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, all 3 of them in terms of growth for '13 over '12, first of all, take into account that there was a 2% impact on revenues. Our revenue forecast right now is 11% to 12% or that would have been 13% to 14% adjusting for the extra week. When we look at the growth of SpringSoft and EVE, we saw growth of approximately $100 million. And then secondly, recall that if Magma's going to do -- Magma equivalent is about $100 million in '13, that's up from $60 million in '12. So there's about $40 million of growth there. So it's very close. Both the organic businesses are growing very solidly, and the M&A impact of the deals completed in 2012 are going to have a very positive impact as well in setting us up in '13 and for growth beyond that point. So it's very balanced between growth of both the overall numbers of 13% to 14% adjusted for the week and a nice balance between organic and M&A impact. Both are solid.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I should have -- I could follow up with you guys, but I think I took out the IP and Systems growth as well as a higher growth piece. And I looked at the IP Systems and the 3 pieces taking out the rest of the core business was a bit flat, but I can follow up with you guys on that. And separately on the EVE and SpringSoft, you mentioned that it added $9 million in incremental revenues and about a similar amount in terms of cost. Is that the type of operating margin contribution you're expecting just mainly positive in 2013?","Aart J. de Geus","No, we've said the impact would be slightly accretive in 2013. And again, it's more a function of aligning the previous businesses into the Synopsys time-based license capabilities so that we'll have that 90% of revenue going forward coming from the backlog. So in combination, the 2 businesses would contribute about $100 million of revenue and be slightly accretive in '13. So obviously expenses, nicely less than $100 million. And that's just the transition year, if you like, the first full year that we have the business and continue to focus on improvements and synergies across the company with those.","Satya Kumar - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","How will the margins from that piece look in fiscal '13?","Brian M. Beattie","We're not projecting that yet. And in fact, the businesses will be totally integrated by that point. And again, the value is harder to identify than the acquisitions, as both for a very deep comprehensive perspective on verification technology throughout the company and enhancing our position in some of the analog services, particularly inside of APAC in that. So a lot of strategic value as well as very strong financials coming from a combination of these businesses.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a follow-up from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","One follow-up. I'm kind of curious, have you guys made any moves in terms of your pricing on any of the products? Have you raised any prices in the last several quarters? Or how do you think about the pricing dynamics as you look to 2013?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, I think that in general, it's always hard to see that pricing would change rapidly. It has not in the past, either up or down. However, I do think that we see that EDA industry right now is doing relatively well, and so that gives a little bit more backbone in terms of the pricing as we negotiate going forward because customers are very much looking at us as their best bet of their own success and differentiation. So I don't want to overstate it because it's hard to have really specific evidence when you do a lot of 3-year deals. On the other hand, in general, I think we're in a stronger position than we were, let's say, a year ago.","Operator","Thank you. And as [indiscernible] speakers at this time, there are no additional questions.","Aart J. de Geus","In that case, we thank you for your participation in this earnings release. I think it's clear to say that not only was Q4 a strong year, there's no question that fiscal '12 was a very strong year, not only by virtue of execution but also by virtue of the acquisition and technology leaps we did forward. And so if nothing else, I would like to leave you with the strong sense that Synopsys feels momentum going into '13 that notwithstanding whatever the landscape looks around us, we feel that we're a very solid company financially speaking and technically. And so we're actually entering FY '13 with very good hopes for good results. Thank you for your attention, and thank you for your support for FY '12.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today.

[Operator Instructions].Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer. Today\u2019s conference call will include commentary regarding our Q1 fiscal 2014 results and also the definitive agreement to acquire Coverity, both of which we announced this afternoon. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results, our expectations about the timing and likelihood of closing the acquisition and about the potential benefits of a culmination. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, today\u2019s earnings press release and our press release announcing the definitive agreement to acquire Coverity. All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release and the financial supplement that we released today. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I\u2019m happy to report that we began fiscal 2014 with a strong Q1. We met or beat every target we communicated last quarter, we made excellent progress preparing for a number of important product announcements over the next couple of months, and half an hour ago, we announced Synopsys\u2019 entry into the software quality, testing and security tools market through the acquisition of Coverity. Before introducing you to this major move, let me first summarize our results. We delivered revenue of $479 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59. For the year, we\u2019re tuning guidance on the revenue side, raising operating margin and reiterating our non-GAAP earnings per share targets. Our guidance excludes any impact of the Coverity acquisition. Looking at the semiconductor landscape around us, there is remarkably little change in our customers\u2019 cautious behavior. While there are clearly a number of companies that are doing noticeably better than others, on average, the various confidence metrics continue to show uncertainty while technology advances continue unabated. These economic and technical challenges drive companies to be cautious in their spending, demanding in their needs, and in some cases, to consolidate their businesses with others for efficiency and market position. While none of these pressures are new, the length of this period of uncertainty is notable in light of the continued intense drive for state-of-the-art design to meet unforgiving market windows.","Fortunately for Synopsys, the technical and time-to-market pressures make great EDA and IP solutions absolutely essential for success. In Q1 we were the beneficiary of this trend, with one of the top global fabless companies increasing its spending with us through a substantial broadening of product adoptions, which brings me to some highlights, starting with core EDA.","From a technology perspective, our leadership in advanced design, including FinFET transistors, is evident. As we\u2019ve often reported, we track the first 450 to 500 designs at each emerging process node. This quarter, we see 20\/22 nanometer designs increasing somewhat, and a definite acceleration of activities at 14\/16 nanometer, driven by the quest for substantial performance, low power and area benefits. Our design platform is relied on for nearly 90% of the 20\/22 nanometer and below projects. This is not by accident, as our TCAD 3D simulation of process and transistor devices is used well ahead of these technologies becoming available to the design community. This early modeling information, an increasingly comprehensive collection of IP, ranging from logic libraries, to memory blocks, to advanced interfaces; and a complete set of digital and analog\/mixed signal design tools, makes Synopsys the solution of choice for FinFET design. Indeed, through our customers, we see how FinFET-based chips will impact a growing number of products entering the market in late 2014 and significantly in 2015. This rapid advance in chip complexity brings enormous challenges to designers, but also to the core design tools. Please stay tuned this quarter for Synopsys to launch a major new capability in design tools. The outcome of many years of work, we have demonstrated excellent results with early partners, and I\u2019m looking forward to discussing the impact later in the quarter.","Moving to verification, we see an even bigger need for solution breadth and productivity increases. Be it in simulation, emulation, prototyping, verification IP, or debugging, the complexity challenge is growing faster than Moore\u2019s law. With approximately 70% of advanced digital designs counting on Synopsys tools, and virtually all of the top semiconductor companies relying on our analog circuit simulation, we\u2019re driving a very promising solution. Over the last 12 months, we\u2019ve made excellent progress towards building our next-generation verification platform based on both organic development and acquired technology. This quarter, we intend to roll out our long-term verification vision, introduce two major new products, and deliver a unique set of productivity improvements resulting from our massive integration investments. Now to IP and systems, where demand is strong. In Q1, we launched a number of new products, including an ultra-low power, non-volatile memory for internet-of-things applications, and a multiprotocol 12-gig SERDES for the data center market. In the Ultra high-definition TV space, Realtek, Synopsys and UMC announced first-pass silicon success of an award-winning chip utilizing Synopsys IP, tools, and professional services.","Meanwhile, our customers continue to adopt our USB solutions, which are now shipping in many millions of chips. For example, Microsoft uses our USB 3.0 IP in the Xbox One game console. In an industry first, we also demonstrated the next-generation USB 3.1 controller at CES in Las Vegas. It delivers end-to-end transfers of 10 gigabits per second. This is twice the data rate of USB 3.0. Our customers will be designing the new USB standard into products over the next year, and as contributors to the development of the spec, we already have IP ready to go at these early stages. As mentioned earlier, our FinFET footprint is rapidly widening, with releases of key FinFET optimized IP titles at several foundry processes. As we grow in IP, customers are signing up for larger and more wide-ranging agreements and several that include some technologies still in development. Because of this, as well as the timing of orders in 2014, we\u2019re seeing a slightly different profile than planned of how and when IP bookings translate to revenue. This results in a small amount of 2014 revenue now being scheduled in 2015, and while our annual bookings plan remains unchanged, we\u2019re tuning our \u201814 revenue outlook slightly down.","Consequently, we\u2019ll drive ops margin slightly higher and maintain non-GAAP EPS guidance. From a multi-year perspective, we continue to see IP and systems as a low-double-digit growth space. On the system side of this business, our FPGA-based and virtual prototyping products did particularly well during the quarter. While rewarding, this is not a surprise, as many of our customers are significantly increasing their focus on the simultaneous development and verification of hardware and software. Which naturally brings me to the very important announcement we made today. Synopsys is entering the emerging software quality, test, and security market. While this market is directly adjacent to our present position, it simultaneously extends to customers that Synopsys had no interaction with in the past. Today, we announced that we have signed a definitive agreement to acquire Coverity, the leading provider of software quality, testing and security tools. The $375 million transaction, which is approximately $350 million net of their cash, will be funded with a combination of U.S. cash and debt. Subject to HSR regulatory review and other customary conditions, we expect to close the transaction in our fiscal Q2.","Coverity fits well with the Synopsys high-tech, customer-obsessed DNA. Its 300 employees have built a solid business, with 2013 revenue of approximately 75 million in a recurring revenue model, and an average growth rate of 20% per year. The acquisition is important for two reasons: First, it\u2019s a natural adjacency and expansion of our total addressable market within our existing customers that are seeing growing amounts of software embedded in their products, and an ever-increasing number of engineers dedicated to that task; Second, the market for software quality extends well beyond the semiconductor industry to all software developers in all industries, thus opening a long-term growth opportunity beyond our existing customer base, in a fast growing market we don\u2019t address today. Let me quantify the opportunity. IDC today places Coverity as number 1 in the Software Quality Analysis and Measurement market segment, currently at approximately $500 million, with estimated 2017 market revenue of nearly $1 billion. We believe the increasingly complex development and deployment environments, including mobile, cloud, and embedded, could drive the CAGR to 20% or more in the next few years. As we\u2019ve discussed previously, today\u2019s electronics are differentiated by a combination of chip design and, increasingly, software. Semiconductor companies today typically hire more software than hardware engineers, and the importance of software goes well beyond the semiconductor space. With more than six million professional software developers in the world writing at least 60 million lines of code every day, productivity, quality and security tools serve a rapidly growing market.","Traditional techniques for testing code, many of which have not changed for decades, are no longer sufficient. In that regard, Coverity is a leader in a new age of software development tools. The company spun out of a Stanford research project 10 years ago, pioneered a disruptive technology that finds defects by inspecting the code itself, rather than running the code and waiting for bugs to appear. This allows developers to fix quality or security defects early in the process. Since early fixes are relatively cheap compared to discovering defects in final quality assurance or, even worse, shipping defective software, the economic benefit of this technology spans cost, quality of end product, and time-to- market. Coverity has built an impressive customer base, large, global companies such as Adobe, SAP, Samsung Electronics, Citrix, Dassault Systems, Panasonic, Raytheon, Expedia, and Comcast use Coverity today. Its customer base of more than 1,000 includes; nine of the top 10 software companies, eight of the top 10 global brands, six of the top 10 semiconductor companies, and seven of the top 10 aerospace and defense companies. As a matter of fact, Synopsys itself has been a Coverity customer for almost a decade, and for the past several years, we have mandated that Coverity be run on all of our software.","Bringing the two companies together has the potential to create incremental revenue opportunities in a couple of ways; one, through increased sales to current Synopsys semiconductor and systems customers. While these customer logos overlap, Coverity tools are sold to different buyers and different budget. Two, using Synopsys\u2019 broader reach and brand to increase penetration in industries new to Synopsys, and where Coverity has only just begun to serve; applications software, financial services, banking and trading platforms, government services, and basically any industry using software to power their operations. In addition, we see a pathway to expanding even further into this space, and building a substantial presence over the years, similar to what we did first with EDA, then IP. Coverity will be managed by John Chilton, one of our most senior executives who is well known to many of our investors, and who built our IP organization from the early stages. We\u2019ll integrate Coverity carefully into Synopsys, taking advantage of opportunities to leverage Synopsys\u2019 reach, while utilizing the already-successful practices and perspective of the Coverity team. In summary, we delivered strong results in Q1. During Q2 and through the next 12 months, we\u2019ll be launching compelling new technology in both core design and verification. And we\u2019re excited to embark on our new journey as we complete the acquisition of Coverity.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to, Brian Beattie.","Brian Beattie","Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today I will summarize our financial results for the quarter, provide you with our guidance for Q2 and the full year of 2014, and provide some financial details of the Coverity transaction. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. As Aart highlighted, in the quarter we continued to execute well, meeting or exceeding all of the quarterly financial targets that we provided in December. In addition, business levels were strong. We repurchased $55 million worth of Synopsys stock and our balance sheet remains healthy. Total revenue increased slightly to 479 million, well within our target range. About 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog and one customer accounted for just over 11% of first quarter revenue. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.6 years. We continue to expect average duration for FY14 to be approximately three years.","Turning to expenses, Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were 419 million, which included 28 million of amortization of intangible assets and 18 million of stock-based compensation. Q1 total non-GAAP costs and expenses were 370 million, down 6% sequentially and slightly below our target range, driven primarily by timing of quarterly expenses, including some delayed hiring, along with overall cost control. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter. For all of FY14, we currently expect non-GAAP operating margins to increase over FY13 levels by about 100 basis points. We continue to focus on operational efficiency and this year we will adjust our planned expense levels slightly to achieve our targeted FY14 non-GAAP earnings. Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.43. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.59, which was above our target range. So now looking at our cash flow, as expected, there was a Q1 net operating cash outflow of 74 million, due primarily to the timing of our prior year annual incentive compensation payments. We continue to target operating cash flow of 425 million to 450 million in FY14. We repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan, leaving a remaining balance of $98 million. During the quarter we purchased about $1.4 million shares of Synopsys stock for $55 million and we have approximately $445 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As a result, we ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 893 million, with 32% onshore and 68% offshore. DSO was 47 days and we ended Q1 with approximately 8,690 employees, with about one third in lower-cost geographies.","Now turning to the Coverity acquisition. As Aart mentioned, we anticipate funding the acquisition with a combination of U.S. cash and debt, the specifics of which will be determined over the next several weeks leading up to the close. Coverity generated approximately $75 million of revenue in 2013, is roughly breakeven on a non-GAAP basis, and is slightly cash flow positive. While we will not update our specific guidance until after we close the transaction, at this point we would expect its revenue contribution to be approximately $20-25 million in 2014, and increase substantially in 2015 as we work through the deferred revenue haircut. Our aspiration is to grow revenue in this space to more than $100 million over the next two years. Now due primarily to the impact of purchase accounting and the associated deferred revenue haircut, we expect the acquisition to be approximately $0.10 dilutive on a non-GAAP basis in FY14, reach breakeven in the second half of 2015, and be accretive in 2016. Now without the impact of the deferred revenue haircut, we would expect that the acquisition would be accretive in 2014 and beyond.","So now let\u2019s address our second quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance. None of this guidance includes the impact of the agreement we announced today to purchase Coverity. After the acquisition closes, which we expect to occur in our second quarter, we intend to provide updated guidance. So for the second quarter of FY14, our targets are; revenue between 505 million and 515 million. Recall that there is increased variability in quarterly revenue, driven by factors such as sales volatility in emulation and prototyping hardware, which generates upfront revenue, timing of IP consulting projects and royalties, and certain contracts where revenue is recognized when customer installment payments are due. We continue to expect a revenue model that\u2019s approximately 90 % time-based. Total GAAP costs and expenses between 422 million and 444 million, which includes approximately 19 million of stock-based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses between 377 million and 387 million; other income and expense between 0 million and $1 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.33 per share to $0.41 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 per share to $0.62 per share.","Now our fiscal 2014 outlook, again, excluding the impact of Coverity; revenue of 2.03 billion to 2.065 billion, which reflects the timing and profile of IP revenue that Aart mentioned. Other income and expense between 8 million and 11 million; non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 24%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings per share of $1.72 to $1.83, which includes the impact of approximately $77 million in stock-based compensation expenses. We are reiterating non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.55 to $2.60; capital expenditures of approximately $130 million; and we continue to target cash flow from operations of 425 million to 450 million. And finally, to assist in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be a bit higher than our first half revenue, with Q4 higher than both Q2 and Q3, which are similar. At this point, we expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly towards the second half of the year. So in summary, we\u2019ve achieved another quarter of solid financial performance and execution.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. First, we\u2019ll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen and congratulations on the transaction.","Aart de Geus","Thank you, Rich.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","So first just wanted to clarify in terms of the expectations for Coverity ex \u2013 any deferred I mean so you had 75 million baseline sounds like in \u201813. So ex-deferred revenue effect you would have expected that revenue to be about 20% higher in \u201814 is that an accurate statement?","Brian Beattie","No we\u2019re not giving what\u2019s the estimate, we\u2019re just saying based on not having a deferred revenue haircut and looking back at what 2013 looked like, it would be accretive if we didn\u2019t have to do a pretty significant typical deferred revenue haircut. The key there Rich is there is about 75 million of deferred revenue that we will anticipate acquiring when the deal is approved, and again just very typical deferred revenue haircut. We think it\u2019d be close to about 80% of that would be lost in the accounting treatment. So we just want to highlight that if we didn\u2019t do that, we would be actually in breakeven immediately for \u201814.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","You mentioned it was a recurring revenue model is it a SaaS like model or is it more of the typical subscription that you currently do with your customers?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s more like typical subscription license model.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Gotcha.","Brian Beattie","And very similar to ours as well.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Gotcha. And just trying to think about how you\u2019re thinking about this from a sort of synergy perspective, Aart. I mean as you mentioned a lot of overlap in customers from the high level corporate standpoint, but clearly very different groups. And I would think you\u2019d kind of need different people calling on them so I\u2019m just wondering do you envision sales synergies here or do you really view this as kind of \u2013 is it somewhat separate operation that let you get more wallet share within some of your big customers as well as other customers outside your traditional domain?","Aart de Geus","That\u2019s an excellent question because we are very much looking at this. I think the first thing we have to do is really learn well how they did it. Obviously, we have experience dealing with these large customers. We have a lot of experience doing very large transactions, but we also know that sometimes it\u2019s very good to be able to sell different budgets to different people under different premise. And so, we will be quite careful before we integrate too forcefully, because Coverity clearly did a number of things very well as they grew their initial market presence. But there is benefit of being able to go to these large companies and already have a strong brand. They may be the second comment and why I\u2019m personally so ecstatic about this is that on one hand, it\u2019s absolutely adjacent. And I can say that many ways because you have seen us invest a lot in number of years in tools that all are heading towards this hardware software interaction. And of course, we know very well that our customers up to market are embedding more and more software on chips themselves are multi-prophesying, little miracles of silicon. And so right there, there is a degree of complexity that is entering the software world that used to be very well known in hardware for many years but now is really starting to play there. At the same time, beyond this adjacency, software of course is a broad term and in many of the end applications financial systems to take just one example, you can see that the complexity and the security is becoming a very real issue. And so being able to apply A, the newer techniques that Coverity has pioneered, but B potentially over time to bring some of the techniques that EDA has pioneered, I think it\u2019s just very promising, but it\u2019s going to be rolled over for discovery. So want to be careful to not overemphasize the future, but I think again in the short term this is just a fabulous extension for Synopsys.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just wanted to follow up on your trimming up your revenue guidance for \u2013 I guess it sounds like pushed out IP revenue. First want to clarify that the revenue from your non-IP businesses unchanged that\u2019s what I would sort of infer from your comments. And then just hoping you could give me some color on, why your customers are pushing out these projects and kind of how this sort of changed relative to your original expectations?","Aart de Geus","Yeah so, on the core tools the picture has not changed where it\u2019s always very difficult to exactly predict what one will do four quarters from now. In general, I don\u2019t think that we would say anything fundamental has changed. On the IP and actually some of the other products that tend to be much more turn oriented, meaning you do a transaction and you will turn that some of that transaction to revenue within 12 months. About a quarter of the Synopsys business falls into that category, which is by definition always make a little bit more noise on how to predict that transition. In that context, the IP deals have become more complex and are relying on a broader set of products, some of which gets delivered when the customer wants them. And the very fact that they predict that they will want something this year or next year is a function of where they are going, and some of it is predicated on when the development is finished. And the positive in that is that a number of customers are really relying quite heavily for us on all the FinFET technologies and those have their own timeline. And so as we did our own modeling which we do on a continual basis, looking forward with all these it became clear that tuning the revenue a little bit was the right thing to do. At the same time, we have said many times we focus on the earnings per share and so we manage that company for that commitment.","Richard Valera \u2013 Needham & Company, LLC","That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you, Aart.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yeah hi. Thanks for taking my question. Brian, I just wanted to clarify one thing did you say that the goal for Coverity is to go to over 200 million or was it 100 million in two years?","Brian Beattie","It was 100 million over the next two years, Krish.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. And then one other question I want to find out was, it seemed like if you used your onshore cash to push this transaction, you\u2019ll be left with like almost no onshore cash. So this assumes that buybacks are going to cease at this point or?","Brian Beattie","No, let me help you clarify. First of all, we\u2019re looking at funding this with our onshore U.S. cash as well as debt and the exact balance of that is something we\u2019re working through as the deal closes. And we\u2019ll let you know what that ultimate breakdown is in the next within the next quarter as we close this transaction. And so again that is access in using our line of credit which we\u2019ve had in place for over a year. And that is totally available for these types of transactions. And then on the question of buyback, it really comes up to the same position we\u2019ve had. We said from the use of cash that M&A is our number one priority and that stays consistent and that\u2019s in line with its announcement that we made today. Secondly, as far as buybacks that\u2019s another option we\u2019ll continue to evaluate, continue to look at the best use of our cash relative to M&A relative to other buybacks, relative to paying off a little bit of our debt and we balance all those things altogether. So, that\u2019s where we balance and I\u2019ll give you the details over the next quarter of how much this will be using U.S cash and how we\u2019ll be using our line of credit to help fund it.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then final question from my end on your emulation business, the EVE business what kind of goals do you have for this year? Do you expect revenues from the business to increase, double any kind of color on that will be helpful?","Aart de Geus","Well we never disclose individual products, but clearly we see this as an opportunity to grow our business and our company overall. Most importantly, we also see it as a key ingredient in our verification strategy and a lot of the technical effort right now is focused on the integration of that product line with all the other technologies that we have. Stay tuned there will be more information coming out about that specifically in not too distant future, and it\u2019s clearly a field that continues to evolve very rapidly.","Krish Sankar \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks, Aart. Thanks Brian.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah good afternoon. First a question when you talked about how you\u2019re trimming the revenues a little bit raising the margin, what are the dynamics behind the margin going up higher than you initially had them?","Aart de Geus","Well that\u2019s called management. The fact that we, to the best of our ability set a plan for the year and then during the year, we continually readjust that. And of course at any point in time, there are many variables that go in sometimes only you can have fluctuations in currency exchange for example, and we\u2019ve seen a plenty of that in the last few years. You can see that some product lines move faster than others, in other words, there is variability. The reason we have always communicated to you the first variable to be the earnings per share, specifically the non-GAAP earnings per share, is that it\u2019s sort of our way to say, hey we will do our best to rebalance if any of these variables for whatever reason, changes. And so in this case, we make sure that we\u2019re focusing on driving the ops margin by controlling the expenses or looking at the growth of our population for example, we are growing company, so there is many things we can do there. But it is a proactive act of management and it is good to see that as a team we can align behind that but very quickly as it is indicated.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. So simply if you have a lower IP level IP\u2019s lower margin that helps your margin overall?","Aart de Geus","No, no I wouldn\u2019t go at it from that angle. At any point in time, any of our businesses we always like to do more business. So don\u2019t worry about your variable levels of profitability of any of our products. In general, as long as product is positive it\u2019s a good thing for the company. Now having said that, when we look at variances or rebalancing of the products ever slightly so, we still look at the aggregate expenses for the company. And if not at all with that thing from time to time to focus on that because one can always find things in the drawer that\u2019s one hasn\u2019t thought spending money on. And that is exactly what we have been doing and that\u2019s why we were able to do this point in time guide for the same earnings per share guidance that we had in the beginning of the year.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. All right. And then looking at Coverity, and maybe I missed this earlier, but on a longer term basis do you see Coverity as still standalone product separate from EDA or do you integrate that technology into your EDA tools?","Aart de Geus","Yes and yes, I guess it\u2019s probably the best answer, because at this point in time there is no question that with some of our existing customers, there is technology that will be of interest coming in from Coverity. At the same time, my hope is that many of the deep algorithms that we have pioneered in the hardware world for many, many years will also be of high value to Coverity\u2019s products then applied to a much broader set of potential customers. And so the reason we are cautious on stating too strongly how we want to integrate is because we are facing very interesting new market for us, growth market that we want to learn as much as possible from the Coverity team. And then of course, hopefully bring some of the experiences at Synopsys had over the years to benefits of accelerating the penetration in that market.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then may be one more question on IP, when you look at it from a broad based, are you starting to see more overlap with companies like Cadence or other IP vendors or is there still really the internal production that you\u2019re trying to displace?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s in the internal that is the biggest opportunity space for us. This is a growing market and as I think I mentioned in the preamble that we see the growth rate on multi-year basis really not having changed for us. There is lots of opportunities with customers that have probably barely outsourced 50% of the building blocks that are easily outsourceable. So there are space to do things there. And the other thing is that with the increasing complexity of these blocks, I think we\u2019re going to see more customers that actually if they wanted to, can no longer do them themselves. And so, that in itself over time will provide good opportunity for us.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. But customers are cautious right now with spending, does that make it easier or harder to sell IP? If they look into decrease your cost structure or is it you just don\u2019t want to spend any money?","Aart de Geus","It\u2019s an interesting question because in general, you would all would say when customers are not cautious they spend more money, but it\u2019s hard to point to the years where customers are not to some degree cautious. And IP outsourcing is particularly interesting because more often than not actually customers come at this from an economic perspective rather than technical perspective, because outsourcing IP 10 years ago was absolutely taboo. Today, it\u2019s actually a great way to accelerate the product development with state-of-the art blocks, that otherwise would be difficult to do for them and not necessarily be differentiated. In other words, they would have to spend their most competent engineering time on it, without necessarily getting differentiation. So, we\u2019ve seen in various downturns that each one of those brings about a rethinking on the side of the customer, as to what they should do and what they should not do. And the very fact that we have a very strong I think track record of quality and also support of the customer it served us well, when people want to explore outsourcing and it comes as [inaudible].","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then last question for Brian, the tax rate at 24%, do you still view that as your long term tax rate or does that change in the years to come?","Brian Beattie","Yeah it is. We\u2019re still on the 24% range I just remind everybody as all of the CFOs look at projecting tax rates for 2014 and beyond, we have not factored in the R&D tax credit into any of our assumptions.","Thomas Diffely \u2013 D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brian Beattie","Thank you, Tom.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go the line of Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. It\u2019s Zachid[ph] here for Sterling. Aart, you touched on this on a prior question, but just wanted to dig a bit deeper. In your prepared remarks, you talked about how customers remain relatively cautious, despite a lot of technological advancement. What do you think is kind of driving that disconnect? It seems like it\u2019s been a few quarters or more than few quarters, but what are some of your updated thoughts there?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think you have to start with the big picture which is of course in the last four, five years global GDP has languished. Semiconductors has done significantly better than that, but semiconductors are not growing enormously fast. However, the technology demands are growing enormously fast. And so, in many ways, customers are for starters, between this squeeze off, how do I get the money and how do I pay for all the new good stuff? Secondly, there are some markets where there has just been increase in concentration, all the way to some markets that tend to be sort of winner takes all, in terms of behavior. And so there, another dynamic is at play which is how do customers do create critical math. And that often results in either acquisitions within a product line or outright company mergers for math and for size and so all of these changes are relatively difficult to execute well. And so that is why if you look at some of the what\u2019s called, the confidence in indexes that look at semiconductors exact [inaudible] month are you it\u2019s quite remarkable how these things isolate between 48% to 52% and 50% of the intermediate between happy or unhappy. So, that life in the semiconductor lane right now and so it\u2019s not a surprise that customers are cautious, may be cautious is not even the right word, they are just managing within the budgets that they have. Now having said that, I think we have Synopsys only executed in terms of growth over quite a number of these years and we expect to continue to do that. But we have hard work and that\u2019s our job.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on the IP push out of IP revenue, is it fair to say that most of that is customer driven meaning that they are pushing out their own product introductions which in turn, trickles down to you?","Aart de Geus","Somewhat, I think certainly there is number of cases where what you said is absolutely correct. There are number of cases where they do larger VPAs where either the take up of the IP or the availability on part of the IP is impacted by both their timeline and our timeline. And so those are sometimes very difficult to predict, they are good signs because they are signs of customers trusting us with their future. But sometimes it\u2019s just a little bit more difficult to predict. And as you surely can see from my earlier comments around the stress levels of technology, for our customers they moved to FinFET is a pretty big decision. We see the large guys have all gone to it after investing. This is the next segment of customers that\u2019s just now sort of moving into that domain.","Unidentified Analyst","And then on Coverity, it sounds like they are selling to a bunch of different verticals, but can you disclose about how much they generate from the semi-vertical even if just a range?","Aart de Geus","Let me not do that, partially because until this is closed, I should not really speak about that company beyond what is reasonably public knowledge. What I can say certainly is that more than half of their customers today, are in the semiconductor segment that we know well. And that\u2019s of course where we initially encountered them, but it is quite interesting that at least quarter to a third, are pretty far away from where Synopsys resides. But you can immediately see how important quality is in software is just taking out the financial services or banking services, but we\u2019re also taking about people doing oil research or aeronautics research. There is a lot of software being developed. And I think the interesting insight here I hope that plays out going forward, for a number of decades the level of quality for hardware have to be extremely high, because an error can force people to redo their chip. And right there is often a multi-million dollar decision. Whereas an error in software could also be fixed by a patch, well that is true if your software is not too complicated. When the software becomes very intertwined with many other things, so we have truly systemic complexity, which we know well on the hardware side, and that is why my hope is that over time, a number of the techniques that Synopsys has pioneered will also apply to the broader software world.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re more welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Next we\u2019ll go to line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart, a couple of questions to start on Coverity, could you talk a bit about how the dynamics of that business differ from what you\u2019re used to in the EDA? For instance, with over 1,000 customers they would seem to have an average amount of spent per customer or may be $0.75 million or so considerably below what you\u2019re used to in EDA. Assuming that number isn\u2019t scalable for customer, would it be fair to say that much of the growth would be dependent on new customer acquisitions vis-\u00e0-vis Coverity? Also if you think about Coverity in a larger context of systems design, not just on the software quality level but more broadly does it then become also important for Synopsys to have a strong position on custom IC? I have a couple of follow ups.","Aart de Geus","Sure. So for starters, it\u2019s interesting that the numbers that you cited, when we started Synopsys, we would have loved to have numbers like that. And it took quite a while to build up the transactions and relationships that we have with our customers today, it took many years and of course, the sales approaches quite a bit what for us has been like 25, 27 years or so. Having said that though, I think you\u2019re still pointing your finger at an interesting set of questions which is there will be a number of questions that initially are brand new customers that are new to using tools around software. And there one will gradually penetrate that market, there are some customers that very quickly will realize if the software works well and its impact how can they move to larger volumes, how can they broaden the utilization or how can they even do what we at Synopsys did, which ultimately mandates the software utilization? Now I don\u2019t think that there is much correlation between this and what we do in the custom world, except for the one area that I think is interesting in long term which is the intersection between digital and custom is clearly visible in the Internet of things. The Internet of things is full of things that have software embedded and so when you look at that in aggregate, this is precisely what I always refer to as systemic complexity very multi-dimensional set of things. I think right now this is all looking far forward. The way we should look at Coverity it is new time that is existing today on the very focused area of quality and testing and security of software. And just focusing on that alone will be our first challenge. The reason I said some of these other things is just because I see a natural adjacency for both our technology and market position.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. Couple more for you Aart, regarding the bigger picture of the market. You mentioned that you are seeing some improved penetration or consolidation on some accounts, with your largest customer you clearly have the large majority of the customer spent. The question is are you seeing a trend where you are now have become the majority of a greater number of customer spend? Is that a trend at all? Go on, sorry.","Aart de Geus","In general, our objective obviously is to grow with our customer and to grow into customers where we are not well represented. Ultimately the EDA industry is relatively stable, but within that Synopsys has done I think well. For those customers that are really impacted by our tools and it tends to come from the advanced site of the spectrum, all people knew very large volumes very high complexity, low power designs, that\u2019s our natural home. And so, the fact that our tools are increasingly performance and \u2013 increasingly performing very well together I think is one of the reasons that a number of customers have broaden their footprint with us. But you have to earn that every day and it\u2019s a field of continued change so we\u2019ll keep pushing on that and opportunity for us.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Lastly, geographic question for you and in terms of the whole industry, Asia-Pac has been by far the fastest growing market over the last a number of years and in fact decade. Not just on the too side, but increasingly on the IP side if you do a 10 year CAGR analysis, it looks like Asia-Pac for you, has been a mid-teens growth business and all other regions, low to mid-single digits. The question is do you see any risk that could potentially decelerate or disrupt the kind of above average growth that you\u2019ve seen in Asia-Pac for these last many years? And conversely, are you seeing any sense of it bottoming in Japan outside the currency effects, are you seeing any signs that the long slow erosion in that market as far as EDA is concerned is beginning to bottom out?","Aart de Geus","Well let me start with the top of the question. Of course, the growth of one region comes out at the expense of another within the profile of the overall growth of the semiconductor industry. And so, if you grow higher than the industry then some other region must better finish and grow lower. And you\u2019re absolutely correct that Asia-Pacific initially coming from almost nowhere, has grown to become a very, very market. It is also a market that has invested in technology and invested in this cooling of technologist i.e. engineers substantially. So that reason alone makes it an interesting place. If you have add to the fact that some of those economies specifically China has the potential to grow its own image as a customer base substantially, surely one would believe that, that can continue for a while. If you look at Japan, I do think that they are a number of positive while very difficult changes and you can see it in companies that are restructuring, that are refocusing and of course at the national level, there has been a high degree of emphasis on stimulating the economy and utilize currency as one of the mechanisms to do so. I think the feedback tends to be a little up and down from one quarter to another you only have to read the newspapers to see that. But I am still a believer that in aggregate, the structural changes that industry is going through are necessary. They are being fooled, they will take some time, but over time, Japan hi-tech if I put it on the umbrella will emerge stronger.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Sorry can I squeeze one in for Brian, on the IP business. In Q1, would it be fair to say that there was a close correlation between the $10 million or so drop in IT revenue in Q4 and the $10 million drop or so in your services revenue in Q4?","Brian Beattie","I\u2019d say that as far as one of the changes for our IP business as we saw in Q1, that the services part is down and that just again reflects the timing of the bookings of when those transactions came in the breath of the larger contracts and in fact coming through as well. So, you\u2019re right, it is IP, it is related to services line which is different. And again, remember this is contract by contract, account by account and it varies by quarter to quarter. We had anticipated some reductions in terms of IP business going from Q4 to Q1 as we let everybody know at last year. And then as we look ahead to our guidance for Q2, again it looks like a stronger business based on the projections that we have at this point for Q2.","Jay Vleeschhouwer \u2013 Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And no one else is queuing up with the question.","Aart de Geus","So at this point in time, let me thank you again for joining us for this call.

","At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thanks Anna. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. ","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings Press Release.","In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings Press Release, 8-K and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","Also included in the financial supplement is detailed information around our long-term financial objective, the transition to ASC 606 this year and operating segment results. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I am happy to report excellent second quarter results. Revenue was a record $836 million, with strength across both operating segments. In Semiconductor & System Design, software revenue growth was particularly strong, moderated somewhat by a tough hardware comparison versus a record second quarter 2018. Software Integrity revenue tracked right to plan with greater-than-20% growth and is expected to be profitable for the year.","Non-GAAP EPS was $1.16, and we repurchased $100 million of our stock, bringing the total so far this year to $129 million. While the U.S. export restrictions that were announced last week do have an impact, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings guidance in the top end of our revenue range to reflect the strength of our business. Trac will provide some additional color on this topic and discuss the financials in more detail.","Whereas geopolitical tension has escalated, the overall customer environment for us is quite solid. The hunger for advanced technology, design tools, IP, and security solutions is strong, creating a robust market opportunity. The growing impact of AI, 5G, the internet of things, and big data is profound and is driving substantial investments in new compute and machine-learning architectures. ","Virtually all vertical markets are engaging with AI and the potential economic impact it forecasts to be in the trillions of dollars. In addition to long-time semiconductor vendors, very large system companies and cloud providers are investing competitively, opening further opportunities for us. The push for AI solutions, along with the growing security issues associated with a highly-interconnected world, benefits our entire Silicon-to-Software product portfolio.","Synopsys is ideally positioned to solve these very complex challenges. Our EDA design and verification solutions are front and center in creating brand-new AI-optimized engines. Our IP is broadly used in the most advanced silicon technologies ever built. Our prototyping tools run and tests software on new subsystems long before silicon is available; and our software security and quality solutions are essential to minimize vulnerability to threats.","In that context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. The underlying driver of EDA growth is design complexity, along three vectors: One, advanced processes moving to smaller, denser technology nodes such as seven, five and most recently, three nanometer; two, optimizing designs in more established nodes for cost reduction, but also speed and low power; and three, massive software content that is becoming integrated as part of chip design. And overall the system challenges to make sure the chip and the software work well together.","In design customers rely on Synopsys for virtually all of their 12nm and below designs. The key reasons are state-of-the-art tools, and also our unmatched collaboration and support. This quarter we continued our long-standing foundry-enablement with TSMC, who certified both our digital and custom design platforms for its 5nm FinFET process.","TSMC also certified our Fusion Design Platform for their innovative System-on-Integrated-Chip or SoIC chip-stacking technology, delivering design solutions for true 3D device integration. Samsung used our complete design solution to develop the very first test chip for its brand-new Gate-All-Around process.","In digital design, a rapidly growing highlight is the success of our new Fusion Compiler product, which we launched in November. It\u2019s a revolutionary combination of the main pillars of design, all of which are cornerstones for Synopsys: synthesis, place & route, and signoff into a single solution, on a single data model.","Fusion Compiler is doing really well from both technical and business perspectives. A rapidly growing set of customers is reporting excellent results, including significantly shorter design times, a higher level of predictability and better timing, area and power results. Adopted by 19 different logos, across eight different process nodes, and used for about 250 active or by now completed designs, the trajectory is impressive.","One such customer is Renesas who deployed Fusion Compiler across its high-value automotive portfolio. Renesas cited consistently superior power, performance and full-flow productivity on its production designs. The versatility and potential of the Fusion Design Platform is living up to its promise, which includes continuously adding of new fusion technology capabilities to broaden its impact.","This quarter for example we launched a fully integrated Test flow containing next-generation capabilities for automotive tests and functional safety. Stay tuned as we deliver further enhancements over the next 12 months.","Now turning to verification, where we continue to see outstanding results and a strong outlook for the year. Thanks to many years of great technology advances and excellent customer support, we are the market leader.","Verification is a huge bottleneck for chip and system design. Customers tell us that they can\u2019t get enough verification, as design complexity is getting more difficult and more time-consuming by the day. Synopsys is fortunate to have the fastest software and hardware solutions, and demand is high for our Verification Continuum Platform.","Q2\u2019s strength in verification software was driven in part by accelerating demand from influential systems companies who are reinventing how to design and verify their next-generation products. Our decade-long leadership is an important indicator of our impact. 12 of the top 15 semiconductor companies in the world use our franchise VCS simulator as their primary verification solution.","Demand for our hardware-based verification is also high and increasingly broad-based. The ability to validate chips together with the software and the need for early software development are paramount. Our new ZeBu 4 emulator launched late last year, is doing very well, with early demand exceeding expectations and outpacing that of previous solutions.","Adoption of our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping solution which targets early software development was again robust in the quarter. As a result of our differentiation, we are the market leader in both emulation and prototyping.","Now to IP, which had another very strong quarter and is poised for an excellent year of double-digit growth. As the number two vendor in the world, and the market leader in interface, analog, embedded memory and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry\u2019s broadest set of building blocks to address today\u2019s most complex design requirements for AI, automotive, internet of things, cloud computing and more.","The quarter featured a number of important milestones at advanced nodes. We announced that we have achieved more than 250 IP wins on TSMC\u2019s 7nm FinFET Process, across a broad range of applications. In addition, we signed a multi-year agreement with a marquee global customer for 5nm IP.","Meanwhile, our portfolio continues to expand. Further building on our strength in automotive, we announced the collaboration with Global Foundries to develop the industry's first automotive-grade IP for their 22nm FDX process. We announced a complete solution for one of the hottest markets around narrow band IoT, enabling the next wave of connected devices. And we taped out two key IP titles for cloud computing and AI applications, including a 112G SerDes, and ultra-high-speed connection for hyperscale data centers.","With the rising complexity and time-to-market challenges inherent in delivering today\u2019s electronic systems, Synopsys fills a critical and growing need for sophisticated, low-risk IP, which brings me to our Software Integrity Group, which has now reached the 10% of Synopsys revenue milestone and is scaling nicely. ","As software security issues continue to increase in both number and severity, testing during the development process becomes a necessity. This is true not only for electronics, but for anyone who develops software in financial services, medical, automotive, industrial and beyond.","The progress our team has made in building this business over the past five years is striking. While we acquired compelling technology and added substantial organic investments, we also focused our deep knowledge towards building a compelling software security and quality platform.","In March we announced our new Polaris Software Integrity Platform. It brings products and services together into an integrated, user-friendly, cloud-based solution that makes deployment and scalability easier. ","While we will continue to deliver enhancements to the platform over the next 12 to 18 months, the initial release is already showing great promise. We are engaged with customers across all regions and early reaction has been very positive. This included a Fortune 500 insurance company who placed a multi-year, multi-million-dollar order for Coverity delivered on Polaris.","The power of our portfolio, the broadest in the industry, is evident in the growing number of high-value contracts and companies adopting multiple products. Industry recognition of our solution also continues to grow. Last month, for the third year in a row, Synopsys was named a Leader in Gartner\u2019s Magic Quadrant for application security testing; in fact, we were placed at the highest level. ","We were also again recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for Software Composition Analysis for open-source software. Important rankings such as these substantiate our leadership for customers who are investing significantly and choosing their preferred partners.","To summarize: We delivered another very strong quarter, and are raising the top end of revenue and non- GAAP EPS guidance for the year. We\u2019re making step-by-step progress in expanding our ops margin. Our new EDA products in the early stages of a multi-year adoption cycle are experiencing rapid and substantial adoption. Demand for our IP portfolio is high, and we expect to deliver another year of low double-digit growth. And our software security and quality business is scaling well, reaching about 10% of total revenues and expected to reach profitability for the full year.","Finally, I want to say thank you to the global Synopsys team for its continued hard work and commitment to helping our customers meet their important and always urgent objective.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac. ","Trac Pham ","Thanks Aart. Good afternoon everyone. We continue to execute well, delivering good top and bottom-line growth and non-GAAP operating margin of 25%. Operationally, we are on-track for another outstanding year, with an outlook that reflects high-single-digit revenue growth on an apples-to-apples ASC 605 basis, substantial operating margin improvement, and double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth.","Last week\u2019s government action to restrict trade with one of our customers and its affiliates does have an impact on the business, as we are currently unable to ship products, deliver software updates or provide support. As a result, we are not able to book new business and recognition of currently contracted revenue is on hold. However, due to the strength of our first half, we\u2019re still able to raise our non-GAAP EPS guidance and the top end of our revenue range. I\u2019ll provide more details in a moment.","Now to our Q2 numbers. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated, and all results are reported under ASC Topic 606. For a summary of these results, as well as equivalent financial metrics under ASC 605, please refer to our Financial Supplement.","We generated consolidated total revenue of $836 million or 8% growth, and saw broad-based strength across both segments. Semiconductor & System Design revenue was $753 million, up 6% or high-single-digits excluding hardware, which had a record second quarter last year. For Software Integrity, revenue was $83 million, an increase of 23% as that business continues to capitalize on market dynamics and gain share in this high-growth market.","Continuing down the income statement, consolidated total GAAP costs and expenses were $721 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $626 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 25%. At the segment level, Semiconductor & System Design delivered an adjusted operating margin of 26.8%, with Software Integrity at 10.1%, reflecting both underlying strength and quarterly variability of revenue and expenses.","Note that certain operating expenses such as stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, and other expenses that are managed at the consolidated level, have not been allocated to our segments. We continue to expect Software Integrity to be profitable for the full year, with the goal of reaching at least our consolidated corporate margin over the long-term. These operating results in turn drove GAAP earnings per share of $0.77, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.16.","Turning to cash, operating cash flow was $353 million, driven by strong collections in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $631 million, and total debt of $292 million.","Before moving to guidance, let me provide some additional color around the impact of last week\u2019s government action. As I mentioned, we are not able to book new business with this customer and its affiliates, and revenue recognition for current contracts is on hold until either the contract expires or the restriction is lifted. ","Because the duration of the ban is unclear, we\u2019ve expanded our ranges to account for an array of potential impacts. We believe that we will eventually be able to recognize the revenue, depending on the timing of the ultimate resolution of the government action.","Our targets, based on ASC 606 for the fiscal year 2019 are: Revenue of $3.29 to $3.35 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $2.798 and $2.853 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $2.505 and $2.525 billion, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin at the midpoint of just over 24%;","Other income and expenses between minus $12 million and minus $8 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $2.85 to $3.27 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $4.24 to $4.40 per share, an increase at the midpoint of $0.08 over our prior guidance;","Cash flow from operations of $670 million to $700 million, which reflects additional uncertainty due to the trade restrictions, and some restructuring costs as we reallocate resources for future growth; and capital expenditures of approximately $270 million. We continue to expect CapEx to drop by roughly half in 2020. ","Now to the targets for the third quarter: Revenue is between $810 and $850 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $700 million and $746 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $620 and $640 million; other income and expenses between minus $4 million and minus $2 million; our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 16%; outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.83 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $1.07 to $1.12 per share.","I\u2019ll conclude by reiterating our long-term financial objectives. Annual double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth, driven by revenue growth in the high-single-digits, reflecting mid-to-high single digits for EDA, low-double-digits for IP, and Software Integrity growth in the 20% range, and operating margin expansion to the high-20s by 2021, and in the 30% range longer-term.","Our execution in the first half reflects our commitment to driving near-term results that will put us on a path to achieving our longer-term operating objectives. Our capital allocation strategy enables us to meet these dual objectives, while returning substantial value to shareholders. We maintain a balance of internal and external investments for growth and a robust share-repurchase program.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. ","Rich Valera ","Thank you, good afternoon. Aart beside from the ban which has some specific implications, would you say there is any other change in the outlook or the demand from your customers relative to a quarter ago? ","Aart de Geus","Actually I would say no, I don't think that there\u2019s material other change. There was some worry about three months ago that seem to have settled. I think the market is just re-adjusting itself among the companies who is doing better than others, but the end demand I think remains just as strong as it was before. ","Rich Valera ","Got it and then Trac just a clarification on the guidance for that the rev rec with Huawei. So can we assume that the low end of your revenue range that there's no rev rec assumed for Huawei for the balance of the year, is it is that correct?","Trac Pham","That\u2019s correct Rich. We try to widen the range to capture the possibilities of the restrictions remaining in effect and then the higher end of the range which reflects the execution of the first half which has been very strong and then possibly that gets listed in some reasonable amount of time.","Rich Valera ","Right, so is it fair to say that the low end would have been going up had not you had this change with respect to Huawei?","Trac Pham","That's correct. ","Rich Valera ","Got it, and then with respective to the hardware business which obviously had a tough comp in Q2, but generally I think has a kind of a tough comp for all of next year. I think when you came into this year you were thinking that that would be flattish. I don't know if you gave that specific guidance but my sense was you were just sort of thinking about that being flattish? Any change in thoughts on the hardware business, you know that now that we're a couple of quarters into the year? ","Aart de Geus","No, I think fundamentally I think we have predicted it reasonably well and while we didn\u2019t use those words, the words are not all that far away from where we are. And so we do see good demand and broader demand, so that is excellent. So in the long term I think that will just sit at the back. Last year was just particularly strong and actually overall so far this year is good in general. I think you characterized it correctly. ","Rich Valera ","Got it, thanks very much gentlemen. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. ","Tom Diffely ","Yes, good afternoon. I was following up on Rich's question on Huawei. Where there applications near us on location that had been removed at this point? ","Aart de Geus","Well you know I don't think we want to go into the intricacies or all the individual actions, but with all of our customers we have essentially constantly applications, engineers helping them and you know right now we just follow exactly the rules set by the government and they include not getting specific support. ","Tom Diffely ","Okay and then, I just have a question on that, was it a combination of both traditional EDA tool as well as IT was one that more significant than the other. ","Aart de Geus","Yeah, well we wouldn't break it into individual pieces. Large companies typically our participants in all of our portfolio. So that certainly would include the tools and IP. ","Tom Diffely ","Okay, actually you said at some point there was some of the strong growth you see in IP comes from a lot of the Chinese customers as you are fairly new to this space. Okay, so I guess moving on, do you see other impacts from the trade war, the tariffs on your business and if you do, is there difference between delivering EDA traditionally versus over the cloud? ","Aart de Geus","No, we don\u2019t see any changes and I think it's too early to see any changes in the market, period. Obviously there will be some readjustment of how different suppliers act. I'm talking about semiconductor companies. But I think it's really much too early to speculate I would say, even the last few days there have been changes. ","Tom Diffely ","Okay, and then Trac when I look at your full year view and obviously you\u2019ve got the dampening effect of Huawei, but was there any other puts and takes that created the spread or was it really just that one particular event? ","Trac Pham","It is fairly that isolated issue, because when you look at first half results you are seeing very good growth in the top line margin improving very well against last year and you can see in our guidance for Q2 was very constructive. And so the widening of the guidance range really reflects the trade restrictions that went into effect last week. ","Tom Diffely ","Great. Okay, thank you. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Mitch Steves","Can you hear me? ","Aart de Geus","Yes, we can. ","Mitch Steves","Okay, I apologies I am on the road, but so I only have two questions, the first one is pretty high level. So obviously the US and China got higher tensions here. Maybe I\u2019m thinking about this too much, but is there a chance that essentially the Chinese vendors also do outside of Huawei who want to push to kind of go into the higher end node now, now with the potential for it to get banned, wouldn\u2019t it make sense they would try to, I guess try to invest in the higher tax. Do you have any thoughts on that?","Aart de Geus","Well, you know I think that all companies that are in the signature arena are continually racing forward to try to provide products with high end nodes and most sophisticated technology. I don't think that goes away under any economic scenario and so this is one of the reasons why we think that overall our business outlook is very solid or strong, because the demand given the applications that are being developed requires strong investments on the part of our customers in advanced technologies, and so different companies will get there in different ways, but the race is definitely on. ","Mitch Steves","Got it, and then second one, I guess on the track to take the limelight for this one. Well, when I look at the Software Integrity business, you had 10% margins already. That seems pretty substantial on a Q over Q basis. Can you help us understand how that\u2019s going to ramp, because I think that going 50% sequential growth in terms of the margin perspective is pretty high. So how would you model that going forward in the next couple of years? ","Trac Pham","Yes, let me start with this. Let\u2019s focus on this year. We're showing a really good trend on software integrity and that\u2019s heading in the right direction after you know roughly five years of investment in that area. ","The profitability or the OM for that business, it's going to be noisy from quarter-to-quarter. Keep in mind it's a nascent market that\u2019s growing and the profile of that business will vary from quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s just the revenue growth, but still very strong and we\u2019ll continue to invest in this area. So you'll see us talking about revenue growth and investment.","For this year though, we are certainly on track for profitability for the business, but I just would be cautious about extrapolating too quickly the Q1 results heading to Q2. But we definitely will be profitable.","Longer term given the dynamics and the nature of that business, we do expect it to be at lease as the corporate average in terms of OM. ","Mitch Steves","Okay, thank you. ","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. ","Sterling Auty","Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. I apologize, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s the static or I didn't quite catch the following two questions round the China situation. The first one is, is it all revenue related to all products currently with that customer that's put on hold? Is there anything else that potentially could come on the revenue line over the coming quarters? And I got one follow up. ","Trac Pham","So the revenue guidance includes all revenues for all products related to that one customer. ","Sterling Auty","Okay, and so there is no revenue at all coming for that customer in the income statement, alright perfect. And then the other one is, I didn't catch \u2013 what about cash flow? In terms of cash collections and payments. ","Trac Pham","Yes, so our cash flow guidance of $670 million to $700 million does reflect a couple of new items. One is an impact of tax collections for that customer and probably it\u2019s just a reflection of the fact that we aren\u2019t able to provide additional support for them, so the prudent outlook is to assume that the collections will be delayed. The other part is the restructuring that we took in Q2, a minor restriction that we took in Q2. ","Sterling Auty","I think that\u2019s very fair, that last element. FX impact on top and bottom line in the quarter and the outlook?","Trac Pham","Generally, immaterial to our overall results. Keep in mind, the one currency that's not denominated in USD is the Yen and that is hedged at the beginning of the year. So the top and bottom line is pretty much dampened by FX. ","Sterling Auty","Sounds good, thank you so much. ","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. ","Gary Mobley","Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my question. A follow-up question on the operating margin for the Software Integrity business. You mentioned the long term target of being at corporate average, you know presumably high 20%. What revenue level has to be achieved to get to that target? ","Aart de Geus","The model that we described for the Software Integrity is roughly about 20% plus growth and if we continue on that path the growth will be there and then over the last few years not only have we invested in the product portfolio and our go-to-market infrastructure, but we have also spent time building out the organization infrastructure, the back-office where there is the systems or the processes to scale in that. So you will continue to see improvements in operating margins through a combination of revenue growth in that 20% range and operating leverage as that business scales. ","Gary Mobley","Okay, Trac you mention a minor restructuring in the second quarter, but I think the charge was the highest charge you've had in at least a few years. So could you shed some light on what the restructuring was and perhaps you know what the headcount and product groups might be impacted?","Trac Pham","Yeah, it\u2019s really, Gary it\u2019s very much fine tuning. We've committed to driving operating margin expansion with a focus on hitting the high 20s by 2021. We\u2019ll continue to invest in the business, that\u2019s an important part, across all areas and as we tweak and tune it we\u2019ll try to \u2013 our focus is making sure that we're emphasizing the business areas that is going to deliver the best combination of top line and \u2013 top line growth and margin expansion, and so Q2 was just a function of that you know.","Gary Mobley","Okay, and the last question. I'll ask it quickly, hopefully it\u2019s a quick answer. But do you have handy the mix between merchant ship vendor and System OEMs and captiviely developed integrated circuits? ","Aart de Geus","Sorry, I don't follow that question. ","Gary Mobley","Well, what\u2019s your sales mix between immersion integrated circuit companies and system OEMs. ","Aart de Geus","You know that\u2019s very sure that\u2019s never changed all that much. It was always sort of in the 40%-ish for the system houses. But in all fairness you know those definitions are becoming much fuzzier because a number of system companies that in the past didn't do any chip design have now started to invest in chip. And I think we mentioned some of those as being some of the big cloud providers for example are some of the very large companies in the world and at the same time the other people that are dedicated to chip design are spending more money because it's more challenging. So fundamentally for us the picture is changing, but is not evolving away from those numbers.","Gary Mobley","Okay, alright that's helpful. Thank you. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer ","Thank you, good evening. Trac just a quick clarification. You did not mention in your prepared remarks an updated backlog number as you did in Q1, if you could provide that? ","Second for Aart with respect to the restructuring, that ties into a couple of questions that we had meant to ask you anyway and that is back in September at an Investor meetings in New York and again at the Analyst meeting a couple of months ago, you referred to improving your internal processes related to the company's profitability and Trac referred to efficiencies, but you didn't really go into much detail as to what you're doing, you're changing your cost structure here. But in what other operational and ongoing ways are you in fact going to improve those processes and efficiencies that you alluded to? ","And also, it looks now just a quick spot check this afternoon. Once the restructuring news came out that your current job openings are the lowest in a year and a half and looks like most of the pullback in openings as in the U.S. and you still have a fair number of openings in China. So maybe just talk about all of those issues together in terms of processes, cost structure, hiring? Thanks. ","Trac Pham","So let me start with your first question Jay. The backlog was around $4.3 billion, pretty consistent with where it was at the end of Q1. Overall the business, as you can see in the outlook, the business has been pretty healthy and run rate growth was actually up in Q2 again. ","I\u2019ll make a few comments on the fine-tuning of our business and Aart can provide some more color, but it really ranges across the board. For example, you know it goes from systems implementation. Over a couple years ago we upgraded our ERP system to get prepared for 606 transition as well as the evolution of the business into different portfolios. ","Having that platform then allowed us to go in and spend time last year and continue into this year looking at our infrastructure and the processes around the Software Integrity business and allowing us to scale some of that benefit you are seeing, certainly in the profitability improvements in the first half. But really looking at our business processes and then the systems that are supporting that business, the CRM system that supports that business which is very different than what we are traditionally used to. It\u2019s much higher volume, lower dollar in absolute terms relative to the EDA and IT business. ","Those are two examples of the sort of the things that we are looking at, but you can see in some ways they are big heavy lifts in terms of creating the infrastructure, but they are appropriate things that you would want to do in terms of scaling the business from where we are today at $3 billion to the next level of ambition. ","Aart de Geus","Yeah, so maybe I can comment a little bit going back to, I forget exactly if it's two or three quarters ago when we communicated to you that we had essentially executed on a multiyear investments push with a number of acquisitions, specifically creating the Software Integrity Group, but also a number of pushes on the tool side and in broadening our IP portfolio.","So we are continuing on all these investments because I think we invested in the right direction and things are looking quite good there. At the same time, as we communicated to you that we were putting additional emphasis on improving the Ops margin after this round of investment, we are not only looking at all the infrastructure tasks and all the processes as Trac mentioned, but literally going through every business and looking at, so which products have higher potential, which areas in the world or areas with customers need an additional emphasis or can be slightly reduced, and even what verticals are of interest and we've done very well for example in the automotive side, but there may be others that we could consider. And so it is actually a long list of a lot of fine tuning, but the fine tuning does have an impact. ","As to the openings, I do think that we have a very large number of openings at this point in time. They do change from time to time also because business units revisits where the needs are, how these have evolved, which position has been filled, what are we looking for and they also move a little bit from geography to geography as a function of the situation. ","So I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything abnormal in that, but I think we are very serious and well organized to keep pushing on the ops margin and if you have watched the result in the last few quarters you should at least get an inkling that we're heading in the right direction. ","Jay Vleeschhouwer ","Thank you. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Pacific Crest. Please go ahead. ","Jason Celino","Hi, can you guys hear me? ","Aart de Geus","Yes. ","Jason Celino","Staying on the margins topic, you know even your semi and systems operating margins increased by 30 bips quarter-over-quarter. How should we think about you know linearity of those margins. I appreciate your comments on the variability of the other segment, but how should we look at the core margins? ","Trac Pham","You know, as you look on a multiyear basis you should see a steady progression from where we were last year to where we want to be in 2021, which is the high 20s. You will see a steady progression towards that. On a quarter-to-quarter basis it can be very highly variable, very lumpy give the mix of the business that we shipped up, particularly quarter or the contracts that are in play that quarter, but overall you see that trend on an upward trajectory. ","Jason Celino","Okay, and then relative the new ZeBu 4 product, you said you are getting some good feedback from customers, can you maybe provide some more color around that? ","Aart de Geus","Sure, you know one of the key capabilities of the ZeBu 4 is (NYSE:A) that it is faster and (NYSE:B) that it can do much larger capacity and the fact that you can really scale your capacity as required by the needs of the customer. ","Lastly the cost per computation is the lowest on the market and so that makes one attractive solution. It\u2019s actually a solution that has also found some really hairy problems to solve, such as can you start running software on hardware that you don't have yet. In other words, can you virtualize your designs, can you implement them in an emulator before you actually have to silicon and that is turning out to be both a very challenging problem, but one that we are well equipped for. ","So we are very encouraged where this is going and if nothing else, we've also seen in the last few quarters that we are broadening the number of customers that are intrigued or that actually have started to use this. ","Jason Celino","Great, thanks! ","Operator","And our next question comes from Gal Munda from Berenberg Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Francois Yoshida-Are","Hi, this is actually Francois on for Gal. I just wanted to revisit the China contracts that you said was on hold. We were just wondering how long do you think that would be on hold, and then as a follow-up you mentioned how system companies are driving software verification are these customers purchasing hardware as well or is that not necessarily for the complexity of their designs?","Trac Pham","Our guidance is focused on FY \u201919. So the range in particular in the lower end reflects the possibility that the restrictions are in effect for the rest of the year. In the event that does change the then you would expect it to be on the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance.","Aart de Geus","Regarding your question on prototyping, most customers if not all really use both, meaning that, let me say it differently, the people that use hardware invariably also use the software, because that's typically how they got to know us in the first place. For smaller problems you try to get as far along as you can on the software and once the speed is woefully inadequate and the complexity has grown, that's where people go and start using the hardware to get much faster results and we have multiple evaluations on that theme by the way. ","So, the other comment I would make is that now its one thing to do very, very fast simulations. It's another thing to actually diagnose what happens when something goes wrong and so that's where the debugging is extremely important and we have a very, very powerful set of software debugging capabilities that work with both our software simulator and with the emulators. ","Francois Yoshida-Are","Okay, great. And what's the length of those kinds of contracts? ","Trac Pham","Our duration in general is typically three years, it runs around three years. ","Francois Yoshida-Are","Okay, and then I just had one more on your Polaris platform. Is that platform completely built in and if not what's left to be integrated and what is the roadmap for completion and how should we think about that for the benefit to your margins?","Aart de Geus","Okay, let me take one step back and say what is the platform all about. Well the platform is all about, to let software developers use really a multiplicity of tools that can detect a variety of quality and security issues as you develop the code. And so you have to realize that it's a little bit more than a year ago that we actually acquired one of the bigger pieces of our product and so the objective for this year and it turned out it was early in the spring this year, was to have the first version of the Polaris platform that aims at bringing all of our products together including by the way some services through that platform also.","What we have to-date that some customers have already purchased is the platform with the first set of tools and Coverity was the first set of tools that is on there. As we now progress through the next 12 to 18 months, more and more of our tools will become available.","The last comment about this is that, why is this particularly relevant for the larger companies, because a if you were you know the seesaws [ph] or the head of IT in a large company you have a lot of challenges around security. And of course for each challenge there are 10 different companies that have some miracle cure and a while we do not participate in many of these remedial situations, what we intend to provide is the best development environment that can constantly diagnose and early indicate issues so that the development is better in the first place.","And for that the ITs, heads of ITs or seesaws would rather have one trusted broader partner as long as \u201cthe stuff works together\u201d and that's so easily said and so difficult to do, and this is why we are so excited about Polaris platform, because we are making things work together really well. And of course we have you know 25 years of lessons learned from EDA on how to do that and now we are applying all of these lessons to the Software Integrity space. ","Francois Yoshida-Are","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019ll turn it back over to the host for any closing remarks.","Aart de Geus","Sure, let me start by apologizing on the static, while we don't hear any of that, so you've been loud and clear to us. I hope that the messaging at least that came across and if nothing else, we all understand that there's a quite a bit of noise in the market and most of those things there's no control we can have over that situation. ","But in general, our business has been strong in the first two quarters of the year. Is looking good for Q3 and so we are continuing on per terms on our trajectory and we appreciate all the interest that you had in this earnings release. Have a good afternoon! ","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"19942":["Synopsys, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. We delivered revenue of $542 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.80. We entered into a $180 million accelerated share buyback program to repurchase stock. We are on-track to meeting our operating cash flow goal of approximately $450 million for the year. We are raising our revenue target to $2.195 billion to $2.235 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS objective to a range of $2.75 to $2.80, the midpoint of which represents double-digit growth. Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly.","Looking at the economic landscape around us, I would characterize both the macro and semiconductor environments as solid. The overall economic outlook remains stable, with levels of caution that vary by geography.","For semiconductors, which had a strong 2014 with about 10% growth, the outlook for 2015 is positive, albeit with the usual early year trepidations driven by a very competitive market.","The impact of semiconductors continues to grow, not only in the traditional computation and mobile communication areas, but increasingly in every aspect of our daily life, including health, automotive, and financial segments. With this unstoppable evolution of the electronics market, the relentless drive for smaller and lower-power transistors continues unabated.","Its corollary, much more complex chips that integrate complete systems, including rapidly mounting embedded software content, continues to drive our and our customers' business.","The number of designs using power-efficient FinFET transistors at sizes as small as 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, and 10 nanometer is growing at a fast pace. At the same time, the cost and time-to-market pressures can make or break a product cycle. For our customers, this puts great emphasis on partnering with vendors who can not only provide the best tools, but who also collaborate intensely to ensure product success.","Synopsys is uniquely positioned to be just that partner, and in fact has demonstrated time and again our value as an integral part of their success.","One such partner, one of the most important wireless IC companies in the world, expanded its relationship with us in Q1. As they develop their next-generation of products and plan their requirements for the next several years, they'll count on close collaboration and the leverage of a larger portfolio of Synopsys tools across digital and analog\/mixed signal, design, and verification.","In 2014, we launched a multi-year Silicon to Software market strategy, predicated on three pillars. First, build on our leadership in EDA with the clear objective to provide the state-of-the-art toolset required to design the next generations of chips. Second, grow our IP offering as one of the highest-impact productivity mechanisms available to design highly complex chips under unrelenting time-to-market constraints. And third, invest in and grow our Software Quality and Security solutions, as embedded software expands massively into next-generation electronic systems, and the vulnerabilities of application software create more and more challenges in our day-to-day lives.","We enter Q2 with confidence in our business due to our position and expertise ranging from deep silicon to sophisticated software; our comprehensive product portfolio utilized today by the most influential semi and systems companies; a global technical support team widely recognized as the best in the world; and a predictable business model that enables us to invest consistently to advance technology, while simultaneously driving long-term shareholder value.","Let me now provide some highlights for the past quarter, starting with EDA. As the acknowledged technology leader at advanced nodes, Synopsys is deeply engaged in our customers' efforts, ranging from early process development, to chip design, to system verification. The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date grew nearly 15% in just the last quarter, to almost 200. The breadth of our FinFET proven tools and IP gives us a notable competitive advantage, as evidenced by Synopsys being relied on for approximately 95% of these designs. At the very bleeding edge, we're engaged in numerous 10 nanometer partnerships with early adopters, and we're the go-to partner for 10 nanometer process development.","Through our TCAD technology, we're already collaborating with silicon providers and research consortia such as IMEC on 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer. As a result of these early-stage collaborations, we have access to key models much earlier in the process than our competitors, giving us a sustainable advantage.","Our relentless innovation in verification, both digital and analog\/mixed-signal, is evident as well. Our flagship VCS functional verification product is the primary simulator for 80% of advanced designs.","In 2014, we began rolling out game-changing new products that are driving a multi-year upgrade cycle in both design and verification. The single most important EDA tool launch in the last decade was IC Compiler II. Announced last March, and which delivers, we claimed at that time, an astonishing 10X improvement in throughput. Now with more than 50 engagements, our productivity claims are being confirmed again and again, and we're now systematically helping customers proliferate IC Compiler II into their production flows.","During the quarter, Renesas stated in a press release that they, \"view ICC II as a key enabler of competitive differentiation, and are in the process of extending its application to all key in-flight programs across 40 nanometer to 28 nanometer and below.\" Another advanced customer commented that, while the speed-up itself is impressive, the impact when combined with its larger capacity is that it opens the door to fundamentally changing the very way in which design is done. That is why we refer to it as a game changer in the industry.","At this point, IC Complier II has already delivered a rapidly growing number of successful tape-outs, and we see high demand across our customer base.","In verification, our objectives are just as ambitious. We're executing on a Verification Continuum vision that integrates best-in-class hardware and software engines aimed at radically impacting verification and debugging productivity.","In 2014, we released the first set of capabilities in our Verification Compiler product, which combines all our software-based verification tools. Demand and initial adoption have been excellent. We're now broadening our integration to encompass both software and hardware-based verification engines. As we're fortunate to have both the fastest engines and the number one position in a majority of the verification areas, tight integration will drive substantial productivity increases for our customers.","This has enormous value to them as they struggle with chip and system complexities compounded by hardware-software interactions. The early results are truly excellent and throughout 2015, we'll roll out key capabilities that position us well over the next several years.","Our strong ecosystem partnerships with the leading foundries and key IP providers are also critical in supporting our mutual customers. For example, last month, ARM and Synopsys announced support for ARM's new Cortex-A72 processor for mobile SoC development. The reference flow includes a range of Synopsys tools, including our powerful IC Compiler II product.","Let me move to our second strategic priority of growing our IP and Prototyping product lines. Demand for IP is strong, as more and more companies outsource standards-based, yet complex, IP blocks. Synopsys is the number one supplier of interface, analog, memory, and physical semiconductor IP, bolstered by a reputation for highest quality, reliability, and technical excellence.","We are increasingly at the forefront of process viability as our IP is a vital enabler of the commercial introduction of new technology nodes, be it the most advanced FinFET processes or those targeting the Internet of Things.","We've taped out more than 30 FinFET chips, and the silicon results look very good across the board. We secured a large, strategic win for a broad set of 10 nanometer IP blocks, and also delivered our first 10 nanometer embedded memory IP, all indicative of our momentum.","In addition, we are the very first IP provider of a USB 3.1 controller. This new generation of USB has great promise; it's twice as fast as USB 3.0, and more power efficient. Imagine the impact of such improvements in your daily use of your mobile devices.","As you know, the software content on those mobile devices is huge and growing. The design challenges are significant, and it's become necessary to adopt an approach that enables software development to occur at the same time as the chip design, thereby speeding time-to-market by six to nine months.","Our HAPS FPGA-based prototyping solution does just that, and has proven itself in the marketplace. Q1 was its highest revenue quarter ever, and with more than 5,000 HAPS systems installed at customers today, we have excellent momentum.","Turning now to Strategic Priority number three, expand our presence in software quality and security by building on the excellent Coverity Solutions we acquired last year. In this new market space that analysts expect to grow in the 20% range, we see our opportunity in three primary areas. One, accelerate adoption in the directly adjacent embedded software market segment, which covers software embedded on a chip, or electronic system. Two, accelerate adoption in the largely untapped enterprise-applications market segment that reaches industries from financial to health, energy, retail, social media, et cetera. And three, enlarge the portfolio by investing in new languages, and further expanding in the security space.","The Coverity integration of infrastructure and sales has gone well, and our initial financial expectations are on track. We saw 32 new logos in the quarter, and executed an important agreement with a large, U.S. energy company, which expanded its usage after good initial success. This customer values not only the excellent technology, but also the stability and resources of the larger Synopsys entity.","In summary, we are confident and optimistic about our business. We delivered strong results in Q1, and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. We see high demand for our compelling new technologies in core EDA, which will drive a multi-year upgrade cycle. Our ever-expanding portfolio of IP and momentum in FPGA prototyping are driving strong IP and systems growth.","And finally, we're making good progress in our new, higher-growth software quality and security space.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Building on a strong foundation in 2014, we're starting this year with great momentum. Our excellent Q1 financial results and improved 2015 outlook leaves us increasingly confident in our ability to execute our strategy for growth and profitability. In Q1, we met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets we provided in December, posted double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings, and accelerated our stock buyback program.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q1 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 13% to $542 million. Greater than 90% of Q1 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.4 years, but we expect the full year duration to be approximately 3 years.","Q1 total GAAP costs and expenses were $471 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $403 million, below our target range, due largely to a shift in timing of expenses, including some delayed hiring, as well as lower travel and professional services. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 25.7%.","GAAP earnings per share were $0.41. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.80, above our target range due largely to a lower tax rate and timing of expenses.","Non-GAAP tax rate was 13.4%, due mostly to the reinstatement of the federal R&D tax credit for 2014. The Q1 tax rate includes both a retroactive benefit for fiscal 2014 and a partial year impact to fiscal 2015. As a result, we think a non-GAAP tax rate between 19% and 20% is a reasonable estimate for 2015.","Turning to cash flow. As expected, Q1 had a net operating cash outflow. The $87 million outflow was due mostly to the timing of 2014 incentive compensation payments, along with one-time severance payments related to our voluntary retirement program and other restructuring. We continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $450 million.","We ended the quarter with total debt of $303 million. This includes $235 million from our revolver, drawn during the quarter to largely fund our Q1 share repurchases, and $68 million from our term loan.","During the quarter, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement, or ASR, for $180 million. This was part of our goal to keep share count roughly flat with 2014 levels. Under this ASR, we received 3.3 million shares in Q1, and expect to receive the balance by Q3 when the ASR is completed. We have $200 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, of $917 million, with 13% onshore. We'll continue to optimize the use of cash to generate maximum long-term shareholder value. Each quarter we will evaluate our M&A, buyback, and debt reduction options, to determine the best balance.","DSO was 49 days and we ended Q1 with approximately 9,300 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies.","Now to our second quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the second quarter, our targets are revenue between $543 million and $553 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $470 million and $489 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $418 million and $428 million; other income between $0 million and $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 22% to 23%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.33 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.62 to $0.64 per share.","For fiscal 2015, we are increasing our revenue target to $2.195 billion to $2.235 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 9%; we expect other income between $5 million and $9 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%; outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million; GAAP earnings of $1.41 to $1.50 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $89 million in stock-based compensation expense; we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings to a range of $2.75 to $2.80 per share, which represents double-digit growth at the mid-point; capital expenditures of approximately $100 million; and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.","Finally, to help in your modeling, second half revenue is expected to be slightly higher than first half revenue, with Q4 the largest revenue quarter. We expect total non-GAAP expenses to be skewed slightly toward the second half of the year, with non-GAAP EPS increasing sequentially from Q2 to Q4.","In summary, Q1 was a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent financial results, highlighted by double-digit top and bottom-line growth and solid operating margin. We are also increasing revenue and EPS guidance for the year, reflecting the confidence and optimism we have for the business.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from the line of Rich Valera from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Aart, I was wondering if you'd be willing to comment on the competitive dynamics in the EDA industry, particularly, I guess in digital, as you probably know your largest competitor is talking about gaining share in digital and has increased their expenses pretty significantly this year to support those share gains. So just wanted to get your sense if, are you seeing any changes in the competitive landscape and do you think you need to change your level of investment to address these changes to the degree you're seeing them? Thanks.","Aart de Geus","Thank you. No, we don't see any big changes nothing that you're telling me is not age-old EDA, this has always been a very competitive landscape. And we are in the fortunate situation of specifically in the digital side, we have some really fabulous products that has been rolled out and that are now gradually being distributed to customers. So that brings with it that there is quite a bit of support effort to help them move on to the new project and so on. So we will be very, very busy from that perspective, this is an intense time, but it's an intense time with a very good outlook given the quality of the products that we have.","Rich Valera","I know you'd be willing to comment on share gains specifically but give the ICC II ramp that you're expecting, would you be willing to even qualitatively talk about your thoughts on share as you move out over the next couple of years, I mean your ability to at least maintain your share in digital with that ICC II ramp in front of you?","Aart de Geus","Well our objective is to clearly grow it. At the same time, we're enough to know that for many years I've said that EDA is the industry where all the children are always above average, and all the share gains are above average. And so yes, there are many claims always being made. At the end of the day it is what are the results over long period of time.","The second thing is many of the contracts that we have of course are very complex and very large. And so these things change gradually, but there is no question that with the strong technology we have an excellent shot at moving forward step-by-step and so far it looks like that's working out fine.","Rich Valera","Great. And just one product question if I could on Verification Compiler, you alluded to some enhancements you're expecting to incorporate into that in this year. Any color you're willing to give us in advance of those actually being announced?","Aart de Geus","Sure, just to clarify, so Verification Compiler was actually a product we introduced last year.","Rich Valera","Right.","Aart de Geus","And it was the integration of all the software verification tools and the benefit of having that integration was immediately higher productivity for the customer. But also the possibility for designers to quickly move from one type of product needed to another in that context.","Our longer-term and much broader ambition has been to establish a Verification Continuum that reaches much broader space, including the various forms of hardware verification tools and even something beyond that. And so that is been the focus at least for our R&D teams for the last year. There is the results that I've seen are truly outstanding and during the year we will gradually announce those as we're ready to make them available to customers.","Rich Valera","Great. And I'm sorry one more, because I just thought of that, you mentioned HAPS, I think had a strongest quarter in history I believe --","Aart de Geus","Yes.","Rich Valera","It's history since you've had it at least. What do you attribute that to? Is there something secular going on there or is it, what are your thoughts on the kind of prototyping market and how that looks going forward?","Aart de Geus","The answer is actually very simple. You remember you would certainly know 10 years ago, there was this term that was new system on a chip --","Rich Valera","Sure.","Aart de Geus","We're completely there. System on a chip means it's a hardware piece with a bulk load of software. And the challenge with that is of course that the software guys would like to start modeling and trying out their software before the chips are ready.","And so be it individual chips or in some cases even broader systems off chips, those are being modeled on the HAPS boards, and the benefit of the HAPS boards is that they are amazingly fast in run time, and that is absolutely key if you want to drive some software where the speed is relevant in terms of testing it. And so that is the simple reason why we see that and I think that will continue.","Rich Valera","That's great. Thanks Aart, I appreciate it.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome, Rich.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys, wanted to start with the upfront revenue, when you guided for the quarter, had you contemplated this level of upfront revenue as part of the mix and what was the driver?","Trac Pham","Yes, Sterling, this is Trac. The revenue came in as expected in total as well as the various line items. Certainly the upfront revenues were strong and that was due to a strong hardware quarter primarily the HAPS side.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And how should we think about the mix of upfront? Because on a percentage basis this is the highest percent in recent memory, is it going to continue at this level or fluctuate?","Trac Pham","Yes, upfronts will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. I think upfronts will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Our model for upfronts remains at 10% or less.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And then turning to sales and marketing, you mentioned the shift in spending and hiring, can you give us a sense of how many heads you were anticipating hiring in the quarter that may have shifted to the second quarter?","Trac Pham","You can see that the headcount did decrease from Q4 to Q1. A large portion of that was due to the voluntary retirement program and the small layoff we had, but also the delayed hiring.","Sterling Auty","Okay. How would you characterize? Because one of the things is duration down to 2.4, sales and marketing down seasonally more than expected, and you're giving us some transparency. I want to make sure that we get a good handle. You're not going to give us the bookings number but these are the things that we kind of use to triangulate to whether it was a good bookings quarter or a challenging one and these items are kind of pointing to challenging in terms of the duration and expenses. Anything else you can give us in terms of transparency to the top two, how much of that were these items and versus the health of the bookings in the quarter?","Trac Pham","Well I would say that Q1 came in as we expected across our business segments, all of our business metrics. The run rate was up, the duration was light at 2.4 for the quarter, but we expected to trend back to three years for the full year, didn't see anything unusual in the business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tom Diffely from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. So may be first Trac, when you look at the $0.18 upside in the quarter, it looks like back of the envelope calculations here that $0.10, $0.12 came from lower costs and $0.06, $0.08 from lower taxes, does that sound about right?","Trac Pham","I would say it's more about half of that was taxes about $0.08.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And so the increase in the full-year guidance is largely due to the tax?","Trac Pham","Yes, so when you look at, I'm sorry. When you look at Q1 there is really three things happening revenues came in as expected, the upside was really on lower tax rate; two, higher than expected other income; and then, three, the shifting of expenses. And as I said $0.08 of that is roughly the tax rate.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And what is your current view of the FX impact during the quarter and what you project might be a headwind or tailwind going forward?","Trac Pham","Yes, I mean that's a really good question considering the variability and FX this year. Let me just step back and say that we do have a hedging program in place to protect our financials both the P&L and the balance sheet from that volatility. From a P&L perspective, our goal is to protect the annual EPS from any FX movements.","On the revenue line, our revenues are invoiced in dollars except for Japan, which last year was roughly 12%, we do hedge that revenue. On expenses, we got about a third in local currency and that's hedged as well. So what you see on a net-net basis is that FX had an immaterial impact on our bottom-line year-over-year.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then Aart, when you look at the IP market, how do you view the market when we move from the plainer world to maybe 40 nanometer FinFET and then ultimately 10 nanometer FinFET. Does the IP market itself increase dramatically from those steps?","Aart de Geus","For us it will. And the reason is that what that means is that building the IP is actually substantially more difficult. So much so that's a number of people that are introducing a new technology can only do that if simultaneously to a number of other things, a substantial amount of IP is ready to go, otherwise people can't design chips. And given that, for that we're now extremely well versed and literally the smallest sizes of FinFET technology, especially in our IP team, I think we're well positioned to become more and more of a backbone provider to the industry.","It's also one of the reasons why we collaborate very closely with the foundries and other technology providers, because if we work with them ahead of time we can sort of see where the technology is going, what the problems are going to be, and invariably even when the technology is introduced it goes through quite a number of iterations and lot of refinements and improvements for yield and our team is all over that.","Tom Diffely","Okay, that's nice. And then finally when you look at the 50 plus engagements with IC Compiler II, at this point can you tell what impact of this new product that's 10 times faster has on the market size, is it shrinking the market because it's so much faster or is it actually potentially growing the market because it can do a lot more or enable a lot more?","Aart de Geus","The -- its always amazing, even at 10 times faster too it will not shrink the market for very simple reason which is, the first thing that customers do is, well I can do bigger things now, and I can do them sooner, and I can be more competitive. And so it's a little bit like introducing the next race car on the market immediately the races become even more intense and that is what IC Compiler does right now.","Secondly, one should not underestimate how much chip complexity has grown in just the last four, five years. And you may recall that number of years ago I was very bullish on the impact of FinFET going forward at the time where it was not quite clear that the technology would make it. It is very clear that it's making it now and it's also very clear that the combination of lower power smaller devices will have impact on many chips.","Initially it's all on the more complex chips; gradually it will become necessary even for the things that will end up in Internet of Things type product, so a lot of opportunity there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks, good evening. Aart, question for you first on IC Compiler II. To the extent that is sees good uptake, which you say you are in fact seeing, could there be as well a pull-through effect on other Synopsis tools whether or not they've been as architecturally overhauled as the implementation product has been, I'm thinking for instance, specifically of Design Compiler, PrimeTime, perhaps some others. So we've seen sometimes the areas of technology that one product does well it starts to pull other products in the company's portfolio along as well. So are you seeing something like that at all?","Aart de Geus","Well, we're in a fortunate situation that in many of the situations our customers do already have the products that you mentioned. And there is no doubts that after many years of work, we have architected our tools in such a fashion that if you use them in combination, you will get better results, than if you sort of use the smorgasbord of independent tool and so from that perspective alone that's been a positive.","Secondly, there is question that some tools tend to be more anchor point product. And so when renewal of contracts happen, it tends to bring up the question well what else should negotiated at that time, can we grow the contract, or can we become a broader provider and the answer is more often than not, yes. So all in all this is a good position to be in, having said that, there is competition and we have to battle for every opportunity and that is what customer needs in order to get the best tools.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","On the call a quarter ago you announced of course the management change involving Trac and self, and Brian, could you remind us of the internal changes you've made to align yourselves towards the changes in the customer base, the systems companies, and how that mix is evolving for you new vertical markets you're addressing this is not a Coverity specific question per se, but clearly you've to do things differently or align things differently inside the company, so could you remind us what you've done organizationally to prepare for an evolving end market?","Aart de Geus","Well the end market that has gradually become bit more systems dominated is not a new phenomenon. I think about 40% of our revenue comes from systems companies, the rest come from chip companies. And so we've been there for a long time.","Your question is interesting nonetheless because more and more we're seeing that the software content that plays into many of chips or the systems becomes actually the differentiator for our customers, and sometimes it's also the negative differentiator meaning when it doesn't work away when it's not ready. And so from that perspective, I think we will see a gradual increase on first the verification tools around the whole hardware software. And obviously the acquisition of Coverity was to then open up new horizon towards the software period and they are there still a lot of open space.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","And one more product question for you and then last financial question for Trac. Rich and Sterling asked earlier about the HAPS business, my question there is, is there an analogy here at all in terms of the evolution of the market as we saw with emulation. So as you know of course that market was around for a long time, but wasn't very large, didn't really do very much until just the last few years and now we've seen it grow to fairly sustainable size and on the whole it's had pretty good growth, not every vendor every year, necessarily. Is there any reason to believe that the much smaller prototyping business could now be seen perhaps some similar kind of inflection for similar reasons over the next number of years?","Aart de Geus","I think in general your thinking is correct. I find it's relatively difficult to predict what the speed of that will be. And the reason I'm saying that is the difference between HAPS boards and emulators is that the HAPS boards, now they do look a little bit like a science project, I mean you've to pluck in a lot of wires and there's lot of mechanism to actually get the software into the chips just the right way. And now of course the people that do this are hyper sophisticated doing it. And I think the utilization will increase. How quickly it will go a little hard to tell but there's no question that the problem that is addressing is absolutely growing.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. And then lastly for Trac, could you elaborate on why you would not have raised the cash flow guidance for the year on the higher GAAP net income outlook for the year. And more broadly when you look at over the next number of years and operating cash flow, free cash flow, besides net income and deferred revenue, what other principal levers do you foresee in terms of being able to meaningfully inflect or grow your working capital and overall cash flow?","Trac Pham","Okay. So I think I'll start with the first one, which is our cash flow guidance, Jay understood that. So we are confirming our cash flow guidance of $450 million. If I understand your question you raised revenue and EPS and why does cash flow stay the same?","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yes.","Trac Pham","Yes, so it's early in the year cash flow tends to be one of the more difficult parts of our business to predict. Keep in mind, last year, as you recall we end up overachieving on our guidance by $100 million just to highlight how variable that can be long-term though. We are definitely very comfortable with -- we're comfortable with our guidance of $450 million for the year and we're certainly comfortable with our long-term trend on cash flows.","I think if you ask what's going to drive that over the long-term, it does track EBITDA less cash taxes over time. So we continue to drive top-line growth and drive operating margins to the mid-20s you will see our cash flows trend with that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I actually joined a little late so I apologize if it has been asked. Kind of curious you started from the digital side now that cadence seems to be stepping up on the gas putting some customer investments. Can you just frame the situation in digital and what you're doing to contract it; I've got a follow-up after that?","Aart de Geus","Yes, we commented early about that. The digital area is very interesting for us because we have, as you know, introduced some very powerful products specifically IC Complier II. And so we're massively engaged with a large number of customers already in a) improving that the technology is as good as we said it would be, and so far, every piece of feedback has been absolutely in tune with what we predicted originally. And then helping them gradually design it in as they have many chips that are in-flight as we would say, and you -- when it is always very careful with introducing new products, and it takes some handholding.","So that is what we're focusing on and we see that as an opportunity to grow our share and to really work with customers on a very close partnership basis for the coming years.","Krish Sankar","That's really helpful, Art. As a follow-up trying to figure out the status of the emulation product with Eve, and in the past you've said that one of the applications you'd been using your product was more of a software wrapping rather than a true emulation potential. Kind of curious when you look forward, do you feel that the product cycle lifetime for emulation needs to come down from the typical four to five year cadence or do you think your strategy right now you have is the right one still?","Aart de Geus","In our field anything that can bring down the product cycle is a good thing. It's always amazing to me that after literally 50 years in this year, of Moore's Law, this continues exponential increasing complexity is being met with new tools, new products, and this is in verification, it is in implementation and so on, and of course emulation or HAPS boards or some of the virtual prototyping are very central to this.","The one new twist to all of this is that now on top of this well-understood Moore's Law, you get all this embedded software and that brings a degree of complexity that is going to be a very difficult to keep at high quality and to verify and to get ready.","On the other hand, that's exactly the type of job that we love we've been chasing that type of increasing complexity for many, many years. So be it emulation, be it rapid prototyping, be it virtual prototyping, or other techniques, all of these always welcome yesterday, and our team is non-stop raising forward to improve them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just first, where you -- you've now created your yearly guidance by as much as you did your Q1 EPS estimates and you just kind of walk us through that?","Trac Pham","Q1 was good quarter and we did increase our annual EPS guidance to a range of $2.75 million to $2.80 million. As I can remind you, the majority of the overachievement was due to expense timing and non-operational items that's the tax rate and higher other income.","And we're trying to strike the right balance between the overachievement and investments in the business. Investments per our plan, we see a lot of opportunities in IP, software quality, and security, and even and in our new EDA solutions. So we want to make sure that we're balanced for it.","And I think one thing also keep in mind as you look at the guidance that we just provided at the midpoint we'll continue to increase operating margins by about 100 basis points year-over-year.","Monika Garg","Okay. And then, Aart, you talked about semi industry grew like 10% last year, grew high-single-digit before that but the core EDA growth rate which you have talked about is still 3% or 4%. Do you think EDA growth at least starts to come closer to semi industry growth?","Aart de Geus","Well just to be clear semiconductor industry goes up and down rather violently. And if I look at my numbers, I would say that the average semiconductor growth rate is probably around 4.2% to 4.5% right now if you look at it from a multiyear perspective. So in that sense EDA actually is pretty close to the customers and not that all that different. Overall EDA over many years has out executed semiconductors, but when the semiconductors have a great year, they worry about the bad year, and when they have a bad year, they worry, and so it's an industry that is always raising forward.","Monika Garg","Okay. I have a question on Coverity, previously you talked about Coverity expected to be credit second half this year, that is still the target, and Coverity was going kind of 20% plus which you talked before, is that -- is it still the growth rate you're expecting and seeing for that business?","Aart de Geus","Yes. So we're still on target for a breakeven in the second half. And the other thing we said is that we would be over $100 million in 2016 and so far things look good.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. So one quick question on your product revenues, you talked about system revenue as record, and do you report that under IP and system is that the reason that number is so high?","Trac Pham","You mean, why are we reporting IP and systems together.","Mahesh Sanganeria","No, no I'm just conforming that that is the case, that you prototyping revenue IP and systems?","Trac Pham","Yes, it is correct. We are reporting those together. The trailing 12-months growth was actually quite high. And but you may also remember from last year that IP goes up and down quite a bit. And we've said that the IP is double-digit growth on a multiyear basis. And the reason for that is that the nature of that business, the fact that they're often milestones attached to deliverables and we said last year that this would be a good year and so far it looks like it is.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. So one question on the 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer from the foundries and from the semi companies we're hearing lot of change in the timing and pushing out, pushing in, are you seeing a different kind of behavior on migration to 20 nanometer and 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer considered that we have different set of players on the foundry and side and also on the product side, if you can compare it to the previous years, I mean design transitions that would be helpful?","Aart de Geus","Sure. Let me distinguish something which is let me take the whole grouping of 28 nanometer and higher, and then 20 nanometer as an individual node, and then the FinFET category somewhat actually have 22 nanometer, 16 nanometer, 14 nanometer, and 10 nanometer. The 20 nanometer node is really little bit of an off-duck and TSMC have been successful with that. But we have predicted already a longtime ago that it would probably be a node that would not see a lot of utilization; because once the vision to FinFET is established and that's the yields look good enough people will rapidly move there. That appears to be the case.","At the same time for all the people that don't want to cross the bridge to FinFET 28 nanometer will be a node that will be utilized massively for a quite longtime. And so that sort of the way we look at it a little bit which is 28 nanometer is sort of the one side of the bridge with plainer transistors, 16 nanometer is really the other side of the bridge with FinFETs, and then from there you go on to smaller dimension.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. And one more question related to that, but really further looking we know that the FinFET enabled the Moore's Law beyond 20 nanometer, and there is already a talk about FinFET probably be sufficient for may be a couple of generation and then it will another transistor structure change, a material change. Do you have the -- do you want that that we have to change the material structure very soon or this can take you few for few generations?","Aart de Geus","Well our sense is that so this can go for a few generations right now. At the same time we are fields where relentless and ingenuity is a necessity to overcome the intricacy of very, very small physic. So at some point of time the very nature of the transistor will change again.","It's always fascinating to me to remember that not that many years ago, I'm taking six or seven years ago, many people said FinFET will never work, and here we are. And so by the way the term Moore's Law of course is by now more of a concept than an actual exact law because the economics with these type of chips are changing a bit, but there's no question that the opportunity of fabulous products as we move to smaller transistors is still very, very appealing.","Mahesh Sanganeria","Okay. That's very helpful, Art. Thank you very much.","Aart de Geus","You're welcome.","Operator","And at this time there are no further questions.","Aart de Geus","In that case, thank you very much for attending our first quarter's earnings release so we had good results, and we feel confident about the year, and we have a lot of work to do to finish the year. Thank you very much. Have a good rest of the day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available for replay after 4 o'clock Pacific Time today through March 4.

[Operator Instructions] Today's call will last 1 hour. 5 minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Kathy. Good afternoon, everyone. With us on the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Brian Beattie, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin our remarks this afternoon, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during this call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2012, and our earnings release for the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.","All financial information to be discussed on this conference call, the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the current report on Form 8-K that we filed today, our second quarter earnings release and our financial supplement. All of these items are currently available on our website at www.synopsys.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus","Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm pleased to report excellent Q2 results, very rapid progress on the integration of Magma Design Automation and raise guidance for fiscal year 2012.","Let me begin with a financial summary. Our business in Q2 was strong across all metrics with revenue of $433 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.53, which includes $0.01 of dilution from Magma that was not included in our previous guidance range. For the year, we are raising our outlook based on increased visibility and confidence and the progress made on the Magma integration to a range of $2.03 to $2.07.","From the perspective of our long-term financial management, you may recall that in 2010, we communicated to you a high single-digit EPS growth objective based on 5 pillars: One, organic revenue growth in core EDA of low to mid-single-digits; two, double-digit organic revenue growth in IP and systems; three, continued M&A; four, efficient allocation of resources; and five, keeping share count roughly flat at approximately 150 million shares.","Clearly, we continue to deliver against these objectives and are already well on track to achieve double-digit EPS growth again this year. We will provide 2013 guidance in our December earnings release, but I will say already now that our objective is to achieve high single-digit EPS growth for next year as well.","For the present quarter and year, Brian will provide more financial detail in just a minute. Before addressing the product highlights, let me comment on the current landscape. For as the economic ups and downs are readily visible in the press on a daily basis, the electronics and semiconductor industries are racing forward from a technology point of view. While electronic consumption is staying high, the battle for share among the providers is quite intense, resulting in some consolidation and accelerated push towards the 28-nanometer production of advanced chips and substantial investments into the next generations of technology.","For our industry, this clearly means additional pressure as we support challenged and very competitive customers. But also, a solid landscape of renewals, add-on purchases and emphasis on value selling.","We expect that going forward, customers will rely more on EDA for improved design efficiency and product differentiation, which bodes well for our sustained growth prospects. In that sense, EDA feels healthier than it has been in a number of years.","These analysts are particularly positive for Synopsys. For many years, we have focused on building a set of complete solutions, ranging from system design to chip implementation to manufacturing. In addition, our time-based business model, supported by a substantial multiyear backlog, lets us continually invest in R&D and support in virtually any phase of the economic cycle.","Consequently, it's not surprising that the majority of the state-of-the-art designs are done with Synopsys tools and rely on the skills of our global support teams, which brings me to the highlights for the quarter, starting with our core EDA and manufacturing offerings.","One of the advanced areas in which both stress and excitement are visible on a daily basis, is in the design of processors, graphics and SSE. Clearly, our customers aim to achieve highest performance at lowest power. In this area, Synopsys shines. One example is with Samsung, who completed the first-ever production tape-out of a high-speed ARM Cortex-A15 processor relying exclusively on IC Compiler and Galaxy for physical design.","Simultaneously, the acceleration to 28-nanometer saw the number of active designs and tape-outs grow 15% to 20% this quarter. The vast majority of these use our Galaxy solution. For the even more advanced 20-nanometer node, we estimate that Synopsys is being used in about 80% of designs and tape-outs.","In this context, links to manufacturing become even more important. Our two-pronged strategy features integrating manufacturing elements into design tools for faster and better results and developing manufacturing tools to attack the most difficult challenges at the next advanced processes.","Our Proteus mask synthesis solution, for example, continues to gain share. During the quarter, we announced that Renesas had adopted Proteus LRC for lithography verification. Also in the quarter, we had another major manufacturer adopted Proteus for 20-nanometer.","In parallel to implementation, verification continues to be a crucial part of the design flow with 70% plus of advanced designs from processors to graphics to SSEs being verified using Synopsys. A particular highlight for the quarter was our success in expanding our verification IP offering. We introduced groundbreaking technical advances in this area, yielding competitive wins at several large companies. For example, last week, we announced that AMD had selected Synopsys as its verification IP partner.","Let me briefly also comment on our excellent progress in integrating Magma and working with their customers. In last 90 days since we closed, we integrated all of the teams. While keeping the critical core of technologies and technical support, we're able to recognize considerable expense synergies by eliminating overlapping infrastructure positions. We are progressing swiftly to rationalize facilities and other long-term expenses as well.","Focusing immediately on our joint customers, our combined teams conducted very insightful face-to-face worldwide listening tours. In parallel, our R&D teams that detailed cross-training and analysis to assess where strength could be leveraged on each product line. This week, we started to roll out customized roadmaps to our customers responsive to their stated needs.","From the start, we have been very clear that we will support the former Magma tools to make sure that our customers' projects will not be jeopardized. It is also clear that in a number of areas, there are very good technologies that will integrate with other Synopsys tools, creating even better solutions and providing interesting upgrade opportunities.","We see some of these capabilities becoming available as soon as year end or early next year. Since the roadmap discussions have just started, it's too early to comment on the specifics, but in general, the customer interactions are going very well.","Now to IP, where Synopsys is the second largest vendor in the world leading at interface, memory and analog IP blocks. Given the high time-to-market pressure for most consumer applications, and the enormous number of sophisticated IP blocks used in the key SSE chips, the build versus buy trade-off for IP continues to evolve to the benefit of commercial solutions.","Q2 is another strong business quarter for our IP, and we continue to expand our portfolio both organically and through acquisition. For example, during the quarter, we acquired 10-gigabit SERDES technology from MOSAID, further expanding our high-speed service offering.","With increased attention on the advanced technology nodes, adoption of our IP blocks for advanced 28- and 20-nanometer designs is ramping steadily. We expect Synopsys' IP to continue to be a good driver of growth for us this year.","In systems, our SPGA-based and virtual prototyping product line are doing well also. The ability to accelerate embedded software developments by 6 to 9 months is a compelling value proposition for project managers. Given that most prototyping systems are still built in-house today, we see increased outsourcing to commercial solutions from Synopsys as the driver of growth here as well.","Bringing IP and system solutions together, last month, we introduced the Soundwave Audio Subsystem, a complete, integrated hardware and software audio IP subsystem for system-on-chip designs. This first of its kind solution is designed to save customers years of integration and verification effort and supports popular audio standards such as Dolby, SRS and DTS.","Overall, be it in low power design, in complex system verification or in sophisticated IP reuse, all of our products are supported by a worldwide team of experts that our customers greatly rely on for their differentiation and success.","Before I conclude, let me briefly comment on today's announcement that Chi-Foon Chan has been appointed to join me as co-CEO. Many of you know that Chi-Foon and I have been working in this matter for over a decade, and while this is formal recognition of the success we've had in co-leading the company into his present leadership position, there are no major changes in structure or responsibilities.","I will continue as Chairman and CEO, being the main face to Wall Street, and Chi-Foon will continue as President and co-CEO shouldering much of the operational responsibilities for the company. I'm extremely pleased that we are recognizing Chi-Foon's hard work and talent in this way. I look forward to together conceive and drive the next phase of growth of Synopsys.","In summary, we delivered excellent Q2 results and are raising yearly guidance based on both intrinsic strength in our base business and the addition of Magma. The environment for EDA and Synopsys is robust and demand for our technology is strong. We're making rapid progress in integrating Magma and expect to deliver even better technology going forward.","I'll now call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian M. Beattie","Well, thank you, Aart, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with our guidance for Q3 and the full year.","In this first quarter following our recent Magma acquisition, I will also address the related Q2 financial impacts and will outline the revenue trends of the Magma business leading into FY '13. Going forward, we will not be breaking out the impact of Magma as the company has become fully integrated. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise.","Now Synopsys delivered an excellent quarter, highlighted by strong business levels, double-digit growth in both revenue and non-GAAP earnings and considerable free cash flow generation. Additionally, we are raising our full year outlook for revenue, non-GAAP earnings and operating cash flow.","Let me now provide some additional detail on our financials. Total revenue was $433 million, an increase of 10% compared to a year ago and well above our target range. As expected, revenue contribution from Magma was modest at $14 million, primarily reflecting the standard purchase accounting haircut that was applied to deferred revenue.","We delivered growth across all product groups, with particular strength from our core EDA platform. One customer accounted for slightly more than 10% of second quarter revenue.","Approximately 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, while upfront revenue was 5% of total. Now this is well within our target range of less than 10% upfront. The average length of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.7 years, and we expect average duration in fiscal 2012 to be about 2.8 years.","Turning to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $415 million, which included $29 million of amortization of intangible assets, $21 million of stock-based compensation. We also had $31 million of acquisition-related costs that related primarily to Magma.","Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $332 million, an expected year-over-year increase also due mainly to our Magma acquisition. Excluding Magma, total non-GAAP costs and expenses would have declined sequentially.","Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter and 24% for the first half of fiscal 2012. For all of FY '12, we continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase over FY '11 levels by approximately 100 basis points.","Turning now to earnings. GAAP earnings per share were $0.14, down from $0.53 a year ago. And recall that Q2 of FY '11 earnings included the onetime impact of a $32.8 million or $0.21 per share GAAP-only tax benefit associated with an IRS settlement for fiscal years 2006 through 2009.","Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 18% to $0.53 and includes the $0.01 dilution from Magma. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 24% for the quarter. And for modeling purposes, we continue to think that a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25% is a reasonable estimate for fiscal 2012.","Now turning to our cash and balance sheet items. Our balance sheet remains strong with $797 million in cash and cash equivalents. We also had $250 million of debt at the end of the quarter due to the Magma acquisition. Of our total cash balance, 19% was onshore at quarter end and 81% was offshore.","As expected, our domestic cash declined as a result of the Magma acquisition. We generated $127 million in cash from operations in the quarter, and we are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $320 million to $340 million.","Continuing on with our cash and balance sheet items. Capital expenditures were $9 million for the quarter. For the year, we expect capital spending of approximately $55 million. We did not spend cash to repurchase stock in the quarter and have approximately $272 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. And as always, we'll evaluate the best uses of cash each quarter, including company operations, M&A investments, repayment of debt and stock repurchases.","So continue on with our balance sheet items. Q2 net accounts receivable totaled $236 million and DSO was 50 days, within our target range. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $736 million. We ended Q2 with approximately 7,475 employees, with more than 1\/3 in lower-cost geographies. Approximately 590 of the additional employees were from our recent acquisitions, the majority coming from Magma.","Now let's address our third quarter and fiscal 2012 guidance, which excludes any future M&A, including the impact of future acquisition-related expenses on GAAP targets that may be incurred in Q3 and beyond.","So for the third quarter of FY '12, our targets are: Revenue between $440 million and $448 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $371 million and $387 million, which includes approximately $16 million of stock-based compensation expense; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $333 million and $343 million; other income and expense between 0 and negative $2 million; a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 26%; outstanding shares between 149 million and 153 million; GAAP earnings of $0.29 to $0.34 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.49 to $0.51 per share. And we expect greater than 90% of the quarter's revenue to come from backlog.","Now our fiscal 2012 outlook. We're raising our revenue range with our new target between $1.74 billion and $1.76 billion, reflecting underlying strength in our base Synopsys business and also the addition of Magma. At this time, we anticipate that Magma will contribute approximately $60 million for the full year.","Other income and expense between 0 and $3 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 25%;  Outstanding shares between 148 million and 152 million; GAAP earnings per share between $1.04 and $1.16, which includes the impact of approximately $71 million in stock-based compensation expense; non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.03 to $2.07; and we raised the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.05, $0.03 of that due to Magma. And our current range represents year-over-year growth of approximately 13% to 15%, exceeding our beginning-of-the-year commitment to deliver high single-digit earnings growth in FY '12.  And we are now targeting cash flow from operations of $320 million to $340 million.","Now as I've mentioned, while we're still analyzing the business and planning for FY '13, our objective is to achieve high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. For modeling purposes, we think that a reasonable estimate for Magma revenue is just shy of about $100 million, taking into account the business model transition under Synopsys, along with the backlog profile that was acquired.","So in summary, we're pleased with our excellent second quarter results highlighted by top and bottom line growth, solid operating margin and strong cash flow generation. We're also pleased to provide increased revenue, EPS and cash flow guidance for FY '12.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I'd like to extend my congratulations to Chi-Foon on his promotion. So to start out, Aart, with something referred to in your prepared remarks about 28-nanometer where there's a lot of activity and some issues with respect to yield and I guess, capacity. Can you talk to how sort of that's potentially benefiting Synopsys? Where are the opportunities there and perhaps also at below 28-nanometer at this point?","Aart J. de Geus","Sure. The 28-nanometer node has been in the works for a long time, both from a technology development, as well as from a designer perspective. And I think the reality is that the 2 are coming together now all at the same time with both market opportunities, designs that are ready to go and applications that really would like to take advantage of this node. And as you pointed out correctly, there's definitely the perception of lack of capacity and maybe even some yield issues that cause a lack of capacity. Now nothing that drives capacity growth more rapidly and yield improvements more rapidly than customers that are eager to buy, but we are clearly seeing that all of the suppliers of silicon are working very hard to try to take advantage of this opportunity. Simultaneously, it's an opportunity for us because the chip design itself has influence on the quality and the yields that one can get in the implementation. And so products such as our Yields Explorer allows people to look at their design and look up to the manufacturing and identify more easily issues that could reduce yield. And therefore work more closely with a foundry rapidly to fix those. And we are definitely seeing upswing on that specifically around that node. In general, I think it's encouraging that 28-nanometer is doing well because it indicates that the wave of moving to this node is now really becoming very real from a production point of view. And of course, a few companies are already well ahead of that. But this indicates that there's a lot of, I would say, advanced, if not super advanced, chips are now migrating there, and so that demands a lot of tools, a lot of handholding, which is some pressure, but also a lot of opportunity for us.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then with respect to your discussions with customers that have -- that were both Synopsys and Magma customers, any one concern is that the degree that those customers wanted a dual-vendor strategy, now they're effectively a single vendor strategy. What can you do to prevent them from the fact that -- if you to try to prevent them from going to another vendor to sort of create a dual-vendor strategy and what -- how were those talks going?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, for starters, we don't want to prevent them from doing anything because if people really want alternatives, then they're free to do so. I think what the bringing together of the Magma technology and the Synopsys technology does is for starter actually accelerate the overall frame that we have. It makes it more solid for the coming node of 20-nanometer, which is a node that requires a large amount of technical investment and support, dedication. So in that sense, I think we are a much more and even better bet, I should say, because of combining those things. And at the same time, we have been very clear to the customers that certainly for all of their ongoing projects, we don't want to jeopardize where they're heading there, and we'll continue to support the former Magma tools. So I think the customers have a lot of choice, but the customers are also very, very focused on figuring out which solutions really work and actually try to reduce some of the application.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And finally, for Brian, can you state what the interest rate is on the debt that you took out?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes. It's effectively today at about 1.375%.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And is that a floating rate?","Brian M. Beattie","It does, yes. It floats on a LIBOR. We've been using 30-day LIBOR rates, and the premium on top of that, the spread is about 1.1%. So LIBOR rate now is very inexpensive. We continue to expect the rates will stay low for the foreseeable future.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And is it your intent to maintain that debt for some period? Or would you consider paying that off rather quickly as you generate cash and the balance of the year?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, I'd say our goal is to obtain really the maximum optionality that we can with the resources that we've got. But it's a balancing item there between our operations and repaying that debt. Also, the M&A opportunities, it's still maybe in front of us and also the buyback scenario. So we look at all 4 of those areas as areas that we need to address and use the cash in the appropriate way.","Operator","We have a question from Raj Seth with Cowen and Company.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Brian, first, a question for you. Your guidance suggests, your annual guidance, that we'll see sequentially lower operating margins into Q4. I mean, there was the same trajectory pre-Magma. Can you remind me what the reason is for that? And I'm just curious if there's some residual lot of costs in there that one might expect go away as you moved into the next year? I mean, fundamentally, I guess, I'm curious how to think about margins in the next year. You mentioned high single growth -- high single-digit growth expectation. Do you think that margins ought to expand in the next year, stay about where they are? How do I think about that next?","Brian M. Beattie","Sure, Raj, you bet. Yes, as we look at margins, first thing we'd say is, again, we're focused on improving the efficiency and driving margin up. And we anticipate that for this year, we will be up approximately 100 basis points over the numbers that we had seen last year in 2011. Relative to the Magma costs and the margin pressure, again, we anticipated that back of the last quarter that the earnings contribution from Magma would be modest and, in fact, we came out at $0.03. So for this year, the operating margins aren't quite up to the standard as you'd anticipate from the transition costs that we have for integrating the products, and again, anticipating that to improve as we drive profitability up from Magma well into '13. And then the last point I'd say is that, again, our -- as you see us already being close to 23% to 24% operating margin, that our goal continues to be achieving the mid-20% levels over the next few years as well. So again, just recall that on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it does move around a little bit based on the timing of the expenses and how things work. Recall the extra week we had in the first quarter, which happens every 5 to 6 years. And you will see a bit of movement. But overall, again, about 100 basis points improvement in 2012 over 2011, inclusive of our acquisition.","Raj Seth - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And a question, if I might, for Aart. Aart, on the IP business, you talked about a good momentum there. Can you talk briefly about sort of what the margin trajectory is there? And as you balance, I suppose, the desire for breadth in the portfolio, how do you balance that against the -- and you tell me if this is true or not, but the fact that you probably have some hit products with them, the portfolio that probably generate, I'm guessing, a lot of the disproportionate amount of the revenue, just talk a little bit about you're going to build that out over the next 12 months or so?","Aart J. de Geus","Sure. Raj, I think you gave most of the answer in your question, which is, it is precisely a balancing act between growth, profitability and broadening the portfolio for the short and the broad term. And in that context, a, we are clearly seeing continued growth, the business is doing well, and we think it's an important one going forward; b, without giving specifics, I think we've commented started maybe roughly 4 to 6 quarters ago, that we were gradually improving the operating margin of that business largely because as the business becomes larger, it should become more and more profitable; and c, you saw some of the results of that overall in the results for the corporation. Brian just mentioned that this year, we will be moving up the operating margin by roughly 100 basis points. Well, that is the result of all of those things, including this business. And so I think we're well on track in every domain. Now from a broadening point of view, at any point in time, yes, some of the products are \"hot\" because when somebody needs it, their competitor needs it, and before you know it, everybody needs it. And that is, by the way, also the nature of many of those standards. But it's also true that to be evolved constantly, they constantly have to be  mapped into other technologies, and so there's actually quite a distribution of efforts over a broad portfolio. And that is actually one of the Synopsys' strength.","Operator","We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Brian, can you start with maybe walk us through from a high level, if you can. So you have Magma that was out there with, what, a high $30 million, almost $40 million quarterly revenue run rate. How do we think about starting there, taking the deferred revenue haircut, what the impact from the model transition might be to get us to the revenue contributions you talked about for this year and next year?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, sure will, Sterling. As you know, we said that this year, the revenue contribution from Magma would be about $60 million. And that, that, on a full year basis, going into '13, would give us just slightly less than about $100 million of run rate. So first of all, it starts with a very significantly different business model. And as we look at the business and the operations of Magma, now we've had an opportunity to go through every single contract and profile those out for the years, we found a few things. Number one was that, as you know, from the last 2 quarters, that more than 50% of those revenues were taken upfront. As you can imagine, that's a significant difference from us that is this past quarter, we had about 5% of revenues that are taken upfront. So under Synopsys, we look at taking those revenues for both contracts that were signed and contracts to be signed with the Magma products to our very, very ratable model. So it's quite different. So naturally, it would have the impact of stretching out those revenues. The other thing that we saw was also the length of contracts. We had one of the contracts we acquired also went out to 2019, first quarter of our 2019 plan. So you could see that many of the contracts, as referred to in the backlog, were some in excess of 5 to 6 years. And of course, we're trying to align that again with the Synopsys model, which averaged about 2.7 years. But we'll certainly honor all of the commitments that were made in that regard. And finally, down to the backlog, looking at the very specific backlog of products and contracts that were acquired on the transition, we saw about $200 million of backlog that meets the Synopsys' standard of not having options included in them for transitions. And we've taken that backlog very specifically into account as we projected both the end of this year and well into 2013 revenue. So I'd say those are the 3 contributors to the difference from what was seen as Magma numbers from the last quarter it was reported to our detailed review of them now as we look forward.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So we can assume the ratable mix to be identical to your -- to the 90 plus going forward?","Brian M. Beattie","That's correct.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And that could be a transition period? Okay.","Brian M. Beattie","Absolutely, yes. And recall again, in the first number for this year, we had deferred revenues that were about $23 million that we acquired. And we'll lose about $12 million of that due to the standard purchase accounting haircut that's done on deferred revenues. So it has a little bit of an impact in '13, that cut kind of happens over 12 months or so. So again, pretty standard process as we look through it. But again, we told everybody last quarter, we would break out all the Magma impact through revenues, spending and earnings contribution. We've done that for the year. And then now as we said very clearly, the products, the teams, the customer accounts are all fully integrated, and we're moving forward.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then touching upon an earlier question, as we think about the expense run rate, associated to LAVA, how much of the cost synergies that you would want to capture from the deal have already been recognized? How much is still in front of us?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, I'd say, again, specifically identifying the Magma revenue or the Magma employees is really not the way the company is operating right now. We are totally integrated on an integrated product offering, integrated from a development perspective where the teams are jointly developing both a maintenance of products that were signed prior to our acquisition on February 22, as well as all the integration work to the best of all the products that are outlined earlier. So the teams are very integrated going forward. And clearly, we have goals we set for 2013 and beyond of high single-digit growth, and we know that we have to work that through. And again, that's a commitment we've already made with still 6 months to go in 2012, and we just see the teams as totally integrated. There's a last few elements that we have to address relative to some facilities that we actually moved out of this past weekend, the main headquarter facility. And that's actually a Q3 activity, but again, we're moving very, very quickly on customer integration, employee integration and facility rationalization with some very significant cuts that have been taken place already in the infrastructure groups to make all of this happen.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. One more, and I'll hop back into the queue. As I look at the $0.01 of dilution, it would seem to suggest the LAVA-related expenses are about $16 million in the quarter. But total expenses were about $23 million, $24 million. Higher than that I would have expected, meaning that there are -- looks like there's $7 million or $8 million of higher expenses in just the core Synopsys. Can you give me a sense as to when you looked at it -- where maybe expenses were a little bit towards the higher end of what you expected, was it sales marketing, was it research development? Where was the heavier spend?","Brian M. Beattie","You bet. The -- looking specifically at Q2 numbers, our spending was up again primarily related to the very, very strong business levels that we've seen in the first half of the year related to overachievements of those levels. We have also accrued and used Q2 as a 6-month catch-up on bearable compensation payments that are now being anticipated due to this overachievement that we've reflected both in our midpoint growing by about $85 million on the top line. And as you know, that\u2019s both $65 million or $60 million for Magma and $25 million organic growth. And so again, a lot of it came from that perspective of the business is doing very well. We did need to accrue a little bit more to take into account the 6-month catch-up on variable comp.","Operator","We have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I have 2 of them. Brian, just to get back on the synergy standpoint, I understand the Magma is well integrated, at what point do you think the operating margins of Magma would trend towards your corporate margins?","Brian M. Beattie","Well, it -- again, we're moving very, very quickly to bring up that newly acquired business. But again, let's put this in the context that the Magma business represents about 6% to 7% of the overall Magma -- or the overall Synopsys financial performance as measured by the revenues. And we're very quickly integrating those teams that they're doing the total development work for both product groups. The expenses reflect that. The revenues reflect that. And again, we have already made a commitment now for 2013 that we will continue with that high single-digit growth for 2013 and make sure the margins are there to do it, taking into account the momentum we had already this year, being up 100 basis points over last year and the commitment we've made to continue to drive our margins to the mid-20s.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it, all right, and then I have a question for Aart. In all the last several quarters, you've seen many of the foundries and the chipmakers try to the 28-nanometer. In a scenario like that, did you actually see EDA spending stall out because customers are trying to fix the manufacturing issue? Or it was agnostic to what is happening in the factory? And secondly, if that is the scenario, do you expect a similar trend to 20-nanometer?","Aart J. de Geus","So we saw none of that. As a matter of fact, I think design is mostly driven by the complexity of design. And if there are yield issues, on any node, some people will spend some more money on the interface between design and manufacturing. Other people will rush to immediately remap their designs to either another node or another foundry if they can. And so I could not say, at all, that any yield issues, which, by the way, are common for every node in history, so I wouldn't overdramatize it either. But I don't think it has any negative impact on design. I think maybe on the positive side, the very fact that there's so many designs queued up for 28-nanometer tells us that there's a lot of very sophisticated chips in the works. And we certainly feel that through the perspective of our field support because they are very, very central to the success of these chip designs. And so in that context, I think that technology is racing forward as fast as it has been in the past, and the value is certainly very high because the competitiveness among our customers is very high right now.","Krish Sankar - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Did you guys give what -- I mean, what's your breakout? What part of your revenue comes from 20-nanometer design today?","Aart J. de Geus","We actually don't break it out for a simple reason, which is our most advanced tools that are used for 20-nanometer, for example, are actually also bringing substantial benefits to 28- and 40-nanometer because they are faster. They're better. They're more optimized for low-power design and so on. And so in EDA, there's been a bit of a myth for years that every time there's a new node, people are going to change all their tools. I would say it's absolutely the opposite. People hate to change tools because these are very, very sophisticated programs. You learn how to use them, and so they upgrade if there is value to the next release, and it is true that advanced nodes tend to need the new release. But in general, I would not say that is a massive shift of tools because of a node transition.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Aart, I'd like to ask first about the Magma integration, of course. With respect to your sales and support model, the base business previously had a model where Synopsys would have about 3 or 4 AEs and field support per sales rep. And you also had,  if I recall correctly, about 150 named accounts. With the integration of Magma, could you talk about how that might have changed in terms of the scope or ratios within your sales and support model?","Aart J. de Geus","It's a good question. I had to think a little bit because we certainly did not do the math that way. It's not a bad way to do the math. But in general, I would say that we kept the vast, vast majority of the technical people, and certainly, of the support people because there's such a high demand but only to support the previous Magma tools. But in general, for really good talent in the field as customers tackle more difficult designs. It is also true that we probably cut higher percentage in the sales team. But again, to put in perspective, we're talking about a very small company compared to the rest of Synopsys. And, but it still adds to your point, which is if you look at the last 5 years, my guess is that we have increased the number of support people per sales person largely because the sales activity, our team activities, anyway, with the business units and with others in the company. And whereas the support is something of which there's never enough of. And so I would say that balance has increased towards having more support people per sales person.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. With respect to the products or the forces of growth actually, with Magma, you now have majority shares implementation. You reinforced what was already probably majority of share in sign-off. And as you pointed out, you're #2 in IP. Could you talk about other areas where you might look to gain significant share or otherwise just your good enough organic growth that might have a material impact on run rates and revenues?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, as you know, we have a very broad portfolio, and I even hesitate to call the number of products because there's some very large products and of course, we have thousands of little IP products. But the reality is, to cover a broad set of designs, we need to have flows that are very complex and that have many different tools. So in that context, the first thing that Magma adds, and that was one of the key reasons to move ahead, is it adds even more technology and also more technologists and support people that are very capable to our team. And so we absolutely foresee that we will continue to invest in all the areas that you mentioned. At the same time, we have another set of tools that you didn't mention in the whole verification space, in the custom space, in the system space and, of course, in the IP space. And then, even within manufacturing, we are broadening somewhat. And although it is a really small addition, it's still noteworthy to mention that this past quarter, we added this small company in the Optical space, thus getting a little bit more footprint there as well. This is all maybe a long diatribe to clarify that there's no end to need for more technology and therefore, for opportunities for us. And in that context, it's both a quest for driving the best technology, the most advanced ones, but also integrating them really well and supporting them well. And so that is the, really the comprehensive picture that we're trying to drive forward for our customers.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. Just one more for you, Aart, and then a financial follow-up for Brian. How would you rate this integration, thus far, versus Avanti a decade or so ago, particularly the area of key employee retention in R&D, for example? And how are you doing in keeping key LAVA people on the FineSim and Tekton teams and so forth?","Aart J. de Geus","Well, in general, every acquisition is different in nature. At the same time, hopefully, over our history, we learned lessons, given that we done, I don't know, 60 or 70 of them by now. And in this case, if there's one thing maybe that stands out in our own execution is that we have moved very, very rapidly. The sheer fact that in 30 days, we had decided on all the people situations. In 60 days, we had already feedback from customers systematically. And now, 90 days later, we're already back on the road with the roadmaps going forward, I think, illustrates that we're moving quickly. I don't know the exact numbers actually, but of the 750 or so people, we must have retained roughly 500, 480 or so. And so I'm sure there will be some ups and downs around that, but the fact is we have some really, really good people that are here, and some have communicated that they really like to be here. I'm sure some will rethink it, but the bottom line is we're moving very fast. And I think there's some experience in the company on how to do it well. And it can all be summarized in one sentence, which is, \"Do whatever is best for the customer in the long term, and then the rest will find its way.\"","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. And lastly, for Brian, you said that you had gone through the -- the LAVA backlog and contracts and, of course, changed the model. Could you talk about the degree to which you adhere to put all to LAVA's previously given bookings expectations? They have been public in giving some  expectations for their bookings. Could you just talk about whether or not you haircutted those numbers at all? And with respect to your own internal increase in revenue, that $25 million you mentioned to yourself, if you gross that up to your bookings performance, would it be fair to say that you had roughly 100 million or more in bookings upside versus what you had set you would get to get to the prior revenue guidance?","Aart J. de Geus","Jay, this is Aart. Let me answer this one. For starters, as you know, we don't comment about our own bookings, and so we wouldn't comment about Magma's bookings either. Secondly, there was a lot of speak that the Magma business model was virtually the same as Synopsys. It is not anywhere close the same of Synopsys. And therefore, comparing their bookings practices to ours is not helpful driving the future. Everything we do right now is under exactly the practices that we've had in the past that you have heard from us about in the past. And I'm not saying theirs were better or worse or different -- or I'm saying they are different actually. And so we are just aligning it as if these were now Synopsys' products going forward, and so they follow exactly that same strategy. But clearly, we have reworked the backlog we received that came out quite different than the way they would have reported it. And hopefully, all the numbers that you get from us now are vetted through the practices that you have seen us have for a decade or so.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Sterling Auty.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a couple more. First, Aart, let's talk a little bit about the co-CEO. Just to answer the question because I'm sure there's going to be some discussion. Is this the first step in the transition for yourself out of the CEO position and onto something else? I know you mentioned that nothing's changing from an organizational perspective. But I still expect people to ask the question.","Aart J. de Geus","It's a completely legitimate question, so I can answer it head on. No, it is not a change in status or planning of change of status for me. On the contrary, it is actually both maybe a recognition and a highlighting of what has been a fabulously good working relationship. But even better than that, I think it is also the signing up for now really working on the next phase of growth of the company. And this is a particularly good time because I think we had very good results. We have actually very, very solid outlook for this year. And so our energy is entirely focused on '13, '14 and '15, and what better time to make these changes as now as we are working together as a team. One more comment, we also have a much larger company today than half a decade or 1 decade ago. And that includes, also from a geographical point of view, and the very fact that we can both speak with full authority for the company to very different geographical locations is actually a very good thing. And I don't think we ever question what the other says. It works very well as a team.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Brian, the jump in shares for EPS calculation in the quarter, was there anything more than just the higher stock price impacting your Treasury method?","Brian M. Beattie","Yes, plus the fact that given a significant acquisition that our primary focus was on that acquisition, putting the debt structure in place to complete the transaction,  and given that, we did not buy back any stock in the second quarter, combined with a higher price point that you mentioned. But overall, for the year, we look at relatively flat share count compared to where it was last year. And we'll continue to evaluate all the other options going forward.","Sterling P. Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And lastly, when you look at the gross margin, it came in very nicely for the quarter. How much of that was just a mix issue in terms of revenue versus any other items that may have been benefacted it?","Brian M. Beattie","Well on a gross level, primarily what you see there is some of the services to deliver in the field. There's really nothing fundamental to it. Sometimes, there's a little bit of a hardware mix for our little hardware business that we've got. So really no fundamental shifts at gross levels and on the operating level. I think we've covered that earlier. That's really our prime focus.","Operator","There are no further questions. Please continue.","Aart J. de Geus","Well at this point in time, I thank you very much for attending the meeting. Hopefully, you took away that not only did we have an excellent quarter, but we have a very strong outlook for the year, are focusing very much already on the further out future, and our sense is that our industry and our position is quite healthy. So in the context of many of the other moving parts in the world, hopefully, we are a beacon of stability and worthy of your interest. Thank you very much for your interest.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. ","At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets, and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results.","While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC report and today's earnings press release.","The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release, and financial supplements that we released earlier today. All of these items plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on this site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered revenue of $569 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68. We entered into a $200 million accelerated share buyback program and are well on-track to meeting our revenue, EPS, and operating cash flow objectives for the year.","Trac will discuss these in more detail shortly. As most of you know well, Synopsys serves the broad Electronics industry all the way from Silicon to Software. Over the past five years this market has seen, and is seeing, dramatic changes as continued advances bring daunting complexity challenges, but also a fabulous wave of impact and business ","opportunities. ","Most notably, demand is expanding for mobile and cloud infrastructure to support the enormous potential of big data, which is accelerated by a wave of Internet of Things data generation. Internet of things, or IoT for short, itself is rapidly morphing into the next generation of smart everything meaning digitally intelligent devices using functions such as vision, learning, and reasoning, as we\u2019re already seeing in assisted and autonomous driving.","The increase in complexity of these sophisticated hardware\/software systems challenges the entire value chain. Whereas the race is on again along the traditional metrics of performance, power and cost, it\u2019s also subject to growing concerns on how to deal effectively with systemic security issues. ","Synopsys is uniquely focused on enabling our customers across three market segments:","Semiconductor companies, who design chips and increasingly embed software in them; ","Systems companies, who develop products that incorporate chips while adding their own differentiating software; and Software developers across many industry segments, who focus on handling the increasing complexity and security of their code.","For Synopsys, \u201ccomplexity\u201d is in our DNA and we\u2019re well equipped to enable the next generation of opportunities. Many years of investments have made us the market and technology leader in EDA; the second largest IP company in the world; and the emerging front-runner in addressing the critical new software quality and security space. ","We\u2019re consciously building our Silicon to Software market position with an objective to grow shareholder value through strong operating cash flow generation, solid revenue growth and expanding annual non-GAAP operating margins through a balanced capital allocation strategy featuring stock buybacks to maintain or shrink share count. And acquisitions to expand our SAM and TAM and through the most predictable recurring, time-based revenue model in the industry, supported by a large multi-year backlog.","Our objective thus remains to drive long-term revenue and earnings growth, while continually evolving the position of Synopsys towards the sweet spot of today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s electronics. Let me make a couple comments on the present landscape. In Semiconductors, the environment is essentially unchanged since we spoke in December. ","While consolidations are a bit of a headwind for the EDA industry, as customers rationalize their combined businesses over time, Synopsys is faring quite well in these situations. ","The mission critical nature and completeness of our solutions mitigate risks and our Q1 results are very encouraging. In Systems, our strong position and focus on the intersection of hardware and software have been particularly positive, and we\u2019re seeing growth for Synopsys. For software developers, our rapidly evolving platform of quality and security solutions is getting attention, and we see increased calls to action, most notably from the security perspective.","Now to some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. In Q1 we signed a significant agreement with Globalfoundries for design, verification and manufacturing tools. Synopsys is supporting their recently acquired IBM ASIC business by providing access to a full Synopsys flow, including IC Compiler II place and route and IC Validator physical verification. ","In addition, a cornerstone memory supplier increased its business with us by more than 25% per year, with particular strength in analog simulation and manufacturing. Meanwhile, our next-generation physical design system, IC Compiler II, continues its rapid deployment as customers see excellent results. The solution is production proven, with nearly 150 production designs supporting 19 different silicon process nodes. ","Demand is quite high as IC Compiler II continues the fastest ramp of the Synopsys product ever, with opportunity for further growth. Some visible successes include: November\u2019s qualification of IC Compiler II by Samsung Foundry for its 10nm production work. A collaboration with Globalfoundries on the industry\u2019s first 22nm FD-SOI process and reference flow that includes Synopsys synthesis, IC Compiler II, and signoff.","As the clear leader in advanced design tools, we are witnessing increased adoption of 16, 14, 10 and even 7nm FinFET technology. Of the 286 active FinFET designs currently being tracked, Synopsys is relied on for 95% of those chips. 100% of the 10nm and 7nm tape-outs completed thus far utilized Synopsys design tools.","Notable also is Samsung already providing 10nm qualified Synopsys physical verification run-sets. IC Validator, which works particularly well with IC Compiler II and on FinFET technologies, is seeing an increase in customer utilizing its full signoff status. We also experienced strong growth and business alignment this quarter with multiple silicon manufacturing partners in both lithography and TCAD at very advanced nodes.","Now to verification, an area where we\u2019ve seen excellent growth as our vision is now being realized. A number of years ago, we recognized that existing verification approaches were woefully inadequate to deal with the upcoming complexity growth in hardware, and the systemic challenges of hardware and software.","We had a vision, anchored around our market-and technology leading VCS simulation, to ","deliver a complete platform of interacting verification techniques which we called the Verification Continuum. This vision and its subsequent execution were right-on, and today we\u2019re seeing excellent technical results, as well as business and market share growth.","A great example in Q1 was a major enterprise-level partnership and expanded commitment to Synopsys by one of the top mobile semiconductor companies, to drive state-of-the-art technology collaboration and broadened adoption of our solution. Both the hardware and software elements of our Verification Continuum did well this quarter.","Our emulation system, ZeBu, saw excellent growth and continues to demonstrate performance and cost advantages. In prototyping, we shipped a large number of our next-generation HAPS FPGA based systems. On the software side, our virtual prototyping solution is having solid success, particularly in the auto industry. As evidenced by a large Q1 agreement with a leading U.S. OEM, our automotive strategy is bearing fruit as the industry is massively increasing its investments towards opportunities such as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.","We expect the verification business to do well this year. Now to our IP products, where a solid results quarter accompanied continued expansion of our already broad portfolio. Our distinct leadership in interface IP continues. This quarter we were first to market with the new USB Type C, which supports the connector that functions with either side up or down. ","In Q1, we also announced our Data Fusion Subsystem for IoT devices. The many sensors on cell phones, tablets, and the like need to take data in and process it effectively. This first-of-its-kind integrated subsystem bringing together the processors, peripherals, memories, libraries and drivers necessary makes it easier, quicker, and lower risk for customers to build this functionality into their chips.","We also continue to innovate in our security IP portfolio. This quarter, we announced an enhanced security package, featuring data encryption, address scrambling, and data integrity checks aimed at providing protection from system attacks and IP theft. The theme of security naturally brings me to our Software Integrity business group. This new TAM, higher growth area is our most recent investment and holds great promise, as testing for defects and security vulnerabilities is now a necessity in virtually every market segment, ranging from automotive, to health, to energy, to financial markets.","Our objective is to provide both developers and users of software with tools to automatically check for quality and security issues, as the software is being developed or ","used in larger systems. The size of this tools market is approximately $2.4 billion, highly fragmented, and growing about 20% per year.","Driven by a universe of 20 million plus software developers and a cost of failure that has gone up dramatically, particularly when human safety is at stake, this market is evolving rapidly. Last week you may have seen the President\u2019s budget proposal, in which he asked for a 35%, $5 billion increase in the U.S. cyber security budget. Another good example is automotive, where, following some widely published hacking incidents, focused on software security and safety has become intense. ","As we attract some world class experts, integrate technologies from the four software security companies acquired in last eight months, and closely collaborate with the automotive industry to help drive standardization efforts addressing cyber security, we\u2019re garnering attention and building a strong brand in the new emerging area of software sign-off.","I hope you see from my comments that our Silicon to Software push is both well anchored and visionary. Last quarter we delivered excellent progress in virtually every area of our business. In summary Q1 was a very good start to the year, and we\u2019re well ","on-track towards meeting our annual financial targets","Our core business is solid with areas of promising growth; we continue to invest towards broadening our TAM; and our Silicon to Software vision aligns well with where the customer base is going, and opens up brand new markets.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. Q1 was an excellent start to the year. Building on the momentum from 2015, we continued to execute very well in a challenging environment. ","Q1 business levels were strong. We met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets. And we returned $200 million to shareholders through our stock buyback program. With our strong Q1 performance, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 2016 revenue, earnings and cash flow objectives. ","Now to the numbers: As I talk through Q1 results and 2016 targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue was $569 million, with growth across all product platforms. Over 90% of revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The duration of new renewable customer license commitments averaged approximately 3.7 years, which reflects a couple of large, longer-term agreements. Duration will vary depending on customer requirements and we expect the full year 2016 to average approximately three years.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $497 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $440 million, slightly below our target range, due largely to the timing of expenses which included some delayed hiring. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, and for the year, we expect margin to increase over 2015. We will continue to drive global operational efficiency in order to expand non-GAAP operating margin to a solid mid-20s range. ","GAAP earnings per share were $0.39, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.68, above our target range. Similar to prior years, Q1 had a net operating cash outflow. The $35 million outflow was due largely to the timing of 2015 annual incentive compensation payments. We expect this strong operating cash flow for 2016, with a target of at least $500 million. ","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $706 million, with 16% onshore \u2013 and total debt of $228 million. In 2016, we plan to increase buybacks to slightly reduce share count. In Q1, we initiated a $200 million ASR, which we\u2019ll complete in Q2. There is $300 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. ","In addition, we closed a couple of small acquisitions in the software security space, adding key technology to support our strategy and drive long-term growth. DSO was 57 days, within our target range, but up from Q1 last year due to strong business levels. We ended Q1 with 10,290 employees, with more than one-third in lower-cost geographies. The increase in headcount was due to planned hiring and acquisitions. ","Now to second quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For Q2, the targets are: revenue between $595 million and $610 million, as we communicated in December, we expect more variability and quarterly revenue due to the timing of our hardware and consulting business.","Total GAAP costs and expenses between $503 million and $522 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $450 million and $460 million; other income between $0 million and $2 million. A non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%. Outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, GAAP earnings of $0.38 to $0.47 per share, and Non-GAAP earnings of $0.78 to $0.81 per share.","For 2016, revenue of $2.35 billion to $2.39 billion, other income between $0 million and $4 million, and a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%. Outstanding shares between 153 million and 156 million, a reduction of 2 million shares versus our prior guidance range.","GAAP earnings of $1.64 to $1.79 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 to $3.00 per share, capital expenditures of approximately $80 million, and cash flow from operations of at least $500 million.","In summary, our priorities remain centered on managing the business to maximize long-term shareholder value; our predictable business model and strong cash profile provide a very solid financial foundation for this year and beyond and with our strong Q1 performance, we remain confident in our ability to achieve 2016 revenue, earnings and cash flow objectives.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we will go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Krish Sankar","Hi thanks for taking my question I actually joined a little late. The first question was Aart the Globalfoundries customers you mentioned, is it a new win or is it an existing customer what kind of margin profile do you expect for that business?","Aart de Geus","Krish if you don\u2019t mind we never call into about specifics about a customer. But Globalfoundries be it through the Globalfoundries side or the IBM side were customers before and I can only say that we are very pleased with the results and the support from Globalfoundries. It has worked very well. ","Krish Sankar","Got you, no worries. The second question I had was you know obviously you guys spoke about it last earnings call there have been a lot of chatter around impact about semi M&A on R&D? Kind of curious, have you actually started seeing any impact or what are your customers telegraphing to you either those that just finished the acquisition or those that are in the process of getting acquired?","Aart de Geus","So Krish, sorry you missed a little bit at the beginning. I tried to explain that we have really three customer categories the semiconductor ones the system houses and the software companies. When we are talking about consolidation in the semiconductor industry we are mostly talking about literally semiconductor companies, people that design chips, maybe embedding a lot of software, but nonetheless, are centered there. ","And of course a number of the consolidations that occurred or that got started in the last 18 months have meanwhile progressed and closed in some cases, and we are engaged with all of these companies. As I mentioned in the preamble, we are very encouraged by the results that we have gotten, that we are faring quite well with this.","And I think one of the reasons is that as companies look for becoming more efficient, they also often rethink which suppliers they want to work with and how they want to work with them. And given both our vision from hardware towards software and our ability to deliver a very broad I think well-honed set of platforms, we are not only a leader in helping them differentiate themselves in technology, but also far and away the lowest risk. And so we have fared well with this.","Krish Sankar","Thanks, Aart. And just a final question either for you or Trac, you guys have done a great job in execution and, talking about a mid-20s operating margin profile. I'm kind of curious, is this a business that can be a 30% operating margin business, driven by any kind of like levers you can pull on the OpEx side? Or is this a business where Op margin expansion is just purely a function of drop-through from the top line?","Trac Pham","Well, Krish, I would emphasize we're focused on driving high single-digit EPS growth sustainably. I think reality is getting to a 30% ops margin. You can do it for a short-term, but not sustainably over time. The nature of our business is pretty technical. Long-term, though, to drive high single-digit EPS growth sustainably, it's really going to come through a combination of driving top line growth and margin expansion. And the benefit we have in terms of trying to grow margins, we'll really be looking at how we balance the portfolio between core EDA, IP, and software integrity.","And also as we look across our functional grids, whether that's R&D sales and marketing and G&A. I think typically you\u2019ve referred to the 30 \u2013 folks will look at R&D spend, but from our side, we'll increase margins either from driving that top line or balancing our resources.","Krish Sankar","Okay. Thanks, Trac. Thanks, Aart.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson.","Andrew Masuda","Yes, it's Andrew Masuda asking a question on behalf of Tom. First one for Aart, just on the IP business, could you maybe update us on the percentage of IP that is outsourced today and, where do you see it going over the next year or two?","Aart de Geus","Well. First, it\u2019s actually a difficult question to answer, because the definition of IP that's outsourcable has grown dramatically in the last few years.","For those that have followed us for many years, you recall that at some point in time we were proud to provide an adder and simple things like that. Today we are absolutely driving the state of the art of building blocks in terms of both complexity and some of the advanced [indiscernible] USBs and other interfaces are not only very complex on their own. They are also extremely complex as you put them into brand-new silicon technology, such as 10-nanometer or fin set.","We ourselves think that at best, 50% or so has been outsourced. I just want to give the honest caveat that it\u2019s a little bit hard to estimate. But as a little side note the evolution in the market that we see both through some of the consolidations, but also through this move towards providing much more differentiation through the combination of hardware and software, makes a number of customers focus on the higher levels of abstraction. Meaning more and more of the software, and therefore an increased tendency to delegate or to outsource the hardware IP and we are in a certainly a very good position to benefit from that.","Andrew Masuda","Great. Thank you. And then next question is for Trac. Could you maybe just talk about your expectations on the linearity for operating cash flow as we move throughout the year?","Trac Pham","Operating cash flow. Let me describe the P&L and maybe that can help you. You probably expect that the second half revenues will be a little higher than the first half. Same thing with expenses, with EPS ramping up weighted towards second half. Lisa later on can probably give you more details in the after calls.","Andrew Masuda","Great. Thank you.","Trac Pham","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.","Darren Jue","Hi. It\u2019s Darren is here on for Sterling. Thanks for taking the question. Just wondering about those large deals that drove the contract duration higher. Was there any sort of unusual level of discounting that had to be extended to get those customers to sign the long-term deals? Or was it sort of their desire to sign the longer term deals?","Aart de Geus","Well, the reason customers sign long-term deals is maybe financial, but in most cases it\u2019s really because one is looking at a collaborative partnership that has the potential to create additional differentiating value for the customer. And over the years from time-to-time we have done very engaging \u2013 build very engaging relationships that have demonstrated that working closely together cannot only impact the way our tools are used presently, but also hone it for the specific situation that the customer has. And so although of course when you do a multi-year deal, you always make sure that it is balanced for both parties. You also make sure that one creates something that is beyond what would be just a customer supplier relationship.","Trac Pham","Darren this is Trac. I would stress that not only were the deals large, but they were quality deals. We did see run rate grow in Q1.","Darren Jue","Okay. And maybe just one other question for you, Trac. At least based on our model, looked like most of the upside in the quarter in terms of EPS actually came from the gross margin line. I was wondering if you could just talk about what drove that.","Trac Pham","Yes, the overachieve on EPS is really expense story. We were light on expenses. Typically we started the year behind in hiring and this year was probably more, more in common with that. We'll be catching \u2013 we'll try to catch up on our hiring for the rest of the year. If you look at our head count, it was pretty flattish versus the end of the year. That's where the upside came from.","Darren Jue","Okay. All right, thanks.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Yes, thank you. And couple of questions, Aart, about how your business is evolving and the end market and start with the most popular question, of course, having to do with consolidation. So it sounds as though so far it hasn't had an adverse effect on you in terms of post merger, budgeting versus premerger budgeting. The longer-term question is for you. Do you think that the concentration of your customer base, the top 10 or 20 will be up, down or sideways over time, at least in the core business? Do you think the top 10 to 20 will continue to account for half or more of your revenues, even taking into account some post merger cutting among some of your large customers? And couple other questions.","Aart de Geus","Well, by definition, when you have consolidation, that means that some customers are becoming larger, assuming that you continue the business relationship, which we have. And so I think that is not a new phenomenon and that will continue. At the same time, I've always been a believer that in times of consolidation, you can't look at it as a maturation of a market, or you can look at it as the beginning of a next phase. And the reason we're emphasizing and we're investing along the lines of working with both semiconductor systems and software developers is precisely, because we see an evolution in the market that we will continue to emphasize this increased role of the intersection between software and hardware.","And so we are well positioned for that. Obviously, on the hardware side, we go as deep as anybody down into the silicon. On the software side, we have put down new gamuts in the software sign-off, software integrity space. ","And then in the middle, we have a large business that deals with the intersection of those two, be it in verification or even some in the IP side. So I think we're well balanced and I tried to express that by saying we're trying to sort of follow the sweet spot of the industry. And in that context, of course, the players do change over time. But I think we're \u2013 we have solid roots down and I think good opportunities looking up.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","With respect to the IP business, you said yourself that in the early days, the technology was, that you offered was fairly primitive compared to what you do now. But it's always been the case that IP has been a fairly fragmented business. In other words, lots of different categories, which historically had made it hard to scale as far as margins were concerned. You've done better over the years now with margins, but my question is, particularly now in having to meet the needs of the new IoT markets, your new automotive strategy, et cetera. Could you foresee that the portfolio for IP becomes even more fragmented again and if it is so, how might that affect your cost structure or the margin profile going forward in IP?","Aart de Geus","Well, I think it's a good question, although I must say we never use the word fragmented about our own position because we see it as broad. Meaning that having more products available, more IP titles is actually a good thing, given that it is relatively costly to build up the channel that is capable of both selling and supporting this. Secondly, given that it's important to build good relationships with the customers and if the trust the IP1 delivers, they are more likely to come back for other things. And so in that context, I hope that we will continue to actually broaden the portfolio.","But I also would say that we are deepening the portfolio because maybe to be more to the point, the difference between a USB 1, a USB 2, a USB 3 and now a 3.1 and a USBC are quite remarkable just in terms of the capabilities that go into that part. And then on top of that, you layer the evolution on the silicon side from I forgot when we started this, probably by 65-nanometer or so, and then down to 40, 28, 16, 14, 10, and now 7. That is a substantial evolution in terms of the complexity of what we deliver. And so all the more is a trust relationship, an execution relationship with customers essential. So if we can broaden it even more, that is good. But we also partner very well with some other key providers and our objective is to make sure that our customers are successful with this way of doing design. So far, I think it's proven to be true.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","One more for you, if I may, on strategy and then wrap up with Trac on Q1. So you've become quite enthused now about the automotive opportunity and the question there is how you see yourself positioned for that. In other words, do you think your play is largely at the IP and software integrity level, or do you think you can and should move up the supply chain into the automotive systems suppliers themselves, or even up into the OEM level that car companies themselves, as Mentor has done, for example, in some cases.","Lastly for Trac, for Q1, would it be fair to say that the substantial sequential increase in your IP business was correlated to the unusually large sequential increase in the Asia-Pac business? And then on the other hand, was your decline from Q4 North America largely correlated to a sequential decline in emulation? Thanks.","Aart de Geus","So let me start with your automotive question. The first reason why, of course, automotive is in so many discussions is because somewhat surprisingly so, almost overnight it has turned into the poster child of what digital intelligence can do. And this, I say surprisingly so, because automotive in the past has been a relatively slow adopter of silicon technology for many good reasons, because safety was absolutely paramount. And so it demanded a lot of very specific long-term design. I think this is changing radically, meaning that suddenly automotive is now on the clock tick of Silicon Valley, so to speak, of software combined with most advanced silicon. And therefore, many of the capabilities and tools and IP that we provide is front and center.","Now, to your specific question of our position in automotive, we have a remarkably complete set of capabilities that is well vested in a number of automotive-specific techniques, such as making sure that the chips are designed with proveable safety and verifiability in mind. So in that context, we I think are very well positioned and very engaged at by the way, all the levels that you mentioned. So semiconductor companies, Tier 1s, even some automotive companies specifically. I don\u2019t want to go overboard with the enthusiasm here either. It\u2019s an industry that doesn\u2019t ship as many cars as their cell phones. So the numbers are somewhat moderated by that. But it is an industry that suddenly has caught the bug of how do they differentiate themselves in this new space and I think the race is very much on.","Trac Pham","So Jay, this is Trac. Your question regarding the geographic growth and the product growth, I wouldn\u2019t read into any correlation between other geographic growth and product growth. We see both emulation and IP as growth areas for us long-term and that's pretty broad-based. We're not expecting that necessarily comes from any one geography. It would be broad-based growth.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Right, but I was asking specifically if that was the case, however, in Q4 to Q1.","Trac Pham","In emulation, that would be partly the case, whether it's quarter on quarter, yes.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Aart de Geus","You're welcome. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And next we'll go to the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I \u2013 First I have a follow-up on the questions he asked earlier. If you look at your closest feared Cadence they posted north of 26 points operating margin last year and we could see them going to at least 27 points in one or two years. Since you are still talking about mid-25% margins, my question is to understand it's not 30% of margin business, but could Synopsys be between 25 to 30 points.","Aart de Geus","Monika, we have said for a while that where we are heading is toward the mid-20s. So these numbers are all in that space. At the same time, one of the things that we decided to do a couple of years ago is to invest specifically in a new emerging area. And we did that with the belief and understanding that a lot of functionality would move into software, that the software was quickly going to reach the issue of complexity and then security issues that would become enormous, and we continued to invest in that. Of course such an area initially is not particularly profitable. But it has potential.","Secondly, we have seen that the investments that we've made recently through some of the acquisitions initially bring about a small hair cut and those are the small differences that would make up or explain what you were mentioning. Be it as it may, our objective is very clear. Our objective has always been how do we deliver shareholder value over the long-term with a fairly consistent pattern so the intent is not to surprise anybody, but at the same time, to also not be hesitant to put our chips down if we see some opportunity. And that is exactly what we are continuing to do. You have noticed that in the last couple of years we have not been hesitant to also utilize our balance sheet towards buybacks, as we found them to be appropriate and have done so again this quarter. So the balance of those things is how we're managing the company.","Monika Garg","Got it. Aart and then as a follow-up, how big do you think emulation market can become? And how are you thinking about growth of your emulation business this year?","Aart de Geus","Well, you know, the emulation business is difficult to characterize because they are multiple players with multiple sort of cycles of product and there is some degree of \u2013 I wouldn't say seasonality as just things go up and down from one quarter to another because it's somewhat lumpy. Lumpy was the word I was looking for. Having said that, the reason that we are bullish around emulation is actually a broader one, which is that we are strong advocates and we think we strongly deliver around a vision of a verification continuum that allows to use emulation in the context of many other tools as appropriate for the task at hand.","And without going too technically deep here, the reason this is important is because we are dealing with a space that goes all the way from verifying strictly some hardware to verifying some chips with embedded software all the way to people wanting to bring up entire operating systems and some application software on hardware that has not yet been built. And so in that context, the, the collection of technologies assembled in a platform that we have is truly quite amazing compared to where we were just five or six years ago. And we have seen that the take-up in system companies that are now hitting this intersection has been particularly positive and that was visible in some of the Q1 growth.","Monika Garg","Got it. The last one for Trac, Trac, at the midpoint you beat Q1 by almost $0.06 EPS and why not raise the yearly EPS guidance?","Trac Pham","Well, as mentioned, the overachievement was mostly on light expenses and, you know, most of that's timing, still early in the year. We are definitely focused on the full year, full-year EPS targets. At this point, we feel pretty good about the guidance.","Monika Garg","Got it. Thank you, so much.","Trac Pham","Thank you.","Operator","And next we'll go to the line of Gary Mobley with Benchmark.","Gary Mobley","Hi. Guys. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I did just have one question about the M&A environment. Given the equity Capital Markets turbulence and maybe some economic softness, more broad, has it become a buyer's market for cash-rich companies like you in what has been sort of a consolidation strategy?","And in other words, are you seeing more companies being shopped to you that are perhaps a good strategic fit, are companies potential acquisition targets more amenable to price terms and considering the answer to that, do you feel the best use of cash might be to decelerate M&A pace or stay on the same cash return strategy or like some dividends and share buybacks?","Aart de Geus","Okay, well, Gary, you probably know that we never respond to specific M&A questions. But in general terms, if you watch Synopsys, we have found a balance between using repurchase mechanisms and M&A as the two ways to leverage our balance sheet. When we look at M&A, invariably it's driven by two things. Either a mechanism to increase the strength of our SAM, meaning purchase companies that have either technology or market position that we think we can do better with or that strengthens our position, or just as importantly, maybe even more important is opportunities to create new TAM for us. And so in that sense, the last 18 months have been interesting because we've done a number of acquisitions, starting with a company in the software quality space.","And the reason that one was important is because that is the fundamental platform to analyze software. And then just in the last I think eight months or nine months or so, we've acquired four security companies that can all pretty swiftly be integrated into the overall software analysis platform. And so these are all good examples of how we utilize our cash on an ongoing basis. ","Now, are there waves of these? Yes, they are. Sometimes they are driven by the state of the market. But in general, I would tell you that many of these things are often on the radar scope for many years and the moment has to just be right to be able to acquire something both from a seller point of view and a buyer point of view. And there's quite a bit of dating that goes around before marriage. So in that sense, we're always busy.","Gary Mobley","Understood. Appreciate the response. Thank you.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll go to line of Srini Sundar with Summit Research.","Srini Sundar","Hi guys, thanks for taking my call. First question is on the mid-20% operating margin that others have also explored. My question is what do you propose will be the timing and how exactly will you achieve it? Meaning will it come from the gross margin line or R&D or a G&A? So if you could\u2026","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well, in general, as Trac alluded to, at the end of the day, revenue growth is the single-best recipe to grow margins, and in that sense, we are heading there. And as mentioned, based on some of the past acquisitions and recent investments, we see that the haircuts will gradually fade away and our continued growth and diligent expense management will get us there. So to me the issue is not can we get there or not. Yes, we will. And we have been committed to that for quite a while.","Srini Sundar","Okay. And my next question is if you go down in the dimensions of the nodes, the number of products that the foundries, that the foundries will design will be reduced. So, for the industry as a whole right now, semiconductors form the bulk of the revenues. So maybe by 2020, what kind of revenue percentage will come from the difference, do you think?","Aart de Geus","Well, in general, I would observe two things. The most advanced nodes by definition are always the ones that get adopted by the people that have both the skills to use them, but most importantly, have the business opportunity to leverage differentiation of faster, much more dense, lower power chips. Initially, that is invariably a small number, as the foundries themselves hone these processes to gradually grow the yields, meaning bring down the cost per chip. The most advanced design companies spend most money because they have an economic return on that differentiation. ","If you look back at only three years or four years, the belief was that FinFET would be the reality for only three or four companies. Well, that is most definitely not the case. We are seeing actually a rapid increase now, as the proof points of solid FinFET technology are there by a broader set of companies. And interestingly enough, a set of companies that one would never have thought about in the past, the automotive companies, are suddenly interested here as well, as they want to introduce digital intelligence in their products. So I think the push will continue, which is not to say that it gets easier or much cheaper, but the value of differentiation is quite high and we will continue to work with those most advanced customers. ","But as said, we also work equally much with the system houses that integrate these chips and each would have an understanding of the insides of the chip and the software that runs on it. So it's actually a fairly broad field of companies that we touch that are deeply involved with FinFET. ","Srini Sundar","Just one last question, your service revenues for Q1 seem to be the lowest among the last nine quarters. Any particular reason for that? ","Aart de Geus","The services line? It's right in the range, Srini, so when you look at the services line, it's a relatively flat at 61 versus the last quarter. And the nature of that business, that's where a lot of our IP consulting business does flow through. So it can move around quarter-to-quarter depending on the revenue signature and the project schedules. ","Srini Sundar","Okay. Thank you very much for taking my questions. Thanks.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And there is no one left in queue to ask a question. I would like to turn it back to the speakers for any closing remarks.","Aart de Geus","Well, again, thank you very much for attending our earnings release. I think the first quarter was particularly positive as a start to the year and I think many of the issues that were alluded to last year actually quite mitigated. And so we have a strong outlook going forward. Thank you again for your time and we'll be available after the call for the analysts.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our fiscal second-quarter results were very strong and solidify our expectations for the full-year. In summary, business was robust in all key areas. After many years of investment and innovation we launched several important new products including a game changer in digital design. And we closed the acquisition of Coverity bringing us into the emerging market of software quality, test and security.","Highlighting our financial results; we delivered revenue of $518 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65 and a $112 million in operating cash flow. For the year, we\u2019re now including the impacts of the Coverity in our guidance. Based on the combination of solid organic business and the impact of purchase accounting on Coverity, we expect 2014 revenue of $2.050 billion to $2.075 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50. We are also raising our operating cash flow guidance to a range of $450 million to $475 million primarily reflecting strong collections in the organic business. ","If you look at the customer landscape, we see continued focus on balancing the drive for better faster differentiated products with a continued caution around cost. If there is any change in our customer\u2019s mindset, it is the mounting pressure to develop and utilize a more and more advanced technology. In addition, companies are relying more on complex software to differentiate their products. And their customers are becoming less and less tolerant of software with quality and security effect. ","Synopsys is uniquely positioned to be the partner of choice for companies facing these challenges. With our technical expertise, standing all the way from deep silicon to the hardware software intersection to software, we now deal to nearly all companies that utilize technology to drive their business. Our edit emphasis on software not only extends our business opportunity along the path, that our existing customers are taking, but also engages a broad set of new companies across the industry spectrum. ","Synopsys is one of the deepest high-tech companies in the world and we deliver some of the most sophisticated software ever built. With Coverity, we\u2019ve entered a market segment that now needs and will benefit from the same level of technical depth. This changes our outlook considerably as it is opening our broadest customer base ever.","Let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with leadership in core EDA, which was marked by some product introductions that can be rated among the most important in the decade. The first of those, IC COMPILER II is the game changing successor to IC COMPILER, today\u2019s industry-leading place-and-route solution. Several years ago, we\u2019ve tasked our team to drive an order of magnitude leap in productivity by developing a complete new architecture and algorithm while in parallel continuing advances in our existing IC COMPILER flagship product. ","The team has succeeded well beyond my expectations. IC COMPILER II is truly transformative and features like measurable 10X faster throughputs. 10X now 10% is in an astounding accomplishment, introduced at our March users group meeting, key partners such as Imagination, LSI, Panasonic, NSD told attendees about their early use and independently confirmed the magnitude of the results.","While IC Compiler II will officially shipped as a full system in July as it\u2019s already contributed to production designs at early partners and we have received confirmation of several successful tape-outs. Needless to say, there is significant interest and demand which we are managing carefully to ensure seamless adoption and success for early customers. The timing of this breakthrough coincides perfectly with our technology push into advance FinFET supporting all of the capabilities needed for absolute state of the art design of very complex devices. Incidentally the breakthrough algorithmic advances also benefit hard driving designs at well established notes such as 28, 40 and 65 nanometer; for example where 10X throughput improvements are economically just as meaningful. We\u2019re also making excellent progress in our custom digital co-design and one to engagements over the incumbent for our custom FinFET solutions.","Moving to verification, we announced a major step in our roadmap towards redefining this market segment and giving customers a next generation end-to-end solution that does not exists today. Specifically in March, we introduced Verification Compiler which features complete access to old verification technology needed in a single product including industry leading stimulation and debug. In addition, verification complier includes brand new static and formal technologies that are 3 to 5x faster than anything on the market. On top of that, key verification ID significantly completes and accelerates the verification of crucial ID structures. All of this is tightly integrated to deliver 3x productivity improvement for customers\u2019 increasingly compact circuits.","The result of the massive development and integration project set by both organically developed and acquired technology, verification complier is a great first step on a multiyear roadmap to revolutionize verification. On the hardware side, we introduced our next generation emulator ZeBu Server-3 it\u2019s the industry\u2019s fastest system with the highest capacity available today. Customers such as AMD and Freescale have already adopted our new solution, citing benefits and shortening verification time and meeting accelerated software development and validation schedules.","Although application vision and the innovations recently introduced are triggering partnerships with key customers and one world leader already made a major commitment for long term collaboration with us this quarter. Now to IP, where demand is strong evidenced by record orders in the quarter as the leader interface memory analog and physical IT and the number of two IT play overall Synopsys continues to benefit from our customers move to outsourcing more and more complex IT driving our success our unmatched product quality breadth that enables design teams to centralize a substantial portion of their purchases with us and almost 2,000 engineers on the leading edge of technology development.","Even the few customers who have resolutely help onto internal development are we examining their strategy and are increasingly selected Synopsys of their partner. One of the few major semiconductor companies who have not previously purchased our IP for the number of interface blocks this quarter as a first step towards a broader outsourcing effort. In Q2, we announced two major new IP titles a new USB 2.0 and 3.05 that reduces area by 50% over the previous generation and the industry\u2019s first LPDDR4 memory controller. A couple of years ago we began offering the next level of IP, complete subsystems. They include elements such as interface blocks low power processors memories and software all optimized for a particular application.","One example is our sensor subsystem which is gaining good traction in the Internet of Thing space. Our FPGA base and virtual prototyping products also continue to do very well. We just announced a multiyear center of excellence collaboration with Freescale to speed development of automotive electronic systems software. And driving the future in prototyping, we collaborated with industry leaders to publish a seminal book on advanced software development with virtual prototypes. The titles says it better software faster. Using real-life case studies allow mobile, consumer, industrial and automotive partners, the book offers practical guidelines for accelerating project schedules. ","We\u2019ve already had little over 1,000 downloads in just a few weeks. Better software faster is precisely the mission of our new business group. After just two months the acquisition of Coverity is showing great promise. As a refresher, Coverity products are central in the software creation lifecycle. Our tools are dramatically test source code for software defects that can lead to product crashes, unexpected behavior, security breaches or catastrophic system failures. In contrast to traditionally running the code and waiting for bugs to appear our tools find details by sophisticated formal inspection of the code itself. About half of Coverity\u2019s business is with our current customers although addressing different users and different budget. The rest extends well beyond catering to independent software vendors, ecommerce and industries as wide ranging as energy, industrial and financial services. The strategic Coverity acquisition does significantly expands our talent and customer base. Within the broad automated software quality space, which analysts size at approximately 2.5 billion, Coverity is the leader in the sub-segment called software quality analysis and measurement? IDC sizes this segment at approximately 500 million with estimated 2017 market revenue of nearly 1 billion. Our goal is to build a substantial presence in this space over the years similar to what we did first with EDA than IP. To that end last week, we announced the small acquisition Kalistick that expands our reach beyond software developers to quality assurance while bringing a number of cloud capabilities to Coverity.","Results to-date have been very encouraging. Orders were slightly better than expected in Coverity\u2019s first six weeks at Synopsys. The team is running on all cylinders, already driving increased lead generation and closing a number of growth renewal opportunities. Our objective is to determine the right level of integration by the end of the Synopsys fiscal year to maximize our brand and channel leverage while optimizing for the specific needs of this exciting market. Due to the purchase accounting impact on deferred revenue, we expect Coverity to contribute $20 million to $25 million in revenue and the approximately $0.10 to $0.13 dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this year. Without the purchase accounting impact, Coverity would already be accretive this year. We reiterate that we expect it to reach breakeven in the second half of 2015 and be accretive in 2016 and beyond.","In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter with some extraordinarily high impacting product introductions in the core of our business, strong business and demand for sophisticated IP and a great entry into the software quality test and security market with excellent execution of the on-boarding of Coverity. Well, having made big strive in further differentiating our core business, we are also well on our way to diversifying the company into new areas and feel that we are executing well on the growth strategy we have communicated to you a number of years ago. Let me now turn the call over to Brian Beattie.","Brian Beattie ","","Thank you, Aart and good afternoon everyone. In my comments today, I will summarize our financial results for the quarter and provide you with guidance for Q3 and the full year of 2014. In my discussions, all of my comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Now Synopsys delivered a very strong quarter highlighted by strong business levels and considerable cash flow generation. Additionally, we continued our stock repurchase program and completed the Coverity acquisition and two smaller tuck-in deals. Total revenue was $518 million, above our target range. As expected revenue from the Coverity product sales were very modest, reflecting the standard purchase accounting haircut that was applied to deferred revenue during the first six weeks as part of Synopsys and I will say more about this later.","About 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and we have one 10% customer. The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments for the quarter was about 2.8 years. We continue to expect weighted average duration for FY14 to be approximately three years. Turning to expenses now, Q2 total GAAP cost and expenses were $454 million which included $32 million of amortization of intangible assets and $19 million of stock-based compensation. Q2 total non-GAAP cost and expenses were $393 million, slightly above our Q2 guidance due to the Coverity acquisition. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24% for the quarter and 23.4% for the first half of fiscal 2014.","Turning now to earnings, GAAP earnings per share were $0.40, non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.65 exceeding our target range even with the $0.02 dilution from Coverity. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 19% for the quarter below our target due primarily to a more favorable geographic mix than forecasted. As a result, we think that the non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21% is a reasonable estimate for FY14. ","Now turning to our cash flow, during the quarter, we generated 112 million in cash from operations and are raising our operating cash flow target for the year to $450 million to $475 million. We ended the quarter with total debt of $290 million which includes $200 million from our revolver due to the Coverity acquisition. We also repaid $7.5 million of our outstanding term loan leaving a remaining balance of $90 million.","During the quarter we purchased 628,000 shares of Synopsys stock for $25 million. During the first half of the fiscal year, we spent $80 million, repurchasing approximately 2.1 million shares and have $420 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of 822 million with 18% onshore and 82% offshore. DSO was 57 days reflecting strong business levels and the timing of invoices. We ended Q2 with approximately 9,100 employees with over one-third in lower cost geographies and approximately 325 of the additional employees were from our Q2 acquisitions.","Now a couple of additional words about Coverity product sales. For reporting purposes you\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve adjusted our financial supplement to reflect the inclusion of Coverity products in an updated product group we call IP and software solutions. While we\u2019re not breaking up Coverity product sales, we are on track with expected $20 million to $25 million of revenue in FY14 as we work through the deferred revenue haircut.","Without the impact of deferred revenue haircut FY14 contribution from Coverity would have been approximately $24 million higher and would have been accretive on a non-GAAP basis in 2014. At closing Coverity had $69 million of deferred revenue of which 69% or $47 million will not be recognized due to standard purchase accounting. The majority of the haircut occurs in the first two years with a small amount extending beyond that. So as a result we continue to expect that Coverity will reach breakeven on a non-GAAP basis in the second half of 2015.","At a corporate level, we continue to manage the company with a multi-year goal of high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth, contributing that is core EDA revenue growth generally in the low to mid single-digits, IP and software solutions revenue growth generally in the low double-digits, operating margin in the mid 20s, exploration of value and expanding M&A and optimizing use of our strong cash flow through a balance of M&A stock buybacks and debt reduction.","So now let\u2019s address have third quarter and fiscal 2014 guidance which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter of FY14 our targets are revenue between $515 million and $525 million. Total GAAP cost and expenses between $450.5 million and $471 million, which includes approximately $20 million of stock based compensation expense. Total non-GAAP cost and expenses between $400 million and $410 million. Other income and expense between $1 million and negative million, on a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 20%, outstanding shares between 155 and 159 million. GAAP earnings of $0.30 to $0.38 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.60 to $0.62 per share.","Now our fiscal 2014 outlook. Revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.075 billion. Other income expense between $10 million and $12 million, non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 21%, outstanding shares between $155 million and $159 million. GAAP earnings per share of $1.55 to $1.68 which includes the impact of approximately $79 million in stock based compensation expense. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50 reflecting the expected $0.10 to $0.13 dilution from Coverity partially offset by our Q2 over achievements.","Return to capital expenditures to approximately $115 million and we\u2019re now targeting cash flow from operation of $450 million to 475 million. So in summary we\u2019re pleased with our very good second quarter financial performance and continued execution. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll begin with the line of Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera - Needham & Company","","I had a question on ICC II, was hoping to get some sense of the potential financial impact from this. I was wondering first you could say if it\u2019s a maintenance upgrade or if you\u2019ll get incremental revenue when customers upgrade to it. And then how do you expect it to sort of roll out to your customer base? It sounds like general release in July but how would we expect this to roll out to your entire customer sort of timing and how that might affect bookings and revenue as we look out over the next couple of year?","Aart de Geus","First this is not the maintenance upgrade, this is a new product. The only refinement on that statement is that we have a number of customers that can have access to new technology provided that they buy off the price list at that point in time and so they can replace existing products with the new products which will bring new revenue opportunities for us. But also brings fabulous leverage for the customer because it is truly dramatically better.","So from that perspective it is a product that\u2019s priced higher but also valued much higher than what we have, which is arguably already the best on the market. Having said that the adoption rate I expect to be quite fast, because when you have that level of productivity improvement and of course we have tried to design it so that the changeover issues are very minimal, you can very quickly move to the new product. People that are on the constant pressure to get to better design sooner -- we are immediately intrigued by us, I think that\u2019s why we have already lot of demand. Nonetheless, we will pay high degree of attention to make sure that the early customers do very well and get good results and are very well supported. And we do that with all new products and actually all new releases to make sure that we feather them in but the interest is certainly super high right now. ","Richard Valera - Needham & Company","Question on EVE, you have been fairly quiet about EVE since you bought it a bit ago and now you\u2019ve done a lot of work, sort of integrating into verification compiler and you\u2019ve got ZeBu 3 out, so just wondering; one, wouldn\u2019t expect that there has been a lot of growth there, just due to last commentary that could be mistaken, so I would be happy to get your thoughts on that. But two, do you see that product is maybe reinvigorated and having a better sort of medium term growth outlook than it may be had in the past, your thoughts?","Aart de Geus","Excellent question; it\u2019s actually one year - the absolute capabilities of the product itself, and -- multiple generations of this product, and two, the degree of integration in our offering. What we just announced this quarter was really the next generation of the product. So a product that is substantially faster again for substantially higher capacity; the integration has many-many ramifications. We actually did not say all that much about it. And we have made excellent progress there, but we have still more work to do. And I would say, stay tuned on what will be coming there because there are a lot of capabilities that will be leveraged by a much better degree of integration.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company","Well enough, and Brian, question for you on the revenue guidance. At the risk of splitting hairs here, if you look at the midpoint of your old and new revenue guidance for the year, you are up $15 million you guided to $20 million to $25 million from Coverity, so you know that would imply sort of down $5 million to $10 million in the base business. Is that accurate math, and might sort of this rounding, just wanted to get your take on that.","Brian Beattie","I would look kind of, Rich, this is just a narrowing of the range, given again we had good momentum for the first six months. We feel very comfortable on our Outlook now with only six months left to go. We see a fact that our run rate is up, and it\u2019s really effectively narrowing of the range, and again the Coverity piece is performing exactly as we expected, even slightly ahead in the first six weeks.","Richard Valera - Needham & Company","Brain, just wanted to understand, you gave some nice color on Coverity sort of with and without deferred and that color suggested roughly 50% deferred haircut in the sort of seven-month contribution this year which seems quite high. Is there anything unusual about their business model and how do you view that level of deferred haircut relative sort of a typical acquisition in the type of business?","Brian Beattie","Yes, we see actually based on all the valuation and work that we did and our third parties did a 69% haircut on the overall deferred revenues that we acquired at the beginning of the company. As you know just the accounting rules are that you do get to keep the cost to generating that revenue going forward plus there is more margin, and in a way the good news is that the cost of ongoing is not that significant. And therefore the haircut at 69% is typically a little bit higher than what we would see. We also saw the deferred revenues being a little bit higher relative to the annual run rates in companies we have acquired in the past have had. Explaining those two factors have combined to slightly higher deferred revenue haircut than what we\u2019ve seen in the past.","Operator","I\u2019ll now go to the line of Krish Sankar with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch; please go ahead.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Thanks for taking my question, actually have a few of them. The IC COMPILER II definitely seems very interesting and exciting for you guys. Just trying to figure out, you guys don\u2019t breakout your current IC COMPILER product which is probably part of your core EDA revenue. But do you think the IC COMPILER II could be $100 million revenue product next year?","Aart de Geus","Actually you said, you felt we don\u2019t breakout the individual product, but there is no question that IC COMPILER will, I think fairly rapidly be added on top of IC COMPILER or replace a number of IC COMPILERS that are in utilization today because it has really the ability to do the same amount of work in literally a fraction of the time. And it is interesting by the way to see how different customers use the capability very differently. Some say, well, now I can go to market faster, but there are also quite a number that say, oh now because of that I can actually do more optimization and bring out some more area or some more speed and thus make my product either lower cost, lower silicon cost of higher performance, that\u2019s higher differentiation. It\u2019s always intriguing to see how when one provide something that is truly radically better; the ways that which it gets used is not always predictable. The reason am sharing this is because we have already very good evidence of the very good results from multiple customers and so I expect it to be phased into utilization very rapidly. From an economic point of view this is all part of our usual three year ratable model. And we expects and hope that this will utilize up a little faster the contracts that we have in place with customers and that\u2019s always an opportunity to grow our business.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Got it Aart that\u2019s very helpful and I just had a couple of more questions. The last earnings call you guys kind of like flick verity you guys didn\u2019t done your full year revenue little bit because FinFET customers are seeing some kind of like push outs in the schedule. So I am kind of curious what the status is now do you think they\u2019ve been working to the issues or do you think that it\u2019s still going to be a while before you start seeing those revenues slowing for you?","Aart de Geus","No actually we see a lot of business around FinFET and partially because we are not just working with customers also part of putting place to their ecosystem that\u2019s necessary in order to do advanced FinFET design and what I mean with that our the IP that is necessary around that and a number of the stores that are looking at the yields optimization. And so you\u2019re absolutely right that a number of the providers of FinFET technology did a number of adjustments to their schedules but also to the competitiveness of their product. And so the race is absolutely on among the people providing the silicon and what we can see is that there typically two groups there is a group that is already moving massively to FinFET because they have either the super high volume or the technology needs of a very large transits account and low power and then there is a group that is saying well I am going to wait at 28 nanometer, which is exactly behaving as we have predicted already a year ago, and is going to be a big note, and then there are a number of people that even use older technologies but really squeeze them for economic benefit. And so it\u2019s sort of advanced design at every node at this point in time but our tools have had big impact on all of these nodes because productivity enhancements lay everywhere. So from that perspective we see a lot of intense investments and a number of people essentially jockeying for being in the lead position from a technology point of view and this year we\u2019ll see a lot of design.","Krish Sankar - Bank of America, Merrill Lynch","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. And then the final question is that obviously there is a lot of M&A means the question I asked in the past in terms of capital allocation and you\u2019re doing like I guess like minimum buybacks every quarter. Is this still the plan or is there a plan to get more aggressive on the buybacks or maybe consider dividend down the road?","Brian Beattie","Yeah, we\u2019ve been very clear around for many years as the priority relative to our capital structure has been on new tam creation or value and earnings generation through M&A and we have put the balance sheet to work and particularly is we look at our past quarter with Coverity, we did spend total of about $368 million in our second quarter and also did a small buyback. So again our priorities are in that order of M&A first, buyback second and our debt repayment and that\u2019s how we plan to continue to deploy and just look continue to look at all the options in front of us from quarter to quarter.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now go to the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Chase & Co","So in your prepared remarks you kind of talked about the pressure at the customers have in terms of the technology side but still being balanced within cost tranches I guess what I\u2019d like to hear is in summary do you feel that your customers\u2019 buying behavior or buying position is in a healthier position today than where it was with the at the end of last year?","Aart de Geus","Yeah, I think if you look at the chart that sort of look at semiconductor growth rates at variety of confidence meters they all look a little bit better than last year. I am maybe cautious just because I have seen so many of these for many years and so when we say they look a little bit better than means that A people are right now forecasting the second half of the year little bit higher growth in semiconductors and B the confidence send the access up by 3% or 4%. Now 3% to 4% when you\u2019re below 50 or above 50 is all the difference between seeing good weather or bad weather and from that perspective I think that people do feel a little bit better but they are just as experienced as I am in terms of many years and so they remain careful because these all big decisions.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Chase & Co","Sure. Switching over to IC Complier II, how is the pricing of that compared to IC Complier on an apples-to-apples basis?","Aart de Geus","Well the IC Complier II is priced higher and there is a variety of prices because there is a variety of configuration of the system including different configuration for different computer situations and we don\u2019t disclose all the details of that. But obviously we do it in such a fashion that the value that the customer get is many times higher than the increase in pricing so that at the end of the day hopefully both the customer and ourselves are happy campers in this equation and that\u2019s they feel very compelled to moved to this new technology because it will have good impact on them. But this is clearly a case where there is no question that there is massively more value this is not an incremental 1.3x or 1.4x better which by the way we deliver at least every year, so we have always been on a fast treadmill. This is really an order of magnitude and that just changes the whole equation of utilization going forward.","Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co","","What portion of the IC complier installed base is not on a contract where they could trade into it by just buying the or paying the price differentials? So in other words, what portion of the IC complier installed base, if they do decide to move, would end up paying the full price?","Aart de Geus","","I actually don\u2019t know the answer to that, my guess would be not all that many but in general that has never been an impairment for people to move or start spending more money, if there is more value. So, the ability to upgrade from IC complier one is often there in the contracts but the ability to upgrade from other products is really there.","Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co","","On Coverity, can you remind us what the contract structure is there, where I am typically wondering about how quickly the deferred revenue that you have written-off may come back into the income statement as you go through contract renewal?","Aart de Geus","","Well, the first comment would be and this was part of the earlier question of, so why is the haircut bigger than what we normally see on company. Well, this was a company that was very aggressively trying to use the revenue as soon as possible in order to be able to invest in high growth. This is a great opportunity space and we will continue to try to do that at the same time we have very disciplined typically three year contract horizon. We are in the process of learning what is actually the optimal contract configuration for Coverity, as they are in the different space, software people do behave differently. And one of the reasons we are cautious before we make a lot of changes to their business is because we want to first learn what they have done to do it so well and if there are improvements or if there are things that we can apply that we have learned in our ability to scale, is we should certainly apply those because this is business that is eminently scalable.","Sterling Auty - JP Morgan Chase & Co","","Last question, will you maintain or expand the Coverity sales force because it sounds like it\u2019s a different touch point even within your existing customers to sale that?","Aart de Geus","","Well we will certainly retain all the sales people. We have some very, very good people there. How we structure it is precisely part of the decision process between now and the end of our fiscal year because that\u2019s sort of a natural point to decide to what extent we integrate or not and maybe sophisticated path in the middle to take advantage of some of the practices that have been particularly good at and take advantage of some of the brand position and the company position at Synopsys is on a worldwide basis that is much more comprehensive. So, maybe it\u2019s a long answer to say, we don\u2019t know the answer to your question yet because we are in the process of rapidly learning.","Operator","","We will now go to line of Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes, good afternoon. I guess first small question for Brian, when you look at the EPS upside in the quarter despite the slight negative impact of Coverity. Was the upside primarily driven by taxes or was there another component that was quite beneficial?","Brian Beattie ","","Well our revenues came in very strong in a quarter towards the higher end of what we have anticipated, so that helped us out as well. The spending, again as we are managing towards that EPS number for this year, even with a little bit of headwind, we have talked about back in Q1, we are still committed to making that earnings per share that we have addressed earlier. So, we have been watching our expenses very closely. And then the third point is as you mentioned, our tax rate and the geographic mix which does take into account the impact of our acquisitions and where they are located has provided a favorable geographical mix of our pretax income. And of course we have to catch up in our second quarter on a year-to-date basis to make that entry as well. So, all that contributed to very attractive tax rate for us and we see that in terms of very attractive tax rate for the entire 2014. So, overall that\u2019s how we contributed. We had a great start to the year to get us on track and you can see that confidence in the full year guidance.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then when you look at your cash level, I think you mentioned that it was 18% onshore. Is there a minimum level of cash you would like to have onshore when considering your potential acquisitions or share repurchasing?","Brian Beattie ","","Yes, there is Tom. We actually used that this past quarter, so we have about a $120 million of tax in the U.S. and that is healthy amount based on any of our commitments that we have elsewhere. So, that\u2019s the kind of a $120 million is a good minimum U.S. onshore tax rate and for the purposes of the acquisition again very specific purpose. We borrowed a very low cost interest rate of about 1.3% and we are able to use that to leverage up the capabilities in the company. And again, our discipline is traditionally to pay that off over some period of time probably by the end of the year and again we will see our U.S. balance growing up a little bit.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co."," ","Okay. Are you seeing\u2026","Aart de Geus","I think he meant cash rates right Brian, cash rate not tax rate.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Yes.","Aart de Geus","","That 120 million tax rate, you meant cash.","Brian Beattie ","","In the cash.","Aart de Geus","","Sorry.","Brian Beattie ","","Cash dollars yes.","Aart de Geus","","We are team here.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And have you seen a potential for more offshore type acquisitions out there most of which you look at is U.S. based?","Aart de Geus","No we look at many things all the time and as you can imagine we don\u2019t communicate much about that ahead of times. But if you take not that long ago we did two major acquisitions off shore, one was SpringSoft the other was EVE and so the reality of worldwide taxation is such that we do distinguish between the different locations of the cash and we have to take that into account when we plan forward.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","But you see plenty of other candidates out there that are on offshore basis?","Aart de Geus","One never sees plenty, one look at plenty and look at many bite you.","Aart de Geus","Tom we did three deals overall in Q2 and one significant one was U.S. based but the other two were in Europe, so again we continue to see opportunities for investing outside the country as well.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay great. And then when you look at the IP part of the business, have you seen an increase in competition in that space since you guys like Cadence have got little more aggressive?","Aart de Geus","Well anytime there is more competition one sees that immediately and we consider that just part of a market that is actually growing very well. And so in that context Synopsys continues to do well and last quarter was a very good example of that. But competition just tries the state of the art forward faster and that is part of why we\u2019re an extraordinary industry.","Tom Diffely - D.A. Davidson & Co.","It sounds like there is some pretty strong growth in the next couple of years as the industry moves towards more of an outsourced model. Beyond that do you see the actual IP market itself growing or is it mainly just the outsourcing portion of it that\u2019s the growth driver?","Aart de Geus","Well that\u2019s an excellent question because obviously initially it is outsourcing and we Synopsys have already seen multiple different ways from outsourcing stuff that anybody could design to outsourcing things that are reasonably difficult to design and where it really becomes a build versus buy decision for the customer to now outsourcing blocks that are extremely complex to build. And then on top of that extremely complex to build on the most advanced silicon technology. And so in that sense some of the Synopsys intellectual property is highly differentiated already today.","So that itself is half of the answer because as people outsource more things, they also now increasingly get access to building blocks that previously would not have been able to build themselves, and I think that changes a bit the very nature of design especially in light that many of these building blocks themselves are sort of almost mini computers and therefore they come with embedded software and the opportunity for the customer to differentiate themselves more and more with the layers of software on top of that.","That all sounds maybe a little complex but complexity is precisely what feeds certainly Synopsys business. And so the IP I think is a great contributor towards the next decade of very sophisticated chip design.","Operator","And we\u2019ll now go to line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","","The first question is on IC Compiler II with the IC Compiler II you have been -- nicely have been able to drive higher value for Synopsys with this new version of the tool. So do you think as you release the new version of the other tools in the simulation market prototype other segments that you could also drive higher value than previous generation of those tools?","Aart de Geus","Well that has been our life long objective of course as a company, in many if you look back for just a second I think it\u2019s fair to say that Synopsys is certainly one of the reasons Moore\u2019s law has prospered so well on the design side we have continued to support it. Going forward we absolutely see at least another decade of continuation of complexity and that involves doing exactly what we just did with all these tools, which is dramatic new improvement in light of sophisticated new technology challenges coming our way.","And so just to clarify also an answer from earlier, many of our customers when they buy into one of our advanced tools, such as IC Compiler they really buy into Synopsys. And the assurance that they will be able to stay up to date and in many cases they do contracts that allow them to get the next version of the tool. And of course if there is a change in price for the next version of the tool they will have to pay for that difference. But it makes it for a smooth outlook and a high degree of assurance to have low risk transitions and get the best technology at any point in time.","This applies not only tow the implementations though it absolutely applies also the verification flow and with verification Compiler this is another example of fairly radical new improvement while at the same time putting together multiple capabilities at originally were partially available only in isolation, so individual products. And from a value point of view this is a very high value because if you use a simulator and you want to very quickly debunk something simulate again maybe verify some of the aspects by using the verification IP. This is all available in one product that granted will be more expensive than just a simulator but from a value per price ratio is enormously attractive for the customer so fundamentally our job is to -- pardon the expression techonomically both the technical and economic match more as well everybody of the week and so far we\u2019ve done that.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Thanks. I think we should now have on the EVE -- is it the hardware upgrade or is it software upgrade? And then could talk about what do you think is the installed base of EVE and do you think those people now since you have a new generation of the tool will upgrade that? And maybe you could -- sorry go ahead.","Aart de Geus","Sure, so the EVE ZeBu Server-3 is a complete new hardware machine. Now with the hardware comes in an enormous amount of software because this is -- this is very complex device that essentially maps the design that one wants to simulate on the internal hardware structure of that machine. And so the upgrades of both hardware and software but this is truly a new machine. Now a number of people essentially when they add machines, they decide which generation they want to add and mostly people will gravitate fairly quickly to the most advanced machines because they\u2019re too the value per price invariably is the best ratio. We see an opportunity to sell more and actually you\u2019ve heard from my preamble that we have already a number of customers that are moving in that direction.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest","Maybe could you take a stab at where do you think your market share in emulation can be? I mean it has lagged to the other two guys of the market.","Aart de Geus","Yes, we\u2019ve never disclosed installed base or market share. At this point in time, we\u2019re clearly the number three in the markets so that\u2019s another way of say there is a lot of opportunity. ","Operator","Okay, we\u2019ll now to line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities","Thanks. Good afternoon. Aart a geographic question for you first. Would it be fair to say that the very substantial sequential and year-over-year increase in Asia-Pac revenues were highly correlated to the increase you saw in your IT and software solutions business. And if that was the case, do you think that the disproportionate growth or consumption of IT is Asia-Pac can continue? Also in that part of the world do you may recall that a quarter ago we talked about the possibility that Japan might be bottoming for EDA though that\u2019s not yet ready to inflect higher but in the quarter you saw further decline in the Japan business, was that currency for the structural weakness or what you\u2019re thinking now about some possible bottoming for EDA in that part of the world?","Aart de Geus","Sure, so let me take them in reverse order. Japan actually it is not a decline of our business. The numbers that you see here are currency related. Now there is no question that Japan is sort of going through the hopefully the end of the their two last decades because enormous amount of change happening in the country in general and specifically in the high tech and semiconductor markets you see number of consolidations you see a number of things changing. Synopsys is now particularly well there and we expect that to continue and certainly hope that the technical talent that\u2019s in Japan will find now a renewal phase given that their sophistication is actually quite high and connecting more to the world market is really the opportunity there. Talking about Asia-Pac, I think there are many elements there because Asia-Pac of course on one hand is a number of countries that have been highly technical for many years specifically Taiwan and Korea.","And now at same time have China becoming a larger and larger in terms of its role of utilization but also in developments of chips and absorption of chips domestically. And so that country of course has come later to the high tech market and what we invariably see when new countries come to any field is that they almost immediately start on whatever the latest design methodology is. So there the question was not so much outsourcing of design one used to do it\u2019s just outsourcing periods meaning you start write away with building blocks that are commercially available and one grows firm there. And so I think the opportunity space is very good for us there as we expect that market will continue to grow and it\u2019s on mythologies that\u2019s Synopsys has a lot to offer in. And so I think that AP will be - continues to be a strong market.","Operator","Can you still hear? Okay then our last set of questions then will come from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Thank you. Brian, question on the offshore cash. What is your plan for that? My question more specifically, what do you expect the tax law changes to happen -- what do expect in terms of tax changes over the next couple of years and how does your strategy with the offshore cash change with that?","Aart de Geus","As I think earlier in terms of M&A opportunities and growth outside of the United States, we believe our cash that is outside this country will remain there permanently. We have 100% permanent reinvestment position on the tax side and that is just where we will keep that offshore and we can borrow domestically at a lower cost than what we have, but it also to point out there is not a significant amount of cash offshore we\u2019re talking $600 million to $700 million and we would expect that to continue there under the current tax regime.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets","Then one question for Aart in terms of your assumption for the core EDA growth of 3% to 5% where is that -- what are you assumption on that growth? Are you assuming the number of seats increasing or the content increasing? Can you elaborate on that one and maybe also talk about why can\u2019t we get a higher growth rate considering the rising complexity and consolidated supply base? I would think that you should be able to get better growth rate than what you\u2019re forecasting for core EDA?","Aart de Geus","Okay let me go backward on that on the growth rate first. I think it\u2019s always little bit difficult to predict exactly where this ends up, but clearly we are for the core of that business inside of the semiconductor industry and so the semiconductor industry now 3-4 years in a row has had the growth rate of 2% to 3%. So in that sense we are getting a bigger share of that value change than our semiconductor customers at times. And that is the heart of where some of this challenges are it\u2019s not a question of can we offer more value and make more difference and I think overtime there is certainly an opportunity for EDA to continue to grow a higher rate than semiconductors. If we look at where the value goes, I think the number of design seats will grow gradually partially because in Asia-Pac for the earlier question there will be more and more designers coming on board.","But mostly the value goes into higher degree of absorption of multiple copies of the same tools for the same engineer and that\u2019s mostly limited by the cost of the hardware to run it on. And so that sort of the balance of the equation, now I would add one more thing for us which is new and in the few quarters will gradually I think communicate more to you as we learn more is the fact that for the first time in our existence are certainly in our recently existence - we have a dramatically broader potential customer base. Meaning people we\u2019ve never talked to and that is because as we enter or as we know have entered with the leadership position in the quality test and security verification of software.","We are talking too many companies that do software that is not visibly liked to semiconductors because they\u2019re running things on the computers. Now you can argue computers are semiconductors but the fact is most of those people do extremely complex project with all the challenges of errors and bugs and maintenance and you have what not and they are now needing increasingly the same level of quality that semiconductors have needed already 20 years ago. And so from that perspective, our outlook is going to be positively enhanced by the fact that first time we can talk to the customers that we have never met in the first place. So there is also a lot of learning but also opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Please continue.","Aart de Geus","Well, I think we\u2019re at the top of the hour which is sort of our cutoff point. Thank you so much for attending our earnings release. I hope that you took away that we have the strong results with a lot of exciting moving parts specifically great-great advances on the technology side and a broadening of the total TAM that Synopsys is looking at. And those are certainly exciting developments looking at our future and we hope to have your support going forward.

Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa K. Ewbank - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone.","Leading today's discussion are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys, and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts and targets and will make other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and today's earnings press release. The reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, the earnings press release, and financial supplement that we released earlier today.","All of these items plus the most recent Investor Presentation are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon. I'm happy to report that our second quarter results were very strong and solidify our outlook for the full year. We delivered revenue of $557 million, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 and $155 million in operation cash flow. We're raising the midpoint of our revenue guidance, with a range of $2.210 billion to $2.235 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS objective to a range of $2.76 to $2.81, double-digit growth at the midpoint.","Trac will discuss these results in more detail shortly. In the semiconductor and systems markets we serve, we continue to see unevenness in terms of business success, with some companies doing very well, while others are challenged, whether in particular verticals or geographies.","Nonetheless, firms continue to invest aggressively in advanced design to build the next great chip for the next great product. In that, they rely on Synopsys as a critical partner. These products feature the most complex electronic systems in the world, spanning the entire continuum of Silicon to Software. Ranging from ever-smaller transistors and abundant sensors, to the critical communication and supporting cloud infrastructures, to embedded software and more and more sophisticated applications, the resulting interactions between big data, communication, and computation are leading rapidly to the age of Smart Everything.","In the decade to come, advances in this space will again bring about unparalleled new capabilities that just a few years ago, felt like far-away science fiction. Synopsys is well positioned. Our EDA solutions enable the most advanced chips, our IP business greatly boosts designer productivity, and recently, our software quality and security tools address the complexity of both embedded and applications software, and thus expand our traditional TAM. In addition, our global teams are focused on exceptional customer relationships and differentiated technology support.","Building on this vision, last year, we launched a multi-year market strategy based on three pillars: First, build on our leadership in EDA by providing the state-of-the-art toolsets required to design the next generation of chips. Second, grow our IP offering as one of the highest-impact productivity mechanisms available to design highly complex chips under unrelenting time-to-market constraints. And third, invest in and grow our software quality and security solutions, as embedded software expands massively into next-generation electronic systems, and the security vulnerabilities of application software create more and more challenges in our day-to-day lives.","Let me provide some highlights on each of these, starting with EDA. The technical challenges facing semiconductor and systems companies are driving substantial investments in the most advanced, as well as more established, process geometries. The number of designs using power-efficient FinFET transistors at sizes as small as 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer, and 10-nanometer is growing rapidly, as leading-edge companies race forward.","The number of active FinFET designs and tape-outs to-date again grew almost 15% in just the last quarter, to well over 200. Synopsys is relied on for approximately 95% of these, and our momentum continues, as more and more enterprises commit to FinFET and count on us for success.","For example, last month, we announced TSMC certification for Synopsys design tools for 16-nanometer of FinFET Plus production, and for 10-nanometer early design starts. And during the quarter, we displaced a competitor at one of its traditional Asian strongholds accounts for advanced 14-nanometer and 16-nanometer nodes.","While leading-edge designs are moving as fast as possible to FinFET, many advanced designs continue to be on 28-nanometer, which is expected to have a long life cycle. Our innovations pioneered for advanced FinFET designs are also bringing remarkable benefits to 28-nanometer circuit, as well as to more established nodes such as 40-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and 90-nanometer.","Our custom design solution is also gaining strength, and in fact we successfully displaced the incumbent at a global medical device company, who is now using a complete Synopsys digital-and-custom flow.","Relevant here, and a year after its announcement, it's worth reporting on our new flagship place and route product: IC Compiler II. In a word, it's doing great. IC Compiler II has proven to be a true game-changer for a fast-growing group of customers. And we can report tremendous demand and excellent business momentum. We're currently already serving 32 customers with more than 70 in-progress design efforts. This is up 40% from last quarter. With more than 90 production designs and tape-outs, IC Compiler II is used on numerous process nodes from 40-nanometer, 28-nanometer to the most advanced 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer and 10-nanometers. These are production designs, not test chips.","Customers report that IC Compiler II is dramatically faster than any tool on the market today, including next generation offerings touted by competitors.","In a number of cases, we take half to just a quarter of the time of competitor tools \u2013 with runtimes of hours versus days. These runtimes are achieved while the quality of results reported by users is superior as well. In March, for example, Toshiba cited \"unprecedented runtime speedup and superior quality of results\" by IC Compiler II, as experienced on its 40-nanometer SoC tape-out. At our recent Users Group meeting here in Silicon Valley, customers including Toshiba, Renesas, MediaTek and ARM spoke about their successes with the tool.","From a business perspective, demand is very high, even in these early stages. And over the last three quarters, we've seen the fastest-ever ramp-up in orders for a new product. With our June release, which includes further enhanced functionality, IC Compiler II will be available to all customers.","Now moving to verification, where approximately 80% of advanced designs rely on the Synopsys solution as their primary simulator. Q2 was a record quarter for our verification tools, reflecting early momentum for our Verification Continuum Platform, with particularly strong results for our emulation system. Verification is the biggest bottleneck in chip design today.","To address this, our Verification Continuum platform contains all of the key capabilities, from our franchise VCS functional simulator, to static and formal analysis, to verification IP, to emulation and prototyping \u2013 all aligned on a common infrastructure, with best-in-class debugging. The platform was developed and continues to evolve in close collaboration with key customers. It has already been integral to large renewals and competitive wins.","We introduced the first components last year, including Verification Compiler, which integrates many of the software elements. Customer interest is high, as evidenced by adoption not only by chip companies, but also by several very large systems companies in the quarter. Here too, high-value additional features and further integration will roll-out through the rest of the year.","Let me now move to our second strategic priority of growing our IP and Prototyping product lines. The Synopsys IP value proposition is compelling. We are the number one supplier of interface, analog, memory, and physical semiconductor IP, with a reputation for highest quality, reliability, and technical excellence.","The business continues to grow, with our IP being used in the most complex chips in the world, from advanced FinFET processes to those targeting automotive, industrial and Internet of Things applications. Based on our very broad availability of proven FinFET IP, we have established clear leadership in FinFET IP development.","This quarter, for example, we announced immediate availability of our silicon-proven IP in TSMC's 16-nanometer of FinFET Plus processes. We also closed a significant agreement with another major foundry to enable broad Synopsys IP on multiple FinFET and 28-nanometer processes. Development of our 10-nanometer IP portfolio is in full swing with multiple customers and partners.","We've had a number of important customer wins, including Broadcom, which extended its license agreement providing access to Synopsys' ARC processors for an expanded range of advanced multimedia and networking designs. Meanwhile, electronics are getting smarter, enabling us to run our lives from wherever we are, at any time. Synopsys is at the forefront of delivering IP optimized for Smart Everything applications. For example, we announced a new embedded vision processor that enables designers to efficiently include capabilities such as object detection, gesture recognition and video surveillance in their products.","Our sensor subsystem is showing momentum, with multiple wins in the quarter with high-profile customers. To address this growing complexity, our prototyping tools enable accelerated software development, hardware\/software integration, and validation of the entire system. We're seeing good repeat orders for our HAPS FPGA prototyping system by companies developing leading-edge mobile SoCs, as well as adoption of our software-based solution in the automotive space.","Turning now to strategic priority number three: Grow our TAM by building a new adjacent business in software quality and security. A year after acquiring and integrating Coverity, we've learned the following: Coverity was a great acquisition, a compelling combination of the familiar and the new, and a platform we can build on. Specifically, we acquired excellent technology, the expanded customer base, and a brand new TAM.","In order to scale the operations to a grander level, it'll take ongoing investments in sales and marketing, as well as in R&D. We're confident in the opportunity in front of us, and understand how to leverage Synopsys' experience in scaling the business, and thus evolve a new growth engine.","Our strategy is to build a compelling and differentiated platform through mainly organic investments in the quality space, and a combination of organic and M&A investments in the security space. To that end, we're expanding our position in software security with the acquisition of Codenomicon, a leader in the area of dynamic security analysis, and well-known for independently discovering the infamous Heartbleed bug. With this acquisition, which is expected to close during Q3, Synopsys can deliver a more comprehensive security offering for the software development lifecycle.","To reflect our expanded presence, we've given the business group a new name, Software Integrity Group, which conveys our focus on software quality and security to help our customers develop complex software with rock-solid integrity. We expect the Software Integrity Group to be slightly dilutive in the second half of the year. Nonetheless, we are raising our overall guidance, reflecting strength in our overall business.","In summary, Q2 was a strong quarter, which solidifies our outlook for the year. Financially, we delivered excellent results and are raising our annual revenue midpoint and non-GAAP EPS guidance range. We see clear momentum with our new implementation and verification products, where we're still in the early stages of a multi-year upgrade cycle. And our acquisition in the software security space will expand our presence in this highly important area.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac Pham.","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Aart. And good afternoon, everyone. As reflected in our excellent Q2 financial results, we are seeing good momentum and strong execution in our business. We met or exceeded all quarterly financial targets provided last quarter. We delivered growth in revenue and non-GAAP earnings and generated considerable cash flow. Based on the strength of the first half and our confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising our 2015 outlook for revenue and non-GAAP earnings and reaffirming operating cash flow.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through Q2 results and targets for the rest of the year, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 8% to $557 million, reflecting solid organic and acquired-company growth. Greater than 90% of Q2 revenue came from beginning-of-quarter backlog, and one customer accounted for more than 10%.","The weighted average duration of our renewable customer license commitments was about 2.5 years. Duration will vary depending on customer requirements. We expect full year duration to be close to three years.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $481 million. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $420 million, at the lower end of our range, due largely to some delayed hiring. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.7%. Aligning with the multi-year strategy Aart outlined, we'll continue to drive company-wide operational discipline in order to fund our higher-growth initiatives. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.68.","Turning to cash flow. We generated $155 million of operating cash flow and continue to target approximately $450 million for the year. We ended the quarter with total debt of $220 million. This includes $160 million from our revolver, which we used to fund the $180 million accelerated share repurchase in Q1, and $60 million from our term loan. As a reminder, the ASR is expected to be completed this quarter when the final shares are delivered.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments of $1 billion, with 15% onshore. Yesterday, we renewed and expanded our credit facility to $500 million. The revolver, which may be increased by an additional $150 million, provides excellent flexibility to support our strategy and business operations. We'll continue to optimize the use of cash to generate maximum long-term shareholder value. Each quarter, we will evaluate our M&A, buyback and debt reduction options to determine the best balance.","DSO was 55 days and we ended Q2 with approximately 9,450 employees, with more than one third in lower-cost geographies.","Now to our third quarter and fiscal 2015 guidance, which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For the third quarter, our targets are: revenue between $550 million and $560 million, total GAAP costs and expenses between $481 million and $501 million, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $430 million and $440 million, other income between zero and $2 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 21% to 22%, outstanding shares between 155 million to 159 million, GAAP earnings of $0.23 to $0.30 per share, and non-GAAP earnings of $0.58 to $0.60 per share.","For Fiscal 2015: revenue between $2.21 billion to $2.235 billion, a growth rate of approximately 7% to 9%, other income between $6 million and $10 million, a non-GAAP tax rate of 19% to 20%, outstanding shares between 155 million and 159 million, GAAP earnings of $1.39 to $1.49 per share, which includes the impact of approximately $85 million of stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP earnings of $2.76 to $2.81 per share. We've raised our guidance range while taking into account the slight dilution we expect from our Software Integrity Group in the second half of the year, capital expenditures of approximately $100 million, and cash flow from operations of approximately $450 million.","In summary, Q2 was another strong quarter. We delivered excellent financial results, highlighted by top and bottom-line growth, solid execution across our business lines, and strong cash flow generation. We are also increasing 2015 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance, reflecting strong momentum in the first half and our confidence in the rest of the year.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Question on ICC II. Thank you for the update there, it sounds like there is a lot of momentum in the market. Just wondered if you would address some chatter out in the market about some maybe initial versions of ICC II having some QoR issues that needed to be cleaned up by ICC I runs. It sounded like if you had those, you are beyond them, but wondering if you would address those or not?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well, this is mostly noise that is related to any transition that you have. ICC II at this point in time is doing very complex chips extremely well and does not need any \u2013 I guess is supported by its older brother so to speak. At any point in time, people like to compare results from one tool to another, they like to see if it behaves in the same predictable fashion as they are accustomed to and IC Compiler II is just doing fabulously well in those comparisons. And more often than not, we get actually response from customers that involve quite a bit of surprise on their part. So having said that, it's a very complex product and we are in an intense move to get customers to move into production design with it that takes some effort and well on top of that.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","That's great. And then, with respect to the acquisition I wanted to clarify \u2013 is that baked into the guidance? It wasn't exactly clear to me if that was in the guidance or not in the guidance, that Codenomicon?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Hey, Rich. This is Trac. The Codenomicon is not backed into the guidance we've provided. But the impact should be immaterial and we won't be changing guidance as a result.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Now, when you had announced that, you'd said you thought it would close in 30 days, which is about where we are now. Anything we should know about? Why that hasn't closed in that timeframe?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","No, not really. These are just \u2013 there is certain amount of work that have to be done with the authorities locally and long track to execute on that.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","And so, I guess since that hasn't closed, that implies that Coverity will be slightly diluted in the second half of the year. Is that as expected?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","No. Actually, you probably remember that, when we originally acquired it, in our initial plan, we expect it to be breakeven in the second half of the year that \u2013 now, that we know much more and now that we've also decided to make some additional investments specifically in broadening the language coverage that is why we specifically communicated at the end of the second half it would be slightly dilutive. But it's very small and we essentially embedded this in the rest of the business for the company. So from that perspective, we still raise guidance.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it, that makes sense. Aart, I just wanted to make sure that I heard you right. I thought you said you had a very strong emulation quarter; was that correct, in your prepared remarks?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Yes, that was exactly what I said.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","And I was actually going to ask you if the sales of emulation had been affected at all by the lawsuit, that I guess you lost at least initially, at this point, with Mentor. And I'm guessing the answer that would be that they have not been adversely affected, but I'll let you answer that question.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And I will minimize my comments on this, after the verdict of course there was a set of issues we have to deal with, the version that's on the market today does not violate any of that. And so, we see that our business is doing well.","Rich F. Valera - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks very much, Aart, I appreciate it.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Rich.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Hi, guys. I apologize, I got cut off for a part of the call, so if you said this in your prepared remarks, I do apologize. But around ICC II, I imagine most of the traction is with the existing customers. I'm just wondering \u2013 any commentary in terms of not-Synopsys teams that are starting to adopt this for some of their advanced chips?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well. As you would imagine, Synopsys has been serving the most advanced designers in the world pretty much a 100%. And so while there is always one or two hold outs, our first objective, obviously, is to make sure that's the hardest driving design groups that need it most, that do the largest chips, and by the way that also the most demanding are successful first, and I think we are doing remarkably well with that group of people. There are number of maybe less advanced designs or let me put it more \u2013 in the 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer category designs that are sometimes advanced but on less evolved silicon technologies that are also using the tool extremely effectively. And so, we have an opportunity here to broaden to companies that maybe before did not look at us as their primary provider for (26:13).","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then, on the guidance for next quarter, specifically to the EPS, is the only increase in operating expenses the slight dilution the you are talking to, or is there some sales hiring or other operating expense investments that you are making, given where the range of EPS is coming in, relative to consensus?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry, Sterling, you're asking about the expense increase from Q2 to Q3? Is that right?","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's correct.","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, what you're going to see in the quarter-to-quarter comparison is the delayed hiring that we saw in Q2, as well as the merit increase for the second half of the year.","Sterling Auty - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We've a question from Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, hi. This is Andrew Masuda calling in for Tom. You guys mentioned that you guys had 15% of your cash onshore. I was just wondering if there was a minimum threshold that you would like to maintain for acquisitions and\/or share repurchases?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry. In general, we tried to keep our U.S. cash flow at around $100 million, but keep \u2013 I should note that we did close our revolver yesterday and we increased that to from $350 million to $500 million. So the combination of the onshore cash right now of $150 million plus the increase revolver gives us a lot of flexibility.","Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then, Aart, just a question on the software quality and security. Can you remind us how much that increases Synopsys' overall TAM?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","It's difficult to remind you, because I always struggle with that question. The reason I struggle is that the space of software productivity tools, software quality tools and then security is highly fragmented and sort of continually evolving. Our own sense initially is that the TAM probably grows by another $500 million or so. But I'll be the first one to say that depending on how one look at it can be much larger. I don't think it will be much smaller. But the security space is a little bit the wild west right now.","Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then just last question on IP and systems, I noticed that it just ticked down modestly in the April quarter. Can you talk about your expectations on that segment for the full year?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","From a quarter-to-quarter, it's hard to have very precise expectations. In general on a trailing-12 months basis, which is sort of what we mostly look at, it's up quite a bit. And the IP business by definition is somewhat lumpy, because there are number of deals that are large and ship immediately, there are some that require work to be done on a contract. And so, it can vary quite a bit. And last year for example was lower business growth than this year. So having said that I think the business is in good shape.","Bryan Andrew Masuda - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","And we have a question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Good evening. Aart, I would like to ask about IC Compiler II as well. Just to clarify the business impact that you're seeing from its adoption, I believe you said, there are 32 customers now using it. Is it the case that most, if not all of them are paying you more now for its use versus what they would have paid you for the, let's say, equivalent number of licenses of its older brother, IC Compiler I? And if you could help us understand the incremental bookings and\/or pricing or revenue implications of its adoption?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well for starters, the product itself is priced at a higher level than IC Compiler I. It has dramatically better capabilities, and of course is superefficient. Secondly, a number of customers as part of their multi-year contracts with us have an opportunity to remix into the next version, at which point in time, they use up more of that contract. And then lastly, as contracts come up for renewal, that is an excellent time to establish what's their level of commitments to Synopsys place and route is and IC Compiler II is doing extremely well with that. And so, having a history of fairly substantially new products in the past, not that we have something like IC Compiler II every few years or so, we nonetheless can absolutely see that the rate of business growth is excellent for it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. And a couple of questions for Trac. You mentioned hiring in an answer to, I think, Sterling's question earlier. In doing a spot check on your website, the number of open positions that you now have. And I know it's sometimes not the best reading of a company's plans, but you do now have largest number of open recs in about a year and a half, since the end of 2013. Could you help us understand how much of that intended hiring, or the people you are looking for, are in a more traditional core EDA business versus the new Software Integrity business?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","We definitely hire \u2013 are looking at to grow our investments in the Software Integrity Group as well as the IP and systems side. As we said, we will commit to growing in those spaces. Keep in mind that the head count at the end of Q2 is roughly flat with where we exited last year. So and for two quarters, now we've been behind our hiring so we should expect that to ramp up a little bit. But with that hiring in mind, I would just refer you back to the full year guidance, we still are at the midpoint of EPS, we're still looking to grow EPS by 10% and then we're still looking to increase operating margins by about 100 basis points year-over-year. So while we're hiring to support our business, we're mindful of the financial impact.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. A couple more for you, Trac. Your core EDA business was up pretty nicely sequentially for first quarter to second quarter, or larger than usual increase. If we think about that in geo terms, would it be fair to say that most of that sequential increase would have been in Asia-Pac, and perhaps secondly in North America?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","It lines up because you do see that the growth in, the trailing 12 months growth for North America and Asia-Pac was pretty strong.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Yes. Okay. And your cost of revenues per product was actually down sequentially, in-spite of the fact that you had a strong emulation quarter. Perhaps you had a really nice increase in the margin on emulation, but should we perhaps read into that, that the HAPS business, also hardware of course, might have been down sequentially? And from a cost perspective might have offset the increments from emulation?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We're not concerned about that and we actually don't worry about the COGS line on a quarter-to-quarter basis. If you look at it over the last \u2013 this quarter as well as the last few quarter trend, it usually bounces around between 82% and 84% and we're well within that range, so, I wouldn't read anything into it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly for Aart, a somewhat technical question, so IC Compiler II, of course, has been on the market now for about a year. One of the things you talked about since you released it or when you released it, was its substantial capacity additions. Could you remind us what you've done for the other products that are closely tied to IC Compiler in implementation, particularly DC and PrimeTime and others, in terms of materially expanding their capacity to keep up, so to say, with the design sizes for IC Compiler II?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well, first taking the step back, the IC Compiler II was out or IC Compiler was somewhat off the bottleneck in the very, very large designs, because far and away the largest amount of data is attached to the physical representation of a design, which does mean that it's not desirable to have higher level of capacity on any of the other tools. And so \u2013 at any point of time when one tool solely does a lot better all of the other tools while being happy for the company, immediately realized that the pressure is on them now to continue to improve and, of course, that is exactly what we're doing, and so from time-to-time you will see new capabilities come out on any of the surrounding tools, and the practical situation, always you can't do it fast enough. So they're working hard on it.","Jay Vleeschhouwer - Griffin Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Aart. Thanks, Trac.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first on emulation, Aart, could you talk about \u2013 you talked about a strong growth in the emulation segment. What is your expectation for the growth of that business year-over-year and your views on the market as well?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well, I don't think I commented on the market. I said that emulation was strong in the quarter for us. But I put it really in the perspective of our broader mission, which is a Verification Continuum that really contains the cornerstones of simulation and, of course, emulation, but also number of other technology. And the reason that's important is because in reality, most designers use a broad set of tools and one of the things that really helps them is if the tools understand the electronic representation the same way, with other words if it can sit on the same infrastructure and if you can use the same debuggers, even if some of the tools are more appropriate for one thing than another.","And so within that context that we have made outstanding progress specifically and making sure that the compilation techniques that we use for simulation and emulation line up very well, and about a year and half or so ago we had flagged that as one of the weaknesses in our offering. And I think right now, it's becoming rapidly a strength.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","So is it fair to assume your emulation standalone revenues growing at least double-digit year-over-year?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","You know Monika, we said that it's doing very well. We don't disclose the growth rates of individual product. They tend to go up and down, but I would reiterate that we think that we have a very strong emulation solution.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Okay. Then on the Coverity, when it was bought, you talked about it growing at 20% growth rate. Could you maybe share how is that business doing on the growth rate basis?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's roughly on track. It is slightly differently dimensioned than when we originally acquired it, because we didn't quite know exactly how to read the numbers. We have concluded meanwhile that it is a business that has great opportunity and for that reason we realized after a while that our core strength is really the depths of the algorithms, specifically around the analysis of the languages. And that of course, beg the question, well, so which languages do you do, and we decided to invest in broadening that language sets.","So I think there is still a lot of space to be explored here. And then the other broadening that we took on, of course, is to strengthen the security angle. Coverity already have some security capabilities, but they were not really well-known for it. Codenomicon is certainly a brand name, and it allows us to position a little bit better in this emerging space while at the same time, learning quite rapidly, what are actually the things that are most valuable to customers.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Got it. Just a housekeeping question, if you look at maintenance and service line item, the first half of this year, the revenues about $130 million, but last year was about $102 million. So it's something going on there? Or is there some reclassification of revenue in this line item?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Are you talking about service?","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Yeah, maintenance and service line item, yes?","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","Well, those tend to go up and down quite a bit. They are very lumpy because a lot of these are directly related to certain contracts having milestones, and the milestones can be very unevenly spread. And so, the service business is not very large for us. And so, I wouldn't read very much into it. The very fact that I wasn't even unaware of what you just said shows that we are \u2013 ourselves maybe we can pay more attention to it, but we didn't.","Monika Garg - Pacific Crest Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's all for me.","Trac Pham - Chief Financial Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","We'll go to Mahesh Sanganeria with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yes. Thank you very much. Another IC Compiler question, Aart. We estimate that the addressable market for place and route about $600 million growing more at mid-single digit. If you can give your opinion on that? And also if you can talk about comparative positioning, because your competitors also claiming significant design wins in that area. So if you can comment on that, that would be helpful.","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","Well. I cannot comment about the \u2013 what a competitor says. If they're growing, that's good, that means the whole market is growing even more. We are certainly doing very well and have been the largest provider in that segment of the market for quite a while. And so, what makes that market interesting and challenging is that it's the first place where all the new challenges of new technologies come through both in terms of the physics, but also in terms of the sheer complexity off of the chips that have to go through the tools. And in that context, IC Compiler II, I think is passing the test with flying colors and that is why we've seen the business actually do very well around IC Compiler II. And as a matter of fact, the run rate for the whole company is up. And so, IC Compiler was certainly a cornerstone in the things that we wanted to accomplish this year.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","And another question, you made a comment on 28-nanometer being a bigger node in your opening statement. I guess you were probably referring that 28-nanometer is staying much longer than \u2013 and you're seeing new designs. Does that have any implication on how things progress for your business? Does that imply that advanced technology is slower, but it doesn't matter to you. You'll go by \u2013 I mean you're benefiting from a number of designs, not necessarily has to be the leading edge?","Aart J. de Geus - Chairman & Co-Chief Executive Officer","That's a very good question. And you may recall that I fairly strongly predicted this. I would say four quarters to six quarters ago already and there is a logic to it, which is no matter what's the difference between 28-nanometer and then the 16-nanometer, 14-nanometer and so on. FinFET is that 28-nanometer is what's called planar transistors or flat, right, whereas FinFET as a name says Fins, they are vertical. And so that is a fairly big physical change, when you think about it. And so there is a reason, one would go after such a change, because the benefits are very large for very sophisticated advanced designs that also need very low-power. So no surprise the people that go there first are the processors and are the people that do a mobility, because they have very complex chips and need low-power.","Now, contrary to popular opinion, it's not just two customers or three customers that have gone there. It's a larger number already. But it is also true that for many of the others. They sort of way to see as others have crossed the bridge, how that's going, when are the economics right, where is the yield is really predictable all the things that you do, if you don't see a super high advantage in being in the most advanced nodes.","But then now you are right about 28-nanometer, which is a very, very solid node, very high yields, a good cost point and so on. And you say well, I still want to differentiate. And so now you're doing very advanced design on 28-nanometer node, which by the way is just as difficult, it's just the type of difficulty you already know about. And so, it's in that context that many of the benefits of IC Compiler II that we're pioneered with, obviously, the intent to be able to satisfy the FinFET crowd have actually very positive impact on the 28-nanometer, and actually we see a number of people also do very well at 40-nanometer. And you look at that configuration, and you say, hey! that makes sense. It's economics that determines when people go over the bridge, and right now the 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer group is arriving at 28-nanometer and we'll be looking when to cross into FinFET when it makes economic sense.","Mahesh Sanganeria - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's very helpful.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instruction will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today's call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Laurie. Good afternoon. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the Company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today's earnings press release.","In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the earnings press release, financial supplement and 8-K that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. Q1 was an excellent start to the year as we met or exceeded all of our guidance targets. Revenue was $834 million with GAAP earnings per share of $0.67 and non-GAAP earnings above our target range at $1.01. In December, we communicated our fiscal '20 guidance, high-single digit revenue growth, substantial ops margin expansion, mid-teens non-GAAP earnings per share growth and more than $800 million in operating cash flow. We are reaffirming our guidance for the year. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","Looking at the overall landscape, ongoing geopolitical tension and the recent coronavirus outbreak have generated items uncertainty around the world. Regarding the virus outbreak, our first priority has been the safety and health of our employees, customers and partners. We continue to monitor the situation and support our China teams as they continue to drive business execution.","On the churn by those challenges, electronics companies ranging from traditional semiconductor and systems companies to new startups and hyperscalers persist in designing evermore complex chips and devices with a high degree of market urgency, driven by AI and machine learning, automotive, 5G, IoT and cloud expansion. The proliferation of Smart Everything is and will be the central driver for years to come.","As a result, robust demand for our solutions has continued in 2020. Our innovation and technologies spanning the spectrum from silicon to software, absolutely central to the ambitious products and systems being built. Let me share some product highlights from the quarter, starting with EDA.","An important differentiator for Synopsys continues to be our leading position in enabling manufacturing process development. With highly sophisticated simulation of new technologies, new transistors, and the structure needed for the most advanced fabs in world, we not only assist our manufacturing partners, but we also lay the groundwork for our design tools to be tuned and ready well before these technologies go into production design.","On top of that, over the last several years, Synopsys has pioneered a new approach called Fusion that literally fuses algorithms from different tools resulting in faster and lower power chips in far less time. A showcase example of this is our Fusion Compiler product, introduced about a year ago.","Within just a few months of its introduction, Fusion Compiler revealed itself as a revolutionary product. It is winning head-to-head benchmarks with consistently superior performance, power and area results across a broad set of applications. Results thus far are ahead of our initial plan with many customer engagements progressing very well, from exploring the tool to usage on a few life design blocks to production roll out.","In Q1, we built upon several breakthroughs competitive wins, ranging from the largest global communications, processors and graphics firms to high impact cloud hyperscalers to multiple influential system houses. For example, AMD chose Fusion Compiler for its full flow digital design implementation of its next generation processes.","Fusion Compiler is displacing the competition of the large hyperscaler for next generation ARM core-based graphics design at 5-nanometer and below. We achieved a significant win at a large multinational consumer electronics company on next-gen ARM CPU core. We're spending displacement and deployments at a leading mobile company for critical 5G designs at 5-and 4-nanometer.","A leading U.S. semiconductor company is deploying Fusion Compiler on all new graphics designs, taking advantage of better run time and quality of results. We displaced the competition for ARM core designs at a leading automotive semiconductor company and we expanded proliferation at a large U.S. semiconductor leader with a new win in wireless design.","While still relatively early in our multi-year product cycle, these important wins represent significant momentum and usage share gain, which will flow into revenue overtime. The Fusion concept is very powerful and is getting great results across Synopsys as our innovation continues at a rapid pace. Stay tuned for some exciting new product announcements as we approach our March Silicon Valley user group event.","Let me now turn to custom design, a product area that underwent a multiyear innovation push and has seen excellent progress over the last 18 months, not only are we now highly competitive for advanced nodes, we continue to see a growing number of displacements and full flow engagements. Our expansion is driven by fresh innovations focused on maximizing designer productivity.","Customers are experiencing this benefit and we saw excellent growth in revenue from our custom compiler product again this quarter. For example, a high impact global systems company expanded its full flow usage in Q1, proliferating after a significant competitive displacement. Additional custom compiler wins include a leading silicon photonics developer and a CMOS image sensor company.","Let me now move to our Verification Continuum Platform where we maintain our number one market share position. In verification software, we gained share in Q1 at a large global hyperscaler driven their growing needs for verification capacity across our platform. Meanwhile, demand for hardware-based verification is high across the board, driven by continued complexity growth in new designs.","The speed and capacity of our solutions are particularly well suited whenever software bring up is involved. While a strong Q1 last year makes for a tough year-over-year hardware comparison, we continue to gain momentum with both new and existing customers. In Q1, we gained 9 new logos and 34 repeat orders including very high profile systems and semiconductor companies. NEC for example, chose our ZeBu emulation system over the incumbents for their high performance compute solutions due to our superior performance, very fast bring up time and unique debug visibility.","In Q1, we also announced the acquisition of the DINI Group, which further expands our half FPGA base prototyping portfolio. Now to IP which continues to deliver strong results, as the number one provider of interface, embedded memory, analog and foundry-specific IP, we provide the industry's broadest portfolio covering all key markets, AI, automotive, cloud, IoT and 5G mobile.","Our demonstrated strength in high-performance cloud computing applications is evidenced in several areas. We've already achieved more than 60 design wins in PCI Express 5.0. Our new die-to-die 56 and 112 gig SerDes continues to gain market traction. We also have a significant IP portfolio win with a major China e-commerce company for micro server applications.","Our leadership position in USB led to multiple Tier 1 processors semiconductor companies adopting our newest generation USB 4.0 IP and a leading 500 meter process. We're also seeing unmatched leadership and momentum in automotive where our automotive grade IP is being used by 10 of the top 11 semiconductor suppliers to that industry.","One notable example is Qualcomm, which selected our automotive IP portfolio including interface, ARM processors and embedded test and repair solutions for their new Snapdragon or Ride Platform for autonomous driving.","Finally, we continue to expand our IP portfolio with acquisition of technologies from eSilicon and INVECAS, the latter closing just last week. Along with valuable technology, these acquisitions also enable us to further scale our IP development to meet high customer demand across growing markets.","Now the Software Integrity, the tools that test software code for security, vulnerabilities and quality issues. We delivered a solid beginning to the year with business levels up more than 30% over the same period last year. We saw continued progress in driving multiyear, multimillion dollar agreements, booking several across multiple verticals.","As I mentioned in December, we've entered Phase 2 of our strategy, scaling into the 500 million to 1 billion revenue space. To accomplish this, we're focused on four areas; one, expanding our cloud-base Polaris Software Integrity platform to additional product integrations; two, scaling consulting engagements to fully leverage a key differentiator in the software DevOps market; three, refining our channel to better serve large enterprise customers, key market verticals and new regional business; and four, evolving our management team for the complexity and size of a larger business.","We're moving fast on all of these. Just last week, we announced the extension of the Polaris platform, bringing static testing and software composition analysis directly to the developers desktop. This first of its kind solution enables developers to seamlessly find and fix security weaknesses in proprietary code and known vulnerabilities in open source code, all within that desktop development environment.","We also added the team and products from Tinfoil Security, broadening our product offerings for Dynamic Application Security Testing or DAST, and adding API scanning capability. Our scaling efforts in the fields also progressing well as we've ramped up hiring activity and are excited about the sales energy in the organization.","A good example of the power of the combination of products and consulting is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Our relationships that began with a small initial service engagement to help them respond to a security bridge, has grown to include both product purchases and add additional services to help them proliferate our solutions.","We're also moving fast to scale our leadership and management teams to the next level. We have launched an external search for a new general manager to lead your innovation into the $500 million to $1 billion level.","While these efforts will flow into revenue over time, we're encouraged by the positive side. There's a tremendous opportunity in this space and we're well positioned to enable companies to improve the security and quality of their software with a combination of high value products, a great new platform and enabling consulting services.","In closing, Q1 was a very good start to the year. We delivered strong financial results and our reaffirming outlook for fiscal 2020. Even with some caution around global markets, electronics companies continue to invest in critical chip and system designs as well as immense amounts of sophisticated software.","Our innovation engine is prolific and this quarter, we will be introducing a number of exciting new products and differentiating capabilities. We are committed and on track towards our mid-and long-term growth and margin expansion targets.","Finally, let me thank our customers for their business and our employees for their dedication and hard work in delivering continued strong results.","Trac will now highlight the financial perspective.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon everyone. We delivered strong start to the year, meeting or exceeding our guidance targets for the quarter, and we are on pace for our four year plan. We remained relentlessly focused on execution, generating revenue for the quarter at the high end of our target range and non-GAAP earnings per share well above the range.","We produced another quarter strong collections, which contribute to a positive cash flow in a quarter that is typically an outflow due to variable compensation payouts, and we launched a $100 million share repurchase. Our increasingly diverse customer base our strong product portfolio combined with our nearly 90% recurring revenue model position us for success in peers of high demand as well as those of great uncertainty.","Multiple factors including the entity list, export restrictions and broader trade tensions as well as the coronavirus situation have added to market volatility. Based on our current view and the strength of our business, we are confident in our abilities to manage through this uncertainty and we are reiterating our guidance for the year.","I'll now review our first quarter results. All comparisons are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. We generated total revenue of $834 million. Semiconductor & System Design segment revenue was $749 million, with strong growth in IP and a tough hardware comparison over the strong Q1 of last year.","Excluding hardware and the impact of entity list, trade restrictions, EDA software results remain within our long-term target range of mid-to-high single digits. Software Integrity segment revenue was $86 million, 10% of total, and business levels for the quarter increased more than 30%. Because of our largely time-based model, the associated revenue would be recognized over the life of the contracts.","Moving on to expenses. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $747 million, which includes approximately 9 million in restructuring costs. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were 647 million resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 22.4%. Our Q1 margin reflects revenue profile this year as well as the change in the timing of general salary increases now in Q1.","We're on track to generate approximately 200 basis points of up margin expansion for the year. Adjusted operating margin for Semiconductor & System Design was 23.9% a softer integrity was 9.4%. Finally, GAAP earnings per share were $0.67 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.01.","Turning to cash, we generated a 10 million in operating cash flow. Including this $100 million Q1 ASR, we've repurchased 1.9 billion of our stock since 2015 or approximately 80% of our free cash flow returned to shareholders over that period. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of 700 million at total debt of 331 million.","A couple of comments before I move on to our targets, as I've noted, we delivered a strong start to the year and we are reiterating our full year guidance. We are maintaining our first half, second half revenue split of roughly 45%, 55%, which reflects forecast the timing of IP and hardware deliveries as well as general prudence given the uncertainty around the unfolding coronavirus situation.","For fiscal 2020, we are targeting revenue of 3.6 billion to 3.6 5 billion. Total GAAP costs and expenses between 2.95 billion and 3 billion. Total non GAAP costs and expenses between 2.63 billion and 2.66 billion, resulting in a non GAAP operating margin of approximately 27%. GAAP earnings of $3.68 to $3.87 per share. Non-GAAP earnings of $5.18 to $5.25 per share. Cash growth from operations of 800 million to 825 million and capital expenditures of approximately 180 million, we expect capital expenditures to decline in 2021.","Now to the targets for the second quarter, revenue between 820 million and 850 million, total GAAP cost and expenses between 724 million and 758 million total, the non GAAP cost and expenses between 645 million and 665 million, GAAP earnings of $0.49 to $0.62 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.96 to $1.01 per share.","In conclusion, our focused execution enabled us to again deliver strong results, meeting or exceeding our targets. With a very good start in Q1, we're reaffirming the full year guidance provided in December. We are also tracking well to our goals of high twenties operating margin by 2021 and profitability at 30% range longer term, as we move towards our next milestone of $4 billion in revenue.","We remain committed to balance capital allocation strategy consisting of investing in the business for gross while continuing to return capital shareholders, as we focus on driving sustainable long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question from the line of Rich Valera with Needham and Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Our question on Software Integrity. So you've mentioned you had very good business level and you said 30% increase in business levels, but it looked like revenue decelerated pretty sharply in the business. So just wanted to understand, if business levels refer to bookings and why the deceleration in revenue and what might drive that to reaccelerate?","Aart de Geus","So, you're correct business levels referred to bookings and you may recall that, last quarter reported that 2019 had been relatively weak in terms of bookings. And so, what you saw is the result of that plus whatever was transacted during the quarter. And so, our objective obviously is to now build back to a high level and we will actively pursue that.","Rich Valera","Any thoughts or commentary on when that business might reaccelerate sort of into the double digits routines?","Aart de Geus","Well, I mean, we've just finished what we thought was a strong quarter, so it's easier said than done to just keep doing that, but that's obviously the objective, right, is to invest in some of the channel areas specifically that I think can be more balanced for the opportunity space. And they share that, we move fast on the deployment of the Polaris platform and the integration of new capabilities. Those are sort of some of the cornerstones to the success of a long term business.","Trac Pham","Rich, Just keep in mind that in December, we also highlighted that the -- in December, we highlighted long-term growth for this business and for multi-year period is 15% to 20%. And we are committed to that and we should be able to grow at least with the market or faster.","Rich Valera","A quick follow-up to that. You've talked about the sales force realignment and it sounds like some new personnel being brought in. Where do you think that both the sales force is in terms of structure and personnel relative to where you want it to be? Is there more you need to bring and you feel like you've got pretty much the sort of the headcount you need to drive the business forward?","Aart de Geus","Well, we're now in active hiring. We have hired a number of people. It's both the combination of tuning, meaning putting it in the right organization and simultaneously filling the holes as we see opportunities and there are plenty of opportunities. So, no, we're far from done, but we have a good start and actually some of the changes that we made in '19 appear to have generally these quite a bit of energy on the front of the sales force that feels that they have a better shot this year than last year.","Trac Pham","I'd also reiterate that as part of our plan, we did contemplate the hiring -- additional highs in that business. We'll continue to invest that business as it scales; and as we said in December, which we're still on track for us maintaining margins relatively flat year-over-year.","Aart de Geus","So, all the commentary that we described is consistent with how we're managing the business.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Joe Vruwink with Baird. Your line is open.","Aart de Geus","That's one of the easier questions. It sounds like we have no connection, operator.","Operator","Let me check, if Joe Vruwink your line is open. Okay, he may pop back into the queue here momentarily. I will go to our next person Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Mitch Steves","The first one I kind of wanted to point to Trac. So given the coronavirus study, the macro concerns, my question is. Since you guys beat pretty nicely in the first quarter, would you have raised a full year assuming that there was no macro change? Or do you believe that this 30 encapsulated in your full year guide?","Trac Pham","It's affecting our guidance. I would say that it's not a meaningful impact of the year. We did get a very strong start of the year, so after 90 days, we feel very good about the outlook for the business on a full year basis. As we typically do describe, after one quarter, it's a good start and it gives us good progress to the year, but there's still a lot of business left the book.","Aart de Geus","If I may add to that, our business is actually mostly multi-year and so we have actually a fairly high degree of stability in our business towards events like this. At the same time, it is clear that some of the customers or the customers' customers are impacted because they may not be able to ship products. And so, it remains to be seen, if that makes its way all the way to us, but mostly we are quite isolated or insulated, I should say for all of these type of problems.","Mitch Steves","And then for my second one, just on the core EDA business. You guys have talked about a mid-to-high single digit growth. But if I look at this, it looks like the last about 5 to 6 quarters, now it's been below about 4%. So, I guess, why is a time based revenue flat year-over-year, if EDA software is still growing mid-to-high single? Is that just going to accelerate in the back half? And if so, I'm just trying to understand why that would be the case?","Trac Pham","Yes, Mitch, I would separate that question to two parts. The first part is, keep in mind that any emulation does show up in the EDA line. So from a product group perspective, we've continued to grow very nicely in hardware and that tends to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but its continued growth on multiyear basis that will affect the comparison.","The second part, which you're trying to connect to is, this license type of time-based. Remember the last year, we did transition to 606. And the mix that you're going to see in the time-based versus up front line is affected by that, that revenue transition. As we've described, the numbers and the comparisons for EDA is colored by the timing of hardware this year as well as the entity list that was affecting both the EDA and IP line, but we still feel very comfortable about a long-term and our model to drive it in the mid-to-high single digits.","Operator","Go back to Joe Vruwink's line, he's with Baird. Please go ahead Joe.","Joe Vruwink","Okay, there we go. I wanted to revisit the last question just regarding EDA performance and I think, obviously appreciate in the market uncertainty, but your customers seemed to have a more optimistic view on their R&D activity in 2020 and I would argue 2021. If that acceleration does come through, is there any reason why is your EDA business wouldn't participate in that trend?","Aart de Geus","No, there's no reason that we'd not participate because -- as I think somewhat mentioned in the preamble, we see customer to be quite aggressive in what they're designing. And so fundamentally, we are in a good market and therefore participation be it in EDA or IP in that is absolutely a part of where we should do well. I think where we are cautious just because there have been so many changes in the global market that have had some impact.","As we gave out the numbers, we encompassed the fact that we thought that we'd be no change to the entity list. And so, those are the types of things that we're dealing with for the year. But fundamentally, actually, I think that we are in a long-term good market leaving alone massive GDP fluctuation or anything like that. The technology needs are high for us and that's very encouraging.","Joe Vruwink","And then if I can follow up on Software Integrity, maybe trying to reconcile the comments a quarter ago that orders were that softer to what seems really like a snap back to this 30% number. Is that just the actions you outlined a quarter ago and you started out the call talking about? Are those beginning to bear fruit already or are there some other things going on?","Aart de Geus","Well, partially, the answer is definitely bear fruit because we have invested and made quite a number of changes, suddenly in the latter part of 2019. At the same time, I don't want to set an expectation that over 30% is the norm for every quarter. That's not where we guiding towards, but the fact is this was a very good quarter from an overall point of view. And so that will manifest itself in revenue over time. So I think we have a lot of opportunities to evolve the business to be capable of rising above the 0.5 billion mark and then you sort of in a different league of management. And so many of the investments that we're making are really all aimed at, you know the skill of scaling to that next level.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Jackson Ader with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","The first one was on hardware. So coming out of last year, you mentioned that large hardware deals slipped and I\u2019m not sure, if we heard an update on. What the expectations are for the timing and delivery of those now in 2020?","Aart de Geus","Well, we typically don't give a specific timing of shipments because some people try to understand which customer did what to whom. But the bottom line is, one of the reasons that we think we have a strong a year overall is that, hardware will be strong and actually the demand continues in that direction. It is also true that the delivery is lumpy and that is itself is visible somewhat in the first half, second half of the year.","Jackson Ader","Okay. I think I can follow the breadcrumbs there and then just the follow up on the Fusion wins, the competitive wins, specifically where you were -- where you mentioned you were displacing a competitor. Can you just give us a sense either a mix or just identify some of the wins whether these were brand new customers to Synopsys or whether they were re winning or winning back, a customer that had maybe shifted away in the past?","Aart de Geus","The answer is yes, yes, and yes. Meaning that, they fall in all categories. In the past, that has been relatively rare that we'd be brand new customers because they used some industry was relatively stable and actually partially consolidating. That has changed substantially in two ways. One is a number of the hyperscalers are becoming interestingly -- strongly interested in doing chip design.","And secondly, there's a plethora of IP companies that are doing extremely advanced design on an extremely aggressive timescale. And for those the utilization of our tools is just imperative to be able to succeed. So, we have opportunities in all farms and the bottom line is we have to continue to push hard on the technology, but right now it's very, very strong.","Operator","We'll go to Adam Gonzalez with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.","Adam Gonzalez","First I just wanted to ask about the China market, and can you just discuss trends there excluding Huawei and how you see that market moving forward? And then, if you see any potential impact from the proposed changes to the regulatory outlook whether that changes to the de minimis rule or the foreign direct product rule?","Aart de Geus","Sure. Well, if you take away the entity list then I would say, no change, meaning that China continues to be very active moving forward as a rapid pace, adopting new technologies, and our business is strong. Regarding the entity list, we had assumed and somewhat predicted that there would be no radical change in the near future.","So far that has turned out to be true, but as we all know, things can happen in unexpected ways depending on how the tensions between the countries evolve. We do not expect that any part of the specific rules would have major impact on changes in our business because bottom line is to the entity list, we are not chipping. So that is sort of an all or nothing type cause situation already today.","Adam Gonzalez","And Trac, just wanted to follow up on the second half revenue outlook. Can you maybe give it a little more detail about what your expectations are for a split between Q3 and Q4? And then I think on the prior call you for the SIG business, you had outlined that you expect to ramp up spending this year such that margins would stay relatively flat throughout the year. Is that still the goal?","Trac Pham","Yes, that's still the goal. Let me start with the first question, this first half, second half. We do expect Q4 to be our direction of the largest quarter for revenues and EPS, and that's consistent with the guidance. With regards to SIG, we do expect the hiring ramp to continue throughout the year and that's reflected in the 200 basis point improvement. But a quarter-to-quarter, you can get a little noisy, but generally flattish with last year.","Operator","We'll go next to John pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","John pitzer","My first question, the large North American CPU guy where you had historically a pretty good position seems to be going to kind of a fundamental change and they've been buying philosophy over the next couple where they're going to move away from doing everything, their own IP to maybe using some more off-the-shelf block IPs within their design. I'm kind of curious, what are the puts and takes or the opportunities that, that might create for you or the EDA space?","Aart de Geus","John, my apologies, but we sort of understood every section word. And so, we sort of made out of the words IP and the word trend, I think, apologize. Is it possible to, to try to summarize just sort of the three or four words that are most interested you and they'll try to fabricate a response to that.","John pitzer","Does this sound better?","Aart de Geus","Yes. There's sort of this wobbling sound as if you were underwater.","John Pitzer","Yes, I apologize. I'm on a cellphone. Is this any better or not?","Aart de Geus","Marginally so, did I get the word IP correctly?","John Pitzer","Yes. The question is that the large North American CPU guy is moving to kind of a different design philosophy methodology, where they're going to be using less of their own kind of internal IP design or off-the-shelf blocks. I'm kind of curious as to what that means for you or the EDA space?","Aart de Geus","I think I understand the question. I'll try to reask it a little bit, which is essentially of the North American CPU guys, are they changing their design methodology to use more reusable IP? Well, I want to broaden the question slightly because answering for there are not that many North American CPU guys, and it's not appropriate for me to answer in a fashion that recognizes the customers.","But what I can say in general is there's no question that around CPU design, and I'll include in that GPU and all the views that are specialized for AI, the design methodology is definitely evolving. There's certainly some people that continue the old way to massively optimize for the last gigahertz, but for a majority, there's definitely a drift toward applications that use much more data so that tend to be more a machine learning-oriented.","And with that comes architectures that are very much focused on getting data in and off chip. And so that in itself brings about a natural increase of potentially reasonable IP. And yes, I think the quality of the IP, the advanced nature, meaning the advanced nodes that our IP is available today and the close collaboration we have with all of these customers has made it possible that they're now counting for design methodologies that use substantially more IP than they did in the past.","We expect that to continue, and we also expect to continue that the IP will become more complex because with the smaller nodes, it really takes a lot of effort to make them work very well. But it is now absolutely a distinguishing capability of the Company. So essentially, what I'm trying to express to you is the IP business is difficult, but it is a great business for us to be in because it will continue to grow. It will continue to be demanding and therefore, a good area for us to be in. And we have long-term relationships with these customers where they acquire more and more pieces from us.","John Pitzer","That's helpful. As my follow-up, Trac, you said there was no impact from the coronavirus on the full fiscal year and that's understandable. Is there any cushion that you're embedding in the current quarter guidance? And to the extent that Software Integrity is not a part of the op margin expansion during this year, how do we think about that business going into 2021? And kind of at what leverage levels would you expect there to be a significant inflection in op margin for that business?","Trac Pham","So the question is the first question is related to Q2. My comment on the coronavirus to the numbers is consistent with Q2 and the full year, it's not meaningful. This is our best outlook for the year and I think it's pretty consistent with how we've been planning the year. With regards to SIG margins, we should be improving margins in FY 2021, and that's going to be a combination of us growing that business and continuing to scale that up and be more productive with the investments.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Aart, for you first. In your answer just now to a question regarding the evolution of design methodologies, you put it largely in the context of the role or adoption of IT. Could you also speak to that in terms of core EDA and in terms of how customers are differentiating themselves vis-a-vis design process and the employment of the tools? I'm sure this has been the case since the primordial days of EDA three decades ago. And but when you look at the multiple applications and needs that you talk about, in what way do you think core EDA design flows, processes, methodologies are evolving or need to evolve for customers to continue to distinguish themselves aside from your incorporation of standard IP? For you, Trac, with regard to IT. In fiscal 2019, according to the 10-K, there was a $235 million positive impact from upfront IT revenue although total IT revenues increased by just over $100 million. How are you thinking about those wonderful 606 mechanics in 2020 with regard to the tough comp you would have on IT upfront revenue versus perhaps a somewhat easier comp on IT subs revenue?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Let me start. Of course, your question can lead to 0.5 hour dissertation, which I will not do. But the first thing to start with is that there's still a continuation of adoption of extremely advanced nodes, and with that comes a nonstop demand for all of our tools, all the ones reaching deep into the physics and certainly all the physical design tools to be up to speed with these nodes.","And by the way, their development is less clearly defined in time, meaning that a new node comes out, and then within three months, there's another version of that node and another three months, another version. And so there's constant adaptation as people are really squeezing out the max. Now in parallel to that, maybe less relevant but still worthwhile to note is that some of the older nodes are also being put more to use as people figure out that was the new tools, they can squeeze out more value out of those nodes and not all the products need the most advanced capabilities.","Having said that, on the advanced capabilities, if there are two or three trends I could highlight for the tools, one is this notion that the capacity of the tools needs to continue to increase, because on Moore's Law, the one factor that really has not slowed down is the notion of increased density. Still more transistors per chip and that adds a lot of value for what you can do. In order to do that, we need to make sure that our tools interact well with each other.","And so the notion of Fusion is really profound because it attempts to have every tool understand somewhat what the other tools will do and essentially have better team play, so to speak. What comes on top of that is that now the application of AI is absolutely deeply anchored already in our business. And we have capabilities in every one of our tools that are impacted by improvements through AI and increasingly, we'll see capabilities between the tools.","The last comment I'll make is in the verification space, where a trend that we had diagnosed early on continues at high speed, which is with the strengthening of the chips and the combinations of chips, and I'm looking here at things that are assembled in a 3D fashion of multiple chips talking to each other such as processors and memories and maybe sensors, the importance of being able to verify both the hardware and the software.","At the same time continues to grow because whichever is the slowest or the worst of in quality will determine when something goes to market. And so that is the area where advanced stimulation techniques, emulation, prototyping play in. So those are sort of the forces that govern what we do. And I can bet that by next week, there will be yet another demand for something to keep going because there is no deceleration in sight.","Trac Pham","So Jay, on your question regarding IP, let me start by saying that we're very positive about our IP business. This is a as we described, a low double-digit growth business. And everything we're seeing in the marketplace and our bookings continue to reflect that outlook. That said, the 606 transition does introduce more variability to the numbers on a quarterly basis. But on a full year basis and on a multiyear basis, this is a very good growth business for us as reflected in the guidance for the full year.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Also Trac, could you update us on your backlog number?","Trac Pham","Well, I know you're going to read our Q that's coming out shortly, and you'll see that the backlog is it's pretty steady at $4.4 billion and directionally up versus last quarter. And then within that, the run rate that we the business that we book was actually very positive.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Jason Celino","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. The acquisition of Tinfoil fills a nice hole in the dynamic testing side for your SIG portfolio. Can you talk about how that acquisition came about? And maybe any other small holes your current offering has?","Aart de Geus","It is a very nice acquisition. And in these new markets, everybody knows everybody. And so then the question is always, are there some acquisitions that are both timely, that are economically reasonable and where we can integrate rapidly in a broader solution? And of course, we have had experience in this EDA business for many really decades. And so there's some similarity in that. And what was particularly intriguing is that Tinfoil fits so nicely in the Polaris platform.","Of course, we have to do the integration. But this is exactly the type of capabilities that we'd love to have there because it makes the platform more useful, more versatile for our customers as they adopt it, and it was designed to make these type of integrations possible and not too costly. So if I add to that, the fact that Tinfoil is truly remarkable, high-quality company with some stunning individuals in terms of their ability to look at the future. We and by the way, the locals that makes it easier to integrate. So far, it looks really promising.","Jason Celino","Okay. And then similar topic, the acquisition of the IP assets over the last few months, how should we think about those as far as complementary to the growth opportunity in IP or kind of the margin expansion opportunity in IP?","Aart de Geus","Very good question. So our IP business is really two components: one is to continually drive both the breadth but I would say just as much the depth of what we do in IP. And depths would be the new technologies new versions of the technology, etc. But the other part is that actually, IP does require quite a bit of work. They are very often statement of works on delivering IP that fits exactly the needs of a customer, so maybe some small variations or some tuning for a specific technology.","And so continuing to grow a workforce that can do this is just part of continuing to scale it overall. And so in both the cases of INVECAS and eSilicon was a combination of some technologies, and but most importantly, also a workforce that was very well suited for the type of needs that we have. So we see it as essentially just another way of continuing to broaden and grow our business.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two of them. First one for Aart. Aart, if you look at it, like high-performance computing over the last several years has swung from being centralized cloud and now it's more distributed toward the edge. Kind of curious, how does this change the EDA landscape, if at all? Did requirements for EDA change at the edge? I'm just curious on that, and then I had a follow-up for Trac.","Aart de Geus","Well, most of the super high-performance computing is reasonably centralized. But it is true that a number of the edge application, if you call a car an edge, there's a lot of computation that's going into that. And so I would say in general, the difference of design is not that marked unless you have two things that changed: one is the need for low power, i.e., battery-operated type things.","And so there, you have the never-ending challenge of how much performance can you squeeze out without draining the battery in, no time. And that's not a new problem. It really started to come up when mobility came up in the early 2000s. But the other thing is that in a number of edge applications now, these computational devices can be used in machines that can actually be lethal. And a car is definitely potentially lethal but so could be a robot or so.","And so with that comes a whole set of other rules that one have to serve in the design of the chips such as having the capability for a chip to diagnose itself as faulty, and in some cases, to diagnose itself and at least temporarily repair itself by having, for example, duplication of some capabilities. Now it took us a while to catch up on all those rules because many of those rules are very old.","They come from the automotive industry. But now, and I think we highlighted maybe in the script on automotive. Synopsys is really well on top of this. And so much so that we now participate in the premiums where the next set of rules are being developed and pioneered. So those are sort of the differences. But for the rest, it's like it's never good enough, it's never fast enough. It's never low-power enough. That continues. And while these sound like negative words, they're music to our years, A lot more opportunity for us.","Krish Sankar","Got it. That's very helpful, Aart, and then a quick follow-up for Trac. It looks like your fiscal 2020 revenue guide is largely unexpected because of the virus. I understand the stability of your revenue stream, but I would have thought that there would have been some impact on the hardware innovation business, given that's a little more variable. Kind of curious, are you not seeing any of that impact in hardware or emulation?","Trac Pham","Well, our guidance reflects the best information we have right now, and the demand from our customers continues to be very strong. I think part of it is that it's going to be the variability is going to be mostly on the timing of it, but that's contemplated in the guidance. As far as growth goes, keep in mind every year, we look at the year and we say that it's going to be hard to grow off of a record year, which is what we had in 2019. But we feel very good about where we are and the pipeline that we've got in place.","Operator","We have a question from the line of Josh Tilton with Berenberg Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Josh Tilton","Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, on Software Integrity, just how many months are left on the total Polaris rollout? What key functionality remains to be integrated? And should we expect a step-up in margins once the platform is fully rolled out?","Aart de Geus","Maybe it's strange thing to answer, but that rollout will continue, hopefully, for a long, long time, meaning, many years. The reason is being that the basic capabilities of Polaris as a platform are there. Now the question is, how well do we integrate multiple applications? And the power of a platform is precisely because it handles multiple applications in a way that makes life much easier for the user instead of having to deal with different products that may have different interfaces, data representations, etc.","So what is encouraging is that we now have already multiple capabilities on there. And you may realize that, I mentioned that the Tinfoil acquisition is slated to be integrated next. And so that's a good way to think about it. Hopefully, we can do many more things. Now the platform itself will continue to evolve. They all do and it's hard for me to say what's the life cycle for a platform in this area, which is still new to us, but if you look at sort of EDA, our platforms typically have lasted somewhere between 10 to 15 years.","Trac Pham","And helped drive margin expansion over time as we ramp up on the platform, but it's going to come across from a variety of things, both revenue growth, operating efficiencies and then getting the benefit of the platform.","Josh Tilton","That was helpful and then just following up on Fusion Compiler. Has it been going up head-to-head specifically against Cadence's full digital flow? And if so, how have the win rates been there?","Aart de Geus","Well, we really have mostly one competitor in that area and it's a very worthy competitor. So yes, we compete all the time against Cadence. Let me just leave it at the fact that, I think right now, we have a very, very strong capability.","Operator","I'll turn it back over to our speakers.","A - Aart de Geus","Well, with that, thank you for all the questions, and again, thank you for your support. We had a strong quarter. We have a whole rest of the year to go, as you know, and we look forward to talking to you again in the quarter. Be aware that for some of you, we are also available later on after the call.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our teleconference for today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last one hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thanks, Ana. Good afternoon, everyone. Hosting the call today are Aart de Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys; and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect.","In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release. In addition, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures during the discussion. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentations, are available on our website at synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Aart de Geus.","Aart de Geus","Good afternoon. I\u2019m happy to report that Synopsys delivered another outstanding quarter and passed the $3 billion mark in trailing 12-month revenue. An exciting milestone as we enter our next phase of growth, and it\u2019s a good time to think our Synopsys team, our customers, our partners and all of you for your support.","We entered fiscal 2018 with expectations for solid revenue, earnings and cash flow. As a result of strong customer demand and excellent execution, we\u2019re on track to substantially exceed the targets we communicated last November and expect to deliver double-digit revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share growth for the year.","For Q3, we posted revenue of $780 million, with strength across all product groups; non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.95, and we generated $289 million in operating cash flow. We repurchased $165 million of our stock, bringing the total for the year to $400 million.","Lastly, we\u2019re raising our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Trac will provide more detail in a moment. The customer environment is strong, as the age of AI, or digital intelligence, drives hefty investments by traditional and new semiconductor and systems companies, as well as software developers across many industries.","Investments are directed at supplying the increasing demand for compute power, cloud storage, and networking infrastructure, all in support of massive data and complex software. Add to that the huge and growing challenge of security, and one can readily see that the need for design solutions will continue to expand for years to come.","Synopsys is uniquely positioned to address these technological challenges, sitting at the intersection of hardware and software. As a result, we\u2019ve grown and strengthened our leadership position in EDA, built a strong and broad IP business group, and branched out into the large, adjacent TAM of software security and quality.","In this context, let me provide some highlights from the quarter, beginning with EDA. The primary driver of EDA growth is complexity. Whether due to more advanced process technologies, sophisticated designs at established nodes, or immense amounts of software embedded on a chip. In our entire history, leadership in electronic complexity has been the differentiator for the Synopsys solutions. Today, this means moving to 7, 5, or even 3-nanometer process technologies.","With our TCAD and lithography tools, we\u2019re a key partner in the initial stages of manufacturing process development. These early engagements benefit all subsequent products, as demonstrated by some of the successes in the quarter. We announced broad certification for several Samsung Foundry advanced processes, from digital and custom design to verification.","And just last week, we announced a collaboration with IBM to enable their very advanced process development with our manufacturing, digital design and IP capabilities.","Our design platform generated revenue greater than plan, reaching an all-time high, with accelerating growth over the past year. On the digital side, our recently introduced Fusion Technology, which brings about a revolutionary new level of integration between synthesis, place & route, and signoff, is really hitting the mark with customers.","Not only does the Fusion Technology provide a fundamental infrastructure to design better chips, but we\u2019ve already embedded a number of AI techniques that further improve speed, area and power. Engagements with partners and customers have grown. Samsung Foundry has certified our Fusion Technology for its 7-nanometer Low Power Plus process with EUV.","Multimedia SoC provider Vatics standardized on this technology after realizing 40% runtime reduction. We are seeing plan-of-record adoption by several high-profile systems companies. And at the Design Automation Conference, industry leaders AMD, Broadcom, Qualcomm, Renesas and Samsung presented the benefits that the new technology brings to their implementation flows, highlighting solid early results.","Now to verification, where we also delivered an excellent quarter. Demand is high for our Verification Continuum Platform, built upon the fastest engines in the industry and our number one positions in all three key areas: emulation, FPGA-based prototyping, and verification software.","Verification hardware had another very strong quarter, with broad-based adoptions and renewals. High profile companies Samsung, Intel and AMD presented to fellow engineers at DAC their real-life successes using ZeBu.","In Q3, we announced general availability of ZeBu Server 4, the industry\u2019s fastest and largest-capacity emulation system. With 2X the performance over competing systems, ZeBu is ideal for the extremely demanding verification requirements in automotive, 5G, networking, machine learning, and datacenter SoCs.","In analog simulation, Toshiba Memory and Synopsys collaborated to accelerate 3D flash memory verification. The resulting technologies address increasing design complexity and reduce multi-day simulation runs to less than a day.","Let me now move to IP, where we expect another record year. Double-digit growth in IP is driven by several dynamics. One, continued outsourcing of semiconductor IP blocks. Two, an increasingly broad portfolio covering interfaces, embedded memories, security, and processor IP optimized for high-growth markets such as automotive, AI, and cloud computing. Three, coverage of leading-edge and established process nodes. And four, the demand for IP subsystems that make it easier and more efficient for customers to outsource their designs to us.","We are seeing strong demand for our processor IP solutions, notably the ARC Embedded Vision Processor that features the industry\u2019s first ASIL-D-Ready embedded vision IP for autonomous driving applications. Our acquisitions in non-volatile memory are also bearing fruit, with significant orders in the quarter across many different market segments.","Now to software integrity, where Synopsys provides testing for security vulnerabilities and quality defects in software code during the development phase. While software developers in our traditional customer base are a prime growth opportunity for us, the number of companies who develop and rely on software as a critical component of their business is much broader than EDA and IP. This mounting need in verticals such as medical devices, financial services, automotive, aerospace and industrials represents a large TAM that we are just beginning to tap.","Our mission is to enable companies to more easily test both open source and proprietary code through a combination of a unified tool platform and consulting services. With general availability planned for next year, we\u2019re making steady progress towards our Software Integrity Platform, with early testing happening now.","An important part of the platform is the set of Black Duck testing tools, which address the growing need to diagnose security risks in open source software. A recent analysis of more than 1,100 commercial code bases found that 96% of applications scanned had open source components. 78% contained at least one open source vulnerability with an average of 64 vulnerabilities per codebase. The integration of Black Duck is going well. For us, this is visible through both early cross-selling opportunities and enhanced brand recognition.","Our services organization is another important aspect of our holistic approach to assisting the customer journey towards a more mature security development process. The progress made over the past four years has been recognized by industry leaders such as Gartner and others, stimulating further strong interest by new customers.","For example, at the recent BlackHat Security Conference, we received around 7,000 inquiries from current and potential customers, nearly doubling last year\u2019s tally. From a financial perspective, we\u2019re also executing well. We\u2019ve reached critical mass, passing a quarter billion dollars in trailing 12 months revenue, and are quite enthusiastic about the future potential.","Reaching up into emerging vertical market segments, automotive is a key focus for Synopsys, not only in software security, but across our entire portfolio. Our unique virtual prototyping is gaining traction across the automotive supply chain. By providing models of critical chips and subsystems, Tier 1s and OEMs can start software development earlier to better meet strict time-to-market objectives.","We\u2019ve collaborated with the leading automotive semiconductor companies to create the most comprehensive ISO-26262-qualified tool flow, with differentiated technologies for functional safety and reliability.","At DAC, we hosted an automotive panel with leaders from NVIDIA, Panasonic, TSMC and NSI-TEXE, a division of leading automotive Tier 1 Danso, who shared their successes with Synopsys. We also have the most comprehensive portfolio of automotive-certified IP, ranging from our ASIL-D embedded vision processor to key interfaces and memories.","To summarize our strategy over the past several years, our actions have been deliberate. First, maintain and grow our leadership in EDA. As the market leader, we\u2019re rolling out new leading-edge technology and have gained share.","Second, continue to broaden our IP portfolio and customer adoption. As the number two global IP vendor, we\u2019ve built the most comprehensive portfolio of high-value titles and continue to see double-digit revenue growth.","And third, enter and scale the brand-new, high-growth TAM and diversified customer base in Software Integrity. We believe that we\u2019ve reached critical mass by passing the quarter billion dollar mark, having built a recognizable brand, and are poised for ongoing 20% organic growth.","During the past years, we made significant investments, both organically and through M&A. We did these while also delivering on our guidance for high single-digit EPS growth. In fact, in the last two years, Synopsys overachieved, delivering double-digit revenue and earnings growth and crossing the $3 billion mark earlier than our own internal projections over few years ago.","This backdrop provides a solid foundation for continued growth and increased operating leverage in the business. We will be in a position to provide an update to our long-term operating model objectives and assumptions when we report next quarter. For now, I will say that we currently intend to drive non-GAAP operating margin to approximately 26% over the next three years, with a longer-term ambition of high-20s.","As we are presently in the middle of our budgeting process, we are not yet ready to provide 2019 guidance, but even with the change in revenue accounting next year, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to increase in FY19.","To conclude, we delivered another excellent quarter and are raising revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year. Our strategic investments over the past several years are paying off. Near-term, our strong products and customer relationships in EDA and IP are leading to very good revenue and EPS growth.","Longer-term, our expansion into the new software security and quality TAM is making excellent progress.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks, Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Reaching $3 billion in revenue is a great accomplishment that not only reflects our financial execution, but also demonstrates that our strategy and investments for the long-term are paying off. This is evident in our strong performance this quarter and improved outlook for Q4. As a result, we\u2019re raising our 2018 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance.","Now to the numbers. As I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue increased 12% to $780 million, reflecting strength across our product portfolio and in all geographies.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $716 million, which includes a $26 million charge for the Mentor Graphics patent litigation settlement. Total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $612 million, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 21.5%. GAAP earnings per share were $0.52. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.95, exceeding our target range due to strong revenue growth and operational execution.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $289 million, reflecting very strong collections and offset by a one-time payment of $65 million related to the Mentor legal settlement. Cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end were $741 million, 18% of which is onshore, with total debt at $622 million.","We launched a $165 million accelerated share repurchase in May, bringing our total buybacks year-to-date to $400 million. As a result, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our share count versus last year. We currently have $325 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","We\u2019re progressing very well with our integration of Black Duck, and remain on track to achieve our 2018 target of $55 million to $60 million in revenue. This estimate reflects a purchase accounting deferred revenue haircut of about $20 million. In addition, we continue to expect Black Duck to be approximately $0.12 dilutive to 2018 non-GAAP EPS and to reach break-even in the second-half of 2019.","Before moving on to guidance, let me provide some brief commentary about the new ASC 606 revenue accounting rules, which will go into effect for us in fiscal 2019, beginning in November. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, we do expect a one-time loss of backlog at the time of transition. While revenue recognized under the new rules will be slightly lower than under the current rules, we do not expect a material impact based on our current forecast, and there is no impact on cash flows or the economics of the business.","As we look to 2019, please note that we\u2019re still working through our normal budgeting process, and are assessing the business outlook, coming off another record hardware and IP year in 2018. Therefore, we would suggest that it\u2019s premature to change your 2019 estimates until we provide detailed guidance next quarter. We will also provide a full-year, full view of our long-term operating model objectives and assumptions at that time.","In the meantime, let me reiterate what Aart said. We intend to increase operating margin in 2019 and beyond, with a goal of reaching 26% in the next three years and the high 20s longer-term.","Now to fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 guidance, which reflects overachievement in Q3 and incremental upside in Q4. For Q4, the targets are: revenue between $774 and $804 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $722 and $738 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $655 and $665 million; other income and expenses between minus $3 million and minus $1 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between $153 million and $156 million; GAAP earnings of $0.39 to $0.47 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.76 to $0.80 per share.","The revised targets for fiscal 2018 are therefore: revenue of $3.1 billion to $3.13 billion; other income and expenses between minus $5 million and minus $3 million; a non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 13%; outstanding shares between $153 million and 156 million; GAAP earnings of $1.55 to $1.63 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3.89 to $3.93 per share; capital expenditures of about $110 million; and cash flow from operations of $460 million to $500 million, reflecting the one-time Mentor legal settlement.","In conclusion, we delivered strong Q3 results and are raising full-year guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP earnings, reflecting another year of double-digit growth. We reached $3 billion in revenue by investing to carry out our growth strategy, while also delivering on our earnings commitments and returning cash to shareholders through a consistent stock repurchase program.","We\u2019re confident in our balanced approach to maximizing long-term shareholder value, making the most of compelling revenue growth opportunities while also driving operating leverage.","Let me now turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Mobley with Benchmark. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Good evening, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to delve a little bit deeper into your implied Q4 operating margin on a non-GAAP basis. I believe the implied operating margin is what 16.5%, down about 500 basis points sequentially, down about 700 basis points from what you\u2019re implying 2019 operating margin maybe. So I\u2019m just curious what sort of investments have been made, because Black Duck seemingly would be just a small contribution to that dilution? And \u2013 well, I\u2019ll stop there and change the question?","Trac Pham","Okay, Gary. You\u2019re in the ballpark, Gary. The \u2013 it\u2019s really a timing of the expenses and nothing unusual. I wouldn\u2019t take the Q4 expense ramp and normalize it for next year. Given how strong our outlook is for the year, we\u2019re seeing a true-up in our variable comp program this quarter and the next quarter as well. So it\u2019s really a reflection of very strong outlook for the year.","Gary Mobley","All right. And your main competitor announced a cloud-based delivery system at the Design Automation Conference. And I think your position has been that maybe the infrastructure isn\u2019t ready from a security standpoint, from a file system standpoint, and just from a latency standpoint. I wondered if you have softened on that stance and maybe just give us your latest thoughts on whether or not EDA is ready for the cloud?","Aart de Geus","Sure. The first thing is to understand clearly why people are interested in the cloud. It\u2019s to find sort of the sweet spots between available performance and the economics, and this is often driven by the need to have point utilization go up for a short periods of time, for example.","From a practical point of view, all large customers have very large clouds themselves. We have a very large cloud. And actually, we have quite a number of customers that are running the software on our own cloud, and we have a substantial number of customers that are running our software on commercial clouds already.","It\u2019s also noteworthy to say that we have an ability to provide also our emulation through the cloud. And so the combination of all of those have definitely provided opportunities for customers to either get peak performance or if they\u2019re very small to start without having to make big investments.","The comment on security is one that on one hand have dramatically improved, on the other hand never quite goes away. And you\u2019re correct that quite a number of years ago, there was a very high concern about security and rightfully so, I would say.","Today, that is substantially better resolved It is also the case that customers are a little bit more centered in terms of how they look at the issues. I think, on the margin, any system retain certain vulnerabilities and, of course, that is helped or hopefully helped by our other part of our business. But fundamentally, I think, the time for doing certain things on a variety of clouds is upon us.","Gary Mobley","Thank you, guys.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re, welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Question on operating margin. You\u2019ve done quite a bit of M&A in the Software Integrity business, which you\u2019ve indicated is going to be dilutive to margin this year. Is there anyway you could give us a sense of what the operating margin of the base business would be without the SI business without the Software Integrity business?","Trac Pham","That\u2019s a good question, Rich. I think if you were to look at the commentary that we provided in the past around our investments in Black Duck digital and even Coverity when we started five years ago, it would probably \u2013 our overall operating margins would probably go up on the order of 250 basis points because of the investments in the new TAM.","Aart de Geus","Yes, if I can answer that, you may recall that every time we\u2019ve made one of the major acquisitions, we said that notwithstanding the fact that these companies typically tended to not be particularly profitable in the first place. There was a haircut in that we typically would work through those in a period of 18 to 36 months. And I grant you that\u2019s a fairly broad window, but the circumstances were all different.","I think, we are living up very much to that. And so an additional reason why we think that now the time has arrived for that business to see some operating leverage is that we are a critical mass. The integrations have gone well. And in general, the markets that we hope would be a positive market has definitely manifest itself. So we see growth opportunities. So it\u2019s our job now to make sure that, that additional growth comes at high degree of profitability.","Rich Valera","Thanks for that. And just a quick follow-up to that Trac. The plus 250, what baseline would that be relative to that sort of relative to your expected fiscal 2018 baseline?","Trac Pham","Yes, Rich, that refers to where we are at today.","Rich Valera","Got it. And then just one more on the ZeBu Server 4, nice to see that when GA at DAC. Can you say if there was \u2013 I know it was in production with limited production release, I guess, before that with, I think, you mentioned 10 customers or more in that release. But what\u2019s their pent-up demand of customers that wanted ZeBu Server 4 and now they\u2019re getting it sort of in this current quarter and beyond?","Aart de Geus","I wouldn\u2019t say pent-up demand. I think that, that we manage the demands by virtue of introducing the product gradually, which allowed us to make sure that it was really a solid by the time we went to general availability. And also some customers were clearly further ahead and they\u2019re thinking about how to bring up software on hardware as part of a strategy to increase the speed with which he could bring products to market.","And they\u2019re now a number of quite extraordinary stories of chips for cell phones, for example, for smartphones, that literally shaves off the number of months to go-to-markets and I had to tell you that, that\u2019s a market that is hypercompetitive. And so I think, the capabilities are coming online at the very moments, where the demand is strong. And so we have high hopes for the new Server 4 ZeBu.","Rich Valera","Got it. Congratulations on a strong results. Thank you again.","Aart de Geus","Thank you, Rich.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Diffely with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Hey, good afternoon. Just a thought on the operating margin projection they have over the next few years. So most of that increase coming from the software integrity [Technical Difficulty].","Aart de Geus","Hi, Tom, I had a hard time hearing you. But I think the question was, where is the operating margin expansion coming from whether it\u2019s specifically to software integrity or across the board? I would \u2013 yes, the short answer is, it\u2019s going to be across the board. Having reached $3 billion of revenues, we\u2019re at a point where we should be able to drive cooperating leverage in the business. The expansion is going to come through a combination of both solid revenue growth going forward and looking for improvements in the way they were executing on the various businesses.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Would you expect the software integrity business acquisition rate to slow then going forward?","Aart de Geus","Well, we generally don\u2019t comment on what our acquisition strategy is. And so going into it, we\u2019ll look at each deal on its own and whether or not it fits into the overall strategy.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then, Trac, I know it\u2019s early, but can you give us a feel for what you\u2019re seeing right now for the tax rate for next year? I think it was going to go up 700 basis points?","Trac Pham","Are you asking about the tax rate, Tom?","Tom Diffely","Correct. Yes?","Trac Pham","It\u2019s still little early. I think, I would say, it\u2019s safe to say, it\u2019s somewhere between 13 and where it\u2019s been historically 19.","Tom Diffely","Okay.","Trac Pham","And again, we are in the midst of working through how we\u2019re going to approach tax strategy going forward in light of the very significant changes in the U.S. tax \u2013 U.S. taxes.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then finally, when you look at the some of the advancements of 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer nodes, how large are those nodes today from a business point of view for you? Are they just nodes you want to get in front of before they happen or \u2013 are they \u2013 is it meaningful revenue today?","Aart de Geus","So the \u2013 if you look at the advanced nodes, the nodes that are now moving into substantial production that are most advances is really 7-nanometer. The 5-nanometer is now technically ready and the first designs are being done and the 3-nanometer is at least, to say, at least is work in progress, I would say.","But what is quite astounding is that, these technologies would have been viewed as impossible again a number of years ago and here we go. And that\u2019s a theme that we know well for like over 20 years now. And so we are in the midst of quite exciting technologies that are in high demand, but also demand \u2013 the high degree of sophistication of the tools, and so we feel right at home.","Tom Diffely","Okay. Thank you.","Aart de Geus","You\u2019re welcome, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Pitzer","Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a solid results. Thanks for that. Let me ask the question. Trac, just one more question on the operating margin target sort of 26% over the next three years, given that there is leverage as revenue grows. Can you help us understand the underlying growth rate assumption to hit that target? And if you\u2019re not ready to give us sort of an absolute numbers, somewhere you could kind of give us a relative number to kind of historical trades the business has seen?","Trac Pham","Yes, I think you answered the question there, John. We\u2019re not prepared to talk about the FY 2019 or the components of the long-term model. But definitely, we\u2019ll give you more details of that in December. At a high level, I would refer you to the comments that we\u2019ve made in the past in terms of where we see the growth for the different areas of the business.","Traditionally, we expect growth in EDA in the low to mid-single digits. IP is comfortably in the low-double digits, and then software integrity is in that 20% range. The other thing I would highlight is in terms of revenue growth year-over-year, keep in mind that we\u2019ve got the benefit of the extra week for this year, which accounts for about 2% impact. And then even though, I think, at a high level that 606, the new rev rec rules will be immaterial to the the results. It will have a slight negative impact too to the numbers. But we\u2019ll give you more details to that coming December.","John Pitzer","That\u2019s helpful. And then, Aart for you, I\u2019ve spent the last couple days in the Valley at the Hot Chips Conference. And at least over the last couple of years, there\u2019s sort of been a resurrection of the debate in sort of general purpose compute versus ASIC, the thought process being with things like Moore\u2019s Law becoming more difficult the large scaling slowing and end of law that maybe we\u2019re entering into a world of just more ASICs over general purpose compute. I\u2019d love to get kind of your thoughts on that to be, I guess more importantly, if you\u2019re moving into a more ASIC-driven world, how does that impact your business model within EDA, but maybe across your portfolio?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well, in my mind there has been no doubt already for many years that while general computing will continue to be pushed forward massively, especially at general offerings in the cloud, that the demands of the emerging machine learning in AI techniques are that with the present success. The one thing you\u2019d like to have is not 2x more computation, but a 1,000x more computation.","And so no matter how hard you squeeze the silicon technology and who get squeeze still further, there\u2019s no reason to be able to believe that you could get thousand times faster results. And so what can you do? Well, the thing you can do is to say reduced the breadth of the problem, i.e., go to special processors that do a task particularly well and now suddenly you are in the 10 and 100x more capabilities, and you can call that an ASIC, or you can call that dedicated processors. But that is where this is heading at a rapid speed.","And the evidence is already clearly visible and we can see it in our own business, because in the last few years, we have had a number of brand new semiconductor companies that all are building the ultimate AI chip, and we\u2019ll see which one is the ultimate. But the investments are broad. We see a number of existing players add substantial dedicated engines to their offering.","And so I think, the push will be on \u2013 in every dimension. And we benefit from that, because these are designs that all immediately go to the leading edge that used the most advanced the silicon techniques that typically drive the complexity of the chips to the maximum that is manufacturable at a, not even reasonable cost, but affordable cost, and it\u2019s driving the state-of-the-art.","Lastly, I wouldn\u2019t underestimate the amount of effort that is also going into various forms of storage and, of course, the communication between processing and storage, because, of course, the term big data is not new to you and there\u2019s a lot of data. And so the key is going to be where do you keep it and how quickly does it become accessible for computation.","So all of this, I think, bodes well for the domains that we\u2019re in, including the very fact that there are also some risk factors in the form of security around these systems. And we have the good fortune of touching many of those from multiple angles.","John Pitzer","Aart, is there anyway of quantifying what this new dynamic has done either to your growth over the last couple of years or your addressable market, whether it\u2019s looking at kind of non-traditional customers that might not have been customers a few years back or however you want to cut it? Is there anyway to sort of quantify what this does to the growth rate of the TAM?","Aart de Geus","Well, as you know, the growth rates are a function not only of the technical needs and the demand, they\u2019re also a function of the health of the semiconductor industry. And as you may remember many years ago actually, five, six, seven years ago, there was always this lamenting of the semiconductor industry not growing particularly well.","Well, the opposite has been the case precisely, because that very industry supplies the hardware that makes this possible. And so it\u2019s really a phenomenon that is actually pretty broad. That doesn\u2019t mean that every year will be an incredible banner year. I think, it\u2019s more that the solidity of \u2013 about the market that we serve and of our own market is higher. And maybe that is an additional reason why we\u2019re looking at healthy growth going forward, but also the opportunity to focus more and increase our operating leverage in that process. So I would consider both of those terms part of a healthy market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Sterling Auty","Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Trac, maybe a couple for you. As we\u2019re sitting here trying to work our models, especially as we\u2019re working into the quarters of next fiscal year need to understand the comparables with Black Duck. Can you give us a sense of what the organic growth was in the quarter?","Trac Pham","The organic growth for SIG, generally, we think the market is growing in the 20% range and we\u2019re keeping pace with that.","Sterling Auty","No, I\u2019m saying for Synopsis overall. So if you look at what is the organic revenue growth for Synopsis overall?","Trac Pham","Overall, I think that, I would say, the majority of what growth, which we\u2019re seeing in the business right now is organic. The acquisitions we made this year that has material impact is really on Black Duck. And keep in mind, while we\u2019re successful in terms of driving that north of 250, this is on a $3 billion-plus business. And you\u2019re seeing growth across the entire portfolio and you\u2019re seeing across all regions. So a lot of healthy growth.","Sterling Auty","Because I was looking at an estimate that would be somewhere around 125 to 150 bps of impact to the growth rate in the quarter if you want organic versus reported?","Trac Pham","Well, we haven\u2019t talked about that separation. I\u2019d just say, we\u2019d safely say though a good portion of a large portion of our growth for this year is organic.","Sterling Auty","Okay. And when you talk\u2026","Trac Pham","You can see where that\u2019s coming from to is, we\u2019re having a phenomenal year on IP, and the growth rate in EDA has been very strong for the last two years.","Sterling Auty","Okay, okay. And the comment that you made about 26% operating margins over three years, since you\u2019re transitioning to ASC 606, I want to make sure we\u2019re on the same page. Does that 26% include the benefit if you have one of moving to the sales commission recognition under the new rule. So in other words, are you recognizing sales commissions upfront today? Are you going to move to ratable? And how would that impact that 26%?","Trac Pham","You\u2019re starting at the highest level of \u2013 the increase in 26% will really be operational. As far as reporting goes, 606 has two impacts for us. One is on the impact of revenues for next year, which would be is negative, but we think is immaterial. As far as the impact on commissions, the net-net of that is going to be neutral over the next few years.","So when we talk about improving operating leverage, it really truly is operating leverage as opposed to any reporting benefit or drag. And while I\u2019m on the topic, we\u2019ll give more details in 2019 of December, but we want to clarify that. When talk about margin improvement, we do expect margin improvement in 2019 even with the impact of 606. The specific amount, I think, we\u2019ll have to test out, but we do expect margins to improve.","Sterling Auty","Excellent. And then last question, Aart, you mentioned products that are currently actually running on the Synopsis cloud and on the customer clouds. I think, it\u2019s easy for us to understand how verification emulation will work in the cloud, because you\u2019re running kind of a batch process versus some of the actual design where you have that interaction. So I\u2019m kind of curious, which products are actually up and running in some of these customer or Synopsis clouds for customers?","Aart de Geus","Well, we actually, I think, have examples, I would say, broadly across the spectrum. But your opening comment is actually right on, which is that the variety of verification or analysis tools tends to go to the cloud first, because they\u2019re very batch-centric. And so you do large simulations there, for example, or large verifications and I think that will continue for awhile.","We have really not announced what we\u2019re doing in this area. And so I don\u2019t want to have too many comments on this. But I think, the gist of your question has its own answer, it is very much verification.","Operator","Our next question goes to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I had a few couple of quick clarifying ones and one long-term one. So for the July quarter sort of one thing that happened is gross margins came down. Can you help us understand why there was a case of hardware slowing down a little bit due to the outperformance over the last couple of years?","Trac Pham","Keep in mind, Mitch, that the \u2013 there\u2019s a few things that actually roll up into COGS, it\u2019s not just hardware. So I wouldn\u2019t extrapolate changes in gross margins as strictly an impact of variation in hardware. Remember, we \u2013 the Sidense acquisition that we made last year, which is a services business \u2013 security services business, you\u2019ll see the COGS flow that line.","And then the other part is, there\u2019s an element of IP specifically, the consulting part of IP that\u2019s recognized on a percentage completion basis, and you\u2019ll see COGS there. And there\u2019s really no correlation between the movements in COGS and gross margins, because the variability of IP and hardware as we stressed over the last few years has been very lumpy.","Mitch Steves","Yes.","Trac Pham","But overall when we look at individually of that, we feel like we\u2019re running the business in a appropriate way as far as margins for \u2013 at the gross margin level for each of those businesses.","Mitch Steves","Got it. And then the second clarifying one is, so your cash flow number of 460, or 500, right. So I know you guys had a bunch of one-time charges. Can you maybe walk us through what the, I guess, the normalized one would be, because you had the Hungarian loss, you had the repatriation and you had the Mentor settlement. So what would be kind of the more normalized cash flow number?","Trac Pham","Yes, you hit the big one. So let\u2019s take \u2013 let\u2019s start with the guidance for the year. It\u2019s 460 to 500. We had \u2013 we have about $165 million of one-time items for this year, right? At the beginning of the year, we had a $33 million payment related to the Q4 repatriation. Early in the year, we also had an outflow $65 million related to the Hungarian tax dispute.","Now keep in mind, that\u2019s still pending, but we had to pay in order to litigate. And then in this past quarter, we had a $65 million outflow for the Mentor settlement. And so at that end, it\u2019s \u2013 you can see that the business is healthy and generating very, very strong cash flows.","Operator","Our next question goes to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Hi, thank you. Aart, two broad questions for you about the EDA market or Synopsis as a whole. The first part is, as Synopses business mix has evolved, including but not exclusively with SIG, and as the customer base has evolved included in particular the rise with your systems customers, what are the external or leading indicators that you as a CEO and management use, if any, to anticipate or plan the business? And then how are you thinking about the external indicators differently perhaps now than when you were a $1 billion or $2 billion company?","And then secondly and more specifically about EDA. The question was prompted by the recent announcement by NVIDIA of its touring chip. And the question is we generally assume that customers ingest EDA tools and technologies and voila out the other end comes super chips of the kind that you\u2019ve been talking about. But is that really so? In other words, what have you seen and what do you think you\u2019ll need to see in terms of customers\u2019 methodologies and design implementation skills and differentiation having to change along with your tools and along with the node changes?","Aart de Geus","Okay. So regarding the internal \u2013 the external indicators there, obviously, multiple sort of horizons around that. The macro horizon is all around the belief that the \u2013 both connectivity and smarts of the electronics world is dramatically changing. And both of those words are relevant, because they imply large amounts of data being moved around with risk, i.e., security risks. And then, but also with the need to be manipulate, stored and so on. And therefore, opportunities for silicon utilization and new chips.","As we zoom in a little bit more into the Software Integrity business and I assume most of your question is motivated by that. There we also serve that what difference, let\u2019s say then, at least the last 10 years-plus in EDA or IP is, we are still getting many more new customers, meaning, logos that we\u2019ve never touched or even never heard of before.","While simultaneously seeing that a number of companies that we\u2019ve done business with for a number of years are gradually moving to a larger spending levels, because they adopt more with more users or with more departments in the larger companies. And those two things we watch, we measure, we look at the renewal rates, essentially, we continue to try to assess is the business healthy. And so the combination of the external landscape and the internal execution so far have been good.","When you talk about companies like NVIDIA that are extremely sophisticated, they also have extremely sophisticated utilization of our tools of combinations of our tools of certain things that they have added to this. And the word methodology is right on, which is really great companies know what to pay attention to and when to pay attention to in the flow.","So that they a, reduce risk and b, maximize how much they can squeeze out of the given silicon technology. In general to your point of do people have to evolve their methodology? My answer would be absolutely yes. The complexity that we see is changing, not only in scale, meaning, more transistors. But also in systemic complexity, meaning, more dimensions that have to be satisfied simultaneously. And the traditional dimensions of speed, area and power are still very foundational.","But so is now the approach to temperature, thermal issues on a chip the dealing with the reliability and safety of certain constructs in automotive spaces and so on. And then on top of that is increasingly the intersection between hardware and software, where a lot of issues popup, but also opportunities are sitting.","So it\u2019s in that context that we provide an increasingly large amount of methodology support and help. And also in our Fusion Technology have integrated a number of tools together to essentially accelerate what could be viewed as methodology, but is really the intersection between tools. So this may sound somewhat convoluted and complex and for us is actually good news, because that\u2019s where we add value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Monika Garg with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for taking my question. So first one here for our estimates, software security is growing 20%, which you talked about. And it could be greater than $350 million business next year, which is a pretty good sized business. Could you talk about how to think about the profitability of the business? And is 20% growth a right way to think about the growth?","Aart de Geus","Well, we\u2019ve said before that we do see this business growing in the 20% range. And so after that, you probably did the math correctly. We\u2019re not pre-announcing 2019, but directionally, you\u2019re certainly right on the mark.","From a probability point of view in a very rapidly growing business, we have commented on the individual pieces, where each one of the companies we acquired over time were becoming profitable in eight to 36 months. We have commented I believe on Black Duck turning profitable in the second-half of next year.","And so you can see that, in aggregate, all of that is moving in the right direction. And yes, there will be a bit of trading off how we look at growth versus profitability and how we manage that. But in the bigger picture of Synopsys, the numbers that you\u2019re mentioning essentially say, this is heading towards being 10% of the overall company. And while it\u2019s material forward to the bottom line, it is in that range of its contribution.","Monika Garg","But Aart, you are guiding to greater than 40% top line growth for this year. Black Duck, you have given us estimate, it\u2019s probably adding about 2% in organic growth. And even if I take the effect of the extra week in 2018, I mean, growth definitely is accelerating year-over-year on the organic basis. Could you talk about the factor, which is leading to high growth? Thank you.","Aart de Geus","Yes. Well, again, I\u2019m a little reluctant to get too close to giving directives for 2019 largely, because we\u2019re not done with our own process. And we tend to not extrapolate from years that are not great and not extrapolate from years that are great. We just want to be careful and making sure that we hit it just right against what we think we can deliver.","Having said that, I think, the reason why overall growth is good is, because the external factors of the importance of electronics and used electronics has the broader term for combination of hardware and software are very positive. The complexity is all coming our way in the EDA\u2019s direction for providing sophisticated tools. And I think that over the last few years, we have proactively made investments that maybe penalize the OPs margin a bit, but we\u2019re, I think, right on from a strategic point of view. So we feel that we\u2019re in the right position.","So the combination of all of that says, okay, we\u2019re looking forwards to give you a predictions on 2019, but we\u2019ll do that at the end of last year. And lastly, we continue to see in a number of areas the run rate of the company grow. And so, at least, it says, we have a fairly solid outlook.","Monika Garg","Okay. Just last one on the cloud side. Could you talk about how ready Synopsys solutions are for usage in the cloud? And are you seeing interest from customers to use the solution in the cloud? Thank you so much.","Aart de Geus","Well, we can make things work quite well in the cloud. It is different than when people own their own environment for a variety of reasons. It is also interesting that, the EDA utilization of computation tends to be at the high-end of sophistication. Meaning that our programs are arguably among the most complex and demanding in the software world period.","And so they tend to use both maximum computational power, but also need a high degree of memory availability to actually run the very large designs that are there. And so we have quite a number of customers that on their own run a number of our products on the cloud. I think, they are continually looking at the economics in their favor or are they better off if they are a large customer to do it themselves. And I think that won\u2019t go away anytime soon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of them. Aart, you spoke about your foundry customers doing like 7-nanometer and then 7-nanometer plus at EUV. I\u2019m kind of curious when new customers start doing that, where they start introducing EUV either for like 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, several layers. What impact does it have on EDA design? Is it a material impact, or do you have to go and redo the design? I\u2019m just kind of curious and then I also had a follow-up question?","Aart de Geus","Okay. Well, in general, every time we introduced anything new in reality, it reduces complexity, it adds more things that you have to know about what that technology is. And while EUV has different needs in terms of masks or fewer needs in terms of mask-making, it is typically limited to only the lowest layers, because it\u2019s quite expensive and slow. And the design has to be prepared well for those techniques.","And so we\u2019re quite familiar with EUV needs and satisfy those. And so I wouldn\u2019t say that EUV has changed our business perspective massively. I\u2019m looking at it more as a \u2013 well, the push for smaller dimensions is still continuing. And so it touches another part of our company more, which is the part that is doing simulations in three dimensions of very small features, because some of those features are new \u2013 are only possible if you use EUV. But for the broad designs, it is really a set of steps that that is related to the manufacturing that we have solutions for. I don\u2019t think it changes our business picture all that much at this point in time.","Krish Sankar","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then as a follow-up, you guys have been interacting with your other customers for a long time for several years now. Back in the days like the auto customers would like to have the same design, same component or whatever design in for like eight to 10, 12 years. Has that behavior changed now with increasing semiconductor content and technology going into autos? Is that cycle time shortening, where they\u2019re willing to refresh design every few years now, or is \u2013 has that philosophy not changed?","Aart de Geus","This is a very complex question, because even when you said we\u2019re attracting a lot with automotive companies for a long time, it almost feels that we were interacting, they were not. And the reason was that automotive companies for many, many years had a layer of suppliers called the Tier 1s that really provide them with subsystems.","And what the automotive companies did, they would give the general spec of what a subsystem needed to do to them and the Tier 1s would deliver. And the Tier 1s in turn would go to the semiconductor people and those we certainly knew very well and then have certain demands for automotive characteristics in the chips.","And so we have worked our way literally up, the value chain, so to speak. And now in the last few years, we have certainly had many more interactions directly with people that actually sell cars and so automotive companies. And you say why did that change? Well, the change is, because the two macro changes on the automotive industry, one is electrification and the second one is the push towards autonomous driving are so phenomenally deep that companies have to deal with this.","What has come down from the OEM \u2013 from the automotive companies through this food chain all the way to us is that notion of safety now have to be anchored in how certain chips are designed, and we are pushing right up, because we\u2019re adding the notion of security, which is mostly manifests as software back up to them. So to say the least, we have a much richer set of interactions with them. The industry will, in my opinion, struggle with your question. Meaning that, if you want to design something for a 20- year life, just imagine using the products that we have 20 years ago and you are a most modern smartphone, it\u2019s completely inconceivable.","And so I think these car companies re going to have to go to mechanisms, where certain part of their platform is meant to survive long periods of utilization. But some of the pieces will be upgradable over the years. And that in itself is a challenging question, because if you upgrade something, there you make sure it still works.","And so you can see that the number of technology problems that are moving up the value chain is phenomenal. And while we, of course, play with many others that bring great value. I think, we\u2019re well-positioned to connect with these companies in multiple dimensions.","My last comment is, this is also visible by the way in our Software Integrity business, and we\u2019ve already done a number of transactions some quite significant directly with automotive companies. And this is almost like coming at this company from two completely different angles. But at the end of the day, they all connect back to the intersection of hardware software.","Operator","I will now turn it back over to our host for closing remarks.","Aart de Geus","Well, thank you very much for participating in the earnings release today. It has a little bit of a special color by version of the $3 billion milestone. And so we do appreciate that many of you have covered and followed the company for many years. And while we may differ in perspective from time to time, we are also very often aligned and we always feel that your reporting is to the point and appreciate the very support that you have given our company. And so on to the next milestone and thank you for the time spent today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference."],"19948":["Synopsys, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s call will last 1 hour. Five minutes prior to the end of the call, we will announce the amount of time remaining in the conference. As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lisa Ewbank, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lisa Ewbank","Thank you, Lori. Good afternoon, everyone. With us today are Aart De Geus, Chairman and Co-CEO of Synopsys and Trac Pham, Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that during the course of this conference call, Synopsys will discuss forecasts, targets and other forward-looking statements regarding the company and its financial results. While these statements represent our best current judgment about future results and performance as of today, our actual results and performance are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. In addition to any risks that we highlight during the call, important factors that may affect our future results are described in our most recent SEC reports and today\u2019s earnings press release.","We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and supplemental financial information can be found in the 8-K, earnings press release and financial supplement that we released earlier today. All of these items, plus the most recent investor presentation, are available on our website at www.synopsys.com. In addition, the prepared remarks will be posted on the site at the conclusion of the call.","With that, I will turn the call over to Aart De Geus.","Aart De Geus","Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. I am happy to report that we continue to execute very well. Our third quarter financial results were strong and we are raising our targets for the full year. We delivered revenue of $615 million with good growth across all product groups, most notably, verification and IP. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.76. We completed our second accelerated share buyback of 2016 and have repurchased a total of 325 million this year. Finally, we are raising our annual revenue, non-GAAP EPS and operating cash flow guidance. Trac will discuss the financials in more detail.","In assessing the environment around us, we see continued volatility for semiconductor and systems companies juxtaposed with intense pressure to concede and deliver the next killer products. While the latest customer earnings results are better than originally anticipated, the forecast for 2016 semiconductor revenue remained sluggish and actually worsened slightly over the past few months. Nonetheless, investments in EDA are robust and Synopsys is both ideally positioned and executing well. Our commitment to customer success remains a key source of differentiation. Our technology vision is focused on critical products with the highest impact and we balance short-term and long-term investments to drive sustainable EDA and a new TAM growth and profitability.","While it\u2019s still early to talk about 2017 specifically, given the ongoing semiconductor volatility and lumpiness of our growing hardware revenue, I will say that we are optimistic about our business and long-term prospects as we continue a track record of executing well in both good and challenging markets. In that context, I would like to thank our very dedicated employee team for their hard work and excellent execution in an extremely demanding environment.","Let me provide some highlights from the quarter in the context of the three customer groups we serve: semiconductor companies, system houses and software developers in multiple industries. In describing the state and powerful semiconductors today, I would like to use the word rejuvenation as semi companies reassess and strategize to drive the next generation of growth. They are restructuring their businesses and targeting investments to attack the emerging opportunity wave of Smart Everything. For some, joining forces with another company is the chosen route. For others, it\u2019s to focus more tightly on their most differentiated areas of success. We have worked with a number of our customers through the consolidation process and in numerous cases we are successful in broadening their relationships. This quarter, we saw some additional consolidation and are confident in our ability to work with and support these in a constructive way.","Regardless of economic challenges, investment in developing highly complex chips is a clear priority with migration to advance process nodes being a key strategy for our leading customers. As a technology pioneer, we are known for our expertise, broad portfolio, engineering support and track record of enabling these advanced designs. The cumulative number of FinFET designs continues to grow rapidly nearly 15% in just the last quarter and more than 95% of those designs rely on Synopsys\u2019 digital tools.","At the other end of the technology spectrum, our key cat products are also a differentiator for us. Used at the very beginning of process development, they enable customers to simulate and optimize key elements of the manufacturing process. This also provides us early access to critical models and information that gives us a head start in our product development. In digital design, our fastest ramping product ever, IC Compiler II, continues to proliferate. Orders in Q3 were the highest in five quarters. More than 90% of our installed base has at least one production project completed or in progress with more than 200 production designs overall. At the Design Automation Conference in June, Infineon, Socionext, Samsung and Toshiba shared with the full house their successful deployment of IC Compiler II to significantly cut design cycle time, while achieving excellent quality results.","In our mixed signal, our newly introduced Custom Compiler product has come out of the gate with great promise. Intrigued by its innovative visually artistic automation, which cuts importantly our task from days to hours, customers are showing high level of interest and we are seeing some good initial adoption. ADAC, GSI, Samsung and ST Micro shared their design challenge experiences and how they have deployed Custom Compiler to improve their productivity. In addition, we announced support for Samsung Foundry\u2019s 40-nanometer FinFET process. Also highlighted ADAC was the power of our EDA ecosystem with the goal of ensuring our giant customer success. Synopsys, TSMC and ARM hosted a popular event highlighting our collaboration efforts to enable design of the latest processors on the latest FinFET technology nodes.","Let\u2019s now look at system houses who either develop their own chips or buy them from others. They too are seeing great opportunities as well as substantial challenges where they are at leading or established nodes. In particular, opportunities around virtual and augmented reality, big data and digital intelligence are extremely promising. Simultaneously, relatively new and traditional companies in verticals such as automotive and industrial are already adopting these advanced technologies ranging all the way from silicon to software, the essence of the technical challenge and promise, the intersection of hardware and software. With approximately 40% of our revenue coming from systems companies and substantial investments around the next generation Silicon to Software continuum, Synopsys is well equipped to engage on next generation opportunities.","First, verification, the biggest design bottleneck today. A couple of years ago, we introduced our Verification Continuum platform. It integrates all critical software and hardware technologies into an increasingly seamless and high productivity solution. Positive customer reaction is leading to rapid adoption throughout the platform. ADAC, QUALCOMM, ST, Samsung and Oracle spoke about their successes using the Verification Continuum. Q3 business results were strong for both software and hardware elements and we are outpacing our competitors in terms of growth. Integration of the SpyGlass technology from Atrenta has taken our solution to a high level of impact for customers. Both the technical and business results have been better than initially expected.","Hardware verification showed strength again. We are now the fastest growing emulation vendor in the industry and also saw record orders for our HAPS physical prototyping solution. An excellent example of our customer success this quarter is NXP, which selected Synopsys as its primary SoC verification and emulation solution for its next generation automotive, secure connectivity and smart connected products. Let me talk for a moment about automotive. Over the past couple of years, we have substantially grown our portfolio in this market segment from design, to verification, to IP, to security, including excellent progress in automotive standards certification. We are beginning to see real momentum in this high promise area.","During the quarter, we announced enhancements to two of our virtual prototyping development kits, which are used by automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. One, models of Bosch IP to speed software development for electronic control units. And two, a new model for Infineon\u2019s next generation TriCore architecture. We also introduced a brand new test solution, TetraMAX II ATBG, which reduces costs and offers order of magnitude and faster runtime. While broadly used for many applications in the automotive context, TetraMAX II has already been certified for the stringent ISO 26262 Automotive Functional Safety Standard.","Moving to IP, we again saw a very good demand across product lines and continued to expand our portfolio to address ever evolving market and product dynamics. At the leading edge of process technology, we won several important 10 nanometer and 7 nanometer projects, a testament to the trust customers have in us as they tape out critical chips containing our advanced IP. In Q3, we announced the availability of the new USB 2.0 type CIP, cutting power and area for cost sensitive and energy efficient IoT edge applications as well as the latest PCI Express 4.0, targeting advanced data intensive cloud computing. We also introduced our second generation embedded vision processor to strong demand, driven by emerging automotive, drone, surveillance and augmented reality applications.","Closing with our software integrity products, our third customer group, software developers, range from semis and systems to enterprise companies in the financial, medical, industrial and energy segments. These developers face multifaceted challenges, immense software complexity with resulting product quality issues and the potentially devastating financial and safety impact triggered by security vulnerabilities. Software integrity is an emerging highly fragmented market, ripe for bringing multiple points tools together under a single integrated umbrella. Similar to how we build our EDA and IP positions over the years, our goal is to build a coherent highly differentiated and productive platform, which drives quality and security in software development. To that end, we are making good progress towards our comprehensive vision of software sign off. During software co-development, our solution enables detection and fixing of security vulnerabilities, quality defects and compliance shortcomings early in the development lifecycle. It also helps customers gain visibility into their software supply chain, thereby reducing risk inherits in third-party code.","Having substantially strengthened our go-to-market approach and channel, we are beginning to see the number of large agreements grow, contract durations expand, international business improve and renewals increase. While still early, these are good signs. In summary, we delivered another excellent quarter and are raising our full year guidance. Our state-of-the-art technology and engineering support are key differentiators as we continue to drive excellent customer relationships. And we are seeing good progress as we invest in a promising brand new TAM.","Let me now turn the call over to Trac.","Trac Pham","Thanks Aart. Good afternoon, everyone. Through the first three quarters of the year, we have executed very well in a challenging semiconductor environment. As a result, we are raising our full year guidance and again, achieving our multi-year objective of driving high single-digit non-GAAP EPS growth. In Q3, we delivered double-digit revenue on non-GAAP earnings growth and generated significant operating cash flow. In addition, we completed our $125 million ASR last week and year-to-date we bought back 325 million of stock.","Now to the numbers, as I talk through the results and targets, all comparisons will be year-over-year unless I specify otherwise. Total revenue was $615 million, above our target range. We achieved double-digit growth across all product platforms with particular strength in hardware. Upfront revenue slightly exceeded 10%. We anticipate more quarterly variability as our business evolves, however we continue to expect annual revenue model that is approximately 90% time based. Over 90% of Q3 revenue came from beginning of quarter backlog and one customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue. The weighted average license duration was approximately 3.1 years and we expect the full year average to be about 3 years.","Total GAAP costs and expenses were $538 million and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $473 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23% for the quarter and 23.7% year-to-date. GAAP earnings per share were $0.42 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.76, above our target range. We generated $252 million of operating cash flow, driven by strong collections and business levels. We are again raising our 2016 operating cash flow target to a range of $525 million to $545 million.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.1 billion, with 12% onshore and total debt of $278 million. Last week, we completed our $125 million ASR. Year-to-date, we have used over 80% of our free cash flow for buybacks. We have $175 million remaining on our current authorization.","Now to the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 guidance which excludes the impact of any future acquisitions. For Q4, the targets are; revenue between $621 million and $636 million; total GAAP costs and expenses between $537 million and $556 million; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $483 million and $493 million; other income, between zero and $2 million; our non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 152 million and 155 million; GAAP earnings of $0.46 to $0.55 per share; and non-GAAP earnings of $0.75 to $0.78 per share. For 2016; revenue of $2.41 billion to $2.45 billion, a growth rate of 7.5% to 8%; other income between $6 million and $8 million; non-GAAP normalized tax rate of 19%; outstanding shares between 153 million to 156 million; non-GAAP earnings of $1.72 to $1.81 per share; non-GAAP earnings of $3 to $3.03; a growth rate of 8% to 9%; capital expenditures of approximately $70 million; and cash flow from operations of $525 million to $545 million.","Finally, we have executed very well in a challenging environment and expect to deliver outstanding results in 2016. Growth is strong across all product platforms with better than expected hardware sales, driving a good portion of the upside for the year. This does add more variability to the businesses as customer requirements drive the timing of shipments and revenue, which is recognized upfront. As we look to 2017, we are currently working on our budget and are assessing this year\u2019s hardware strength and how it will trend next year. Therefore, we would suggest that it\u2019s premature to change our 2017 estimates until we provide detailed guidance in November. In summary, the entire Synopsys team has executed very well. Our Q4 outlook is strong, our 2016 targets are substantially better than they were at the start of the year.","With that, I will turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go to Rich Valera with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.","Rich Valera","Thank you. Yes. I would like to get a little more color on where the upside came from, from both the quarter and for the fourth quarter guidance, it sounds like clearly hardware is better than expected I guess in your original guidance, was there any other product area or GO that is coming in stronger that you previously expected?","Aart De Geus","Actually, we are fortunate that strength was very much across the board. And you highlighted already at the verification specifically the emulation ones would also highlight the IP business as having been quite strong. On the borderline between those businesses is also the hardware prototyping that has done quite well and then it\u2019s also interesting that all the way into our silicon engineering business, we have had quite good results there also. And so I think across the board we are executing well and we have seen our run-rate grow again.","Rich Valera","That\u2019s great. And just from a geographic perspective, it looks like you had another strong quarter in Japan after probably a year or 18 months of really tough certainly year-over-year performances there. Is there anything going on there? Is that sort of lumpiness in terms of the seeming Japan recovery here?","Aart De Geus","Well, as you well know, Japan has been sort of a bit of an up and down economy now for many, many years. And so I think our team continues to execute particularly well in Japan, but it is against the backdrop of a challenged economy. Maybe Trac can make a couple of comments about the year-to-year yen fluctuations that are really the only currency that we continue to deal with. But our business has been quite solid and there is a bit of hope that the Japanese economy after many years of restructuring and refocusing is actually seeing some signs of emerging health, let\u2019s say.","Trac Pham","So Rich, this is Trac. Let me just add that across the board and at the top level, we are actually doing very well. And then when you look at the geographic split as well as the product mix, we are doing well across the board. There is a couple of areas that might \u2013 that I would highlight is when you look at the services line from a product perspective in Europe, that again is also doing well and I just wanted to let folks know that it\u2019s really a function on the services line. It\u2019s a function of this year\u2019s hedge gains being just slightly less than last year. And then Europe continues to do well, but last year, we had an unusually strong product shipment that makes the comparison a little odd, but other than those anomalies, we are doing very well across the board.","Rich Valera","That\u2019s great. Just one final one for me, given the revenue upside you had for both 3Q and 4Q guidance, it seems like you could have possibly driven, dropped a little more at the bottom line. Wondering if you are actually sort of reinvesting some into the business and if so, maybe what areas you might be sort of reinvesting some of that upside into?","Trac Pham","Yes, Rich. So, you are right. When you look at the business for this year, margins will be relatively flat year-over-year. And what you are seeing is really two factors. One, the upside was as we mentioned driven by hardware, which has COGS. And the second part, as we look at the business, there are couple of opportunities to invest in both customer support as well as in product development. The ROIs on those investments were good and so we proceeded with that. I think overall I think I like the balance that we are striking between driving for growth as well as slowing earnings to the bottom line.","Aart De Geus","And in that context, I would add that we are looking at the software integrity business as one that continues to be a very interesting opportunity and so we did few acquisitions in the last 12 months that are being integrated well. And all of that has a lot of life, but it does require some level of investment.","Rich Valera","That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks, gentlemen. Excellent results.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question from the line of Tom Diffely with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Tom Diffely","Yes, good afternoon. So first, following up on the last question on software integrity, what percentage of your long-term portfolio is in place today and how much do you think you have to add there both I guess through acquisition and also homegrown?","Aart De Geus","Well, of course, this is a slightly loaded question, because we don\u2019t comment about acquisitions before we do them, but we have been very clear that we look at this as a new emerging TAM that is in a market that has many, many players, a few large ones and many very small ones all having one hotter technology than the other and in a field that is clearly almost overwhelmed by the number of security issues popping up everyday. So, just to be clear, yes, we have no plan and are not addressing the overall space of security. We are focusing specifically on the development of software and how to recognize and avoid issues upfront during that development. In that context, we are making excellent headway, because a number of years ago, we started with a fairly narrow offering in terms of languages. We have substantially broadened that. That is all our own R&D investment. We have broadened in terms of adding a number of security techniques and we are now integrating these all on a more coherent platform, which allows us to deal with the people that have to confront the security and quality issues in a more coherent fashion. And so we have now moved to starting to build a relationship with other companies that can help certify again standards. The alignment with Underwriters Laboratories is a very good example of that and we have also worked with a number of people that need help in assessing. We are in the supply chain that their software come from and it brings about some interesting surprises at times. So, I think we are in a good position, but there are clearly many opportunities. And the focus really for the last 12 months has been to broaden in security and to substantially strengthen our ability to go-to-market and move towards gradual larger deals. And the overall vision for what we want to offer is really a software sign off just like there has been a hardware sign off for 25 years, software needs this.","Tom Diffely","Okay, thanks. Moving over to the hardware side of the business, do you view 2016 as an unusually strong year in hardware that might pale off a bit next year or is it strictly just the lumpiness of that business that gives you pause for 2017?","Trac Pham","Well, we would like it to be usually strong, but this is a business that we have gradually grown into. And we are well aware that it\u2019s a business that by nature is lumpy, because when people buy a hardware equipment, the equipment gets bought when they feel that they are in a good cash position and the shipments invariably are functional of when they actually need it and so under much less control than, let\u2019s say, a recurring revenue run rate. Nonetheless, it\u2019s a good business and it ties well to our overall verification proposition. And so we are encouraged by the quality of the products that we have and of course continue to invest in driving the state-of-the-art forward in this area.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And do you think this year will be a record year, both in terms of both dollars and share for you?","Trac Pham","Well, it certainly was versus the past. We are not commenting about the \u201817 yet.","Tom Diffely","Okay. And then I guess just one more long-term question, when you look at the emergence of the Chinese semiconductor market and how some of the domestic players have talked about doing manufacturing over time, how big do you think that market gets over time and how is your positioning in that market?","Aart De Geus","Well, for us, it\u2019s always a little strange when we hear about the emergence of that market given that we were already in China in the mid \u201890s. And so we have been very intimately involved in all the steps of the development and emergence of both the talent sets, the investments, the structure of the industry, its evolution, the ups and downs. And the fact that there is now an increase and emphasis on manufacturing is not a surprise, because the volume of design in China that could potentially manufactured in China has grown substantially both in actual amounts and in the sophistication. And so we are well involved with all the leading companies there and I think we are well equipped to participate in this ongoing growth rate, which I think will continue to be high. In general, if you look at our revenue, you will see that the growth in Asia-Pacific has certainly been substantial and there is no reason to believe that it will not continue at the similar rate at least for the time being.","Tom Diffely","Yes, thank you.","Aart De Geus","You are welcome.","Operator","And we have a question from Krish Sankar with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Krish Sankar","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. A few of them, one, [indiscernible] you kind of mentioned next year you expect some lumpiness in the emulation revenue, I am trying to figure out what does it mean exactly for your revenue and margin profile?","Aart De Geus","Well, fundamentally, what it means is that we have a very high portion of our business that is very ratable and therefore, it tends to look a little bit like a straight line on the graph. Lumpiness means that sometimes you get a large order that needs to be shipped at a certain date and that revenue gets recognized at that moment and some other quarter, you may not get that. And so there is some variability that is possible in this. And maybe Trac, you can comment on the profitability or the COGS aspect of hardware business versus software?","Trac Pham","Obviously, hardware is a little lower than software, but it\u2019s still very profitable for us. And our goal ultimately is to balance that in the portfolio to drive earnings growth in the high single-digits.","Krish Sankar","Do you guys have any color or is there a way to quantify how much of your total revenues from emulation?","Aart De Geus","No, we don\u2019t break out individual products. Obviously, the EDA part is a large portion of our business and verification is substantial in that. But it\u2019s clear that this is an aspect of the business that\u2019s doing well. But I would highlight that the whole verification proposition has many, many other products. And over the last few years, we have added some really superb technology in the debugging side, partially via the acquisition of SpringSoft. More recently, you may recall Atrenta and really these building blocks fits very, very well together and are all doing quite well.","Krish Sankar","Got it, I mean it\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to follow-up, it looks like you guys have under $200 million left in the buyback, what is your capital allocation size in a go forward basis to the extent that you can comment on it?","Aart De Geus","We will say as what we have said in the past. We will continue to use our balance sheet in the way that makes more sense. In the past, that\u2019s been a combination of investing in M&A to drive long-term growth and then returning cash to shareholders when that makes sense. Just for reference, when you look at last year, we spent over $280 million on buybacks, which is almost 70% of free cash flow. And then this year-to-date, we have been pretty \u2013 even a little bit more aggressive with that and we have raised the buybacks to be about 8% of free cash flows for the year.","Krish Sankar","Got it, very helpful. And then just a final question, when you look into like the future and let\u2019s say, emulation does get to be a bigger chunk of your revenues even though it\u2019s lumpy and they have some slight detriment on the margin profile, I am curious, what are the levers that you guys actually have if you want to continue maintaining 8% to 10% kind of earnings growth profile, is it mainly going to come from top line growth or do you have other levers you can put to actually make the earnings profile better? Thank you.","Aart De Geus","Well, as you know, we can always try to drive profitability harder. At the same time, there is a balance there of how much do you want to invest in new opportunities. And we have done a very conscious effort already starting in the early 2000 in broadening our portfolio to build a substantial IP business and then most recently in the last 2.5 years in investing towards the software integrity space as opportunities to grow additional businesses. So over a long period of time, we remain very committed to deliver mid-20s operating margin as the constant objective, while maximizing the revenue growth as the way to continue to strengthen and broaden the company.","Trac Pham","Krish, this is Trac. I would add that our focus is to drive this business and grow this business sustainably over time, so that\u2019s going through a combination of both \u2013 a combination of revenue growth, operating margin expansion and then reduce our share count. And so those things collectively should help us grow our earnings at high single-digits long-term.","Krish Sankar","Got it. Thanks guys.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","We have a question from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jackson Ader","Thank you. This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling. One question from our side and that is in the software portfolio, is there \u2013 you already spoke about I think some things that are outperforming your expectations, is there anything in the product portfolio that may be underperforming your projections?","Aart De Geus","Well, at any point in time of course, we have a very broad portfolio. To be honest, I am not sure how many products we have. And we have big products and many smaller products and so all of the products have waived. But this past quarter actually, economically speaking, the results were quite strong across the board and so nothing jumped out. But always, products that are in investment mode or that are in next generation mode, that\u2019s an ongoing job for us and has been now for many decades.","Jackson Ader","Okay, fair enough. Thanks. That was all from us.","Aart De Geus","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we will go next to Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Thanks. Good evening Aart and Trac. Aart, let me start with you on the subject of technology and products, somewhat broad question, one thing we are seeing pretty much across all of engineering software not just in the EDA part of it are some fundamental issues that are being addressed by some of the major companies around basic software architecture, computer science, if you will, in that respect as it relates to EDA, one of the more interesting announcements I thought at DAC was from answers regarding some new data and architectural issues that they are addressing. And so the question for you is do you think that you and EDA generally are positioned well enough in terms of capacity and so forth for the next number of years architecturally or do you think that these are some issues that you are now going to have to fundamentally address as some of your peers in engineering software seems to be doing. In terms of a couple of specific products in your case, it seems very clear that you are putting a lot of incremental or renewed effort behind DC and if you could comment on that and you are also seeing some good new momentum in DFM where you seem to have broken out of the sideways revenue pattern that you are in for quite a number of years or perhaps you could comment on your DFM opportunity as well?","Aart De Geus","Well, so when you say are you going to have to revise your architecture, we are revising architectures all the time and it tends to come in two ways into a constant smaller tuning and optimizations versus every so often doing a redesign of let\u2019s say, the data structure they use or the approaches to problems. And it is only through that, that we have literally been able for now 29.5 years to constantly be at the very leading edge of what technology can do and that\u2019s a necessity because we are half of Moore\u2019s Law and there is the manufacturing advances and then there are all the tools that make it possible to use these. So in that sense, we are accustomed to being sort of \u2013 for 29 years, we are behind the 8 ball, because every customer wants it to be better and so do we. Having said that, I think your generic observation that there are new opportunities emerging I think is interesting not just for us, but for the very fact that a lot of people are now looking at processor architecture changes to accommodate the fact that various forms of digital artificial intelligence will become a more and more important for different types of applications. And so we see a number of customers focusing now on what can they do to essentially reinvent computation to satisfy and enable that. And that ranges literally from what to do around big data all the way to a pattern recognition, learning and so on that gets applied to now a number of fields including automotive. So I can certainly never say that we are good enough. The whole point is to always say we are not good enough and keep pushing.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","Okay. And then in your case, there was a specific sub-question regarding DC and your DFM business?","Aart De Geus","Sure. So the design compiler is a product that itself has gone through a number of these types of generations. And it\u2019s obviously a leading edge tool that has an immense broad utilization on all the most advanced nodes. And so they are two. We have a substantial effort ongoing for both optimization and tuning as well as looking at architectures that could improve things, going forward. DFM is a bit different. DFM tends to be a number of economically smaller products that are highly specialized. Many of those have also fewer customers because it addresses mostly the people that are manufacturing, but I don\u2019t have to tell you that the physics of manufacturing in the last few years has done an easy 10x of growth in complexity. And that is actually good news for us because that caters directly to some of the strength of that team. And we have made a number of fairly substantial investments, I would say going back 4 years to 5 years where we are seeing some good return on it now. And as mentioned to another question earlier, we have a broad portfolio and so it\u2019s a constant allocation of investments with an intent and hope to see a return 2 years to 3 years later.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","To finish up with Trac, a couple of financial questions, you seem now to have pretty much solidified your position as the second largest in relation to target by revenue after Cadence, by our calculation just doing some quick math after the results, it looks like your emulation business might have been up by nearly half sequentially and up maybe more than that year-over-year and so the question is given that kind of revenue growth, are you seeing some commensurate margin scaling in the emulation business or you basically have to give that up to get the volume deals done like with XP [ph] for example. And then could you say whether the percentage of revenue from your largest customer was up, down or sideways versus Q2?","Aart De Geus","If I may jump in, you just asked Trac a whole set of questions that he is definitely intending to not answer because not only do we not disclose individual products, we are certainly not disclosing the economic profile of those. But there is no question that whenever products do better, there is an opportunity to either improve the margin structure because that\u2019s what good business does or to continue to invest and accelerate the development of future technology and we clearly do both. And so we are thankful for that business being strong, but I think we will leave the commentary on that. Do you want to add anything, Trac?","Trac Pham","No, no comment at this point.","Aart De Geus","Anything else, Jay.","Jay Vleeschhouwer","No. Thank you.","Operator","Okay. We will go next to Gary Mobley with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.","Gary Mobley","Hi everyone. I am not sure if it\u2019s been said, but congratulations on strong execution for the year. With hardware becoming greater mix to the revenue, I am curious to know whether or not this goes to a backlog building quarter, whether or not you can build on your year end backlog for 2015 of $3.6 billion and with some costs with respect to the longevity or sustainability of the strong hardware revenue, as you approach 2017, are you still going to try to provide guidance based on the old axiom of 90% of forward revenue coming out of backlog?","Trac Pham","Yes. Gary, this is Trac. We will give more \u2013 actually, we will give the specific backlog number at the end of Q4. What I would say is that year-to-date, our business has been very strong, bookings have been solid and then run rate has been up. So the underlying economics of the business is very healthy. And then for the quarter, I guess specifically for the quarter, 90% of revenues came from backlog.","Gary Mobley","Okay, alright. Just one follow-up question, I think in the past you commented that software integrity represented \u2013 might represent about $100 million in the total mix of the broader group for 2016, do you still feel comfortable with that revenue level?","Aart De Geus","Yes, that is what we are targeting for this year.","Gary Mobley","Okay, alright. Thank you, guys. Again congratulations.","Aart De Geus","Thanks Gary.","Trac Pham","Thanks Gary.","Operator","We have a question from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. As a follow-up on the software security verification, your expectation was this segment to go 18% to 20%, is that the growth you are still seeing and when do we expect the segment to break even and then positive operating margin?","Aart De Geus","Well, we continued to invest. And as you know, we have also made some acquisitions. And so every time you do that, that pushes the profitability down somewhat, but the job of course is to bring that up as we integrate things. So we expect it to be slightly dilutive in \u201816. But we are very encouraged by a couple of things. One is that the quality, the sophistication of the solution that we have is truly starting to be viewed as strength. And so I think we have good opportunities. But in parallel to that, especially in the last 12 months or so, I think we have strengthened the ability of our channel to not only sell the solution well, but also to gradually move towards larger transactions. And as you probably know, many of these fields that are emerging tend to be very small deals and you build them gradually. Well, we have seen now a number of transactions grow in size. A number of them have become multi-year, which were different than what originally the companies we acquired started with. And we see the opportunity to have a stronger broader relationship with the companies that use our software. So all of that feels like the early days of EDA. And in that sense, we will reassess continually how to balance the profitability drive versus the growth. We will prioritize growth, but rest assured that it\u2019s only a business if it becomes profitable and if it becomes more profitable overtime, otherwise, it\u2019s a hobby. And so we will continue to push on that as well.","Operator","Thank you. And we will go next to Mitch Steves with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mitch Steves","Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess the first question is kind of Intel side of the equation. They just announced a new partnership with ARM during their Analyst Day or I guess the big presentation. I am just wondering if that was expected or if that may potentially impact the business at this time?","Aart De Geus","Yes. Well, of course, it was expected, because we have been informed quite a while ago. And as a matter of fact, we have quite a number of customers, as you know, that do ARM cores and that optimize those for different set of technologies. And so I expect that we will be very helpful at getting the best out of the technology that Intel has to offer for people that want to build their products around ARM cores and we are already quite engaged in that.","Mitch Steves","Okay, got it. And then secondly in the software integrity piece, I know you guys already talked about the $100 million number, but if I were to think about the long-term growth, is it fair to assume that, that will kind of help pace or potentially at least keep up with semiconductor IP as a whole?","Aart De Geus","Yes, certainly. We look at our businesses in terms of growth rate as EDA being suddenly very profitable, but the lower growth rate, IP in the middle and software integrity at the top of those. And so it\u2019s almost a classic decision set on how to balance the investments among these different categories as we build the company that hopefully delivers continuous high single-digit earnings growth going forward by essentially balancing a portfolio of different needs.","Mitch Steves","Got it. Thank you. Great quarter.","Aart De Geus","Thank you.","Operator","And we have a follow-up from Monika Garg with Pacific Crest Securities. Please go ahead.","Monika Garg","Hi, thanks for the follow-up. Question on the operating margins, if we compare your op margins with Cadence, your margins are still like almost 250 basis points lower in spite of the fact Synopsys has much higher revenue base, almost 30% higher and we are seeing good top line growth. So, why are we not seeing more leverage in the model?","Trac Pham","We do have leverage in the model. I think as I mentioned earlier, margins are relatively flat this year, but it\u2019s important for us to manage this business sustainably over time. And when you look at the earnings guidance that we have provided for this year, it\u2019s predominantly driven by operations, right. And so our balance this year is just trying to invest appropriately to drive growth long-term, while also generating high single-digit EPS growth.","Monika Garg","Yes. Just a follow-up then, semi industry is in the midst of consolidation, but Synopsys had seen two good growth years last year, it grew 9%. You are guiding to almost 8% for this year. So, the question is, are you not seeing impact on consolidation or do you think you are gaining market share?","Aart De Geus","Well, we certainly do see the impact of consolidation, because all of these transactions come to us initially always with the request of can you reduce our cost? And while we are trying to accommodate customers as much as possible, we also try to offer our solutions, whereby we can do fulfill a broader set of their needs. And in that context, I think we have continued to do well also because many of the technologies that we provide are essential and are at the leading edge. So, none of this is simple. And as you well know, in our industry, we have talked for quite a number of times, including at many of our earnings releases about what\u2019s the impact of this. Maybe especially in 2015, where there were a number of very large consolidations, I think we have fared well with these and we are thankful for that, but this is just part of an evolution in the industry around us and I think we are well positioned to continue to be a cornerstone supplier to people that are really going to drive their own companies to the next state-of-the-art level of applications and that\u2019s a good position to be in.","Monika Garg","Thanks a lot.","Aart De Geus","You are welcome.","Operator","Thank you. And I will turn it back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Aart De Geus","Well, we thank you for your attendance at this call. As usual, we will follow-up with a number of you after this and we hope that you have a good rest of the day. Thank you so much."]}}
