Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2018 earnings call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide details on our second quarter performance by markets, discuss margins and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Gee, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that once again materially exceeded our internal expectations on the top and bottom line, and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. For the quarter, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 2.8% with comparable hotel EBITDA margins up 90 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 6.7% to $476 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 10.2% to $0.54. Based on our second quarter performance, we are again raising our full-year guidance for RevPAR, adjusted EBITDAre, and adjusted FFO per share.","For the full year, we have increased the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR guidance 12.5 basis points to 2.1%, increased the midpoint of adjusted EBITDAre by $20 million to $1.545 billion and increased the midpoint of adjusted FFO per share by approximately $0.04 to $1.74. These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth, and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT.","As mentioned in our press release, we closed on a previously announced sale of the W New York on Lexington Avenue on May 9 for $190 million. In addition, we also stated that we have placed the W Union Square under contract for $171 million. The W Union Square has significant money at risk, and we anticipate the sale closing before the end of the third quarter. Once complete, these two asset sales will have sold for a combined cap rate of approximately 1.3% and reduce our exposure to profitability-challenged assets in New York, a market that faces headwinds as a result of significant supply increases and continued expense inflation.","Selling the W Union Square exemplifies our continuing efforts to upgrade the quality and profitability of the portfolio. Including the W Union Square, over the last 18 months, we have recycled out of over $1 billion of low RevPAR, low-growth, and high CapEx assets at an aggregate 5% cap rate into hotels with higher RevPAR, higher growth, and lower CapEx needs at the same cap rate. This accretive activity has only served to bolster the iconic and irreplaceable nature of our hotels. Please note that included in the guidance is a one additional asset sale we discussed on our last quarter call. The timing in that sale has been delayed, but we still do anticipate a closing by year-end. The combination of the newly announced W Union Square disposition and the delay of our additional asset sale incrementally reduced our full-year adjusted EBITDAre by approximately $2 million.","As Michael will discuss in further detail, our investment-grade balance sheet has never been in better shape. With leveraging only 2.4 times, over $500 million of cash on hand, and $700 million of capacity available under our credit facility, we are well positioned to drive shareholder value whether by acquiring assets, investing in our iconic portfolio or buying back stock. We continue to maintain a disciplined approach to capital allocation; and although we are evaluating and monitoring several acquisition opportunities, we are not including any additional purchases in our revised full-year guidance.","As it relates to investing in our portfolio, we spent approximately $86 million on CapEx in the second quarter, which is consistent with our plan to spend between $475 million to $550 million on total CapEx. Notable projects during the quarter, including guest room and restaurant renovations at the Swiss\u00f4tel Chicago, and a lobby and public space at the Westin Seattle. We also completed our multi-year transformation of The Phoenician during this quarter as we delivered the tennis and activity center and upgraded the golf course. The Phoenician is nothing short of spectacular and we anticipate that the transformation will position the property to drive meaningful increases in revenue and profitability.","As I mentioned, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line as our scale and platform continued to drive operational outperformance. Working with our managers, our asset management and enterprise analytics teams did another exceptional job of driving margin growth in the quarter.","Here are just a few of the highlights. While the second quarter wasn't as dramatically impacted by holiday shifts as it was in 2017, holidays certainly influenced results in April and June. April was by far our strongest month of the quarter, with RevPAR up 5% as Easter shifted to the beginning of the month from mid-month in 2017. On the back-end of the corner, we saw the last week in June positively impacted by the July 4 holiday falling on a Wednesday, as business was pulled forward into the last week of the second quarter. As a result, our comparable hotels had a historic high RevPAR of nearly $197 in the second quarter, an increase of 2.8%. This was driven by a 2.2% increase in average room rate and a 50-basis-point increase in occupancy. Year-to-date, RevPAR increased 2.1% to $185, driven by a 110-basis-point increase in occupancy and a 70-basis-point increase in average rate.","Given the holiday shifts, group business led the way this quarter and improved 3.1%, rebounding from the first quarter as we expected. This was driven primarily by rates, which increased 2.7%, while group occupancy was up 40 basis points. Notably, corporate group revenues were up 15.2% and had a material impact on banquet and AV spend, which was up 6.6% in the quarter. We continue to see the quality of our groups improve, which is reflected in the significant banquet spend. The strong group performance in the quarter gave our managers the confidence to push transient rate and continue to enhance profitability.","Overall for the quarter, transient revenue increased 2.2%, driven by an increase in rate of 2.3%, offset by a slight decline in occupancy. Speaking of transient, we witnessed the continuation of the first quarter theme on the business transient traveler returning in the second quarter. Combine that with a sizeable increase in corporate group business and banquet F&B spend in the quarter, and it is reasonable to conclude that the corporate customer is healthy. We are optimistic that business travel will remain strong over the course of the year and into next year, particularly as non-residential fixed investment and corporate profits continue to project mid-single digit increases.","Looking comprehensively at revenue, total comparable hotel revenues increased 3.7%, boosted by an F&B revenue increase of 4.8% and other revenues increasing 9.8%. Our asset managers continue to do an excellent job working with our property managers, finding ways to increase ancillary revenues at our properties. These contribute meaningfully to our overall market performance.","As was the story in the first quarter, we continued to do a great job improving profitability in our properties and driving comparable EBITDA margin growth. In the second quarter, comparable EBITDA margins grew 90 basis points. We received a tax rebate at the Marriott Marquis in New York, which positively impacted margins by 40 basis points. The balance of the margin lift was a result of increased ancillary revenues, increased productivity and reductions in undistributed operating expenses. This translated to adjusted EBITDAre of $476 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per share of $0.54. Both were significantly above consensus estimates. Year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA was $846 million and FFO per diluted share was $0.97.","As we look into the second half of the year, our group booking pace is very strong with group revenues up 4.7%. The fourth quarter of this year remains the strongest group quarter with group revenue 5.4% ahead of last year. With approximately 95% of our group revenues on the books for 2018 and occupancies at all-time highs, we continue to see the booking window extend. The global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. The economic indicators we closely follow, corporate profits and non-residential fixed investment, remained strong. The forecast for non-residential investment has surprised to the upside and now stands at 6.5% for 2018 with 4.5% improvement forecast for 2019.","As mentioned earlier, the pickup in business transient travel continues to gain traction and provides reason for optimism. Combined with a healthy group pace for the second half of the year, the stage is set for continued increases in rates, which should drive profitability at our hotels. This is only bolstered by continued strong leisure demand, resulting from record levels of consumer confidence and low unemployment. This combination of better than expected first half results and increased macroeconomic optimism is driving the across-the-board raise to our full guidance.","As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance for the full year to a revised range of 1.75% to 2.5%. This is predicated on our belief that the first half, which materially outperformed our expectations from the beginning of the year, will match our long-held top line expectations for the second half of the year. We feel very confident that this is achievable given the strength of our second half group pace and supportive macroeconomic factors.","Consistent with this trend, we are anticipating comparable EBITDA margins of 25 basis points to 75 basis points based on our revised RevPAR range. At the new midpoint of 2.1% RevPAR growth, we expect comparable EBITDA margin growth of 50 basis points, an increase of 40 basis points from the midpoint of our prior guidance.","2018 adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $20 million at the midpoint to $1.545 billion on a revised range of $1.525 billion to $1.565 billion. I would point out that this increase is on top of the $25 million increase in guidance we posted last quarter, while also factoring in an incremental $2 million in lost EBITDA due to the W Union Square sale, offset by the delayed closing of one additional asset sale. We are increasing 2018 adjusted FFO per share by approximately $0.04 at the midpoint to $1.74 on a revised range of $1.71 to $1.76.","In closing, we are pleased with another beat-and-raise quarter as it continues to demonstrate the attributes of our premier lodging REIT. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to continue to outperform our peers in the near, medium, and long term.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and our balance sheet in much greater detail.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we had an outstanding second quarter, with impressive beats to our internal top and bottom line results, as well as consensus estimates, enabling us to increase our guidance for the full year.","Comparable RevPAR increased 2.8% on a currency-neutral basis, of which 80% was driven by average room rate and, in part, drove comparable EBITDA margins to increase an impressive 90 basis points this quarter. 40 basis points of the margin expansion was related to a tax rebate at the New York Marriott Marquis, with the remainder of the strong performance driven by rate-driven RevPAR growth, better-than-expected F&B revenues, an increase in ancillary revenues and broad operational efficiency. As a result, adjusted EBITDAre increased 6.7% to $476 million this quarter, which was $21 million or 5% above consensus estimate. In addition, adjusted FFO per share grew over 10%, which was $0.03 or 6% above consensus estimate this quarter. We remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property and asset managers to bring more profit to the bottom line.","Now, I would like to address the Marriott Starwood integration that has been the topic of discussion this earnings season. We have not seen any measurable impact from the sales integration. In fact, the RevPAR index for our legacy Starwood portfolio actually outpaced that of our Marriott legacy portfolio in the quarter.","Furthermore, we continued to reap the benefits from the Marriott Starwood revenue and cost synergies. In particular, we continue to accrue benefits from reduced OTA charges, procurement, credit card, reward and centralized system cost. We will continue to monitor and work with Marriott to ensure a smooth transition, and we are very pleased with what we have seen to date.","Looking at specific performance in our individual markets, our best-performing domestic markets this quarter were New Orleans, San Antonio, San Francisco and Orlando. RevPAR increases range from 8% to almost 12% in these markets, generally benefiting from strong corporate group business. Overall, group revenues increased double digit in these markets with growth ranging from 12% to over 14%. Our New Orleans Marriott outperformed this quarter with RevPAR growth of 11.8%, exceeding the STR upper upscale results by 440 basis points. The impressive results were driven by increases in average rate of 7.4% and a 3.4 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong citywide demand in the quarter resulted in an increase in corporate group room nights, which allowed our managers to drive transient rate.","Group revenues increased 13.5% and transient rate increased over 9% this quarter. In addition, the strong group business at the property contributed to a 7.5% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business. Our hotels in San Antonio increased RevPAR by 10% this quarter driven predominantly by average rate that grew 8%. Strong group business, in particular, improved group revenues over 14% and boosted food and beverage growth by almost 19%. The RevPAR growth at our San Francisco hotels exceeded our expectations with a significant increase of 8.6%, driven by a 6% improvement in average rate and a 2.1 percentage point expansion in occupancy.","The Fisherman's Wharf Hotel benefited from its rooms renovation, while other hotels benefited from strong corporate group business. Total group revenues increased 13.5% and food and beverage revenue grew 15.4% with a more profitable banquet and catering revenues increasing 19%. Our Orlando World Center Hotel continues to benefit from strong overall leisure transient demand. However, in the second quarter, the hotel's RevPAR growth of 8% was primarily driven by strong group business. Group occupancy grew 6.3 percentage points and group average rate increased 5.7%, combining for 12.4% group revenue growth. Once again, strong group business allowed for more aggressive pricing, driving up the average rate by almost 7% and increased banquet and catering revenues by over 10%.","Looking to markets that were more challenged in the quarter, our hotels in Boston experienced a RevPAR decline of 2.9% in the second quarter as weaker citywides contributed to the decline in group business. There was a 40% drop in the number of citywide this quarter and only one event at the Heinz Convention Center, which impacted our two large hotels in Boston. RevPAR in our hotels in Atlanta decreased 2.7% in the quarter, primarily from an average rate decline of 3.2%. Our performance was particularly challenged from the renovation disruption at The Whitley, a Luxury Collection Hotel, which is undergoing a conversion from a Ritz-Carlton.","In Los Angeles, RevPAR at our hotels declined 2.2%, resulting from a 2.9% decline in average rate, slightly offset by a 60-basis-point increase in occupancy. Impact from the Marriott, LAX and Manhattan Beach Marriott renovations in 2017 negatively impacted our properties in the market. If we exclude Boston, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, the remainder of our portfolio grew RevPAR at 3.7%.","Moving away from our quarterly results and looking to our forecast for the full year, we expect our hotels in Miami, Philadelphia, Maui, and San Francisco to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate the DC, Houston and Atlanta markets to underperform.","In July, we paid a regular second quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price. In addition, this represents a payout ratio of 46% on our adjusted FFO per share. We did not repurchase any shares in 2018, but have $500 million of capacity available under the current share repurchase program. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility as we are the only large REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintain as we believe it is a prominent differentiator to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value creation opportunities throughout the cycle.","As of June 30, 2018, we had cash of $646 million and $551 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $4.2 billion, with an average maturity of 4.5 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4%. In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Subsequent to the quarter-end, we repaid $150 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility and, as a result, have approximately $500 million of cash and $700 million of available capacity. Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.4 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility, providing a significant dry powder for external growth opportunities.","Moving to outlook, lastly, as you model and forecast out the remainder of 2018, please keep in mind that we generally earn approximately 20% to 21% of our total adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results which enabled us to increase our guidance across the board for the year.","Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value combined with a powerful investment grade balance sheet, is a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to shareholders over the long term.","This concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore ISI.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the question here. So, I've got one. I'll make it count. With respect to capital allocation, clearly Host is interested in portfolio recycling which entails both buying and selling assets, and you guys have done a fair amount of both recently.","My question here is, on the acquisition side, given the fact that private markets are pretty strong, there is liquidity out there looking to be allocated to hotels and a lot of that carries a low cost of capital, how do you sort of thread that needle between being a public vehicle with a certain cost of capital versus the private market for acquisitions which may or may not accommodate that at any given time?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Rich. Happy to address your question. So, as we think about our strategy which we have articulated very clearly, it is to continue to build out the iconic and irreplaceable portfolio of hotels which we identified in our supplemental disclosure, the top 40. The top 40 hotels which have a RevPAR of roughly $234 accounted for roughly 62% of our EBITDA last year and generated close \u2013 over $900 million in EBITDA. So the portfolio within the portfolio is larger than any other standalone REIT that's in the public marketplace today. So we think about iconic and irreplaceable. We think about having scale and geographic diversity.","And the last pillar really is the investment-grade balance sheet. So as we sit back and say, how do we get there, how do we continue to build out iconic and irreplaceable, our view is that there are two ways to do it. If the markets are \u2013 depending on where the markets are, you either buy hotels or you sell hotels.","And we take a constant read of acquisition opportunities in the marketplace. We take a constant read of where the capital markets are today. And if we see an opportunity to recycle capital out of lower RevPAR hotels with slower growth prospects and in need of CapEx, that's certainly something we would consider to do because it's very consistent with our strategy.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. And maybe one quick follow-up there. I mean, where \u2013 what do you think the public markets are telling you to do right now?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Be prudent allocators of capital, maintain your discipline, and don't be shy about recycling when you see the right opportunities, and don't be shy about buying when you see the right opportunities. And if your stock price...","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Got it.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","If your stock price happens to dip and you think your stock is a good buy, we have $500 million authorization and we certainly won't be shy about buying back shares.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thank you, Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Powell with Barclays Capital.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning. In New York, there's talk that there could be hotel undersupply over the next few years given strong office space construction and increasing Airbnb regulation. How do you balance the opportunity maybe to continue to monetize the assets in New York at low cap rates versus what seems to be improving long-term outlook in the market?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, Anthony, I think we would agree that that New York generally as a market is always going to be a good hotel market. Clearly, it's the highest RevPAR market in the country. I would tell you that we look asset-by-asset as we always have and we look at how we think our hotel is going to perform over the near to medium term and build out whole value scenarios and we look at alternative usage for every property in the portfolio, including our New York hotels.","And as we mentioned in our release, we closed on the W Lex and we have the W Union Square under contract. And as we looked at the right strategy for each of those assets, we took all those factors into consideration.","I think for the near term, New York is going to continue to have supply headwinds. We're obviously very in line with what's happening, with leveling the playing field from an Airbnb perspective, but New York is still going to have a lot of supply for the next two or three years, in our opinion, and it's a high-cost market in which to operate. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we're taking steps to reduce our exposure to profitability-challenged hotels, and those are hotels with high expense ratios, high expense flows and expense inflation and hotels that are in the need of CapEx.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Michael.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","I just wanted to stick to the topic of CapEx. I guess maybe you think out to 2019, how are rising costs, both labor and materials, kind of affecting your thinking? And does it change timing of any projects that you have in the hopper and kind of how does it move up and down or how do assets move up and down on the potential sell list as you think about CapEx needs?","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, CapEx is obviously one factor that we look at, Michael, when we evaluate what we think a hotel is worth to us. We are early into the budgeting process for our comprehensive 2019 capital plan. We'll have some meetings in September to really drill down, and as we do every year, look at hotel by hotel project by project and make some determinations on if owner-funded CapEx is required, is there a value play and are we willing to invest in the asset.","So obviously, we have a full in-house capability with our design and construction group, and we're very current on trends in both labor and materials cost. And when we sit down, we will have all those facts and figures in front of us.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Understood. And then, as you think about acquisitions and what you're underwriting, does that change any \u2013 your thought process on maybe redevelopment or deeper repositioning opportunities for the potential deals you might \u2013 may or may not be looking at today?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think that when it comes to acquisition underwriting, it's the same process. And, of course, if we feel that as part of our underwriting that the CapEx needs of any particular potential acquisition or any value enhancement project that we might undertake are such that we will not be able to underwrite to our return hurdles then that will change our point of view about moving forward.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's all from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you...","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hi, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. When you look at some of your larger hotels in the portfolio, is there an opportunity or would you take the approach to kind of incrementally group up that others seem to be having some success on? You mentioned some hotels are like more profit-challenged. Would that be a strategy at some of your hotels?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think, we developed \u2013 Smedes, we developed a optimal revenue strategy for every property in the portfolio. And those strategies are revisited on a daily basis quite frankly. So, as I mentioned, we have 95% of our group on the books. And we saw a nice pickup in corporate group, which is frankly more profitable given the higher total spend with food and beverage and AV revenues. So I think there's a balance.","And clearly at some hotels, it makes sense to take more group, depending on what's happening in a particular market in a particular year. In other hotels, you want to take less group because you feel that you can drive corporate group, which is short-term bookings and higher-rated transient business into the property.","So we have always had the strategy of optimal group transient mix. It's nothing new for us. It's something we've been doing for years, and we're right at about 40% group now, and it's going to vary by hotel and by market.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you. You mentioned the tax rebate for the Marriott Marquis in New York. Was that related to just an appeal or something else? And then as you look at your margin expectations going forward, are there any tax rebates expected in those numbers?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","It's not related to an appeal, it was an inducement; an inducement to redevelop. As you may recall, we in partnership with Vornado, redeveloped a retail parcel there, and we had some help from the city. We also got some help from the city on the Westin Grand Central. There will be minor tax ICAP rebates in the second half of the year, but it's nothing material or worth talking about.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","On the margin side, Smedes, right, as we mentioned on the call, we had a \u2013 the property tax rebate had a 40 basis point impact to our margins. That's the same amount for the year-to-date. For the full year, the ICAP margin impact will be 17 basis points.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just following up on the last question. Were those tax rebates included in guidance before, or that helped, guys, I think, you still would have raised even if it's new.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I'm sorry, Tom. Can you ask that question one more time?","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. So you said you raised your full year guidance by $20 million, right? Were the tax \u2013 was the Marriott Marquis New York tax rebate in your prior guidance or was it not in your prior guidance? And I imply that it helped you by $5 million to $6 million. Is that fair?","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thomas, it was not in our guidance and your assessment is fairly accurate.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So you still would have raised, but by not as much. And then on the W New York sales, you highlighted earlier on that you sold them at a 1.3 cap rate. Obviously that's a very impressive cap rate for a sale. One would assume the buyers have or don't want the 1% cap rate. Can you just talk about what you expect they'll do? And did you look at other options for those properties and kind of how is your thought process around the eventual sale? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Thomas. Yes, we did look at other options for the properties. We go back to \u2013 let me take you back to 2006 for a moment, because we've been involved in New York for a long time, and in 2006, just to give you a sense of how we think about New York City, we own the Drake Hotel at 57th and Park, and we saw an opportunity to increase the FAR available to that hotel through purchasing air rights from adjacent property owners, really on 56th Street. And we assembled incremental FAR and we're able to deliver the hotel free and clear of the management contract, it was exquisitely timed, and recognized significant value. We sold the hotel for $440 million. And I think that was somewhere in the mid-20s from an EBITDA multiple perspective back then.","I can say that by way of background to let you know that we look at all options that are available to us on every asset, and we are keenly familiar with New York and the current legislative landscape and what you can do and what you can't do. And that's all been taken into consideration. And we were very comfortable and very happy with the pricing we achieved.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was hoping we could \u2013 morning. I was hoping we could drill down a little bit on some of the components of margins and just kind of conceptually. I know there's been some help with food and beverage strength, and I know there's been some help on some of the resort fees and other fees, and some of the green programs that might help on housekeeping costs.","And then there's obviously core inflation working against you. Can you kind of bucket that, whether you want to look at it for the quarter or the full year? What are some of the pluses and minuses, and how sustainable do you think some of them are going forward?","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. So, a couple of things. So, first \u2013 so why don't we talk about the margins, the 90 basis points of which rate 40 basis points was attributable to property tax rebate taking us down to 50 basis point of sort of operational improvement. Of that, it was a mixture \u2013 it really was a very broad mixture of things, both top line and bottom line. In particular, we saw super strong F&B revenues, particularly banquet A&B, driven by over 15% corporate group business in the quarter.","We also had \u2013 we talked about earlier, 80% of our ADR growth this quarter \u2013 or 80% of our RevPAR growth this quarter, driven by ADR, which as you know, just drives more profitability to the bottom line. We had a fair amount of an increase in utility revenues which are high profit, and our managers continue to try to find ways to continue to find those higher-profit opportunities in ancillary revenues.","But then, when you go down to departmental expenses as well, we saw a fair amount of efficiencies coming out in those departments as well as on distributor operating expenses. So when I sort of think about where we were finding savings and opportunities, it really was very broad, both top and bottom line.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","And then the one thing I would also throw in there on the food and beverage, we saw improvements in productivity and we saw improvements in food cost. And with the outsize spend in beverage being driven by corporate group and improvements on the flow-through that really helps our margin performance.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just to follow up on that, on the margin question, maybe to package it a little differently though, obviously, you guys called out some of the very favorable initiatives that Marriott's kind of merger is delivering for you guys now that that's complete. Would you have any ability to break that piece out separately and say, okay, look, when we kind of look at Marriott's initiatives, they're contributing this much versus our core operating efficiencies and some of the mix shift things you just mentioned are contributing, why? So just kind of internal versus external a little bit.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I think it's a little challenging, Shaun, to break it down with respect to what Marriott is doing. I will tell you that as we think about what Veenie (44:46) has said, that they continue to see margin improvements, they continue to work hard for the owners to reduce costs and expenses that we should see continued benefits from the various initiatives at Marriott. Whether it's reduced OTA commissions, we'll start seeing a benefit when the rewards programs are merged together with lower charge-out ratios on the expense side as we get our Starwood legacy hotels fully integrated into Avendra. We'll see lower procurement costs. We're seeing lower workers' comp costs on Marriott legacy properties as a result of Marriott implementing Starwood workers' compensation policies. So think about it in 2019 that maybe that's worth 50 basis points.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","And we're still expecting now a fair amount of expectation around revenue synergies driven by the sales force integration, loyalty program integration among others, so.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, guys. That's perfect. Jim, you mentioned the 50 basis points in 2019. Is that incremental or that will be sort of all-in, including some gains that are being recognized this year? Appreciate that a lot of things you said are still on the comm. So maybe more of it's next year, but is that like incremental or sort of \u2013 or total all-in?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I would think about it as being all-in, Shaun.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. No, thanks for the clarification. Thank you very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Katz with Jefferies.","Khoa Ngo - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Khoa Ngo on for David. If I can just jump back on to the capital allocation topic, there's clearly a big event going on in this space among your competitors. I'm just trying to get your thoughts on your decision-making process around company level versus the asset level. That would be great.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I'll answer the question first by saying, David (sic) [Khoa] (47:06), you never say never. However, our strategy has been clearly enunciated that we are focused on iconic and irreplaceable hotels and with scale and broad geographic diversification and investment grade balance sheet. So, when we look at individual assets versus portfolios versus other companies, our first screen is iconic and irreplaceable hotels, and that's how we think about it.","Khoa Ngo - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Maybe a follow-up on that one. Thanks for taking the question. As you look at the non-top 40 hotels, how would you characterize the typical potential buyer of those types of assets? How demand from that group may be evolving and how you would generally expect sales of those assets as you compare one-offs versus the portfolio? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. I think the buyer can come from different places. The buyer could be another REIT. The buyer could be a private equity firm, or the buyer frankly could be a sovereign. And we stay in close touch with everyone and keep a close view into the capital markets and what that financing might be available and what the cost of that financing might be and level of proceeds, and all that informs our decision as to what course of action we might take.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then maybe one unrelated follow-up and maybe I missed this in the beginning of the call, but I guess what are you seeing when you referenced the forward-booking strength, are you seeing any deviations across markets or cities? And any kind of color you can provide there as you look into the back half of 2018 and even 2019? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","We're really not seeing any deviation. As you know, some markets \u2013 performance flips market-to-market, but all-in-all, we're not seeing any deviation.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Jim...","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Bill.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","There are published reports that you are marketing $1.2 billion worth of assets; and a) curious on that front and where you are in that process; and b) as you think about if those reports are accurate, the use of proceeds would either be to build a war chest for transactions that may be on the market or coming to market and I think we can all kind of identify a strategic in a couple of other things that are out there. Or it's maybe to take quicker action on shifting the portfolio makeup kind of in response to some of the Street's requests through the years. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about what you would do if you in fact are selling that portfolio.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, Bill, you know that we don't comment on published reports. We only talk about press releases that we might issue. But if you think about what I said earlier with respect to our desire to really build out the portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable assets and if iconic and irreplaceable assets are not available or if it would make economic sense and be accretive to shareholders to buy back stock or reinvest in our portfolio, those are always all levers that we have to create shareholder value.","But to answer your question a little more directly, there are two ways that we can build out the iconic and irreplaceable portfolio. We can do it, number one, by buying those types of hotels; or number two, we can do it by selling hotels that don't fit that profile.","From a sales perspective, everything that we do starts with a disciplined review of each asset and our view of value \u2013 our whole value taking into account what we believe is a reasoned operating pro-forma as well as the capital needs of the asset going forward. That is the first screen when we're thinking about selling a hotel and when we're buying a hotel as well. So, we'll wait and see what happens.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. I appreciate that. If we fast forward a year, 18 months, do you think you still have investments outside the U.S.?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","We continue to \u2013 as we talked earlier, Bill, over the course of the last several quarters, we continue to explore options with respect to the Euro JV. We're making good progress. I have nothing to report at this time. I hope to be able to have something to report over the next two calls with respect to the Euro JV. The other assets that we have, we have three hotels in Brazil and one in Mexico City and a couple hotels in Canada that really would be the balance of our exposure outside the U.S. So, we're focused on bringing our complete focus back to the U.S.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Thanks. I wondered if you could give a little bit of color. I think you mentioned the increase in group in 2018, I don't know if I heard 2019. And then I'm also just wondering how that pace of future group for 2019 changed during the quarter. Others have suggested that some of the improvements in GDP haven't necessarily translated into better demand yet. I'm just curious for your take on that. Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Robin. Group booking pace in the quarter for all future periods is up 22%, and group booking pace in the quarter for 2019 is up 10%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And then in terms of any thoughts on how changes in macro improving the GDP has affected demand in your view or not affected, as the case may be?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I'll point to the outsized performance we had at corporate group in the second quarter. It was up almost 15%, and we saw strong spend with food and beverage, and AB revenues. And we are hopeful we're going to continue to see that trend continue over the balance of the year. We may not get a full 15% for the rest of the year, but we still anticipate corporate group to be up. And we also are hopeful that we're going to see corporate group continue to come back to our hotels in 2019.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Two-part question for me. I mean, can you talk about what you're seeing with international inbound demand right now and whether you've seen any impact from the stronger dollar?","And then just to follow-up on that last question, as I think about the demand environment, everything we're seeing whether it's record occupancies, 4% GDP, tax reform, et cetera, historically you'd think you'd see a little bit more than 2% RevPAR growth right now. So, maybe you can talk a little bit about what you think is limiting that upside right now and some of this group booking pace has been building, if going forward into next year and beyond, you could start to see some acceleration from there?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Jared. We'll talk about international inbound demand first. We saw about a 13% pickup in the first quarter, and we saw an incremental 5% pickup in the second quarter. And the inbound demand was really very broad-based in Q2.","International accounts were roughly 10% of our business and it's obviously on the coast where it's most impactful, so it's a tale of different markets as everything is in the hotel business. San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, a lot of that inbound demand is coming from Asia and New York, Boston, and Florida, it's coming from Europe and Mexico, Middle East, so we're really seeing it across the board. That was one question. Can you repeat the second question?","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. It was really sort of a follow-up to Robin's question and just the demand environment overall seems pretty strong right now with....","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Whether...","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, we finished this quarter with 84% occupancy in our hotels. We have not seen that occupancy since 2000. And going into the balance of the year, the hotels continue to remain full. 95% of our group is on the books for this year. Where we have opportunities to yield out lower rated business and increase rate, we are doing that.","We see the leisure traveler as being particularly strong. No signs of any weakness on that front. We're encouraged that corporate group is coming back. We're encouraged that the business traveler has returned. And I am confident that over time, assuming that those trends hold, which we have every reason to believe that they will, that we will be able to increase rates.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And I'll just add to that. Now, remember this quarter was interesting because you look at sort of what the attribution of RevPAR growth was last quarter \u2013 in the past couple of quarters compared to this quarter where you had 80% of your RevPAR growth driven by rate. We're certainly seeing our ability to start pushing ADR.","Jared Shojaian - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hello everyone. Can you go provide an update on the retail and signage at the Marriott Marquis? How much if at all is this helping other revenue growth this year? And then talk about the inducements at that property, is this a one-time event? Should we back it out for next year?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","The retail is virtually completely leased as is the signage. I think we have one space left. The ICAP will be around, but it will be \u2013 it will be around for a number of years, but it's going to be in lesser amounts.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then...","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","It...","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Go ahead, continue. Okay. So for that leasing, I mean, how much of that rent is \u2013 or I guess the lease payment, is that increased? If I recall correctly, that has various step-ups. Will you start to get \u2013 I imagine just a higher lease based on, I forget the formula but maybe a percentage of the lease rent at the property or can you give a quick update reminder how that works?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, you might \u2013 well, why don't we take this one offline.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I'll turn the conference over to your host, to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Coleen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter 2015 earnings call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed. And we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results, and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now here is Ed.","A - Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter and are pleased to be realizing some of the benefits of our proactive portfolio management strategy. While it's been an interesting last three months in the lodging space, we believe the reaction that's expressed through the equity markets has been over exaggerated, and we are intending to exploit that reaction both now and into 2016.","But first, let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $323 million for the quarter and $1.66 billion year-to-date, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 1.5% as compared to the first nine months of 2014. Our adjusted FFO was $0.34 per share for the third quarter and $1.15 year-to-date, reflecting a 4.5% increase over the first nine months of last year. Both earnings measures beat consensus estimates for the quarter.","These results were driven by several factors. We had expected weaker results because of the impact of the well-documented calendar changes, the late Labor Day holiday and earlier midweek timing of the Jewish holiday, which drove association business into the fourth quarter and generally limited group business overall in September. This proved correct, as our domestic group revenues looked flat for the quarter, as a roughly 2% increase in rate was offset by a 2% decline in demand. While group business at our international hotels was up significantly in terms of demand, gains were more than offset by a decline in rates, as our Rio Hotel had been able to charge very high rates during the World Cup in 2014. Overall, we saw group revenues decline by slightly more than 1% in the quarter compared to the same period last year.","At our domestic hotels, we look to replace the deferred group demand with additional transient guests. We benefited from a 4.5% increase in demand from our top-rated segments, which represented nearly a half of our overall transient business. Overall transient demand was strong in both July and September, up more than 4% in each month. Unfortunately, as we mentioned in our September release, transient demand in August was weak, which dragged our quarterly increase in transient demand down to approximately 2%.","Weakness in international travel likely contributed to our challenges in August. While international air arrivals have continued to increase, the rate of growth slowed in the third quarter and spending increases were limited. This may suggest the trips have become shorter, leading to a decline in room night demand. Arrivals from China, South Korea, and the UK continue to grow. We saw declines in travel from France and Japan.","Overall, we saw a reduction in international demand in the 5% to 10% range, which represents about 4\/10 of a percent occupancy, with slightly more impact on the East Coast versus the West Coast. Our positive mix shift helped drive an overall transient rate increase of 2.5% for the quarter, resulting in transient revenue increase of 4.5%. This, in turn, led to RevPAR for the quarter in constant currency increasing by 2.8% or 3% as adjusted for the USALI change in reporting Resort fees. Comparable food and beverage revenues grew 6.5% in the quarter or approximately 3.7% on a USALI-adjusted basis. Banquet and AV revenue increased by 8.8%. As several groups increased spending above contract minimums, we benefited from newly-created meeting space, and the short-term bookings included heavy F&B spend.","Savings in food costs helped drive very favorable flow-through, as the food and beverage profit improved by approximately 20%. Other revenues declined by 11% in the quarter, due to the timing of insurance claim proceeds related to business interruption from Hurricane Sandy, which we received in Q3 of 2014. Adjusted for that one-time benefit, other revenues increased by 1%. Overall, total comparable revenue growth was 2.1% for the quarter and 3.1% year-to-date.","Comparable hotel EBITDA margins declined 55 basis points for the quarter and are up 10 basis points year-to-date. The negative margin growth was impacted by a combination of the USALI-mandated changes and by the Sandy business interruption proceeds, which reduced margins by 35 basis points. I will now take a few minutes to provide an update on several of our activities in the context of our near-term strategy for the company.","As indicated in our September 28 press release, given that we did not believe we could replicate the success of our initial investments in the Asia-Pacific region, we have made the decision to exit Australia and New Zealand, and ultimately close our office in Singapore. As we announced this morning, we have sold our Four Points Perth Hotel, which we owned in a joint venture with GIC, as well as two hotels which are wholly-owned in Auckland, the Auckland Novatel and ibis. The total price for these sales equals $104 million. Four of our remaining hotels are effectively on the market now, and we expect that the remaining two hotels will be placed on the market at some point next year.","With respect to Europe, this morning we announced that our joint venture had sold eight of its 18 hotels, representing 2,300 rooms for \u20ac420 million, or roughly $464 million. While we continue to be interested in investing in Europe, we felt that the current market offered an attractive exit point for a portion of our portfolio, which had an average RevPAR of \u20ac113. After completing this transaction, our remaining EU portfolio generates an average RevPAR of \u20ac164 or more than $180, which is well more than double the average RevPAR for the EU market.","Our remaining portfolio includes iconic assets such as the Westin Palace in Madrid and the Hotel Arts in Barcelona. These sales represent $207 million of approximately $300 million of proceeds identified in our last press release. There is one additional international sale we had anticipated closing this year, which has been delayed by regulatory issues. As a result, the timing of that closing is less certain. Despite the fact that low stock prices have forced many REITs to the sidelines in terms of acquisitions, the feedback we have received from the brokerage community, and have experienced from our own marketing efforts, is that international investors and domestic private investors are still seeking new acquisitions, albeit in a targeted manner. We have been the most active seller in the REIT space for the last four years, having now completed north of $2 billion in sales. We continue to see opportunities to complete sales at attractive prices, and are currently marketing approximately $1 billion worth of assets. These assets include the Asia-Pacific hotels I just mentioned, one key asset located in New York, as well as hotels located in several suburban US markets that have an average RevPAR of less than $135.","In addition to these planned sales, we have identified approximately $1 billion in incremental hotels that we can bring to market in 2016, assuming that transaction pricing remains attractive. The majority of these assets are located in suburban or secondary markets, and have an average RevPAR below 120. While there can be no assurances that we will complete all of the contemplated sales of pricing we would deem acceptable, our goal continues to be to reduce our exposure to these noncore assets and markets, allowing our domestic portfolio to be targeted primarily towards urban assets located in major markets, plus a collection of iconic resorts.","Our long-term goal is to continue to grow the Company and expand our presence in attractive markets. However, as long as the equity markets continue to value our company at a meaningful discount to the private market value of our assets, we are unlikely to invest the proceeds of completed sales into new acquisitions. Instead, because of the inherent gains stemming from these sales, which could average 50% of our expected sale prices, we will likely use proceeds first to pay dividends, and then for other corporate purposes, including repaying debt to maintain appropriate leverage levels and for repurchasing stock.","As is evidenced by our purchase of $400 million of Host stock over the last six months, we believe our stock is a very attractive investment. As outlined in our press release this morning, our Board has authorized an incremental $500 million repurchase program, which means we currently have $600 million of total repurchase capacity. The timing for implementation of this program and any subsequent expansions will depend on our operating outlook, the pace of our asset sales, other potential investment options, including ROI CapEx, and our stock price.","At this point, we believe that the Company's common stock is the most compelling investment opportunity available to us today, and we look forward to deploying more of our capital for accretive value-enhancing share repurchases. In addition to these capital allocation activities, our other primary effort is to reap the benefits of the investments that we have been making in our existing portfolio over the course of 2015.","As we noted earlier in the year, we have closed three hotels to complete major redevelopments: The Axiom in San Francisco, The Logan in Philadelphia, and The Camby in Phoenix. These three projects should complete construction around the end of the year or in early January. In 2015, these three assets are expected to generate EBITDA of negative $4 million. While we are still refining our budgets for 2016, we expect these projects will generate approximately $20 million to $22 million of EBITDA with additional strong growth expected in 2017. We also expect to benefit from the more disruptive than normal room, meeting space, and lobby renovations we have completed in 2015.","To summarize, we intend to narrow the markets where we invest and operate, further reduce our exposure to nonprime suburban airport and secondary markets, benefit from the capital investments we have made in our portfolio, and most importantly, close the valuation gap between our public market value versus the inherent value of our assets through a combination of asset sales at private market values, with capital returned to shareholders through dividends and through stock repurchases. As we noted in the press release we have already returned more than $1 billion to shareholders in 2015. We expect to add to this total.","Looking ahead to the remainder of 2015, we continue to expect solid results in the fourth quarter. Booking activity in the third quarter was very positive, increasing 2.7% over the same period in the prior year. Our group booking pace for the fourth quarter is ahead of last year by more than 3% and rate is up by more than 2%, indicating that booked revenues are up approximately 5.5%. Although transient activity has moderated to some degree compared to our expectations in July, we still expect RevPAR growth in Q4 to be stronger than our year-to-date performance, leading to full-year RevPAR growth of 4% to 4.5%.","While more difficult to predict, we expect to see continued strong growth in food and beverage spending in the fourth quarter, with growth ranging between 5% to 6%, driven primarily by banquet activity generated by the increasing group business. This should lead to full-year food and beverage growth of 4.5% to 5%. We expect our adjusted margin increase to be 20 to 30 basis points for the full-year. Based on these operating assumptions, our estimated adjusted EBITDA will be $1.385 billion to $1.4 billion, and our adjusted FFO will range between $1.50 and $1.52 per share.","Our window into 2016 performance is limited, as we have not yet received our operating budget. That said, there are several factors we note that should favorably affect 2016 performance. Our group revenue pace for 2016 remains quite strong, well north of 6% compared to less than 1% ahead at this time in 2014. Activity in Q2 and Q3 is very strong. Only Q1 is currently demonstrating a shortfall to 2015 in rooms booked. We believe that is caused by some carryover renovation activity and the earlier Easter holiday, which will limit late March corporate and association events. Our CapEx spending next year will be lower.","While we are still finalizing our capital plan for next year, we expect our maintenance CapEx to fall by approximately 10% and our overall spending to decline approximately 20%. As a result, there will still be some disruption from individual projects, but we expect our disruption overall to fall short of 2015 levels. We expect the three redevelopments I referenced earlier to provide $24 million to $26 million of lift over 2015 performance, in addition to the regular internal growth we would generate from our comparable portfolio. And despite the fact that we have been a very active seller this year, including the additional international sales we discussed today, the expected incremental EBITDA contributed from The Phoenician in 2016 will more than offset the EBITDA we earned in 2015 from the sale assets, which we will not be receiving in 2016.","The net impact of those investment recycling activities in 2016 compared to 2015 is projected to be a $3 million to $5 million increase. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the third-quarter and 2015 year-to-date, especially against the backdrop of a difficult calendar shift. We look forward to a solid fourth quarter, as we continue executing our strategy to drive value and return capital to our stockholders.","Now, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory Larson","Thank you, Ed. I'll start by providing some additional details on our comparable hotel results by market. In the third quarter, our Seattle hotels increased RevPAR by approximately 10%, exceeding the Star upper upscale market results by 750 basis points. The outperformance was driven by an 11.6% average rate gain, as our managers were able to replace low-rated group business with higher-rated transient business during the summer season.","In addition, our Westin Hotel experienced strong banquet and catering business from an international delegation from China, which resulted in food and beverage growth of 18%. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we note The W Seattle will be impacted by a rooms renovation starting in December, and will likely moderate the RevPAR growth for our hotels in Seattle. Our hotels in Los Angeles also had an impressive third quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 9%, driven by average rate growth of 7.6%. Both transient and group business were solid, with revenues for both up more than 7.5%.","Food and beverage revenues were also strong and increased 11.5%. The strength in the Los Angeles market is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. RevPAR for our hotels in San Francisco grew more than 6% in the third quarter, beating the Star upper upscale RevPAR growth by 230 basis points. Strong transient business contributed to this outperformance, as demand increased 7% and average rate increased 5%, resulting in total revenue growth of 13%.","Looking to the fourth quarter, consistent with our previous statements, our hotels in San Francisco are expected to perform only slightly above our portfolio, with one property beginning its renovation and construction at the Moscone Convention Center, which is expected to weigh on group business. RevPAR for hotels in San Diego market grew 5.6% this quarter, driven by strong transient demand, which was offset -- some weaker group business. Transient revenues increased 9.4% and group revenues grew 1.7% in the quarter. Both transient and group average rate increased approximately 5%. Food and beverage revenues grew almost 17%, with the more profitable banquet and catering business growing 24%. This increase was driven by high catering contributions related to strong corporate group room nights at our Hyatt Manchester and Coronado Hotels.","The group revenue pays for the fourth-quarter look strong, and we expect our hotels to outperform the portfolio next quarter. Moving to the East Coast, our hotels in Boston outperformed the portfolio this quarter with a RevPAR increase of 5.3%, driven entirely by an average rate growth of 5.3%. Strong group business at the Calgary Marriott and the Westin Waltham contributed to group revenue growth of over 16% in the quarter, with a 23.5% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering revenues.","Total food and beverage revenues were up 18%. We expect the strength in Boston to continue into the fourth quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 4.4% for the quarter, which outperformed our portfolio but significantly underperformed our internal forecasts. Certain cancellations and citywide events that did not create the anticipated compression led to the underperformance to our expectations. Based on the strong group revenue pace for the fourth quarter, we expect RevPAR performance to improve.","Our hotels in the New York market had positive RevPAR growth of 1.3%, outperforming the Star upper upscale results by 90 basis points. The well-understood supply in the market, and a decrease in demand from international travelers due to the strength of the US dollar, are impacting the industry's ability to raise rates. We expect RevPAR to significantly lag the portfolio, and acknowledge that the dynamics impacting New York in 2015 will likely persist in 2016. RevPAR at our hotels in the DC market decreased 3.4% this quarter. As you may recall, last third-quarter, our DC hotels grew RevPAR by 9%, benefiting from several major citywide events.","The city was unable to replace these events this quarter, and the lack of compression resulted in declines in average rates across the market. We expect RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter to strengthen, as two of our larger hotels were under renovation during the fourth quarter of last year. In addition, the group revenue pace for the fourth quarter improved and looks strong for 2016. Unfortunately, RevPAR growth in Houston and Calgary continued to be constrained in the third quarter, primarily as a result of commodity price volatility and, specifically, weakness in oil. Both of these markets experienced significant declines in RevPAR for the quarter.","In Houston, RevPAR at our hotels declined nearly 10%. These declines are related to the overall slowdown in the Houston economy, mainly stemming from negative impact of a struggling energy industry. Our hotels are focused on growing group room nights to offset the transient decline caused by these poor market fundamentals. On a positive note, the group revenue pace for the fourth quarter is up almost 28%. However, even with the strong revenue pace, we continue to expect negative RevPAR for our Houston hotels in the fourth quarter. Likewise, our Canadian hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 5% in the third quarter, primarily due to the significant decline in RevPAR at our Calgary Marriott. Our Toronto Eaton Center Marriott had strong positive RevPAR growth in the quarter. Major declines in transient occupancy related to the global oil decline in Calgary were somewhat offset by an increase in group business of 18.4%. This increase in group revenues drove the food and beverage revenue growth of 28%, with banquet and catering business increasing 38%. We anticipate energy issues to continue to negatively impact our Calgary property in the fourth quarter.","Shifting to our European joint venture, our assets in Europe had an outstanding quarter, with a constant euro RevPAR increase of 9%, resulting from an increase in both rate and occupancy of 4.3% and 3.8 percentage points, respectively. The increase was driven by strong transient business as well as an increase in international travel demand with the weakened euro over the summer months. Transient revenues increased 13%, primarily as a result of 9% increase in average rates. International travel demand into the European countries increased 5% in the third quarter. As we announced in today's press release, we disposed of eight hotels in the European joint venture. We expect our 10 remaining high-quality assets to continue their strong performance into the fourth quarter amidst improving EU economic conditions.","Let's move to our forecast. At the end of September, based on market weakness for August, we provided an update to our outlook for 2015. We identified weaker leisure business in the United States and lower-than-expected growth at our international properties, mainly at our Calgary and Latin America hotels. We expect these trends to continue into the fourth quarter. In addition, while renovations will continue to impact specific hotels going forward, it is worth noting that the fourth-quarter this year will have fewer comp hotel renovations than the fourth-quarter of last year. As announced in our press release, our Board of Directors has authorized a second share repurchase program of up to an additional $500 million of common stock.","During the third quarter and through early October, we repurchased 15.2 million shares at an average price of $17.76. This brings our total repurchase to date to approximately $400 million. Along with $100 million remaining under our initial repurchase program, we currently have $600 million of repurchase capacity. With respect to dividend, we paid a regular third quarter dividend of $0.20, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on the current stock price.","Given our strong operating outlook and the generation of significant free cash flow, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend. Also, based on the asset sale plan Ed outlined in his comments today, keep in mind that the successful execution of these asset sales in 2016 will likely result in taxable gains that could lead to large special dividends. These will be one-time, but could be a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.","Moving to our balance sheet. During the quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we completed several transactions that reduced our average interest rate by 80 basis points to 3.7%, and extended our maturities to an average of 6.2 years. We have no significant maturities until 2019, and are operating from a position of financial strength and flexibility. After adjusting for the debt transactions that occurred after quarter-end, as well as taking into consideration the 391 million exchangeable debentures that we expect to convert to common shares, we have approximately $214 million of cash, $621 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility, $200 million of capacity under the term loan, and $3.9 billion of debt.","And our leverage will be at the midpoint of our stated 2.5 times to 3 times range. When taking into account the additional stock repurchase authorization we announced today, we are comfortable with pushing our leverage closer to the high-end of our range. In summary, we feel good about our results and our outlook for the rest of this year in 2016. This concludes our prepared remarks.","We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi. Good morning. Ed, on the asset sales that you've identified, do you believe you'll be able to sell some of these noncore assets at prices or valuational tools that are above your current stock price -- stock trading multiple, rather?","Edward Walter","It will obviously depend upon the asset. But yes, I think that when you look at where we are trading right now, I think a number of these sales could happen at or slightly below that cap rate or that EBITDA multiple.","Anthony Powell","Right. Thanks. And even beyond the $2 billion that you've identified as potential candidates for sale, what percentage of your portfolio do you believe is noncore? And could there be more sales even beyond 2016?","Edward Walter","Certainly, the $2 billion captures the bulk of what we would look at as noncore. I'm sure that there are -- I'm sure there's some incremental assets that, as time evolves, we could add into a sales program from the standpoint of looking at noncore sales. I think, ultimately, this is going to come down to exactly how long does the sale markets remain attractive, and what are some of the options that -- other options that we may see for that capital? Over time, what we've always wanted to be doing, and we have been doing, is looking to sell those assets in our portfolio where we see somewhat weaker growth prospects, and then redeploy that capital into higher-yielding opportunities, which today, is buying our stock.","Anthony Powell","All right, that's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Smedes Rose from Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to come back to -- you mentioned that you expect some disruption from CapEx projects in 2016. Is this related to projects that are currently underway that are finishing up next year? Or are they new projects? Maybe you could just sort of talk about what's sort of the major -- besides the three hotels that were closed and are reopening, what are some of the major projects that are underway or that you contemplate starting in 2016?","Edward Walter","Smedes, what I was referring to there was that there are -- first of all, we are still spending capital. We are still investing money in CapEx programs in 2016. The overall level, as we tried to make it clear, is going to be less than what we did in 2015 by a pretty material amount -- about 10% in maintenance CapEx and 20% overall. So the spending is clearly going down. What I was trying to highlight is that you'll still have some disruption from those individual projects just because we're obviously still doing them. The larger projects that we would be starting at the end of this year that might carry into next year would be our renovation of the Denver Tech Marriott and the Hyatt, the San Francisco Hyatt near the airport in Burlingame. Those are probably our two single biggest projects that start in the fourth quarter and carry into the beginning of next year. And then we have a series of other rooms' renovations. But again, I think the point I would make there is that, overall, we would expect that there will be less disruption in the comp portfolio next year than what we experienced this year.","Smedes Rose","Okay. And then just you mentioned maybe about $1 billion of proceeds for the first tranche of sales and maybe 50% of that would go out as kind of a specials. Could you also break out what you would think the debt associated with those asset sales is?","Edward Walter","I think what we are referring to more there is the fact that as you sell those assets, you are also losing EBITDA. And so, in the context of thinking about our overall balance sheet management, as you, if you sell $1 billion worth of assets, you dip into $0.5 billion, assuming that's how the math worked out; then some chunk of those remaining proceeds would be deployed to repay debt to ensure that we weren't exceeding leverage levels that we would be targeting. And then the other portion of those proceeds would be available for other uses, which would, in today's world, be used to buy back stock. I think as we indicated in our comments and we've talked about for a long period of time, we're generally looking at maintaining our leverage in the long run between 2.5 and 3 times. Right now we are in the middle of that range. In the near-term, we would be comfortable, given our operating outlook, to allowing that to -- that leverage level to fly towards the high end of that range. But as you are selling assets, you are ultimately going to have to make some adjustments to your debt balances to ensure that you don't go well above that range.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","We will now hear from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hey, good morning, guys. Two questions for me. The first one would be -- we've heard some of the operators, including some of the big brand companies, talk a little bit about softness in the month of October on the transient side. Clearly, you guys have a little bit more group exposure and more sort of unique exposure to individual markets, but I'm curious -- are you seeing anything that's similar to that across the portfolio or any callouts on that front?","Edward Walter","I would say that we are seeing a little bit of that, too. You make the right point, that we have a portfolio that's oriented towards group. And as I indicated, our group pace for the fourth-quarter was very solid. It improved over the course of the third-quarter because of good strong bookings in the third-quarter. But I think we are seeing some transient weakness in the fourth-quarter too.","Shaun Kelley","Got it. Thanks, Ed. And then my follow-up would be -- the other thing that I think some of the other REITs that have reported earlier have talked a little bit about is, supply growth in some of the urban and CBD markets. I'm curious, when you guys look market by market, particularly for next year, any markets that stand out to you on the supply front? And how is that sort of impacting either your asset sale program or just your general outlook for the fundamentals in those markets?","Edward Walter","There's no doubt that supply is picking up. I think one of the themes, though, that as we've looked at that, is there's also no doubt that the bulk of the supply that you are seeing nationwide is really being driven by the upscale and midscale segments. Supply and upper upscale and luxury is still well below long-term historical averages. And that applies both on a nationwide basis as well as on what we would look at as sort of the top 17 markets where our portfolio is deployed. So there is a little bit of a bifurcation there in terms of where that supply hits. I think some of the markets that are -- that I think that are widely known to have a high level of supply, that would include Houston, New York, and Miami. Those are certainly -- as we look out, and our analysis tends to do a bit of a weighting in terms of when that supply is going to hit and assumes that it feathers in over a 12-month timeframe. But it's clear that those three markets are going to see strong levels of supply in 2016.","Gregory Larson","I mean, the flipside to that would be there are certain markets like Hawaii where there is virtually no supply.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Thank you both.","Operator","We will move on to Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Good morning. So following up on Shaun's question about the softness in October, as you speak to your customers and your peers, what do you think it's related to? And do you think that it's the beginning of a longer-term downtrend?","Edward Walter","Harry, I think it's really hard to say. We -- first off, we're sort of all getting the October softness light. We are seeing it kind of a real-time. You know, our group element of our business has held up fairly well through October, at least based on all indications we have. I would imagine that we are still seeing the same international travel weakness that we saw in the summer. I suspect that that is still carrying into October. My guess is that will become less impactful as we get later in the year, because I suspect international travel tends to ebb a bit as you get into the late part of the fourth-quarter. But I'm sure that is contributing to it to some degree.","Harry Curtis","Second question is, Ed, you have seen a number of cycles. You've seen a number of REIT positive and negative cycles as it pertains to attracting funds on the investor side. What I'm -- where I'm going with this is, typically when the Fed raise rates, REIT mutual funds lose assets. Yet it's interesting that lodging REITs tend to do well. What do you think, if the Fed does begin to move rates a bit, what is your expectation as far as Host's ability to price up and keep lifting its dividend?","Edward Walter","Well, I think you are right in your assessment, first off, that when -- historically, what we've seen is that when the Fed starts to raise rates, it reflects the fact that there is an expectation that the economy -- or a realization that the economy is doing better. And so while oftentimes I think you've seen a bit of a falloff in terms of REIT valuations, or a lodging REIT valuations when that first starts to happen, folks start to also recognize that a good economy is good for lodging. To the extent that the Fed raises rates at the end of this year, the beginning of next year, and it's also because of the fact that the Fed is really beginning to believe that business investment and GDP growth in 2016 are going to be stronger than what we've seen in 2015 -- and I think that's the consensus outlook at this point, but I would also tell you that's been the consensus outlook the last couple of years at this point, is that the next year will be better.","If that all happens, I think that bodes well for us and for the other -- the lodging industry in general. One of the things that will be important for 2016 performance is to see some recovery in -- or some strengthening in demand. We obviously know that supply levels will be somewhat elevated compared to this year, so we are going to need more demand in order to accommodate that. You know, we are certainly seeing, as I mentioned in my comments, really strong bookings for next year, well better -- far better than where we stood at this time last year. And we are seeing -- a lot of our markets are really showing good, solid, advanced group bookings.","So I think if we get -- if the Fed is raising rates because the economy is better, that's clearly a good sign. What I would hope with that too is that we would not only, this may be wishing for too much, it would be good if the currency didn't appreciate considerably compared to at least the euro and potentially the yen. Because I think the area where we've been hurt a bit in international travel this year has been a fall-off in travel from Japan and from Continental Europe. And the fact -- if the currencies would remain generally flat year-over-year, I think that would be helpful for international demand, which is something that's been important in this cycle. And it would be good to see that come back at a stronger level in 2016.","Gregory Larson","Yes, I think the only thing I would add, Ed, I agree with you, right, because of our strong group booking pace and because of some of the assets that you talked about that are closed this year that will reopen next year, it would be great to have very, as Ed mentioned, strong EBITDA growth next year, which obviously means our taxable income would be higher, which means our dividend would be higher. But in addition to all of that, as Ed mentioned in his comments, as we sell assets, obviously approximately 50% of the proceeds from those asset sales will also go towards the dividend. So for all those reasons, I think 2016 looks good from a dividend front.","Harry Curtis","Thank you.","Gregory Larson","Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess just the first question I was hoping you guys could kind of give some more color on, and you gave some on the call already, is -- as we're looking out to 2016, it might be helpful to get a good understanding of what the renovation disruption you've put into guidance for 2015 was, so we know that that's going to be added back. And then also what you think the EBITDA impact from your net acquisitions and dispositions that you guys have already closed on. I'm not asking for any forward guidance, just what the impact is in your 2015 guidance from those things, so we can make sure that we adjust accordingly.","Edward Walter","Well, I think we tried to explain that in our comments, that if you look -- the assets that we owned for a portion of this year, which we sold in 2015, generated about $20 million worth of EBITDA in 2015. And then we had a -- and then when you -- we also obviously owned The Phoenician for a part of this year, which generated, call it, $6 million or so of EBITDA for this year so far. So, when we look at what -- when you take that $20 million out and you add in the full benefit of The Phoenician in 2016, we are sort of expecting The Phoenician will be in that $30 million to $31 million level next year. So that's where we get basically a lift of $3 million to $5 million on a year-over-year basis for comparing the benefit of The Phoenician versus the sales of the assets that have gone out the door this year.","Ryan Meliker","That's helpful.","Edward Walter","Okay. And then on the redevelopment side, again, we had $4 million -- we took a $4 million hit from those three assets and we expect to see a $20 million to $22 million lift from that, those are probably the most significant year-over-year drivers. We obviously know that we are spending less on CapEx next year. We know that the number of the investments we made, especially in the first half of this year, were disruptive. Without going through the whole budget process, it's hard to understand what that incremental lift will be. So, unfortunately, we'll have more detail on that as we get into our call in February.","Ryan Meliker","No, that's really helpful. Thanks for giving a little bit more detail on that. And then just the second question I was hoping you guys could answer for me was -- year-to-date, your suburban assets have been kind of your strongest performers. I know that's not always the case, and obviously, as we happen to go through the cycle, things change. But I guess the question I would ask is, is now the right time to be selling those assets, given they are kind of driving your RevPAR growth more than any other segment? And with occupancy levels where they are across the industry, you would tend to think that we'll see more compression demand into a lot of those suburban markets.","Edward Walter","I think that's a very good question, part of our assessment there. And so we think about that in the context of the assets that we are selling. I think the flipside of that is there's no better time to sell an asset than when its performance is extremely strong. And so I think partly what you are seeing here is our assessment that, while the assets are performing well now, probably will -- should perform well again next year. As we think about where we want to be invested in the long run, at least for those assets that we would end up selling, those would be the ones that we would be comfortable in letting go, even though, in the near-term, their performance has been stronger.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, that's it for me. Thanks a lot, guys.","Edward Walter","Thanks.","Operator","Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI has our next question.","Rich Hightower","Good morning, guys. So I actually want to follow up on Shaun's earlier question about supply growth. So, while it is true that midscale and upscale represent most of the growth that's going on in a lot of these markets, I guess my question is, would you say that some of those hotels are actually competitive with urban upper upscale properties such as those that Host owns? Because I think LaSalle and Pebblebrook sort of made that point on their calls, where they said some of the demand that might be -- might have previously gone into those types of hotels is actually gravitating towards either the limited service category or even some of the suburban markets. So, I'm wondering if you are noticing the same shift, or if you have a different perspective?","Edward Walter","Shaun, I mean...","Gregory Larson","It's Rich.","Edward Walter","Rich, I think you are right in that assessment that, first of all, supply is supply. And whether it comes in the midscale or upscale segment or in other segments, it's going to have an impact on the market. So at the end of the day, there still is an impact from that supply. But I think part of our point, though, is that there still is a distinction between the different segments. The supply at the upper price points is not as high. Another differentiation is, from a standpoint of the type of customer, those upscale hotels are really not in a position -- or midscale hotels are not really in a position to be able to handle the group business that our -- the bulk of our portfolio is able to accommodate. So, I would agree that I am concerned about supply, whether it's in the higher price points or in the mid-price points. But I do think that mid-price points supply will be a bit less impactful in our portfolio, in part because of our orientation towards group.","Rich Hightower","Okay. That's helpful, Ed. Thanks. And then my second question has to do with the group pace number that you mentioned for 2016. I think it's held steady at plus 6% for maybe the past quarter or so. It's a solid number. Is there any reason, though, that it maybe isn't accelerating at this point? Or is it just too early to know or to have the data?","Edward Walter","I'm actually fairly encouraged that it's stayed as constant as it has. Because I see -- the reality is, if you think about that, is that right now if you can tell me that we can do better than 6% group revenues in 2015, I would be pleased, or 2016, I would be pleased. Typically, what we have found is some other phases of this particular cycle is that when we are -- when we sort of had very strong advanced bookings, as you get closer to the actual period of time when the numbers are real, you tend to see that because so much space has been sold, you start to have less available to sell, and consequently that sort of the improvement over the prior year in group tends to decline a bit. So the fact that we've been consistently strong for 2016 throughout this year, really I view as a fairly favorable -- as a good thing. It's a good thing. You know, I would offer up too is that it's not just 2016 that looks good; we've got pretty good advanced bookings for 2017 too. So that trend is going to continue past this year.","Rich Hightower","All right, great. Thank you.","Operator","Moving on to Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple questions. You noted your third-quarter trends coming in better than Street expectations. But then it didn't really look like you flowed it through for the full-year. I just wanted to understand that a little bit more what I'm missing there. And then you mentioned your stock is attractive, but why not use full-service asset sale proceeds and increase presence maybe in the select service market? Is that something you'd think about maybe longer-term, as select service has evolved and seems to be doing -- seems to be showing good returns, taking share, et cetera?","Edward Walter","You know, Steve, it's a good -- let me deal with the second one -- question first. It's a good question about whether we should be orienting more as a select service. And if you look at what we've acquired over the course of the last couple of years, we have acquired some assets in that segment as a business. Given what I just said about supply, I probably -- and the fact that the bulk of the supply that we are seeing is directly targeted at the select service segment, I'd probably be reluctant right now, if we were in an investment mode, I would probably be reluctant to deploy a lot of capital into that space, because I think I would be concerned about the -- just the high degree of supply that's coming into that sector. And what we've traditionally seen over time is that new select service competes incredibly effectively with older select service. And so is the fact that you are seeing the increase in supply being so squarely centered in those segments would concern me in terms of accelerating our investments in select service assets at this point. Now thinking longer-term, as we think about where the Company would be in four to six to seven years, I would certainly expect that select service would be a bigger part of our portfolio looking out. But this is probably not quite the right time to be a buyer of those assets if we were in a buying mode.","As it relates to the Q3\/Q4 comparison, I think some of what you are seeing on the EBITDA side is really related to some improvements, as Greg highlighted in his comments, some improvements in Europe. And then you are also seeing on compensation, the low stock price at the end of the quarter, when run through the appropriate models for calculating stock compensation expense. Really, what we hope, at least, is move some compensation expense out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. We'll obviously see how that plays out at the end of the year, but I'm sure you could all guess how we are rooting. But that I think there was some deltas that happened as a result of that. Greg, what do you want to add to that?","Gregory Larson","Obviously, in the fourth quarter, October certainly will be one of the better quarters or better months of the year on one hand. On the other hand, certainly, I think our hotel forecast for October today is lower than what it was a quarter ago. And I'd say the same thing about our fourth quarter in general. Our fourth quarter in general rates to be pretty decent. But as we sit here today, I think our forecast as a hotel forecast for the fourth quarter is lower today than what it was a quarter ago.","Steven Kent","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from Joseph Greff with JPMorgan. Joseph, please check your mute function.","Joseph Greff","Good morning, guys. Did you actually talk about what October RevPAR growth was?","Edward Walter","No, we did not, Joe. I don't -- we just don't have a number quite yet. But it's certainly been running better than what we've seen for the rest of the year, but I don't have an updated number yet for the month.","Joseph Greff","You gave us a bunch of things to think about in terms of asset sales and capital return. How do you feel about other types of corporate actions either separating the portfolios, making them smaller and then affording you potentially longer-term down the road, larger percentage growth opportunities? How do you view those types of opportunities?","Edward Walter","You know, I think we are constantly evaluating a variety of different options for the portfolio. Certainly, one of the questions we've gotten before is about whether we could sell some of these assets in a portfolio sale context, for instance. And that's something we've looked at throughout the year, and the last couple of years, frankly. And we'll continue to look at. So far, the response we've gotten from the market has suggested that the tact we're taking, which is individual asset sales, is probably the most productive one in the long-term. But to the extent that the opportunity presents itself to sell assets in bulk, similar to what we did in Europe, albeit that transaction took almost a year to complete. Then we would try to take advantage of that. You know, as you look at other types of transactions, I know that there's been a lot of discussion about spins and things like that in the market over the course of the last couple of years. I think in the current environment, when the entire -- all of the lodging REIT stocks are trading at a significant discount to NAV, it's hard to imagine that a spin is necessarily going to close that gap as effectively as asset sales, because you are still going to -- after the spin, you are still going to have two entities that would, are going to trade, while you may see an improvement in multiple in general from having taken the step, I don't know that you are necessarily going to radically have those companies trade at a different multiple and a different relationship to NAV than the rest of the industry.","So, all this is evolving. We frankly have only been in this sort of situation where the stocks are trading at this big of a discount to NAV for sort of half of this year. We are trying to take advantage of that as best as we can. We're trying to take advantage of the balance sheet strength that we have to deploy that right now to benefit from that. And we'll continue to evaluate all sorts of options as we work our way through 2016 and 2017.","Joseph Greff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Good morning, guys. I wanted to -- Ed, I wanted to ask you kind of a theoretical question. If there ends up being some kind of M&A in this space, maybe involving some of your brand companies that you do business with, what do you think the broader implications might be? And not really getting specific, but historically, what do you think that could mean for -- do they go for more leverage with you guys? Can you guys renegotiate some things? Just high-level thoughts. Thanks.","Edward Walter","It's hard to deal with that question in the abstract, just because you need to know -- you ultimately need to know who is combining or who is buying who. So it's sort of tricky to say. I mean, our contract rights flow out of individual contracts or corporate level agreements with Starwood and Marriott. And so I don't know that those particular corporate level agreements are necessarily -- in fact, I'm fairly confident that they are not specifically affected by any transactions that might happen at the corporate level by any of those companies. So ultimately, I think our valuation of whatever might occur, whatever combinations would occur or whatever change in ownership would occur, are going to be based upon who's in charge and what their plans are for the brands and the properties that we own.","Chris Woronka","Okay. That's good color. And then just, you know, you guys have, I think you've sold some assets pretty well, actually, in this cycle. But I guess there is also -- some people ask if there's an implication if smart guys are selling assets. Does it imply that the cycle is coming to an end and at the same time you buy back stocks? How do you kind of jive all that from a very high level perspective?","Edward Walter","Well, first of all, we don't think the cycle is coming to an end. We see solid growth in 2016. And as we look out past that point in time, assuming that economic growth continues to be at least at the levels that we've seen lately, we don't see why the cycle wouldn't be continuing past that. You know, I think there's a lot of different reasons to sell assets. In our case, it's not necessarily because we think we are timing it at the top. It's really driven more by an approach to how we manage our portfolio and a long-term perspective to reduce exposure to certain markets, and then, over time, increase it to others, is the way of managing the portfolio. I would envision that other than in those periods of time that are shortly after a decline, where we probably would be -- wouldn't be comfortable that we were getting fair value for our hotels, we tend to be a seller throughout a significant chunk of the cycle. So I don't know that I would read a lot into that other than this is just a continuation of a program that we've been working on for awhile.","Gregory Larson","You know, and I think this is, obviously, Chris, as you know, this is sort of a unique situation right now where we can sell assets that are sort of in the bottom sort of, call it, bottom quartile of our portfolio, assets that maybe have slower growth rates, higher CapEx issues. But we can sell those assets at sort of lower cap rates than where we trade today. Right? And then take those proceeds and either put it out in the form of a dividend or buy back our stock at, which today, is close to an 8% cap rate.","Edward Walter","And then I think lastly in terms of the notion of buying stock back at this point in time, I mean, that's something that we obviously give a lot of thought to. But I think we are comfortable, especially at these levels, that buying the stock is a good investment. And I think we are being thoughtful about how we pursue that, because nobody knows exactly what the future holds. But at this point in time, as we are sort of -- in effect, we are shrinking the Company with some of these sales. And shrinking and buying back stock is a way to help sort of get the benefit of that shrinkage.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo has our next question.","Jeff Donnelly","Good morning, guys. Maybe just to comment that a little differently on share repurchases, I mean, how do you think about balancing the timing of your share repurchases, given your outlook on the direction of real estate values rather than, say, RevPAR at this point in the cycle? And is there a specific maybe discount to NAV that you want to see at a minimum when you make purchases? I'm just curious how you're thinking about that.","Edward Walter","I don't know that we've gotten quite that formulaic about it, Jeff. It's sort of -- we've been in a good position, I guess, in terms of how we thought about it since we've initiated the programs. It's been relatively easy to be comfortable that buying our stock was the best alternative for the capital that we had or that we would be generating. Now, if you go back to what we would've talked about in April, when our stock price was higher and we spoke about this, our assessment at that point in time was as we generated capital from asset sales or from other sources, we would look at buying -- the returns from buying the stock relative to the returns from investing in other things, whether it was new assets or whether it would be ROI investments. And so as we look to a point in time that I hope happens sooner or later, which is that the gap closes between NAV and our stock -- and by the way, I'm hoping that happens because our stock is going up, of course, as that gap starts to close, then we will continue to evaluate what are those best options for the capital that we are generating if, at that future time, you could see an acceleration in ROI investments if those proved to be more attractive. But if, on the other hand, we are at a point in the cycle where we don't think it makes sense to make new investments or new acquisitions, then you would still be buying the stock back at that environment, even though the returns might not be as attractive as they are today.","Jeff Donnelly","And maybe to circle back in your comment about portfolio sales versus individual asset sales, I think in the case of another one of your peers who recently structured a transaction to sell itself, I think people were initially a little disappointed that pricing wasn't as robust as they had hoped. Is that maybe an indicator maybe of what you are referring to is that the market is a little bit stronger for single asset sales than there are portfolio sales? And that's why you feel you have more success going that route?","I think that's a good insight. It's just -- there's a lot of activity on the individual basis. But as you start to move up in bulk, the number of players is thinner. And I don't -- I haven't had an opportunity to read everything that Strategic published. But while I think they had a high level of interest, it seems like I heard that at the end of the day, there was really -- there were only a few serious bidders. And so that is somewhat of an indication of what you are describing.","Jeff Donnelly","And what's your thinking on refocusing maybe more exclusively on the US market? I know you are pulling back in Asia and you've shrunk in some other markets. But there's been some success in doing that, I think, for other companies who have sort of retrenched into the US and maybe cut their overhead a little bit. How do you weigh that?","Edward Walter","Well, I think in the near-term, that's exactly what we're doing. I mean, we're obviously going to cut all the overhead that was in Asia-Pacific region. We only have the international offices in Europe -- are the only ones that would be left sort of as we get into early next year. In Europe, I think we've got a number of opportunities to enhance the value of the remaining 10 hotels that we have. And I think the decision has been made at this stage, is to continue to work that portfolio and then watch for what opportunities might develop in the long run. But certainly at this point in time, as we deal with worldwide capital flows, which we are making investing in Asia very difficult to do, at least on our parameters, the best markets to focus on right now are in the US.","Jeff Donnelly","And then just last question, I don't want to leave Greg out. Greg, you referenced the potential for special dividends. I might have missed it. But are you able to give us just some more specifics on the potential timing of distributions, or perhaps an order of magnitude relative to, say, your current share price or current distribution, just to give folks a better sense of how you're thinking about that?","Gregory Larson","Sure. So, as Ed mentioned, right, we are currently marketing $1 billion worth of assets. Certainly, I'm not sure if all of those assets will actually complete. But as we sell those assets and complete those sales in 2016, certainly that will increase our taxable income. And so, look it, I think the way we look at it is, at a minimum, as Ed mentioned, approximately half of the proceeds will go out in the form of a dividend. And so at a minimum, we could just put it out in a special dividend next year, which would be in the fourth quarter; or to minimize that special dividend, what you could see us do at some point next year is raise our standard dividend. And so, effectively, we've have the same dividend for the year out in 2016. But you could see us stair-step, increase our standard dividend, which would effectively reduce that special dividend at the end of 2016.","Jeff Donnelly","Thank you.","Gregory Larson","Look, it's too early to know that, but I think at the end of the day, you could do the math, Jeff, right? If we sell X number of assets and if 50% of the proceeds go into the form of a dividend, divide that by our share count, you can see what we are talking about in the form of an extra dividend.","Jeff Donnelly","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ed Walter, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Edward Walter","Thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third-quarter results and outlook. We look forward to talking with you in February to discuss both our year-end 2015 results and provide much more detailed insights into 2016.

First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Jessica. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Host Hotels & Resorts' first quarter 2014 earnings call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, here is Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Before I get started, I'd just like to say that we appreciate this opportunity to see many of you in our Investor Day 3 weeks ago, as we shared our insights on the industry and, hopefully, provided you with a better understanding of both our company and our management team.","So in terms of the first quarter, we are pleased to report that 2014 is off to a strong start with another quarter of outstanding results for the company.","Consistent with our commentary on the year-end call in February, hotel demand continues to grow, particularly in our group business, allowing us to drive rates across all segments.","In addition, the solid group demand we experienced this quarter drove exceptional growth in food and beverage. We continue to feel good about industry fundamentals that contribute to our improved outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","First, let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $308 million, which reflected an increase of 8.8% over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.33, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflects an 18% increase over last year. These strong results were driven by several factors.","First, RevPAR for our comparable hotels on a constant-currency basis increased 6.8% for the quarter, as our hotels benefited from strong rate growth and an occupancy increase of 1.5 percentage points.","Our group business was exceptionally strong as our group revenues increased by 11%, as demand increased by more than 6% and average rate improved by nearly 4.5%. All segments of our group business benefited from rate increases, and our corporate demand was up by more than 10%. While the calendar change of Easter to April clearly boosted group activity, we saw a solid demand improvement throughout the quarter.","Given the strong increase in group activity, our transient room nights were essentially flat to 2013. But we experienced overall rate growth of 3.5%, driven by both rate increases and positive mix shift, especially in our higher-priced segments. Transient revenues increased by 3.3% for the quarter.","Second, the surge in group activity translated to a 13.5% increase in our banquet and audiovisual business, which is our largest quarterly increase during the entire recovery.","Banquet revenue per group room night jumped by more than 5%, suggesting that at least for this quarter, groups were willing to spend more.","In total, we generated a 9.5% increase in comparable food and beverage revenues, also our best performance in more than a decade.","Catering activity was exceptionally strong in New York, driven primarily by the Super Bowl, as well as in a number of our West Coast hotels.","The combination of strong rate and RevPAR growth, plus exceptional food and beverage activity on flow-through, led to comparable adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 120 basis points and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit growth of 12.5%, which exceeded our expectations.","We also experienced very strong performance in our noncomparable hotels, especially our 2 large Florida assets in Naples and Orlando, where RevPAR growth exceeded 10% and EBITDA growth exceeded 35%, as we benefited from both the strong demand and capital investments made over the last year.","After a busy period completing a series of transactions at the end of the year, some of which extended into Q1, our activity has been relatively light since our last call. Our investment activity in the first quarter included the purchase of the previously announced Powell Hotel in San Francisco for $75 million. We invested $6 million in ROI CapEx as we completed the expansion of the Willow Stream Spa at The Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui.","We also invested $5 million in a series of energy conservation project and the repositioning of the Cast & Plow Restaurant at The Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey.","Finally, we invested more than $13 million in the Novotel, ibis in [indiscernible], Brazil and our Maui timeshare community as both of these projects continue to be on schedule and on budget. Today, these projects represent a total investment to date of approximately $105 million.","Looking forward, while we have a few assets currently on the market for sale and continue to pursue acquisitions, given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any transactions other than the ones we have already closed.","Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2014, as there are a number of factors that keep us optimistic about future results.","First, demand growth throughout the U.S. should continue to be strong, as key economic factors of GDP growth and business investments trend positively through the full year and international travel continues to demonstrate robust growth.","With the exception of the New York market, we continue to see supply to be constrained, especially in the upper price points. Overall, we expect average supply growth of less than 1% in our primary markets, excluding New York in 2014.","Overall, occupancy in the portfolio is ahead of our 2007 peak, suggesting that our hotels should be able to drive rate growth over the next several quarters. We expect group demand to remain strong throughout the remainder of the year. While second quarter group activity will be lower, primarily because of the year-over-year Easter holiday shift, our booking pace for 2014 continues to be quite strong as revenues are up 5.5% compared to last year.","We were also pleased to see that room night bookings in the first quarter for the remainder of the year exceeded last year's pace by more than 4%, with bookings for the month after April up nearly 10%. With roughly 85% of our full year expected group bookings on the books, we expect -- we feel confident about our group business for this year.","The combination of a great first quarter and solid group trend suggest that banquet activity will continue to be strong, other than in the second quarter, leading to improved F&B growth and profitability, which will help increase margins.","With all these in mind, we continue to expect that our comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the year will be between 5% to 6%, but we expect comparable food and beverage revenue to increase 4% to 5%, which is a full point above our prior estimate of a 3% to 4% increase.","On the margin side, given expected rate growth and positive group demand at our first quarter results, we believe we can drive incremental profitability and strong flow-through.","As a result, we are increasing our adjusted margin guidance to 70 to 120 basis points for the full year.","Based on those improved operating assumption, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance by $10 million to $1.360 billion to $1.4 billion and our adjusted FFO per share for the year to $1.41 to $1.46.","In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2014. Based on our expectations for industry fundamentals, including a supply growth forecast that remains below historical averages, we continue to believe that the current growth cycle in lodging will be sustained. Our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the economy, particularly given the significant investments we have made in our assets in the form of maintenance capital expenditures and ROI and repositioning investment.","Thank you, and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson","Thank you, Ed. We are very excited about another impressive quarter. Our overall strong performance was predominantly driven by the outperformance of our properties on the West Coast, which increased the RevPAR by nearly 14%. This was achieved with a 4.5 percentage point increase in occupancy and a 7.2% growth in average rate.","Our San Francisco, Denver, Seattle and San Diego hotels all achieved high-double-digit RevPAR growth. The outstanding results were due to robust market demand and a benefit for renovation activity at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in the prior year.","Our 5 hotels in the San Francisco market grew RevPAR by over 25%, outperforming the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by 10 percentage points.","Group and transient room nights increased 16% and 8.5%, respectively, while contract room nights decreased over 30%. This mix shift allowed the properties to drive ADR, and ADR increased in all segments by almost 16% in the quarter. We expect our hotels in the San Francisco market to continue to outperform the portfolio for the rest of the year.","The hotels in Denver grew RevPAR in the quarter by 19.3%, benefiting from excellent city-wide, which allowed the properties to shift transient to higher-rated segments.","The Seattle hotels increased RevPAR by 18.5%, driven equally by occupancy and ADR gains. The increase in RevPAR for these hotels exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by 7 percentage points.","The Seattle hotels also have an impressive food and beverage revenue increase of 31%. The restaurant renovation at the Westin Seattle and the leading space renovation at the W Seattle Hotel contributed to the outstanding growth in food and beverage revenues.","The San Diego hotels' RevPAR increase of approximately 16% exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR by almost 6 percentage points. The strong results were due to the completion of the rooms renovation at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotels.","In addition, the solid group pace of these hotels allowed the managers to drive transient ADR.","For the full year, we expect the RevPAR at our San Diego hotels to outperform the portfolio, but not to the extent that the first quarter outperformance and RevPAR will be negatively impacted by the meeting space renovation scheduled at the Hyatt for the fourth quarter this year.","For the full year, we expect the West Coast properties to continue to outperform, particularly in San Francisco, Seattle, Phoenix and Hawaii.","RevPAR growth in our central and south locations, while only 2.5%, was better than our expectations for the quarter. The anticipated weak first quarter convention calendar, combined with the unexpected winter weather, impacted Chicago hotels where RevPAR declined 2.8%.","Four of the hotels with a combined RevPAR increase of 4.6% had fewer vacation travelers due to the Easter holiday shift. We expect these hotels to show improved results in April. Our comparable results for Florida exclude our 2 large assets, the Orlando World Center Marriott and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. RevPAR on a combined basis at these 2 noncomparable hotels increased over 11% in the first quarter. Including these 2 assets, RevPAR increased almost 7.5% in the quarter.","In the central and south locations, we expect RevPAR growth to exceed that of the first quarter results and perform in line with the portfolio, with the exception of the JW Marriott Houston and the Houston Airport Marriott hotels, which will be negatively impacted by the extensive room renovation and repositioning efforts scheduled to begin in the second half of 2014.","Our properties on the East Coast underperformed our portfolio in the first quarter with a RevPAR increase of 2.6%.","Hotels in Boston had a RevPAR decline of 2.7%, while Washington, D.C. was relatively flat to last year. New York hotels' RevPAR increased 4.2% and exceeded the STAR upper upscale market result of 0.1%.","The 2.7% RevPAR decline at our Boston hotels was attributable to a room's renovation at 2 of our 5 hotels. The Sheraton Boston's room renovation began in December and was completed in that April.","And the Westin Auckland completed its room renovation in March. Excluding these 2 hotels, the other hotels' RevPAR increased 5.6%.","Our D.C. hotels' RevPAR was relatively flat. It was negatively impacted by the 2013 inauguration.","In addition, the Hyatt Westville [ph] Hotel was under renovation in the first quarter of this year. We expect that our D.C. hotels will remain challenged in 2014 due to the opening of the Marriott Marquis in May and the JW Marriott rooms' renovation that begins in Q4 2014.","The RevPAR growth of 4.2% for our hotels in New York underperformed the portfolio, but as I mentioned, materially outperformed the STAR upper upscale market by 4 percentage points due to the strategy of pursuing group business for the Super Bowl.","Both our New York Marriott Marquis and Sheraton New York hotels served as the headquarter hotels for the NFL and the media during the Super Bowl.","This strategy also significantly contributed to a food and beverage revenue increase of almost 18%. This exceptional food and beverage result was also due in part to the meeting space renovation at the Sheraton New York, as well as the new ballroom and great room at the New York Airport Hotel.","Now let me move to our international portfolio, which had an outstanding quarter. In constant currency, first quarter RevPAR for the consolidated international portfolio grew 10.3%. All of our Latin American hotels achieved double-digit RevPAR growth in the first quarter and grew RevPAR by a combined 21%. Our JW Marriott Rio benefited from demand that shifted into the first quarter in anticipation of the World Cup to take place this summer.","JW Marriott Mexico City was a large contributor to the solid RevPAR growth as the hotel is benefiting from strong corporate demand and the rooms renovation completed last year. We expect our Latin America hotels to continue to outperform the portfolio with the World Cup in Brazil this summer, strong city-wide in Chile and a strong corporate demand in Mexico City.","The Asia-Pacific portfolio grew RevPAR 8.2% due to solid convention group and increased transient business. Our Hilton Melbourne had a robust double-digit increase in RevPAR as the hotel benefited from the group demand generated from the closing of the Sydney Convention Centre. This increase in group demand allowed the hotel to drive transient rates, which were up 9% in the first quarter. It is estimated that the Sydney Convention Centre will remain closed for its major redevelopment efforts for the next several years.","Overall, first quarter RevPAR performance of our consolidated international hotels is very impressive. The comparable hotel RevPAR for the European joint venture increased 2.8% for the quarter in constant euros. The notable statistics for our European joint venture results in the first quarter is the double-digit EBITDA growth on a RevPAR growth of 2.8%. The outstanding EBITDA growth rate is due to the strong increase in food and beverage revenues and the hotels' ability to control cost. Food and beverage revenues increased 9.5% in the first quarter, mainly as a result of an 18% increase in banquet and AV revenues. The strong banquet performance was driven by increased corporate catering demand at 11 of the 18 hotels.","In addition, the Sheraton Stockholm, which is not in the comparable results, performed extremely well with double-digit growth in RevPAR and food and beverage revenues.","Despite the higher-than-expected utility cost associated with the harsh winter, our first quarter comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increased 120 basis points due to a rate-driven increase in RevPAR and excellent food and beverage sales and flow-through. Our first quarter food and beverage flow-through was an impressive 58.5%.","Looking to the rest of 2014. While we believe there is still room for occupancy growth, especially in our group business, we expect that RevPAR will continue to be driven primarily by rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through. We also expect food and beverage revenue to improve a full point above our previous guidance, primarily in banquet and catering due to improving group demand.","Based on the strong results for the first quarter and our improved outlook for food and beverage revenues and profit, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 70 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and 120 basis points at the high end of the range for 2014, resulting in a 10-basis-point increase in our margin guidance.","At this point, we are forecasting that approximately 28% of our full year EBITDA will be earned in the second quarter. This suggests the resulting EBITDA for the second quarter will be lower than the last year due primarily to the following 3 reasons: First, as you will recall, in the second quarter of last year, we sold land adjacent to the Newport Beach Marriott Resort and Spa and recorded a $21 million gain. Second, we lost EBITDA due to the timing of numerous asset sales completed after the second quarter of last year. And third, the $5 million per quarter negative impact from the Hyatt Maui timeshare sales that we brought to your attention on the last call, where we reduced our second and third quarter EBITDA. But for the full year, we estimate that the timeshare project will increase EBITDA by approximately $12 million.","During the first quarter, we redeemed or repaid $675 million of debt with available cash. We ended the quarter with approximately $392 million of cash and $782 million of available capacity under the credit facility and a debt balance of $4.1 billion.","In summary, we are excited with our first quarter results as this is a great way to start the year. As you know, we have the best balance sheet in the history of the company with the lowest leverage, the highest fixed charge coverage ratio and the lowest annual cash interest expense in our history, resulting in meaningful free cash flows.","As I stated at our Investor Day last month, we are in an incredible position with a powerful and flexible balance sheet with all options open to us as we progress through the cycle. We will continue to focus on creating value for our shareholders.","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Andrew Didora.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ed, I guess, the recovery of group has obviously been a common theme out there over the past few months. I'm just wanting to get your thoughts on some of the deeper trends here. I guess, when you look at your future bookings, are you seeing group strength spread outside of the top gateway markets into more resort locations or areas, like Arizona and Hawaii? And if so, do you see any difference outside the room spend between these locations and the -- maybe some of the top gateway markets?","W. Edward Walter","I could tell you that we, certainly, are seeing growth across all of our markets. This particular quarter, it was centered more in New York and the West Coast, but we also saw some pretty solid group growth down in Florida, in both Orlando and in Naples. That's a big part of what drove the activity at those hotels that I commented on. And so I feel comfortable that we're seeing it across different price points. As it relates to the spend, we've been encouraged that -- for the catering contribution. So that's the amount of F&B per group room. It has been up for the last 2 quarters. I think that still is something that tends to jump around a little bit, but I've been encouraged by the fact that, that grew as aggressively as it did in the last quarter. And then maybe, at least an early signal that companies -- I think the bigger swing here is in the corporate group activity. The companies are getting a bit more comfortable in spending more associated with their group event.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then my second question. We'd certainly like to get your thoughts here on New York. I know Greg gave some of the statistics in his prepared remarks. You guys obviously helped perform the market nicely in 1Q. What are you seeing in terms of both the high growth this year in the market? And how are your group and transient bookings looking for the rest of the year in New York?","W. Edward Walter","I mean, I feel -- certainly, there is no secret that supply in New York is pretty heavy this year. I think the numbers that we're looking at across all segments are in the mid-7% range. And unfortunately, it looks like 2015 is also going to be fairly strong on the group side. I think our current estimate now is somewhere north of 5%. I would say that group activity in New York continues to be solid. I wouldn't say it stands out one way or the other compared to the other markets that we're involved with. It's obviously in the first quarter because the Super Bowl did quite well. But I think looking longer-term, I think in our portfolio, it seems to be consistent with the rest of the portfolio. As I -- it was going to be -- the problem with that much supply is that despite the fact that New York is one of the most exciting, strong demand-generating markets in the country, probably in the world, that's a lot of supply to overcome. And I think we're all going to be struggling a little bit to generate rate growth in that environment.","Operator","And our next question comes from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Ed, you've mentioned earlier that there really is not much to report from a transaction side of things. Maybe you can just talk about why do you think the transaction market has been relatively quite ablated by the seller or buyer issue, waiting on playing the cycle a little bit longer before putting more stuff out for sale? And then I have a follow-up.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. It's -- that's a very good question. I think pricing is slowly but surely working its way back up, not quite to the levels that we saw during the last cycles but, certainly, has been improving. So you would think that, that would start to draw more sellers out. I think the fundamental problem, perhaps, is the fact that there is a universal perception that this cycle has a fair amount of time left to run. You've got low supply for the next week, the next 2 years, and I would still be guessing that 2016 supply will be below demand. So as -- and again, I think that's fairly well-known. So there -- I think the desire on the part of people to sell is probably driven more by strategic reasons than a sense that they -- the time is to -- now is the time to act in order to get out before the cycle starts to go the other direction. So you haven't seen -- just not seeing that impetus behind that higher activity. Overall, though, I think we've been seeing each year. We've been seeing the amount of transaction activity slowly creep up. My general sense from conversations with the brokerage community in the beginning of the year is that they expect activity in 2014 to exceed the activity that we saw in 2013. And so I think we'll probably have a little bit better clue on that as we work our way through the summer because there seems to be the way the cycles work the last couple of years. That activity begins to heat up as we get into some of that NYU conferences and some of the others that tends to be a focal point for folks to put assets on a market with the desire of closing those transactions before the end of the year.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then, Greg, with respect to your '14 guidance -- and you gave some great commentary on the group trends. With regard to your food and beverage revenue guidance or increase, does that also incorporate an increase in F&B revenues in the 2Q through 4Q? Or are you just kind of adding back in the increase with the better-than-expected results in the 1Q?","Gregory J. Larson","Yes. I think, primarily, it's because of our great results in the first quarter. Right, we obviously incorporated those great results in our full year guidance. And then so I'd say that was the main part of increasing our F&B guidance for the full year. But I think we also feel because of that business success that we had in the first quarter, I think we also feel just a little bit better for the rest of the year as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Company.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just to talk a little bit more about the acquisition environment out there. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of private equity capital being raised. Leverage seems to be plentiful for private equity. So I'm just wondering, as you guys are eyeing acquisitions right now, are you looking at things that maybe there aren't a lot of institutional buyers interested in right now, whether that be one-off select service assets, similar to what you did in Nashville with White Lodging or whether that'd be resorts in the Caribbean that, maybe, don't appeal to as many others? Or more international, et cetera? Just help us understand where you guys are focusing your efforts on the acquisition strategy.","W. Edward Walter","Well, I'd say we are certainly looking internationally, although its competitive in that environment too. I think as we look -- start to think about the United States. We are looking -- we'd love to do some more transactions that might set up similar to the Powell Hotel acquisition in San Francisco. We'd be open to more limited service. I don't know how much more limited service development we would end up doing, but I think in a few select markets, we would be open to that. So one thing I would say is we have no particular plans to be buying in the Caribbean. There may be opportunities there, but our past experience in that market would suggest that, that's a market better avoided.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, with regards to things like the Powell or one-off development opportunities that become available, at what point in the cycle do you decide that those types of investments don't make a lot of sense, just given the remaining duration of the up cycle?","W. Edward Walter","That decision ends up being a market-by-market analysis. I think that, certainly, in the timeframe that we're in today with some of the commentary that I gave and the answer to a prior question, I would certainly feel comfortable about pursuing and repositioning in those markets in the U.S. And there are, I think, markets that show really good demand growth, you could see an opportunity to do new development, although, again, I don't want to suggest at all that, that's the priority for us. So I think for a select service development, there is an opportunity to move forward with something in that area and feel comfortable that you're delivering still at -- in a point in the cycle when it's trending positive.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Michael Bilerman from Citi.","Kevin Varin","This is Kevin Varin with Michael. You mentioned last call that 1Q EBITDA would account for around 21% of full year EBITDA. So just based on that commentary, it would imply you beat internal expectation by roughly $20 million. So just considering that EBITDA guidance was only raised $10 million at the midpoint, is it fair to say that Host is tracking at the high end of the ranges where we stand today or is there something else that we should be looking for with -- in the remainder of the year?","Gregory J. Larson","[Audio Gap] and multiply it by -- I think where the consensus runs for the year, I think, that would suggest that we're really beat by about $17 million to $18 million, so close to your $20 million, but a little bit lower. The other thing that I would add is when you look in the income statement, you'll notice that we had $3 million gain, insurance gain, which we had -- we had forecasted that gain, but not in the first quarter, right? So I -- that sort of takes your $17 million to $18 million down to $14 million or $15 million. And then, as you correctly pointed out, we increased our full year guidance by $10 million. So it's a little bit maybe left on the table. And then, that's one of the reasons why I think when we look at our RevPAR guidance for the year today of 5% to 6%, we do feel a little bit more comfortable at the mid- to high-end of that range than we did a quarter go.","Kevin Varin","Okay. And then just one last question. Can you guys quantify the benefit of the holiday calendar shift in 1Q and maybe how much of an impact it will have on -- as we think about 2Q?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we've really run that specifically on that. I think we've been suggesting that we would expect the second quarter to be weaker than the first quarter primarily because of the holiday shift. I don't know that I have a specific percentage to give you, though, for -- to quantify the impact of it.","Operator","And up next, we'll take Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven E. Kent - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe if you could just talk about the balance of dividend versus opportunity to buy assets. And could we look for -- what would -- what is the gaining issues that keep you from maybe raising that dividend over the next -- for the next 12 to 24 months? And then, separately, you've given some color on RevPAR strength, but maybe talk a little bit about brands and location, more on brands. Are there certain brands where you're seeing greater strength? I know you don't normally talk about that, but maybe give us some sense on that.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. Steve, let me answer these in reverse order. I think we're going to shy away from any specific commentary on brands within our portfolio. Yes, I think that they all report on their own, but I don't -- so you get a good sense as to how they're performing on a relative basis, but I don't -- we've not provided disclosure on that in the past, but I don't think this would be the time to change. On your question on the dividend, I'd say, broadly speaking, we would be expecting, as EBITDA continues to grow, we would be expecting in general for our taxable income to continue to increase. And so that in and of itself should require that our dividend continue to grow. So then the second part of the question becomes what to do with the free cash flow that we're generating, which, as we've talked about in the past, is north of $300 million a year, and how do we think about applying those proceeds going forward. And I think the question is you sort of identify, kind of comes down a bit to what do the acquisition market look like and what are the opportunities and whether it's acquiring properties or whether it's investing in the properties that we already have. That -- I think to the extent that we can find investments of either type that meet our return the parameters, and I'd say that at this stage of the cycle, that would still be our first choice in a lot of ways, but to the extent that we do not identify those opportunities or to the extent that the sales [indiscernible] we generate from asset sales exceed the amount of the investment opportunities, then we're going to look at ways to return that capital to our shareholders. I think certainly one way to do that is an increase in the dividend. And at some point, another alternative would be to repurchase stocks. But I think we're open to looking at each of those as we work our way through the year and into 2015. But I'd still say that given -- we still want to continue to grow through investment if we can, but if not, we'll look to return capital.","Operator","And up next, we have Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just looking at the outperformance in Q1 RevPAR, I'm just curious why full year RevPAR guidance wouldn't move up to -- are there factors that you think won't recur because it sounds like the group trends -- and I know you were cautious about Q2, but just overall for the year, group tends are positive, so I guess why not higher RevPAR growth for the year?","W. Edward Walter","I think, Greg sort of answered that question to some degree. And I think, you're also right that we're -- we'd probably feel more comfortable raising that after we get -- the halfway point in the year. But we certainly, given the strength of our Q1 performance, which was better than what we had anticipated in February, we certainly feel more comfortable in the higher end of the range of RevPAR that we provided. We'll look at that when we get into July for our next call.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, just looking at the outperformance, I had expected that maybe it was other markets that was made up for Washington, D.C., given that the market was weak, but you outperformed the market so much in D.C., and just kind of what was behind that.","W. Edward Walter","I think that what ended up happening in Washington is that there was just better overall transient activity and some group strength, especially in March, that helped Washington do better than we had expected at the beginning of the year. Yes, the other thing too is inauguration, while a bit of a hill to climb, was not as beneficial in '13 as we would have hoped. So it's still a challenge for the market for this year, but perhaps not as big as in the historical context.","Operator","And up next, we have Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you help us think about what your banquet in F&B revenue per room is versus prior peak and just how we should think about the trajectory of the segment growth longer term?","W. Edward Walter","To be honest, I don't have -- some of this is -- our reporting and our statistical analysis has really improved significantly since the prior peak, so I -- that's a good -- that's something we should look into a little bit more directly. I don't really have an answer for you on where our banquet revenue would match compared to the prior peak. On food and beverage overall, we're still -- we finished the year running about 10% behind where we had been at the prior peak. So I would be expecting -- for this particular quarter, I'm sure we were beginning to approach where we had been before for the full year. Given the guidance that we've given, we probably are still -- we are still looking to be 5% to 6% behind our prior peak level food and beverage activity.","Gregory J. Larson","Yes, I think another way to look at food and beverage, especially if you look at it through the end of last year, typically, food and beverage growth is about -- the growth rate is about 50 basis points lower than our RevPAR growth. And what we've seen so far during this recovery is that food and beverage growth, about 150 basis points lower than our RevPAR growth. So obviously, food and beverage really underperformed with groups so far during this recovery, and then, except for, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year when group really performed, because of that our food and beverage growth was quite strong.","Operator","And our next question will come from Anthony Powell from Barclays.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division","The result of Seattle and Denver were very impressive. Can you talk about the availability of assets in those markets? Are hotels for sale there and are there any new development opportunities in those markets for you?","W. Edward Walter","We have looked at a couple of transactions in Seattle. I don't know that we have looked at anything in particular in Denver in the last 12 months. There are a few new developments being contemplated in Seattle, probably, the largest of those is the convention center hotel that a local developer is attempting to finance and get off the ground. So I think -- but overall level of activity in both markets is probably about market average right now. I wouldn't say that there's been a big surge in activity there.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And on Chicago, it's kind of underperformed, I think, the market over -- U.S. overall. What do you think has driven that result and how do you view your booking trends there both this year and next?","Gregory J. Larson","As we mentioned during the quarter, I mean, obviously winters in Chicago are never great, but this year, I think, with the polar vortex and 50 degrees below 0, the weather was quite extreme. And so I think that explains some of the weakness in Chicago for the first quarter. I think we think that, that will -- Chicago will perform better as we move throughout the year.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I think generally though, in Chicago for this year we are -- we're not seeing as -- this is not a strong of a convention year [indiscernible]. This market tends to move a bit in the cycle. This is not one of the [indiscernible] Chicago. And so we probably expect lower levels of performance there for the full year.","Operator","And our next question will come from Chris Woronka.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You guys noted a pretty good benefit from renovations completed, I guess, last year at several of your larger West Coast hotels. If we look out a bit, I mean, how does your renovation pipeline look, if you will? Is there a drop-off in that benefit at some point or does it remain pretty constant?","W. Edward Walter","My guess is that, well, certainly, we'd get a benefit as we enhance the hotel in terms of both one part as you get a little bit of a year-over-year benefit from not having a disruption, but more importantly, you get a benefit from having enhanced the asset. I think we're looking at relatively consistent levels of maintenance level spending over the next couple of years. It should -- we should see a surge in disruption other than at particular hotels. And we hope we continue to spend intelligently on those hotels, we should continue to see lift. But I don't know that I would expect anything remarkable one way or the other for the next couple of years.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then, maybe you could contrast a little bit for us the international and domestic markets in terms of the transaction market and how the buyers and sellers differ and what they're looking for and also maybe how much time you guys spend internally looking at international versus domestic deals.","W. Edward Walter","The latter really tend -- we have distinct team so we have a European team that's focused on Europe. We have a Latin America team that's focused on Latin America. And then, of course, we have our office in Singapore that focuses on Asia investments. And then, in the States, everything right now has been out of assessment. So I'd say from a standpoint of time, each of the offices is pretty -- is 100% focused on activity within their region. And then, as that bubbles up, Greg and I and Struan and the other folks that are on our investment committee, that tends to vary based on the month depending upon what's hot in a particular jurisdiction. Overall, I would say, we'd still find that we've spent the majority of our time talking about investments in the U.S., but the international piece of it is a meaningful component of what we're looking at. In terms of the buyers internationally, yes, I'd say that our world is becoming more and more of a global marketplace from investments. And so capital from Asia is interested in the U.S. Capital from the Middle East is interested in the U.S. and Europe. Certainly, the Asian markets are very active with Asian capital directly. So we run into different types of investors in different markets, but certainly, some of the larger players, especially some of the sovereign wealth funds, are active across really in every jurisdictions and we will -- we run up against them on transactions on a consistent basis.","Operator","And our next question will come from David Loeb with Baird Investment Banking.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is really for Greg. On the gain on sale, which must be Philadelphia, can you talk about why there was such a large gain, why the tax effect on that was relatively small? Do you have some plans related to that 10\/31, whatever, or will you need to have some dividend related to that?","Gregory J. Larson","Yes, David, you're right on Philadelphia. But when we think about our dividend for this year, the gain associated with that asset is sort of already baked in to our philosophies for the dividend this year. So when we talk about increasing dividends, and Ed talked about it earlier, it's really going to come from 3 things. Obviously, as our EBITDA increases and taxable income increases, our dividends certainly will increase. I also think that with subsequent asset sales we will expect to have gains, and those gains will, we don't like kind of exchange, will obviously be added to our dividend and could increase the growth of our dividend. And then, as Ed also mentioned, if we're not -- we can't find acquisitions, then our free cash flow -- if you look at our free cash flow today before we make a dividend payment or before we make investments, that's actually over $750 million. So again, if we can't find investments, that will go towards an increased dividend as well. So all those things matter, but Philly, there's really not much to talk about from the gain on Philly.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So no plans to defer that one, no temporary arrangements?","Gregory J. Larson","Correct, correct.","Operator","And our next question will come from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question on your group pace for the rest of the year. Did I catch that right that your pace at around 5.5% is somewhat consistent from what it was about 2 months ago?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, yes. I would say that we're generally consistent with where we've been. But I think we were pretty encouraged by the -- by what we saw on the group side kind of both activity in the quarter, for the quarter and looking forward. Our in-the-quarter, for-the-quarter activity was up about 19% compared to what we had experienced in 2013, so that was a good jump. As we look at the -- as I commented, as we look at the rest of the year, we saw an increase in activity of -- north of 4% in terms of room nights for the remainder of the year, but if you leave out April, where the -- where activity was down because of the Easter holiday, the activity after April was up nearly 10%. So I think, when we kind of watched what was happening in-the-year, for-the-year-type activity, we felt pretty good about that and that made us increasingly comfortable with how group will play out for the full year.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Got it. So it's fair to characterize, I guess, that just given that second quarter is so much bigger, the impact of Easter seems to have a little more disproportionate -- disproportionately larger impact other than have-it-fallen kind of the opposite reign in the first quarter.","W. Edward Walter","Perhaps. I mean, there's sort of pluses and minuses of the holiday being in April. I mean, Mike, I'm not certain I would completely agree that the impact is disproportionate in the second quarter, because I think that the second quarter overall is a bigger quarter for us, and so the losing of the 2 weeks, and losing some group activity there is probably in some ways potentially less impactful in Q2 than it would be in Q1, which tends to run at a lower overall level of volume. The benefit of it being extended in a full year context is that it does tend to -- later Easter tends to extend the spring break season. And so again, it wont show up in a year-over-year number for the -- for April or for Q2, but in the long run, it stretches out the Easter -- or the spring break season, which tends to be a positive in Florida. So I think all in all, we'd rather see Easter occur in April if we had a chance to control the calendar.","Operator","And our next question will come from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. What percentage of your portfolio do you think needs more CapEx or return on investment CapEx spend? When -- sort of what inning are you in do you think?","W. Edward Walter","Harry, I don't know that we -- I mean, if you -- when I think of that question, I think of that in the context of assets that might have some deferred CapEx, because of course, we're always in a situation where we are reinvesting in our hotels. I don't know that I have a real accurate specific number to give you, but I would say that I would view it, from a deferred CapEx perspective, as very small. And the bottom line is we've been consistently investing in our portfolio. As we've talked about in the past, we took advantage of low pricing back in 2010 and 2011 to accelerate our capital program in an effort to try to both improve the quality of our hotels, but more importantly, do it for less money. And I think we're still seeing the benefits of that in terms of our performance. So I'm sure if I sat down and looked at the list of our hotels that -- there's a half a dozen where you could say we've under invested. Some of that -- in general, if that situation exists today, it's because we didn't see an economic benefit from making the investment. And so typically, those are assets that we might be contemplating on selling while we don't think it's -- where we think the buyer would probably prefer to control that CapEx decision. On the ROI front. Those are the things that we are constantly looking at. Of course, we've spent some time at our Investor Day trying to highlight the fact that we felt that there are a lot of opportunities within the portfolio. So as you look at what we're -- this year, we've talked in terms of $70 million to $80 million. I would view that as a target in my own mind about what we should be trying to do on a consistent basis going forward.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then the second piece is, with that in mind over the last 12 months, the lodging sector -- or in the lodging, the 2 stocks that have returned the most capital to shareholders have been Hyatt and Marriott, and those are the 2 that have outperformed, while the 2 that have been more reluctant to increase shareholder returns, Starwood and Host, are up about half as much. And so Mike, what I'm wondering is, do you recognize that more capital return would lead to higher investor interest? And given that you have meaningful free cash flow, what gets you to move on this?","Gregory J. Larson","Ed, before you answer, I just want to correct one thing. From our last quarter call through today, Host has been the best performing lodging stock by far. Go ahead, Ed.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I was looking at that over the last 12 months.","W. Edward Walter","I mean, I don't know that I have a lot to add these on what I said in -- I think I was responding to Steve's question before. I don't know that it's so much of a performance question that would drive us to do with. I mean, I think we've been pretty clear that we thought it was important to achieve certain balance sheet objectives before we start to contemplate any -- paying a dividend that would be larger than taxable income. As we've been indicating over the course of the different -- whether it's calls or investor presentations, during the first 4 months of this year, we have made great progress in strengthening our balance sheet and are feeling that we're going to be accomplishing our objectives in 2014 on that front, so that does provide us with the opportunity to think about deploying the free cash flow that we generate in different ways. As I said before, I still hope, because I think the cycle has got room to run, that we can find ways to invest that profitably in assets that will grow, that will generate a return in excess of our cost of capital and that will drive improve shareholder return. The extent that those opportunities don't present themselves, then we'll look at the alternatives.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Basically, from the -- reading between the lines, just given that you want to find assets to invest in, we really shouldn't be expecting any meaningful lift in the dividend. Is that fair?","W. Edward Walter","I think the answer is -- unfortunately, it depends. I mean, we have -- I think one of the things that sets us apart in our industry has been our discipline in investing capital. And we try to highlight that at our Investor Day in terms of discussing our performance compared to our competitors. So it will come down to that decision, that opportunity. And I wouldn't -- it's just -- I think it's early in the year to try to reach a conclusion on that one way or the other.","Gregory J. Larson","Yes, I'd also add that right even -- if you look at it over the last couple years, right, just -- it depends on, I guess, your definition of significant dividend increase. But even just -- certainly, our dividend have increased with taxable income, which has been about $0.16 increase each year. And then, in addition, I would say, as we fill assets, we'll have further gains and that -- it certainly increase our dividend as well. So -- I think some of it depends on how much we invest in assets, but I think even if we find out what to invest in, certainly, our dividend is going higher.","Operator","And our next question will come from Patrick Scholes from SunTrust.","Charles Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you can break down by month how your group business faired as far as RevPAR for the first quarter. And then, how did April end up for you?","W. Edward Walter","We don't know April yet. I mean, that's a month that have just ended yesterday, but we don't have the reporting for the first few days -- the last few days of the month nor do we have segmentation, but I'm sure it will be weaker than last year just because of the calendar shift. In general, if you look at the overall level of group -- increase in group activity that we had, which was really north of 6% group increase and group room nights, I would roughly say that January would probably been -- kind of was the weakest of that time period and really just reflected a small increase. February was slightly above 6%, and then, as you get to March, we were -- I think we were north -- we had double-digit group room night growth in March.","Operator","And our next question will come from Wes Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Looking at the transient rate growth in the quarter, just over 3%, and with group being so strong, did you leave money on the table there? Or is there weather-related low-rated business you were taking?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I think that's a great question. We spent some time trying to study that. I think you're right at one level, is that we did have some weather disruption and we had the weather disruption in some of our higher-priced markets, so that affected the statistics of it. I think the other factors that affected transient rate growth is if we actually look at the transient rate growth that we were seeing at individual hotels, it was stronger than the 3.5% that we've just discussed in our comments here, but part of what we saw happened in the quarter is that we had stronger group business in some of our higher-priced markets and we had -- we certified an increase in our transient level business in some of our lower priced markets. And so when you actually work your way through the math, it has the effect of understating our transient rate growth for the overall portfolio. But as I talked with our revenue management team about what was actually happening in market, they were seeing higher levels of growth than what we actually disclosed here.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And now turning to the balance sheet, you have a few 6% notes via the Vs and the Zs about $800 million, any of that prepayable?","Gregory J. Larson","Yes. We can call both of those notes in 2015. So that certainly -- if interest rates remain low, that's certainly something we will look at.","Operator","At this time, Mr. Ed Walter, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","W.

Larry Harvey will then provide greater detail on our second quarter results, including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here is Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Well, we are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, which were driven by substantial improvements in group demand and average rate growth. Strong F&B and other revenue growth, combined with improved flow-through, led to earnings results that exceeded consensus estimates. In addition, we just completed the acquisition of a great hotel and have taken advantage of our largely unsecured asset base to arrange a very attractively priced term loan, which Larry will talk about during his commentary.","First, let's review our results for the quarter. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.1%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 3.7%, combined with an occupancy increase of 1.7 percentage points. Our comparable average rate was $195 and our average occupancy was 77.6%, which exceeded our portfolio's prior peak occupancy in the second quarter of 2007, the first time we have seen this happen since the start of the 2008 downturn. For the calendar quarter, our RevPAR growth was 6.8%. Comparable hotel food and beverage revenue growth of 5.7% was driven by a strong banquet and AV revenue and contributed to overall comparable revenue growth of 5.8% for the quarter. The increase in profitable banquet activity contributed to 120 basis-point improvement in our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $348 million, an 11% increase over prior year.","Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.34 in the second quarter, an increase of nearly 10%. On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.1%, driven by a 3.3% increase in average rate and a 1.9 percentage-point improvement in occupancy. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 6%, combined with an adjusted operating profit margin setting increased 110 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $523 million. This represented an increase of more than 14% over the prior year and generated adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.49.","Overall, we are extremely pleased with our operating results and the progress we are seeing in lodging fundamentals. The key driver of our second quarter results was the strong increase in demand in our group business, especially in the higher-priced segments. The favorable trends that we noted in group demand since Q4 of 2011 continued to accelerate in the second quarter as our overall group occupancy increased more than 5%. The demand improvement was evident in all of our group segments led by a more than 9% increase in our higher-rated association business and a 5.5% increase in our Corporate business.","Overall, combining the demand improvement with the rate increase that exceeded 1.5%, resulted in improved group revenue of nearly 7%, which exceeded our transient revenue growth for the first time in over a year. As we had anticipated, one major benefit of the significant increase in group demand was our managers were able to focus on driving rate in our transient segments, which became the primary factor behind our transient revenue growth in this quarter. Rate growth in each of our major segments exceeded 5%, led by a 6% increase in our Special Corporate rate. On the demand side, as might be expected, our government transient business, which represents about 3% of overall demand, declined by less than 3%. The strong increase in group business we experienced did result in a slight decline in transient room volume as midweek availability was constrained. As a result, overall transient revenue increased slightly less than 5%.","Looking at the rest of the year, we continue to be encouraged by the positive trends in group business. Group bookings in the quarter for the remainder of the year increased 9% compared to the prior year and the average rate on those bookings rose by more than 6%. Total bookings for the remainder of the year are now more than 7.5% ahead of last year's pace, and the overall rate for the third and fourth quarters has increased well over 2%, indicating revenue improvement of 10%. We're also seeing the positive booking activity extend into 2013 in both demand and rate, indicating that our group hotels are benefiting from increased business spending and should continue to perform well for the remainder of this year and next.","On the investment front, as we reported this morning, we acquired the 888-room Grand Hyatt Washington, D.C. for $400 million. As you may recall, we signed an agreement last year to acquire this hotel at a higher price, however, volatility in global equity markets and economic uncertainty last fall prompted us to reevaluate our pricing. We have always believed that this hotel is a great asset with a superb location in a strong market with good long-term growth potential. While recent expressions of concerns about the D.C. market, combined with some near-term operating weakness did permit us to negotiate a price reduction, we are confident that this asset remains a very attractive investment.","In the longer term, we expect the hotel will benefit greatly from the redevelopment of the old Convention Center site in downtown D.C., as well as from some synergies associated with our ownership of the Capitol Hill Hyatt Regency. On the disposition front, we have one smaller asset under contract, which is expected to close in late summer, and we are also actively marketing several additional properties which we expect to close during the fourth quarter. While the sale market is difficult to predict, the guidance I will discuss in a few minutes assumes that we complete incremental sales in the $300 million to $400 million range by year end.","Turning to capital investments, we invested $50 million in redevelopment and return-on-investment capital projects in the second quarter, as we've substantially completed the rooms renovation phase of the redevelopment of the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers. We also completed the conversion of one tower to Sheraton -- in Sheraton Indianapolis into 129 apartments and have already begun leasing.","It is worth noting that we are seeing great results in our 3 recently redeveloped hotels: The Chicago O'Hare Marriott, the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott and the Sheraton Indianapolis, where RevPAR is running better than 35% ahead of the pre-renovation levels. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $165 million to $175 million on redevelopment and ROI projects.","During the quarter, we completed the renovation of the rooms of the New York Helmsley Hotel as part of the conversion process of this hotel to the Westin Grand Central, and have also decided to renovate the lobby and create a new restaurant bar outlet in the front of the hotel which should be complete by early fall. We spent approximately $50 million on this and several other acquisition-related projects this quarter and now expect to spend $115 million to $125 million in total on these projects through the full year.","In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $79 million in the second quarter and expect to spend $310 million to $330 million for the full year. Projects during the quarter include room renovations at the Boston Copley Place and the Westin Seattle, as well as meeting and public space renovations at the Swiss\u00f4tel Chicago.","Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we have outlined today, we are seeing very strong demand trends especially in our group business and with low supply in our markets, industry fundamentals are expected to remain solid for the balance of the year. With that in mind, we now expect the comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase between 5.5% and 7%, which reflects an increase on the low end of the range. Our year-to-date margin performance, combined with an expectation that we can continue to drive strong flow-through for the remainder of the year, gives us confidence to raise our margin guidance to an increase of 90 to 130 basis points for the full year. The combination of the margin increase and acquisition of the Grand Hyatt Washington, offset by EBITDA reductions associated with our planned asset sales, as the scope expansion of some capital projects at the Helmsley and Orlando World Center hotels, results in an increase in our adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1,135,000,000 to $1,170,000,000. This operating forecast will result in adjusted FFO per share of $1.04 to $1.09.","Looking at our dividend, we increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.07 per share. Dividends for the remainder of the year will depend on operating results and gains on asset sales. In summary, we are pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about the outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2013. Based on our booking pace and expectations for fundamentals in the business, including continued low supply growth, we believe that the growth cycle on lodging will be sustained. Thank you, and now, let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Larry K. Harvey","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 23.7%. Occupancy improved over 13 percentage points, driven by strong group and transient demand, while rate increased more than 4%. Results for the quarter benefited from the 2011 rooms and meeting space renovations at the Downtown Marriott. Both the Marriott and the Four Seasons Philadelphia had an exceptional quarter with excellent growth in rooms and food and beverage revenues. We expect Philadelphia to be a top-performing market in the third quarter due to strong group and transient demand, which should allow us to drive pricing.","RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 11.1%, driven by an increase in rate of more than 7% and an improvement in occupancy of nearly 3 percentage points as both city-wide and overall group demand were excellent. The increase in group business helped drive a nearly 15% increase in food and beverage revenues. We expect our Chicago hotels to underperform our portfolio in the third quarter due to lower levels of city-wide and group demand, when compared to the third quarter of 2011. Even with the Boston Copley Marriott under renovation, our Boston hotels had a great quarter with RevPAR growth of 10% as ADR increased nearly 8% and occupancy increased 1.5 percentage points. The outperformance was driven by strong corporate group and transient business, which allowed us to shift the mix of business and benefit from rate compression. We expect our Boston hotels to have a strong third quarter.","Our Atlanta hotels had a very good quarter with RevPAR up 8.3%. Occupancy improved more than 4 percentage points due to strength in city-wide association and transient demand, while ADR increased over 1%. We expect our Atlanta hotels to underperform our portfolio in the third quarter due to renovations at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead and the Four Seasons.","Our San Francisco hotels had another strong quarter as RevPAR increased 8.2% due to an ADR improvement of over 7%. The improvement in ADR was driven by rate increases for both group and transient business. With the strong group business, F&B revenues increased over 11%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to continue to perform very well in the third quarter, as strong demand will allow us to continue to drive rate.","RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 4.8% due to growth in ADR. Results were negatively impacted by the second and final stage of the rooms renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York, and a room's renovation at the W Union Square. The renovations at the Marquis included the addition of 8 new rooms at a cost of under $300,000 per key. Unfortunately, we had to shut down the whole floor in order to finish the construction, which affected occupancy at the hotel. We expect our New York hotels to perform better in the third quarter.","Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels struggled in the quarter as RevPAR declined 20 basis points. Average rate increased over 3%, while occupancy declined nearly 3 percentage points. The weakness was due to less transient and group demand. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to perform better in the third quarter due to better group bookings.","Year-to-date, Philadelphia has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 26.5%, followed by Chicago with a RevPAR increase of 13.5%, and Los Angeles with a 10.6% increase. Our worst-performing market has been San Antonio, with a RevPAR decrease of 4.6%.","Our European joint venture operating results continued to exceed our expectations. Excluding the Sheraton Roma, which is under a major renovation, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 2.8% for the quarter. EBITDA margins improved 110 basis points, and EBITDA was up 6%. The JV has high quality assets, and average rate for the portfolio was EUR 194 in the quarter. As we previously discussed, inbound travel to the eurozone from the U.S., U.K., Asia and the Middle East continues to be strong, and is a major source of euro-lodging demand. The Hotel Arts Barcelona, the Sheraton Warsaw and the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, all had strong RevPAR increases for the quarter, while our Brussels and Madrid hotels struggled. Year-to-date, excluding the Sheraton Roma, pro forma RevPAR in constant euros is up 3.3% and EBITDA margins increased 160 basis points, while EBITDA was up 10.4%.","For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 120 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis were up only 1.1%. Food and beverage revenues were up 5.7% and F&B profits were up over 9%, leading to an F&B flow-through of more than 47%. We continue to see improvements in catering, meeting room rental and audio-visual revenues, as well as reductions in food and beverage cost as a percentage of revenue. General and administrative, sales and marketing, and repairs and maintenance increased 3.5%, primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues, including credit card commissions, guest reward programs, and cluster and shared service allocations.","Utility costs were down 3.5%, and property taxes increased 6.6% while property insurance increased roughly 14%. Looking through the rest of 2012, we expect that comparable hotel RevPAR will be driven more by both occupancy and rate growth, but rate growth should be increasingly more important throughout the year. The additional rate growth should lead the solid rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost. We expect the positive trends in group demand to continue, which should help drive growth in banquet and audio-visual revenues and good F&B flow-through. We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. We also expect utilities to decline slightly for the full year.","We have some good news on both property insurance and property taxes. Substantially, all of our property insurance renewed on June 1. We were expecting an increase in excess of 15% for our insurance, particularly given our wind and earthquake exposure and the rate increases we were seeing earlier this year in the market. We took advantage of some new capacity added to the market and were able to achieve an increase of approximately 7%.","We expected a property tax increase of roughly 8% to 9% this year. At this point, we expect an increase in the 6% area as we have been successful in reducing some of the assessments. The majority of these items -- benefit from these items will be realized in the second half of the year and has been reflected in our margin guidance. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 90 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range, and increase 130 basis points at the high end of the range.","During the quarter, we utilized proceeds from our debt offerings with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%, to repay $1 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 6.8%. In the third quarter, we received commitments from a number of banks and expect to raise $400 million through a credit facility term loan. Based on our current leverage level, the term loan will bear interest at LIBOR plus 180 basis points for an approximate 2.1% all-in interest rate today. We are evaluating whether to enter into a swap that will fix LIBOR for the 5-year term of the loan. We expect the term loan to close by the end of July, and we will use the proceeds to repay debt.","Taking into consideration the acquisition of the Hyatt D.C. and the expected term loan, and the related use of proceeds from the term loan to repay approximately $400 million of debt, our outstanding debt will increase approximately $100 million to roughly $5.3 billion. We will have approximately $760 million of capacity on our credit facility and approximately $150 million of cash and cash equivalents. During the second quarter, we issued approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.75 per share for net proceeds of approximately $48 million through our ATM Program. Consistent with our philosophy, our willingness to issue equity depends on our stock price and the visibility around acquisition opportunities. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first today to Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. First, can you just talk about to what extent rate growth or RevPAR growth was held back by lower-priced groups and pre-negotiated Corporates that had last room availability? I don't know if there's a way to quantify this, but any color there and maybe what you're doing with your managers to help maybe expedite the process of getting rid of some of those groups, where maybe you could get a higher price on a rack rate? And then second, just on the guidance, can you just help us with the gives and takes, how much is coming in, and maybe some of the cap rate or multiple paid on the D.C. asset, then how much EBITDA is -- do you expect to go out the door due to the sold assets that you've talked about?","W. Edward Walter","Okay. Let's -- so let's start with the issue about the lower-priced group, and the Special Corporate. It is, as you guessed, it is fairly difficult to get a precise handle on either of those, but especially the impact of the Special Corporate pricing. But here's what I would probably say. If we look at our group business in '12, I think we've previously estimated that maybe a quarter or so of that was booked during a period of time when pricing was weaker and when the business was softer. So as we keep working our way through '12 and into '13, we'll continue to find, because of the nature of how we book group in our hotels and because the number of them are larger hotels that book business significantly in advance, we'll continue to find that we have booked business during slightly slower times simply because we're now in the third year of a recovery. But I would imagine that as we work our way through this year and into next, there will be very little of the business that we've booked, to say back in the '09 time period, that's left on our books. And I don\u2019t -- it is to some degree, inhibiting rate growth, but I guess I'll probably slip it around and go back to some comments that I made in my prepared remarks, which were that, while overall growth in the group area, was I think roughly around 1.5% to 2%, the reality is, is that the bookings that we're getting -- that we got in the last quarter for the third and fourth quarter this year were closer to up 7%, which I think sends a good signal for where group bookings are going on a going-forward basis. Now on the Special Corporate side, what I think you're referring to is the fact that a number of the -- on the transient side, a number of our Special Corporate accounts have what's called last room availability, which means that if there is a room available in a hotel of the type that they're entitled to, that even though we may be able to sell that to another customer at a higher price, they are entitled to get that room for the contract that they've agreed to -- that we've agreed with them on, if the room is available. And since Special Corporate pricing tends to be somewhat below our rack rate pricing, the reality is that did -- I think our sense is in the second quarter because of the high occupancy we ran at so many hotels, especially during the midweek, that did hold pricing back a little bit. At the end of the day, we were very pleased to see the growth in occupancy. That ultimately does allow us to push rate and we were doing that. You could see that at the overall rate growth that we saw on the transient side. There's not a lot that we can do in the near term, relative to the contracts that we've negotiated for 2012, but on the other hand, I think as you look to what that means for 2013, I suspect that our strategy, certainly at those hotels running high occupancies, will begin to change. We will certainly be pushing for higher pricing next year to reflect the more competitive market conditions. I also think that it's reasonable to assume that if trends hold the way they are now, we would probably do a little bit less in Special Corporate than we -- or have fewer Special Corporate accounts next year, or at least fewer Special Corporate accounts with last room availability, because we will be recognizing the fact that number one, we've got more group business on the books. We have a higher occupancy, and we really ultimately would like to be able to push even more of our business into those more highly rated Corporate and Premium categories. With respect to the guidance, I don't think that I really want to break it down into the different segments. I guess I would just say is at the end of the day, we made the decision to move forward with a comprehensive pool renovation including adding a small water park as part of our Orlando Hotel, and that combined with some other activity regarding fa\u00e7ade improvements and other things, I mean, once we decide to step into the pool renovation area, we've decided to accelerate a lot of other activity at the hotel including the renovation of 2 of our food and beverage outlets. And the net effect of that, plus the decision to add what I think is going to turn into a great bar restaurant at the Helmsley, which was not part of our original game plan but represents an opportunity to not only add a very profitable outlet, but also gives us the ability to take the existing restaurant and turn that into meeting space, those changes I think, are going to be really positive for both of those hotels, but they did result in some reduction in EBITDA in the current year. We obviously hope that it results in much stronger EBITDA going forward.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then -- just on the cap rate for the Hyatt, I think you said probably less than 14x when you were going to buy it late last year. I don't know if there's an updated number.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I would say that based on the last 12 months, EBITDA, we're right in the mid-13 range on our acquisition price.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Ed, I think you touched about it -- touched on it in your answer to the last question, but can you just talk about how tight were the terms of these new group contracts relative to a few years ago with respect to either cancellation provisions or attrition or commitments? And then I have a follow-up.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, Joe, I think from a trend perspective, what I would tell you is where as a couple of years ago, we were finding it almost impossible to get really good attrition clauses. What I'm hearing in general is that while the course varies by hotel, we are starting to see an ability to negotiate better cancellation penalties, better attrition clauses and overall, better contracts. But as you can guess, it depends a lot on the hotels. So markets where occupancies have fully recovered, and it's becoming really the, I'd say, the balance of power shifted a bit back towards the hotel. You see better contracts and in other markets, they might still be struggling to recover a little bit or have in these periods, you don't see quite as much. But I think what we're seeing this year is ultimately a slight increase in attrition and cancellation fees on the year-to-date basis, compared to what we had last year, and I think that's a sign of the fact that we've been able to negotiate slightly better clauses in recently, compared to where we were a year or 2 ago. I also think here part of that too, is the fact that the business that was being booked in the end of '10 and in the beginning of '11, which tended to be very, very short term in nature, although I would still -- meaning that people have been booked, unless they're absolutely certain they were going to have the event. Now I think what you're seeing is while they're certainly is business being booked on a short-term basis, my sense is that just looking at how the bookings are playing out, we are seeing more people, more companies booking a little bit further in advance, and that's one of the reasons why you're seeing our booking pace show sort of the positive year-over-year comparisons that we've been describing.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So much of your anticipated full year 2012 group is on the books right now?","W. Edward Walter","I think if you -- my guess is it's slightly north of 90%. Not -- maybe 90%, 91%, something like that. And that obviously depends a little bit on what happens in the fourth quarter bookings. But I think one thing that people should expect, is that given the strength that we have at this point for the rest of the year, we would expect to see incremental business booked. That's obvious, or implicit in my comments that 90% of it is on the books. But I suspect that on a relative year-over-year basis, we may not book quite as many rooms as we did last year only because we're so far ahead of where we were last year. Just to be clear, I mean, just to be clear, there -- sometimes these areas get confusing. We certainly expect that by the end of the year, our group business will be up significantly compared to last year.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Got it, and then would you expect the RevPAR growth rate in the fourth quarter to exceed the year-over-year growth rate in RevPAR in the third quarter? I know you don't provide quarterly guidance, but just directionally?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we necessarily see a big difference in trends between the quarters right now.","Operator","We'll go next to David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A little bit of refraining on the guidance. I hear you add about the trade-offs in the guidance, particularly from the renovation projects in New York and Orlando, but is there -- absent that, is there any change in the guidance for the same-store portfolio? Or is the rest of the change in the guidance related to acquisitions and dispositions?","W. Edward Walter","Now I'd say that I think it really is all caught up in the notion that there was -- well, there is a benefit in the same-store portfolio from the standpoint that the margin improvement is higher than what we've previously talked about. So we are definitely anticipating a pickup there. It's just that when you look at what I guess I might describe as the non-comp assets, there are some reduction in there because of some of the capital projects we spoke about, and then we also have some changes happening because of the EBITDA associated with assets that we expect to sell. Now that obviously could play out a little bit differently than what we've anticipated in the numbers that we have. You never know exactly how quickly an asset is going to sell. And once we put it on the market, we would obviously like to see that happen sooner than later, but there is some variability in the way those would play out. But I don't think at the end of the day, that either -- that has a material effect on the answer here.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, and related to that, I wanted to ask about dispositions and acquisition outlook. In dispositions, you've put a very specific number, including one hotel, but are there other specific ones, including perhaps some of the ones that you have listed that you expect will close by the end of the year?","W. Edward Walter","We certainly do expect that some of the -- a number of the hotels that we are marketing today will close at the end of the year -- by the end of the year. Only one of the hotels that we have been marketing in 2012 met the standard to be excluded from our comp set and be treated as a held-for-sale asset. So that was -- none of the others are anywhere near as far along as that. A lot of our marketing of hotels that we're counting on in selling in the fourth quarter began in the beginning of the second quarter. So we're well into the sale process, and I think have some reasonable level of confidence that we will transact, but we're certainly not in a position to make any announcements relative to which of those hotels will sell. I'd say we've tried to -- in the estimates that we've provided about incremental sales, we haven't assumed that everything that we have on the market will sell certainly. We've tried to make a guess that some reasonable number of the ones that are marketing, that those would close by year end.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And how about on the acquisition side, are you seeing more deal flow these days, and how interesting is the stuff you're seeing?","W. Edward Walter","I would say that is the number of folks we've talked about over maybe the last 60 days. Earlier in the year, there was an anticipation that the second half of 2012 would be somewhat like the first half of 2011, meaning a very high level of activity. I'd say expectations have moderated a bit. But clearly, we're seeing more activity, more opportunity right now than we did in the beginning of the year, and I think that doesn't surprise me in some ways that would happen. I think conditions are better. So we didn't try to predict the number of acquisitions that we would get done, but we certainly still are looking to be active. And I would still say that at the end of the day, for the full year, it is our intent to be a net acquirer as opposed to a net seller in 2012. Now obviously, with the deal we just completed and announced this morning, we've got a good head start on that. So I'm not saying we're necessarily going to buy as much as we're going to sell in the rest of the year, but we do for the full year, intend to be a net acquirer if at all possible.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Meliker with MLV and Company.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question on margins and expectations for margins. You guys obviously have exceeded your initial expectation of the year. I think you initially guided us, 25 to 75 bps margin of comp property margin expansion back in February, and you're up at a -- approximately 110 bps year-to-date. You've now raised guidance up, where the low end is now above what was the high end just 4 months ago, or 5 months ago. I'm wondering if you can give us some color on what's leading that margin expansion ahead of your expectations, and if we can continue to see more of that? Or if you think your current guidance is where things will likely end up?","W. Edward Walter","Well, we wouldn't modify our guidance. That's we already have up. It's what we gave you, so it's included therein. We saw really strong F&B revenues. They were up 5.7% in the quarter. Flow-through was very strong, as I talked about, up over 47%. We also saw a really nice ADR growth. So we had a really good rooms flow through as well. Then you throw in the property insurance and taxes, better loans, another 15 basis points. So I think it's a combination of all of those things, not to mention, I should also add, utilities were down. We were expecting utilities to be up about 2.5% in the quarter, and they were up -- they were down 3.5%. And so at this point, on a full year basis, we were looking at utilities when we gave guidance before, up about 1% to 2%. Now we think they're going to be down slightly.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it sounds like it's really F&B, ADR growth, property taxes, insurance and utilities. And does your current guidance assume that we're going to see similar trends to what we've seen over the first half of the year, or any the moderation in those trends?","W. Edward Walter","No, I'd say that we're generally expecting that what we saw in the first half will carry through into the second half.","Operator","We'll go next to Josh Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","On the Hyatt acquisition, it seems like the EBITDA stream is probably close to where it was in 2007 and you have new supply coming into the market in 2014. Where do you see the upside in the value of that asset coming from, and what level of return do you expect to achieve?","W. Edward Walter","Well, Josh, I think we -- I think you're right in saying that the Washington market in general is closer to its prior peak than some of the other markets or a number of the other markets across the U.S. This asset is not quite at its prior peak. It's probably I'd end up with. My guess is it's about 8% to 9%, 8% to 10% below its prior peak to EBITDA. So as we look at this hotel though, I think that the real opportunity that comes from owning this hotel, comes from its location within D.C. And honestly, what we see is the long-term prospects for the D.C. market. Washington's been talked a lot about the last couple of years as a weaker market, and I think a number of us that are invested in the market have highlighted the fact that part of the problem has been issues -- Washington didn\u2019t fall as far as some other markets consequently didn't necessarily have as much easy ground to recover, and then there's been some issues that I think are somewhat unique to the current period, dealing with a weaker convention calendar and an absence of activity on Capitol Hill that have resulted in less transient demand in Washington than we would normally expect to see. As we look further out in Washington, thinking more broadly about the market, we think Washington is going to continue to be a very attractive market for convention business. And as it -- with the new hotel coming online in 2014, it will only help facilitate the strength of Washington, the convention market. And if you look at the bookings out more into the, say the 2015, 2016 level, we're seeing a certainly, a definite increase in bookings in those years, especially in 2016. That confirms the fact that Washington should be on a long-term basis, a very active convention market. I don't think that the current gridlock on Capitol Hill can continue forever. And so it would seem to me that -- and it would surprise me if it did start to happen in '13. If we didn't start to see an accelerated level of legislative activity, which will certainly lead to an accelerated level of lodging -- of demand for lodging from lobbyists, that will be helpful and adds some strength into the Washington market. So then I think adding -- besides the fact that we generally feel very good about the long term for the Washington market, the last thing I would add is how the location of the Grand Hyatt in Washington is right in what's really becoming the heart of the city. It's immediately opposite what was the old Convention Center site, which the old Convention Center was demolished once the new Convention Center was built in earlier this past decade. And now, it's being redeveloped into 1 million square feet of office and over 300,000 square feet of retail, as well as a couple of different condo projects. And I think there's a real expectation that, that's going to provide a focal point for that part of downtown. We should benefit from that. And I think the location of this hotel is only getting better, and it has had a good track record over the last decade or 2. From our perspective, that can only improve over the next decade or 2.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. When you look broadly at the acquisition market, this asset and other things that you see, where do you think we are in the asset appreciation cycle? And related to that, going forward, do you think you'll be a net buyer or a net seller?","W. Edward Walter","A lot of that -- I guess the answer to the first question, I think that the cycle is ultimately driven by how quickly this new supply start to overtake demand in the various markets in which we and others invest. And certainly, as you look at the projections for supply and well this year, it's pretty obvious, but as you look at the projections for supply in '13 and '14, they are relatively low. So I think as long as we continue to see low levels of new supply, with then -- and we have a growing economy, then we should continue to see demand exceed supply, which I think creates an opportunity for appreciation in the value of hotels. What was the second part of your question there, Josh?","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You think you'll be a net buyer or a net seller over next 12 months?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, as it relates -- yes, certainly in the near term, we're very confident we'd like to be a net acquirer. I think the answer around that question depends upon where pricing goes. And so, we'll continue to evaluate assets the same way we always have, which is to look at our long-term cash flow for the asset and look to see if we believe, under what we think are conservative assumptions, we can generate a return on that asset that would exceed our cost of capital. Now I don't know exactly how this cycle will play out, but I do know that in the last cycle, what ended up happening in 2006 and 2007, is we started to see pricing that just was so strong, that under the assumptions under which we were comfortable underwriting assets, we've started to find that we just weren't competitive as the buyer. Not because we didn't have a low cost of capital, but I think others were just being very aggressive. And consequently, we made a decision at that point that we were better off being a seller than a buyer. I clearly anticipate that we will find the same sort of dynamic happen at some point in this cycle. I don't see any real signs of it yet, so I suspect that even as we look at '13, we would still be active on the acquisition front, but it's hard to predict beyond that right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan with Cowen & Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of other small points on the expenses, and thank you for the detail in terms of what's in the guidance, but I didn't hear, maybe I missed it, but what's the outlook in terms of wages and benefits for the balance of this year? And the second point in this respect, to what extent is food price inflation something that you're thinking about or should be concerned about for the balance of the year or into 2013?","W. Edward Walter","Jim, I'm going to have you come back to that second question because I missed part of that, but I think what we're finding on wages and benefits right now is that we're probably looking at our overall wages and benefits, kind of increasing somewhere a little bit north of 3% over the last quarter. The interesting thing is that on a -- what we tend to look at even more carefully, is how we're doing on a per occupied room basis. And at that level, the increase is much smaller, really closer to around 1, which is reflecting, I think both the fact that we've had some increase in occupancy, as well as the fact that we've been doing a good job about trying to look at ways to be more efficient in the way the hotels are run. If I were to think about where wages and benefits are going to go for the rest of the year, I suspect that the increases in the second half of the year would be slightly north of 3%. That seems to be the trend rate. And my guess is that we'd see, kind of again looking at it on a per occupied room basis, it would be roughly similar to what we've recently experienced. There's certainly no reason that I can see right now why there'd be a major swing in those numbers in the near term. Now your second question dealt with longer-term inflations?","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Food -- the food price inflation. Obviously conditions are getting difficult. We're seeing some significant increases in coolant prices and others, and people are talking about the food price inflation becoming a factor maybe toward the end of this year. And I just wonder to what extent that\u2019s something that you think about, the operators' forecast and how you've coped with that, and is that an issue that could present some margin pressure in 2013?","W. Edward Walter","First I'd say, Jim, so far on food cost, I mean, we've done very well. We actually had a benefit of 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue in the quarter. A lot of the things over time since 2008, we focused a lot on working with the operators on menu management, making sure of good profits, making sure they're focused in using the vendor and some of the services to get the cheapest pricing. Right now, we had -- banquet and AV revenues were up 6.8% in the quarter. So we've been pushing through price -- some price increases there, and overall the menu management has been good. Clearly, when you see the cornfields out in the Midwest, there is some concern around that, but we haven't seen that inflation at the properties.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, Ed, this is really a question for you. If you could touch on how you're thinking about capital allocation internationally? You made some announcements regarding Latin America obviously recently. You've made some positive comments about the resiliency in Europe, particularly in Northern Europe. And I'm just curious how you're thinking about allocating your capital internationally, given everything that's happening, and your appetite for more new build in markets like South America as well as India.","W. Edward Walter","I guess what I would say is that consistent with what you've seen so far this cycle, we still expect that the bulk of the investment that we do will end up in the U.S. Having said that though, I think you did touch on a couple of different places around the world where we are interested in investing more. Europe, as Larry talked about our results in Europe during his comments, and we've been pleasantly surprised by how well Europe has held up despite the turmoil and the debt markets over there, especially the sovereign debt market. And we continue to be interested in investing over there. I think most people know, we invested through a joint venture, with 2 fairly sophisticated investors: One is the government of Singapore, Government Investment Corp. out of Singapore, and the other is APG, the big Dutch pension fund. And as we discuss with them about how to pursue opportunities in Europe, the conclusion that we've collectively reached at this point is that we would be interested in pursuing opportunities in what I would loosely describe as Northern Europe, and I probably focused that more directly on, say London, Paris, and certain other markets in Germany. Both because those are markets that we think will do better from an economic perspective, and certainly from a lodging perspective, but also there are markets that attract a fair amount of leisure customers, which I think helps provide a base for those markets if the economic situation in Europe were to weaken even further. But generally, I don't think we would -- because those are the markets we would look at there. As we look at Brazil, you're right that we'd recently announced the joint venture to develop -- rather an acquisition to buy a completion, in Novotel and in ibis that are being built in Rio de Janeiro. As we look at Brazil, which is really our only focus market in Latin America, we would like to buy existing full-service there because we still feel very good about the overall opportunity in Brazil, and on a select-service side, we think that matches up well with the, sort of emerging wealth that's happening within the country of Brazil, to think that as that country -- as the middle class in Brazil grows larger, they probably aren't going to be staying at the higher-end hotels, but select-service hotels are appropriately positioned to capture that traveler. So I think we could see some incremental investment in some other select-service hotels in the couple of the major markets within Brazil. Nothing necessarily imminent, but we are looking at some opportunities there. In the other markets I haven't touched on, is Asia. And there, we're really focusing our efforts right now primarily in Australia, which I think would generally be existing hotels. Although there's always the possibility in a market that's as tight as Australia, for a new build opportunity. And then we're looking at Singapore and Hong Kong. But I think all of those -- we've tried to -- I'd say in some degree, as we've looked at Asia, we are refining the markets that we're focusing on there a bit, taking -- recognizing that some of the emerging markets certainly would put China at the top of this list, have seen an incredible amount of new supply. Now while that certainly there's a lot of growth in the lodging industry in a market like China, we're not necessarily certain there's an opportunity for a lodging owner to make a lot of money there.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And are there any interest in India?","W. Edward Walter","We have a JV that is building 7 hotels in India, and I'd say that at this point in time, we are watching how that process proceeds and continue to get more and more familiar with the India market. The new supply in India is picking up a bit. It's certainly nowhere near at the level of what we've seen in China, but I'd say right now, we have a cautious outlook on India and are trying to really get a better handle on that as we watch what happens with the hotels that we're completing there.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then a final comment for me. As you think about dividend and the capital spending, can just remind us what your objectives are regarding your balance sheet metrics? Where would you like to be, 1 to 2 years out, in terms of those metrics?","W. Edward Walter","We've concluded that ultimately, we'd like to see become a lower leverage company than where we were at the peak of the last cycle. In part, because we think that will just drive a lower cost of capital, and also in part because we think that's probably just overall safer structure for our company. If we were to try to put that into a debt-to-EBITDA metric, that would suggest to us that we should target to be at or below a 3x debt-to-EBITDA multiple.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. Keeping in mind that your exposure to Europe is fairly limited, I am interested in your point of view on whether or not RevPAR in the second half of 2012 is going to be better or worse, or about the same as the first half?","W. Edward Walter","Harry, that's a great question, and I -- but I think the short answer to that is that we generally would expect it to be in line with what we've seen in the first half of the year. The group bookings in Europe this year have been quite strong. Some of that, admittedly in London, is driven by the Olympics. But the Olympics don't drive -- our portfolio is pretty well diversified across all of Europe, and the reality is that we're seeing relatively good group activity throughout Europe. One of the -- I think in some markets, and I'm thinking of Barcelona when I say this, I think Barcelona is actually benefiting from some increased travel from the U.S. over to Barcelona. I suspect that the favorable trends from the U.S. perspective on the euro, meaning that the euro's gone down, which makes having a meeting or an event in Europe is a little bit cheaper, are probably helping us a little bit on that front. But I think that we keep looking for themes there and trends and trying to track, to try to anticipate which direction Europe is going. And as I think we just talked about on the prior calls, we took a fairly conservative approach to Europe when we thought about how it should fit within our numbers and how it -- what we would anticipate there in the beginning of the year. And the reality is, as you know if you look at year-to-date, in London and Paris, have been in the -- have seen RevPAR growth in the upper single digits and Barcelona has been right there next to them. The one market that's underperformed year-to-date has really been Brussels, but we have a sense that, that will do a little bit better in the second half of the year. So when you work all the way through it, I suspect we'll see some ups and downs through these different markets because that's been the track record for the first half of the year, but at the end of the day, we would continue to expect to see this sort of 3% to 4% RevPAR growth for the full year that we've experienced for the first half.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, so Barcelona is probably up because of executives from Las Vegas traveling there. Let's see, second question is, with respect to your renovations, when you look into 2013, are there any major renovations that you have on the docket right now? What I'm trying to get a sense of is when are most of the major renovations behind you, and when might they be a tailwind to helping your RevPAR?","W. Edward Walter","We're about to, in the next couple of weeks, to start to review our capital plan for 2013. So I guess the way -- the short answer is, I don't think we have any major renovations of the scale of, say, the Chicago O'Hare Marriott or the Atlanta Perimeter Hotel that are on the books today. But I wouldn't be surprised if there are 1 or 2 hotels that didn't ultimately creep into our capital plan as we see some opportunities, to make some material changes in some hotels in an effort to improve their performance. But I think in that category, they would tend to be smaller hotels and probably wouldn't have the impact that you're imagining. In terms of the broader driver behind your question, we feel like we're generally fairly caught up in capital projects, and so we certainly don't feel like we're looking at a deficit in the portfolio. I don't envision that we have any amount of where right now, of any Philadelphia Marriott projects where you're spending $60 million on a hotel, and it really has a disruptive effect on your operations. Well, the same thing, that result, that these larger projects that we've been in the midst of up in the Sheraton in New York. So I suspect at the end of the day, there should be a little less drag but to be perfectly honest here, we're probably about a month early for me to intelligently answer that question because that's what we're about to figure out coming up here soon.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And as a practical matter, do you expect just a renovation piece of it? And it's hard to distinguish between the -- between renovation and maintenance CapEx, but strictly on the renovation side, would we expect a spend of under $100 million next year?","W. Edward Walter","At the risk of rather trying to answer that and turning out to be wrong, I think it would just -- it will -- more to come on that as we get in probably at our third quarter call, we might have a little bit more insight on that.","Operator","We'll go next to Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just in terms of some of your spend and as it relates to your asset sales, with the strategy right now, are you getting any push back on stuff that maybe hasn't been updated that you may be looking to sell? Is the strategy now maybe to address some of those up prior to selling, or how are you thinking about that?","W. Edward Walter","That's a great question, and we think about that very specifically as it relates to each asset that we sell. And so we've tried to be thoughtful as we look out and think about what hotels are coming on the market to try it with -- our capital plan tends to take into account either those sorts of investments that we think would add value to the hotel, so that we can get the value when we sell. We also tend to look at those sorts of -- this doesn't come up as often, but if there is a more complicated capital project that we think -- well, it may not add to value as one of these sorts of projects where the buyer might ding us more because it wasn't done. Think of a facade or a roof when you're looking and thinking of an example that whether there maybe a variety of ways to approach it. We've typically been addressing those sorts of projects to make certain that we don't end up creating a reason why a buyer might be able to offset the price for a capital improvement. So what it comes down to is, each individual asset gets a capital plan that takes into account the fact that we have a general idea about when we'd like to sell that asset and then we will complete that in advance. I think part of the -- and the way you approach these things can vary a bit. But in certain areas like with the rooms renovation, it maybe that you ultimately realize the buyer really is going -- especially in a hotel where the management may change, in a lot of hotels we sell, there is an opportunity for a new operator to come into the hotel, you may not want to necessarily do a rooms renovation because it may be clear that the buyer will want to control that, and will want to reach their own conclusions about how much of a renovation to do and how to approach it. So there's a lot of different factors that go into it, but ultimately, we try to tailor the program to the asset and the opportunity.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","On the disposition front, you've touched on, a little bit I guess in the near term, Ed, but when you look at your portfolio, I think you guys have about 15,000 rooms in airport and suburban locations, and RevPAR there is about, I think $100 a night, which is I think about 35% lower than your urban and resort hotels. How do you think about those less productive assets over the long term? Because it strikes me that relieving yourself of those hotels where ongoing capital investment is arguably a larger percentage of your profits, could be a catalyst to host cash flow growth longer term?","W. Edward Walter","Jeff, I think you're right and that ultimately, we may be speaking more broadly to the question. We do intend to be an active seller over the next 2 or 3 years, and as we -- consistent with what we've described in the past, a number of these suburban assets, both in core and non-core markets and airport locations, leaving out the ones that are sort of directly attached to the airport, those are the sorts -- those are hotels that would be high on our priority list in terms of sale -- hotels should be sold. And I think it's the combination of what you described relative to lower RevPAR, it's also the probability that there are situations that the CapEx may be a bit higher for those hotels as a percentage of revenue. It deals with our outlook in some cases about the growth prospects for those hotels, not in general but relative to the strong prospects that we might see for a number of our urban hotels. So if you go back to the last cycle, I don't remember the exact number right now, but we've sold somewhere, plus or minus around 35, 36 hotels. I don't know that we'll necessarily end up being quite that big of a seller this cycle, but we will be a very active seller if the market permits us to do that. And then we do as we've described before, intend to focus the portfolio on a smaller number of markets that will mean that we will be reducing our presence in those markets that we don't view as core going forward, and even in some of the core markets that we've identified as the market conditions permit us to, we will look to sell assets that are located in suburban locations.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just to add as another question, what do you think about, more broadly than just Host, about the opportunity for folks to convert hotels or convert buildings away from a hotel use and maybe into something like a residential or office because as I know you have one in Indianapolis. But when you look at where we are this cycle, most hotels aren't at peak profits and they trade at multiples that are kind of in line with historical averages. Whereas most, say residential assets, are at peak profits and peak multiples, and financing is cheap. So that begs the question of whether or not we could see more of that conversion activity in the industry in the next 2 to 3 years?","W. Edward Walter","Well, as an order of hotels, I'd love it if a few more of the other ones got converted into residential. I can assure you of that. I think it's hard to say how often that will happen. I mean, the part of it is, well, that we still feel that a lot of markets, the outlook, the fundamental outlook between demand and supply for hotels is very attractive. So in some ways, it probably requires some special situations like the one that we saw in Indianapolis where we just felt that the hotel as originally designed and built, was a little bit too big for the market, which is why it made sense to take one tower from the hotel and convert it to apartment. I'm sure you're right that there will be other situations like that around the country. There are always are. And a lot of times, those come about because there's a changing nature in the local market where the building exists, and so whatever the original reason why people are building a hotel or a hotel of a certain size, there's a reason to make a change. I don't know how much of the theme we will see of that, in part because in general, across the country, we're seeing improving lodging dynamics not deteriorating.","Operator","This will conclude our question-and-answer session. Mr. Harvey, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","W. Edward Walter","Well, actually, this will be Ed Walter thanking you, but I would like to thank everybody for joining us on this call today.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Shantelle. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results, and update on our capital allocation activities and our outlook for 2019; Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our second quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Risoleo","Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I want to start by emphasizing how proud I am of all that we have and are accomplishing in here at Host. Our successful execution continues to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet.","Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT. On the operations front, we delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $460 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.53, which was in line with the consensus estimates for the quarter. Our performance this quarter was driven by 10 basis point increase in comparable total RevPAR to $305 which includes all hotel level revenues including food and beverage and other revenues.","We had strong comparable hotel EBITDA margins despite flat revenues and pressure on wages and benefits. Our EBITDA margin declined 20 basis points, which included a 30 basis point negative impact related to the timing of the receipt of the New York Marriott Marquis tax rebate which we received in the second quarter of 2018 and six basis points related to severance from a planned operational restructuring at one of our properties this year.","Excluding these one-time impacts, our EBITDA margin would have increased an impressive 16 basis points. We generated exceptional bottom line performance results despite the comparable hotel RevPAR decline of 1.5% in the second quarter. The second quarter RevPAR results was driven by an occupancy decrease of 140 basis points which was partially offset by a slight increase in average rate.","The factors that affected RevPAR this quarter include an estimated 90 basis points impact from disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program weaker-than-expected transient demand in major markets like New York and supply growth in Seattle.","New York and Seattle had a meaningful impact on RevPAR for the quarter. Excluding those two markets our comparable hotel RevPAR would have increased 20 basis points. This performance once again demonstrated the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver outsized results. We continue to benefit from our internal initiatives, the Marriot-Starwood merger synergies, the receipt of operating profit guarantees from the Marriott transformational capital program and increases in ancillary revenues.","Michael will provide additional commentary on our continued margin outperformance in his prepared remarks. In addition to our continued outperformance on our EBITDA margins we have made significant progress on the capital allocation process. Year-to-date we bought back $245 million of common stock and we are opportunistically taking advantage of the current market conditions to divest some of our low RevPAR high-capital expenditure assets amid a strong capital margin environment.","During the quarter, we closed on the previously announced sale of The Westin Mission Hills, as well as two additional assets. Our leasehold interest in the Washington Dulles, Airport Marriott and the Newport Beach Marriott Bayview.","Subsequent to quarter end, we sold the Residence Inn Arlington Pentagon City, The Courtyard Chicago Downtown and Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare, which we closed late yesterday. Including the Westin Grand Central sold in the first quarter year-to-date we completed seven asset sales for $609 million and have an additional five assets under contract for sale.","For all assets sold year-to-date and those assets under contract after taking into consideration the estimated capital we would have spent on these assets the combined EBITDA multiple and cap rate on the trailing 12-month results would be 15.3 times and 5.7% , respectively.","We continue to focus on advancing our long-term strategic vision of owning iconic and irreplaceable properties in key markets with strong demand generators and high barriers to entry while divesting low RevPAR high capital expenditure assets through active portfolio management, ensuring that the company is well-positioned for continued growth.","As announced in our earnings press release, our Board authorized an increase in our share repurchase program to $1 billion. After taking into consideration, the $245 million brought back to-date, which includes amounts brought back in the second quarter and through the 10b5-1 program subsequent to quarter end, we have $755 million of capacity remaining. In addition, we further strengthened our balance sheet in the quarter by taking advantage of the strong bank debt markets. We refinanced our revolving credit facility in term loans, upsizing it from $2 billion to $2.5 billion. Michael will discuss this further in his prepared remarks.","The balance sheet has never been in better shape and we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating. Shifting to reinvesting in our portfolio, we anticipate spending between $235 million and $265 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and between $315 million and $345 million on redevelopment and ROI projects this year.","The ROI projects include $225 million related to the Marriott transformational capital program for which Marriott provides operating profit guarantees to cover the anticipated disruption and enhanced owners' priority returns on the incremental spend. The transformational capital program, which carries through 2021 will position the 17 targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio as even stronger competitors and their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sets.","We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders capital as transformational capital projects have typically resulted in meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index, which translates to strong improvement in EBITDA. We expect the ROI on these investments to be in the mid-teens.","In 2019 as I have stated we intend to spend approximately $225 million on 10 projects with four to be completed during the year. Thus far both the Coronado Island Marriott and the New York Marriott Downtown have been completed. Two additional hotels the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter. Only 3 of the 10 hotels where we are allocating this capital, the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, the Minneapolis Marriott City Center and the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter are excluded from our forecast comparable results.","The seven that are still included in our comparable results have impacted RevPAR in the second quarter by an estimated 90 basis points and we expect will impact full year comparable RevPAR by 50 basis points. However, the RevPAR impact is mitigated by the operating profit guarantee of approximately $5 million and $10 million that has been included in comparable hotel EBITDA for the second quarter and full year forecast, respectively.","For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantee payments for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects. This has been included in our guidance for EBITDA.","Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. The U.S. economy slowed, but still grew a solid 2.1% in the second quarter. Strong consumer spending offset a drop in business investment. Consumer confidence is at an all-time high, while employment is at a 50-year low. The consumer is in good shape and leisure demand remained strong.","Businesses were cautious in the quarter likely driven by the global slowdown and the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing trade negotiations. Full year non-residential fixed investment while still healthy declined 40 basis points since the first quarter to 3.6%. We believe this led to a decline in business transient demand especially in major markets such as New York and San Francisco. All of these factors resulted in weaker result than we and the industry anticipated.","Overall, as we look to the second half of the year and amid the growing uncertainty of a trade deal with China being concluded in the near-term, we do not see any near-term catalyst to induce business transient demand.","As a result, we are revising our full year guidance to reflect a slightly softer operating environment. Our outlook for the full year for comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth is now flat to down 1%. Based on our continued margin outperformance in the second quarter and our confidence that the increases are sustainable through the remainder of the year, we are increasing our margin guidance. We now expect comparable EBITDA margin to be down 25 basis points at the low end and up 25 basis points on the high end of our guidance. Michael will provide further details surrounding our second quarter margin outperformance as well as reasons for our confidence for the remainder of the year in his prepared remarks.","These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.73 to $1.78. Keep in mind that our new guidance now includes a reduction of $21 million through our forecasted EBITDA for the sale of the Residence Inn Pentagon City; Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare and five additional anticipated asset sales. If we do not sell these assets at the midpoint, our guidance for adjusted EBITDAre would have been $1.541 billion and adjusted FFO per share would have been $1.79.","Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with our ability to continue to outperform our margins and continue to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy. Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform and our investment grade balance sheet all position us to deliver shareholder value in the near, medium and long-term.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail.","Michael Bluhm","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with our strong continued bottom line performance this quarter. Our asset management and enterprise analytics teams continue to assist their managers with controlling costs to drive margins in a low total RevPAR environment.","With that, let's discuss the details of our result for the quarter. On a constant currency basis, comparable total RevPAR, which includes all hotel level revenues including food and beverage and other revenues, improved 10 basis points to $305, representing an all-time high for the company. Strong food and beverage spend and ancillary revenues resulted in the record performance.","Comparable room RevPAR decreased 1.5% on a constant currency basis, which was driven by a 140 basis points decrease in occupancy, partially offset by a 30 basis point increase in average rate.","As Jim mentioned, renovation disruption from the Marriott transformational capital program reduced our second quarter comparable RevPAR by 90 basis points. Consistent with STR data for the overall industry, we experienced weaker than anticipated RevPAR in the second quarter due to softness in business transient demand especially in the top markets.","Our relative overweighting in the U.S. in Seattle, which declined a combined 10% also hindered portfolio performance. Excluding these two markets, comparable RevPAR increased 20 basis points.","Moving on to comparable hotel EBITDA margins, we continue to deliver impressive margins through our internal initiatives and the benefits from the Marriott-Starwood merger synergies, demonstrating the benefits of our scale and integrated platform to deliver continued operational outperformance.","As Jim mentioned for the quarter, comparable hotel EBITDA margin declined by 20 basis points. However, after factoring in 30 basis point impact related to the timing of tax rebates for the New York Marriott Marquis and six basis points related to severance from our planned operational restructuring at one of our hotels, our comparable hotel EBITDA margins increased by 16 basis points. This is remarkable given a 1.5% decline in RevPAR this quarter. These factors resulted in adjusted EBITDAre for the quarter of $460 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.53.","Now let me provide some additional color around our margin outperformance. As we highlighted on the first quarter earnings call, a variety of internal initiatives are continuing to drive ancillary revenue growth, productivity improvement and decreased operating costs. These efforts are serving to offset increases in wages and benefits, which are accelerating in this low unemployment environment.","In addition to these initiatives, we continue to receive outsized benefits from the synergies with the Marriott-Starwood merger. Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs and combine systems to lower charge-out rates to its owners. This quarter we've seen reduced fees related to the loyalty and rewards program, IT systems and group and travel agent commissions.","And finally the receipt of approximately $5 million related to the operating profit guarantees from Marriott for the comparable hotels that are part of the Marriott transformational capital program is enhancing margins by approximately 40 basis points this quarter and will continue through the remainder of the year and into 2021.","Now let's discuss the performance of our business mix. Starting with our transient segment. Second quarter transient revenues were up 40 basis points and underperformed their expectations as an increase in demand was partially mitigated by an average rate decline of 50 basis points. These results were lower than on our forecast due to weaker-than-expected business transient demand, especially in top markets such as New York and San Francisco. The weakening fundamentals around the global economy along with the uncertainties surrounding the resolution of the China trade issues weighed on business transient demand this quarter.","On a positive note leisure travel continues to be strong and improved as expected, as revenues increased 4% driven by an almost 8% growth at our resorts. As expected group revenues declined 4.7% in the quarter driven by a lack of citywide events in San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, New Orleans and Washington D.C. The late Easter resulted in the group volume decrease in April for us and the industry.","Our managers were very successful in partially mitigating, the group volume decline by pursuing corporate group business, which proved successful as this segment improved 6.4% this quarter. This increased in corporate business, which represents the largest segment of all business this quarter towards the banquet and catering outperformance.","Overall, we're pleased with our optimal group mix for our portfolio. As you recall, 2018 was a record year for group room nights with five million group rooms booked for the year. Consistent with last year, we had over 90% of our group business booked for the remainder of 2019 providing a strong base to business.","Looking at individual markets. Our best performing domestic market this quarter were Philadelphia, the Florida Gulf Coast, Phoenix and Maui with RevPAR increases ranging from 5% to 12%.","Our hotels in Philadelphia outperformed STR's luxury and upper-upscale market by a wide margin with RevPAR growth of 11.5% versus STR luxury and upper-upscale RevPAR of 3.6%. Strong group business at our properties in Philadelphia allowed the managers to drive average rate, which increased 10.6%.","Florida Gulf Coast RevPAR increased 7.7% outperforming STR luxury and upper-upscale due to stronger business, which was up 18.5% this quarter. The strong group business resulted in increased food and beverage revenues by 9% and increased banquet and catering sales by almost 13%. In addition, weather-related events in the Southeast benefited the Tampa Airport Marriott.","RevPAR for our Phoenix hotels outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 6.6%. This was primarily driven by strong leisure demand as transient revenues grew 10.7%. The Phoenician was the exception to this trend in which displays transient occupancy did a stronger group performance and was able to grow transient ADR over 23%.","Now moving on to the markets that were more challenged in the second quarter. Our hotels in Seattle, Orlando and New York saw RevPAR declines ranging from 10% to 11%. The Seattle hotels saw RevPAR decline of 11.2%, which was in line with STR market luxury and upper-upscale hotels. The RevPAR decline was related to the lack of citywide demand in the quarter putting downward pressure on group and transient pricing. The entire market was down 5% in group room nights in the quarter. This coupled with new supply especially the new 1,300 room Hyatt Regency in Downtown Seattle has put pressure on pricing in the market.","RevPAR at our Orlando World Center Marriott declined 10.6% in the second quarter underperforming our internal forecast. Weaker-than-expected group business drove this decline paired with transient rate softness from lack of compression. In addition, the rooms renovation is part of the Marriott transformational capital expenditure program began in the second quarter.","New York hotels RevPAR declined 9.8% as softer demand experienced in the first quarter continued into the second quarter and demand for the Times Square submarket was worse than the overall New York market. STR's luxury and upper-upscale RevPAR was down 1.9% for New York while the Times Square sub-market was down 4.2%.","In addition, major disruption from the renovations at our New York Marriott Marquis and New York Marriott Downtown contributed to the RevPAR decline. However, as these are part of the Marriott transformational capital program, EBITDA related to the disruption was protected through the Marriott operating profit guarantees.","Lease demand was also down and there was a large cancellation at the Sheraton New York for which we received cancellation fees. The New York market continues to experience weakness from both business and leisure customers and new supply, reducing our exposure to profitability challenged hotels in this market over the past year has strengthened the overall portfolio.","Looking ahead to the full year, we continue to expect RevPAR at our hotels in the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Philadelphia to outperform the portfolio due to strength in corporate and leisure demand as well as strong city-wides. Conversely, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in Seattle, New York and Chicago to underperform our portfolio due to continued weakness in business transient demand, weak citywide calendars or additional supply.","Moving to our balance sheet. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintaining. At quarter end, we had unrestricted cash of $1.1 billion, not including $203 million FF&E escrow reserve and $943 million of available capacity of remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility.","Total debt was $3.9 billion with a weighted average maturity of 3.7 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Our leverage ratio at the end of the second quarter was approximately 1.8 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility.","Subsequent to quarter end, we completed $2.5 billion of bank financing capitalizing on one of the lowest borrowing cost in the company's history.","To this end, we refinanced our two term loans totaling $1 billion and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. As a result, we enhanced our liquidity, extended our weighted average maturity to 4.6 years, pushed at our nearest maturity to 2021 and reduced our borrowing cost by again 10 basis points across the grid.","Turning to our return on capital discussion. In July, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a yield of approximately 4.8% on our current stock price. In addition, as mentioned in the press release, we repurchased 10.9 million shares during the second quarter at an average price of $18.32 for a total purchase price of $200 million. Subsequent to quarter end we bought back an additional 2.7 million shares at an average price of $16.83 for a total purchase price of $45 million under 10b5-1 program.","Finally, we recently received authorization from our Board to increase our buyback capacity up to $1 billion, providing us incremental capacity of $755 million. Notably, year-to-date we have returned $725 million of capital to our stockholders.","Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. As Jim described, we revised the comparable RevPAR guidance for the year to negative 1% to flat, indicating that we expect RevPAR for the second half of the year to be stronger than the first, albeit at a lower level than we forecasted last quarter.","Included in this range is our estimate of a 50 basis point impact to our full year RevPAR from the renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects. Without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately flat.","For 2019, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott's operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital programs, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA. In addition, I hope the details I provided surrounding our outsized leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration and the internal initiatives of our asset management and enterprise analytics teams help you understand how we can continue to drive margin outperformance.","Despite our downward revision of the RevPAR guidance, our outlook for our EBITDA margins has improved. Several factors give us confidence in our margins. First, all hotels that have experienced a softening in top line expectations relative to budgets have put in place profit improvement plans to mitigate the impact to EBITDA and maintain margin.","Additionally, here is the savings associated with the Marriott integration have exceeded our expectations, mainly travel agency commissions, royalty cost and allocated expenses for programs and services. The actualized savings are now fully reflected in our outlook. Ancillary revenues have also continued to come in stronger-than-expected. The focus on capture of transient cancellation fees is positively impacting margins.","Further, the Phoenician and its world-class spa and golf facilities are earning great guest reviews and surpassing our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Finally, the operational profit guarantees we are receiving on properties under the Marriott transformational capital program are also providing a boost to our margins.","The reduction in our comparable RevPAR and margin assumption results in a $27 million decrease to our forecasted adjusted EBITDAre for the second half of the year. In addition, we reduced our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance by $21 million to remove the EBITDA related to the sale of Pentagon City Residence Inn and the Courtyard Chicago Marriott Suites -- I'm sorry, the Courtyard Chicago and the Chicago Marriott Suites O\u2019Hare and five additional anticipated asset sale.","The combination of these items results in our new guidance ranges for 2019. Adjusted EBITDAre of $1.5 billion to $1.54 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.73 to $1.78. Lastly, keep in mind that we expect 19% to 20% of our total EBITDA in the third quarter and the third quarter is projected to be the stronger of the two remaining quarters driven by the Jewish holiday shift.","Overall, we are pleased with our strong bottom line operating results. Our performance continues to demonstrate that only a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value and maintaining a powerful investment-grade balance sheet, creates a strong strategic position to deliver superior value to our stockholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we would like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Smedes Rose, Citi.","Smedes Rose","Good morning. I guess I wanted to ask you really -- I think in the past you've said about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of total investment capacity, including share repurchases. So now that you've resumed the repurchase activity, is that kind of the priority going forward, particularly given that shares obviously are lower now than where you've been buying them back half?","Jim Risoleo","Yes, Smedes, as with any time we deploy capital, we will assess the underlying fundamentals and our view of likely future performance and value when we are making a decision to invest in our portfolio to buy an asset or to buyback stock. So, I just point you to the fact that we had a $1 billion authorization. We had $755 million remaining for the year. We will take calls of underlying operating trends and a view of our NAV given current facts and circumstances and act accordingly.","Smedes Rose","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Anthony Powell, Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jim Risoleo","Hi.","Anthony Powell","Hi. In terms of the asset sales, could you remind us how many assets and even number or percent of EBITDA fit into kind of the low profitability bucket? And how quickly could you sell these assets over the next few quarters?","Jim Risoleo","Anthony, we haven't really sat back and said that this is the portfolio of hotels we want to dispose off. We look at sales on an opportunistic basis whether we see a need for high capital expenditure investments in properties, markets that we don't have a favorable view of for the long-term.","On every asset that we evaluate whether or not to sell, we start with doing a whole value which is a 10-year pro forma including 10 years of CapEx over and above the FF&E reserve. And if we feel that we're able to transact in the market at a price that's greater than a whole value and the market dynamics are such that we think the buyer can perform as today with strong financing markets -- financing markets have never been stronger quite frankly both from a proceeds perspective and an interest rate perspective then we'll move forward. But we have no problematic plan in place to sell assets.","Anthony Powell","Okay. Are you marketing more assets currently?","Jim Risoleo","I think that what we will point to you is the assets that we've discussed on the call.","Anthony Powell","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Katz, Jefferies.","David Katz","Hi, everyone. Good morning.","Jim Risoleo","Good morning, Dave.","David Katz","Listening to your commentary as well as the commentary of others and then looking at the capacity that you have, I'd love to hear your commentary around the availability of assets to acquire right as well as what the tolerance for loan to values and valuations has done over the past couple of weeks as best as you can assess it.","And just I'd love to hear your thoughts about how you're thinking about that? And whether having the capacity and just sitting tight for a period of time is not maybe a very solid choice.","Jim Risoleo","Sure. David, I'll take the first part of the question and Michael can talk about the financing market. With respect to the acquisition marketplace, we always have a pipeline of assets that we are evaluating and underwriting. We've been very disciplined and our view towards performance of these assets. Going forward, and we have taken into consideration that the current economic times that we live in today and we'll look at buying an asset relative to as -- an example buying back our stock. It's not to say that if a very attractive opportunity presented itself that we wouldn't pursue it, but to date we just haven't seen a lot out there that make sense for us.","There is a gap between buyer-seller expectations. And I think part of that is being driven still by the flush financing market that's available to buyers today -- to sellers today to refinance our assets. So, I don't know if you want to talk about the...","Michael Bluhm","Yeah. I think that's a great point. I mean look, David the financing markets remain quite hot. And you've seen from a lot of our peers selling assets into it. It really has given the ability to drive pricing. I mean today in the CMBS market, you can still sort of get 75% LTV financing at really record low borrowing rate. And that's both from the single borrower as well as in the conduit market. And when you look in terms of the bank financing, you saw we just typically are one of the biggest branch in the company has done $2.5 billion of bank credit that market right in a low and longer environment we continue to -- that will continue to expect and be a big catalyst for the -- for borrowers and, again, also an environment where you're seeing a record low borrowing rates.","David Katz","Perfect. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario, Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Good morning, everyone.","Michael Bluhm","Good morning, Mike.","Jim Risoleo","Hey, Michael.","Michael Bellisario","Just on the capital allocation front, maybe ask a little bit differently. Maybe could you tell us how much of your buyback activity is being driven by the absolute returns you're seeing in your stock today versus the relative returns compared to where you're selling assets at net that valuation arbitrage that would be helpful?","Michael Bluhm","Michael, a couple of things in there. So look first of all, I\u2019d say that relates on -- we don't know necessarily what type of IRRs or buyers are I think they're buying at. We certainly have as Jim had pointed out; we have whole values that discount back the cash flows of properties as well as the capital requirements at our cost to capital.","And when someone's paying a higher price in that then presumably they're getting a higher return and\/or expect to get a higher return than what we think it's going to get. Look as it relates to the capital allocation, we took you through kind of what we bought in the open market as well as in the 10b5 and collectively sort of fair to say is kind of the weighted average price at sort of $18.04, which works out to about a 20% discount to consent NAV, which look in today's environment I think when you think about sort of -- some of the return profiles of a lot of the assets we look at in the past as well as the stuff that we're selling we think that's a pretty good use of capital.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Good morning, guys.","Michael Bluhm","Morning, Rich.","Jim Risoleo","Morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","Maybe just to shift gears a little bit, so with all of the moving parts in the portfolio in terms of asset sales and what's in the comp pool out of the comp pool and so forth, wondering if you guys could help us bridge to a number for pro forma historical RevPAR, so that we're comping against the right number as we model going forward, or maybe you could cash it in terms of the assets we sold over X-percent below our average RevPAR for the portfolio, just something to help us with the numbers there?","Jim Risoleo","Yeah. Rich the assets that we've discussed and sold year-to-date going back to the Westin Grand Central and the assets that have recently closed and the ones that are under contract, the combined RevPAR for that portfolio I think is around $136 that's about 27% below our company RevPAR. Is that the direction you're going with the question Rich?","Rich Hightower","Yeah. That's very helpful. And then maybe translating that number into an overall impact on what exists today that we should be comping against in forward period right? So that could be a 3% or 4% whatever sort of number that is almost on a weighted basis? We can talk offline if I'm not maybe being clear.","Jim Risoleo","Yeah. We should probably talk offline. I think that -- I think based on the assets that we've sold we've probably seeing a tick-up in our total company RevPAR from call it $180 to $183.","Rich Hightower","Okay. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm after there. And then maybe secondly while I've got you, you did throw out some group pace numbers last quarter for 2020. I think maybe in the low single digit area. If you don't mind reprising those numbers where we sit today? And then maybe describe any changes in the 2020 group pace numbers versus 90 days ago?","Jim Risoleo","Yeah. So, the group pace for 2020 it's holding, it's hanging in there. Total group revenue pace at this point is at 5.4% for 2020.","Rich Hightower","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Bill Crow, Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Good morning guys. A question for Michael on the housekeeping front, and then one for Jim. Michael, could you just kind of build us a bridge based on asset sales? And what the impact will be on 2020 EBITDA?","Michael Bluhm","On 2020, yes\u2026","Bill Crow","Everything that's either -- that's been incorporated in your guidance to date for this year what is going to be full year number for next year?","Michael Bluhm","Yes. If we go all the way back to the Westin Grand right that's a full year impact of $50 million.","Bill Crow","Okay. For all of the assets relative to what this year's guidance is. Okay, got it. And Jim I guess, my question is when we think about what you\u2026","Michael Bluhm","I want to make one adjustment -- hey Bill I just want to make one adjustment, because I'm working off a sheet here that it's net $27 million.","Bill Crow","Okay, all right. And maybe we'll follow-up just to make sure I'm clear. But Jim on the ancillary revenues that you call them and I'm thinking about parking, I'm thinking about fees the guest may pay et cetera. What is the ability to push those again next year? I mean, we can project RevPAR growth. We can think about food and beverage based on group and RevPAR et cetera, but the ancillary it feels like we're playing catch-up to some extent this year and I'm just wondering whether the growth goes out of the balloon next year?","Jim Risoleo","I think it's going to be an ongoing process first, Bill. I don't have hard numbers to talk about, but we're being thoughtful with respect to making certain that our customers are understanding day one what they're being asked to pay and they're achieving real value for any fees that they might be asked to pay. I would expect that we will continue to see increased capture on cancellation fees just from some automated systems that have been put in place, not that we're seeing a tick-up in cancellations. I don't want to call anybody with that thought because we're not seeing a pickup in cancellations. And we are continuing to see a strong out of room spending definition in particular with respect to golf and spa. So, it's an area that we continue to be focused on going forward.","Bill Crow","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning everyone. I just want to go back to that comment about the business travel being a little bit softer and the consumer hanging in there. How does this translate into the resource? It sounds like the Phoenician is doing quite well. Is the corporates still spending there?","Jim Risoleo","Yes. Actually, I think in Michael's prepared remarks, I'll let him talk about a little more, but we saw a very strong group performance at the Phoenician to the point where some of the transient business was yielded out in favor of group, allowing us to really compress transient rate with respect to what collets. The leisure travel continues to be strong overall. Revenues increased 12% in the quarter and that was driven by almost an 8% increase in our resorts.","Wes Golladay","And you're modeling this divergence to continue throughout with the guidance that sort of we should expect?","Jim Risoleo","Our guidance is granular. I mean this is property-by-property forecast to arrive at our guidance for the full year.","Wes Golladay","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes, SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes","Hi, good morning Jim and Mike. Just another way of asking the capital allocation question here. Is it fair to assume that all the proceeds from this next round of asset sales will be used for repurchases? And then, it looks like in 2Q, your repurchases were from asset sales. Would you also consider dipping in at this point, dipping into the balance sheet to do repurchases? Thank you.","Michael Bluhm","Patrick, to Jim's point, I mean I think how much cash is tangible. And we're thinking about in the context of whether we're investing externally investing in our portfolio or buying back stock. We just talked about kind of where we brought back or close to $0.25 billion of stock certainly don't like that price, but like being a buyer at that price. But again, we have to take that into consideration there are other -- all of our capital investment opportunities.","Jim Risoleo","The only thing I'd add to that Patrick is that acquisitions carry a very high volume there.","Patrick Scholes","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning everybody. I was just wondering if you could speak a little bit more about the operating profit guarantees for Marriott are going to play through once the renovation start to roll-off, right? So you're in the middle of the process now and obviously they've been creating a lot of cushion. What happens as the renovations are completed? And did it sort of made whole up until you return to a certain level of profitability, or do they roll-off as soon as sort of the CapEx is down and you've kind of have to fight for yourself while you're stabilizing?","Jim Risoleo","We're hopeful and we believe that the first, for yourself is going to put us in a very good place Shaun because, as these properties are fully renovated, we do expect meaningful increases in yield index which should translate into strong improvements in EBITDA. The way the operating performance guarantees were calculated is really based on the anticipated disruption at each property based on the scope of the renovation and based on our 20-plus years of data related to renovations and our ability to really forecast displacement of business whether you're doing rooms, whether you're doing rooms and bathrooms or a lobby or food and beverage or a meeting space. So, it's a property-by-property analysis. We have some ability to adjust those based on timing of the renovation and the like. But instead of said amount -- I think that the said amount was $83 million in the aggregate. And as we stated earlier today between comp -- non-comp for this year, we will receive $23 million.","Shaun Kelley","Got it. Yes it is. Sorry, I don't think I framed -- phrased that pretty good well. But that's what I was looking for. And then secondarily Jim or Michael can you just mention what you're seeing on group bookings for sort of 2020 and beyond just sort of the all future periods type level of interest or demand on the really leading or really far out group side would be helpful. Thanks.","Jim Risoleo","Yes. I'd tell you -- I mentioned the number for 2020. We're seeing total group revenue pace up 5.4% for 2020. For 2023, the numbers are up approximately 2%, but it's really a little bit early to start thinking about any years beyond 2020.","Michael Bluhm","And Shaun the only thing I would add there is that for how the year shape up in 2020, we've got almost 60% of the room rents on the books already.","Shaun Kelley","Great. Thank you, both.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Woronka, Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Hey, good morning guys. I wanted to ask about margins and you've got through a lot of color on some of the things that were impacting you this year between the renovations and the out of room spend. But as we look forward and in consideration to the fact that the performance guarantees ultimately burn off, is there anything secular that has changed in terms of the margin structure at the hotels? So, in other words if we enter a softer patch, do you think margins hold up better this time, or is there something tangible that you can point to that's hotels now that maybe wasn't there last time?","Michael Bluhm","Look I think as far with -- I think we've all learned a lot to the last recession about sort of really deploying resources quickly to adapt to changing fundamentals. I mean I think you saw that this quarter. We talked about it. I mean as soon as we started think these things slow down, we are very front footed and putting together action plans particularly around employee management.","And as a result we're adding -- we were able to kind of adapt quickly. And when we sort of think about going is the extent of things are going to continue slowing down, we're going to be very quick to adapt.","I'll give you a fair amount of -- a fair amount of how you came out of this quarter. I mean we kind of get a little bit more granular. We saw really interesting productivity gains in both rooms and food and beverage which was again very much of it prescribed by our hotel managers and our asset managers working with our managers to work around scheduling and sort of employee management better.","I'm also very quick on inventory control around F&B and every facet really well and our cost of goods sold, cost structure and how that improved from last quarter. And look as we talked about last quarter, we did have a fair amount of gives and takes on the undistributed operating expense column whether with any due to related things or a lot coming out of the Starwood Marriott synergies that helped us enable to keep that below inflationary growth. And so what I think -- I think you're getting a feel for the way that we are approaching slowdowns and as you can expect sort of a similar proceeds until we slowdown any further.","Jim Risoleo","Yes, the only thing I would add Chris is that's changed and I think we're going to continue to see change in a positive way is technology. And our -- we embraced technology. We think we're on the forefront of technology working with our operators. That will allow us to continue to improve productivity going forward. So, I think that's only going to get better.","And I do believe that it's a new paradigm for the operating expense model in the world of hotels. Additionally, we are keenly focused on cost creep. It's so easy when times are good for the extra body here or the extra controllable whether it'd be in rooms or F&B to come back into the system. So, we're keeping a keen eye on all of that.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Robin Farley, UBS.","Robin Farley","Great. Thank you. My question is actually along similar lines that you were talking about. Just that you've done such a solid job of incremental things to offset the margin pressure that I'm just wondering what there might be sort of incremental in 2020.","And I know you're talking about sort of further productivity, but I was thinking specifically are there Starwood synergies that will be incremental in 2020 that aren't contributing in 2019 yet? Anything that doesn't sort of start to contribute till next year?","And then can you remind us the Marriott, I think you said it was $23 million of profit guarantees in 2019. And is that -- I'm sorry if I missed if you said that upper down next year versus the incremental amount of that in 2020? And then anything else sort of incremental to I believe the cost save this year will continue into next year but just thinking about anything incremental? Thanks.","Jim Risoleo","Yes. Robin, I'll start with our forecasted operating profit guarantee payments based on our anticipated construction spend next year for the transformational capital program. It's likely at this point that we're going to be circa $200 million plus or minus. We won't know until we get through the capital budgeting process, which is starting in earnest in the next week or two actually, but we won't be done with this until the end of the year.","Right now we would be looking at operating profit guarantees of $16 million again plus or minus. I don't want to give you a hard number because both of those numbers are subject to change, but just directionally that's kind of how we are seeing things. I think that as the Starwood acquisition gets fully integrated into the Marriott system that the focus is likely to change. Believe me, we're not going to take our eye off the cost side of it, but the focus is likely to change to yield index and improvements in the top-line we bought. We also see we think incremental benefits from the rollout of Marriott's enhanced reservation system going forward that's very early stages. So we are constantly looking at the next initiative that we can to drive top-line as well as bottom-line.","Robin Farley","And just to clarify the operating profit guarantee, $16 million plus or minus obviously not a firm number yet compares to the $23 million in 2019, but not all of that goes into the comp hotels. So is it possible that the amount that's applied or attributed to the comp hotel base is actually up next year or will it be...","Jim Risoleo","Now, we can get back to you on that one. I don't have the comp numbers in front of me right now for next year.","Robin Farley","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Thomas Allen, Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hey. Good morning. So couple of questions on RevPAR. First your -- and you just had answered me was that ADR is still growing and occupancy is down a lot. I think there are a lot of dynamics at play. So can you just talk about why that's happening?","Michael Bluhm","I'm sorry, Thomas. Could you repeat the question? Why...","Thomas Allen","When we look at first half RevPAR, right your occupancy is down a lot, but your ADR is up. I think there are a lot of dynamics that's driving that. But I just want to kind of hear from you why occupancy will be down and rate will be up?","Jim Risoleo","Well I think what has happened -- so let's take New York for a minute and just focus on that market. And then we can also talk about Seattle to say it's the same dynamic, but it's slightly different. Both of those markets have a lot of new supply. New York's new supply is I think it will be our forecast 28,000 rooms coming online this year \u2013 28,000 29,000 rooms. Seattle just had a 1,300 room hotel opened in downtown Seattle.","Seattle had less city-wides over the course of the year. So some of the lower-rated transient business did not show up in Seattle as well. And the same thing in New York, we saw lower-rated transient business not show up in New York. Both of those markets are driven by international inbound travel. We had seen a decline in international inbound travel from -- in particular from Canada and Mexico. And I think that's why you're seeing occupancy decline, but rates go up.","Thomas Allen","That's helpful. So two follow-up questions actually on the same topic. So first is can you quantify what international inbound travel is declining? And then second, just when you think about guidance and Michael in your prepared remarks you said that the midpoint of guidance implies that second half is in line with the first half like it feels like things have deteriorated in the past few months. And so are there things that are kind of supporting and that's adjusting for the Marriott renovation guarantees? Are there things that are supporting the second half from like a comparability standpoint or anything else that should kind of stabilize RevPAR versus continue to deteriorate? Thanks.","Jim Risoleo","With respect to international inbound Thomas -- very fine market obviously, but year-over-year according to the data from U.S. travel is flat.","Michael Bluhm","And then look Thomas as it relates to the forecast, I'll point you a couple of things. I mean, first of all, I'll start with it actually would be a record group room nights and we get 90% of our business -- we will give you the update on kind of how we're looking for 2019 and we get the 90% of the business on the books start there.","And second, we spend a lot of time with our properties in the past -- over the past month or so really understanding what they're seeing in the individual markets? What they're seeing within their comp set? And how they're competitively positioned? What they're and certainly what those markets individually are experiencing. As we talked about, New York and Seattle were big drivers of the quarter.","New York in particular, where I think, you get into sort of May. I think everyone was almost surprised by that market in particular. And so, as we thought about forecasting it was very much and sort of detailed bottoms-up analysis with our properties.","Very thoughtful about the direction that thing has been heading in the past, couple of months. We carried that direction forward, and -- but certainly did not bring it down further, assuming a further decline. Beyond the type of -- the type of that we've been experiencing over the past few months.","Again, I think we've seen from a lot of other companies as well, is getting the information we have in front of us today. And the outlook based on what we've seen over the past couple of months. And we shared that forward. And we think we were in pretty conservative in our outlook.","Thomas Allen","Excellent, thank you.","Michael Bluhm","Thank you, Shaun.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have no further questions in the queue. So I'd like to turn this conference, back to Mr. Risoleo, for any closing remarks.","Jim Risoleo","Thank you all for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and our 2019 outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our third quarter results, as well as providing you with more insight into how 2019 is progressing.","Have a great day. And a great rest of your summer.","Operator","Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll now conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your phone lines. And have a great, rest of the week. Thank you."],"11940":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","But before I turn the call over to Ed, and for the last time I'd like to remind everyone that at the beginning of 2013, we adopted calendar quarter reporting period. And to enable investors to better evaluate our performance, we have presented the fourth quarter 2012 RevPAR and certain historical results on a calendar quarter basis we call the 2012 as-adjusted-results. The following discussion of the fourth quarter operating performance will include a comparison between the three months of operations ended December 31. Now, here's Ed.","Ed Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report a positive fourth quarter and year for our company. Our results were driven by a combination of strong demand growth, which allowed us to drive rate in both our group and transient segments and excellent cost controls, which led to another year of strong and margin improvement.","Additionally we continued to make progress on several important company initiatives, including executing asset sale, completing acquisitions in target markets, and strengthening our industry leading balance sheet.","Before we get into the details, let's review our results for the quarter and the year. Comparable revenues increased 6% for the quarter and 4.9% for the full year. RevPAR for our comparable hotel on a constant currency basis increased 6.6% for the quarter and 5.8% for the full year. On a nominal basis comparable RevPAR increased 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 5.6% for the full year.","Our comparable domestic portfolio outperformed the industry RevPAR by a strong 140 basis points for the quarter and by 50 basis points for the full year, as our hotels continued to generate meaningful gains in market share. Strong growth in our group business led to increased banquet activity resulting in comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of 6.1% for the quarter.","Overall for the year, comparable F&B revenues increased 4%, driven primarily by 4.8% increase in catering activity. This improvement, combined with our strong rate performance, resulted in an increase in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin of 130 basis points for the fourth quarter and 100 basis points for the full year.","Adjusted EBITDA was $322 million for the quarter and $1.306 billion for the full year that represents a 9.7% increase over the prior year.","Our adjusted FFO for diluted share was $0.33 for the fourth quarter and $1.31 for the full year, which exceeded consensus estimate and reflects to more than 19% increase over 2012.","Throughout the course of the year we experienced favorable trends in our business mix, as room nights grew in our higher rated segments in broth transient and group.","In the fourth quarter, despite the government shutdown, we saw momentum pickup in our group business and we benefited from meaningful increases in our average rates in both our group and transient business.","Starting with our group business, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year with room nights growing more than 3.5%, driven by increases in our higher-rated association and corporate business. Group business continue to benefit from positive mix shift as demands in our corporate and association business increased nearly 7%, while discount demand fell more than 5%. The favorable mix shift resulted in an increase in our group room rate of nearly 3% for the quarter, which when combined with the strong demand growth, resulted in group revenue increase of 6.5%, which we believe significantly outpace the industry.","For the year, group rate was up nearly 3%, while demand was flat, resulting in an increase in group revenues of over 2.5%.","We believe that the combination of the sequester and government shutdown reduced our group demand for the year by 1% to 1.5%. We expect the group business momentum we saw in the fourth quarter will continue into 2014, as demand should benefit from less government uncertainty and continued economic improvement.","Looking at our transient business, in the quarter we benefited from strong demand in our higher-rated retail and corporate business, which increased more than 6.5%. This combined with the previously mentioned strength in our group business, allows hotels to rely less on discounted transient business and help drive rate across all segments.","For the quarter, we saw an average rate increase of 4%, and revenue growth of 7%. These same favorable trends played out over the course of 2013 as our higher-priced transient business saw demand increase of 9%. Our overall transient average rate growth equals 4% and our revenues increased 7.5%.","Group revenues booked in the fourth quarter for 2014 and 2015 exceeded the prior year's strong pace, and for 2014 our group booking pace is up 3% in room nights with average rates projected to be up in every quarter. More than 70% of our expected group rooms for the year have been booked. Revenue for the year up more than 5.5% and we expect a solid year from our group segments.","It is worth noting that while we have enjoyed four solid years of growth, since the 2008\/2009 downturn, we believe that we have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow earnings and values. A few points of comparison. For our comparable hotels 2013 RevPAR was just 2% behind the 2007 peak, but on an inflation adjusted basis we're still approximately 15% behind 2007 levels. While our overall occupancy of 76% in 2013 exceeded our 2007 peak, our portfolio ran at higher than 78% in 1999 and 2000, which suggest that we could expect further improvements in occupancy.","Despite our strong fourth quarter, our group business and our food and beverage revenues are still roughly 10% behind our 2007 levels, suggesting that we have significant room for further growth as the group segment continues to recover and our strategy to improve outward performance bears further fruit.","Our 2013 adjusted margins are roughly 300 basis points behind 2007 levels, and we see no reason given the operating improvements we have implemented, why we can't exceed those levels in the future.","Overall our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit is approximately 15% behind its last peak performance without taking inflation into account. We would expect to eliminate that gap over the next two years.","Supply in the industry is expected to fall short of the long-term average for at least the near term. Supply in the upper price points in our target markets, other than in New York is even more constrained. Continued growth in the economy, accelerating capital investment, and continued growth in international travel, should lead to revenue growth that comfortably exceeds inflation and the long-term averages. We believe the result should be improved asset and company valuations in our industry.","Turning to investment activity, in November 2013 we opened 255-room Hyatt Place in Downtown Nashville, which was developed through a 50\/50 joint venture with White Lodging Services. Since the opening, the hotel had a fantastic start with operations significantly outperforming its budget and underwriting.","On the investment front, as we announced this morning we acquired the 151-room Powell Hotel in San Francisco, along with over 8500 square feet of retail space anchored by Sephora for a total price of $75 million. That price includes an estimated value of approximately $42 million for the retail space. The hotel is located in the city's premier shopping district near the Moscone Convention Center and is in close proximity to the South Street BART station and cable car line. Kokua Hospitality will manage the hotel and will work with us to complete a $22 million renovation for reopening its upper upscale property. When completed we expect our total investment in the hotel portion of the building to be approximately $365,000 a key and I note that that value includes the value of the land that we purchased.","Including the Powell Hotel we invested $340 million in acquisitions in 2013. With continued improvement in the outlook for the economy and the capital markets, the transaction market for dispositions improved in the fourth quarter, including the sales of Philadelphia Convention Center in Courtyard, Nashville, we closed on six asset sales in the last four months, five in North America and one in Europe for approximately $540 million. These transactions reduced our exposure to non-target markets and allowed us to reduce our leverage and improve our overall cost of capital.","We expect to be active on both the acquisition and disposition front in 2013, as we look to increase our investment in target markets and remain focused on reducing our exposure to non-core hotels located in suburban airport locations and on reducing our portfolio allocation to secondary markets.","While we have active pipelines for both sales and acquisition, given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any acquisitions, nor does it assume the impact of any sales beyond the transactions we have already closed. In addition to transaction activity, we will continue to look to invest in income generating additions to our portfolio, which typically drive returns well in access of our cost of capital.","For 2013, we invested a total of $97 million in these types of projects and in 2014; we expect to spend $70 million to $80 million, including the completion of a $17 million brand conversion at the Sheraton Memphis Downtown, and a $40 million repositioning plan to Houston Airport Marriott. Additionally, in 2014, we expect to spend $30 million to $35 million on recent acquisition assets and $320 million to $340 million on routine renewal and replacement expenditure.","Now let me elaborate on our outlook for 2014. As I discussed earlier, we anticipate that hotel demand will continue to grow in 2014 driven by improved economic output and consumer confidence, increased employment, and greater business investment. We also expect the group demand growth will exceed last year's levels. The increased demand combined with low supply growth should enhance efforts to drive both rate and profit margin.","With all this in mind, we're expecting comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant currency basis to increase 5% to 6% for the year, and while F&B activity is often volatile and difficult to predict, we are expecting comparable food and beverage and other revenue growth to 3% to 4%. We expect adjusted margins to be up 60 to 110 basis points. This operating forecast will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.350 billion to $1.390 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.40 to $1.44.","With respect to our dividend it is worth noting that our 2013 dividend increased more than 50% compared to 2012. Today, we announced that our first quarter common dividend will be $0.14 a share, which represents our 13th consecutive increase. Dividends for the rest of the year will depend on operating results as well as gains on asset sales.","I'm pleased to say that the lodging recovery is progressing well due to continued demand increases combined with low supply growth. Given a positive industry outlook and strong underlying economic fundamentals, we believe this cycle will continue to gain momentum throughout 2014. The capital we have invested in our hotels over the last several years ensures that our portfolio is in excellent condition and is well-positioned to benefit from this improving marketplace.","As Greg will describe in more detail, our industry leading balance sheet is only getting stronger and our cost of capital remains quite attractive. As we look at all of these factors, it gives us confidence that Host is well-positioned to outperform in 2014.","Thank you. And now, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Greg Larson","Thank you, Ed. As you have already noticed we've made some changes to our press release this quarter. In our effort to provide greater clarity on our operations, we have replaced the regional RevPAR results with RevPAR results primarily based on cities. In addition, we added a comparable hotel RevPAR in local currency defined as hotel RevPAR and constant currency. This new presentation will enable investors to evaluate the performance of both our domestic and international hotel without the impact of currency fluctuation, a constant currency methodology as was described in the notes to the financial information in our press release.","With that let me begin by counting our impressive fourth quarter results, despite the negative impact with the government shutdown in October, we had our strongest quarterly RevPAR performance of the year. Our comparable domestic portfolio of RevPAR increased 6.5%, which was 140 basis points over the industry performance.","And our consolidated international portfolio of RevPAR increased 7.2% in constant currency, resulting in total comparable RevPAR increase of 6.6%. The outstanding results for the fourth quarter were driven by strong performance in our group business. As we have stated in the past, when group business performs, our portfolio outperforms.","Moving to our detailed RevPAR results, our West Coast properties once again had very strong results with RevPAR growth of 8.1%, driven primarily by an average rate increase of 5.6%. The San Francisco market grew fourth quarter RevPAR by 14% with all five Bay Area hotels achieving double-digit RevPAR growth. This RevPAR increase was driven almost entirely by 13.7% increase in average rates, which resulted from the continued business mix shift from contract to higher-rated transient in group business.","RevPAR at our San Diego hotels grew 10% in the fourth quarter, primarily through occupancy gains of 4.6 percentage points driven by strong group and transient demand. Our San Diego hotels RevPAR growth more than tripled thus far upper upscale market growth of 3.1%. In addition, due to the strong growth production in the fourth quarter, our San Diego hotels also had strong food and beverage revenue growth of 11.6%.","In Hawaii, RevPAR growth of 2.5% was impacted by a decline in occupancy of 430 basis points due the renovation and the timeshare construction at the Hyatt Hotel in Muai. However the Hyatt Hotel benefited from average rate gains of 8.2% from stronger group demand that boosted both group and transient rate in the fourth quarter. We expect the West Coast property to continue to outperform in 2014, particularly in San Francisco, Seattle, and Hawaii. We expect San Diego and Los Angeles to perform in line with the portfolio in 2014.","Our properties in our Southwest location also had an impressive fourth quarter, with a combined increased in RevPAR of 16%. Our New Orleans hotel benefited from three strong high-rated medical citywide events in the fourth quarter that resulted in a RevPAR increase of nearly 22%, largely due to a 20.5% increase in ADR. Houston once again significantly outperformed the portfolio growing RevPAR 14.3% in line with the 13.5% improvement for the first three quarters, offsetting a slight decline in occupancy; the four Houston hotels grew average rates by combined 15.7%.","Both San Antonio properties also outperformed in the fourth quarter, with RevPAR increase of 12.5%, both hotels had strong groups of action, with higher group ADR, which allowed our operators to change the transient mix, which resulted in better average rates. For 2014 we expect RevPAR for JW Houston and the Houston Airport hotels to be negatively impacted by the renovations scheduled in the second half of 2014.","In the east, RevPAR growth of 5.6% was driven by strong results in Philadelphia and Boston, offset by weaker results in New York, and Washington D.C. Our hotels of Philadelphia posted RevPAR gains of 16.9% in the fourth quarter, with a 12.3% increase in demand, as the hotels benefit from year-over-year comparisons due to hurricane impacted fourth quarter of 2012.","Boston had strong RevPAR growth of almost 11% due to the major league baseball playoffs in October, as well as the positive year-over-year impact of Hurricane Sandy. The RevPAR increase for the Boston property consisted of a balanced mix of increases in both occupancy and rate.","Despite the increasing supply in the New York market, our New York hotels increased RevPAR by 3.9% in the fourth quarter in a market where RevPAR for the star upper upscale segment was negative 0.1%.","The hotels in Manhattan reported very strong fourth quarter RevPAR growth of 4.6%.","Our Washington D.C. hotels grew RevPAR by 1.8%, identical to the growth achieved in the first three quarters, hampered primarily by the shutdown of the federal government in October, and ongoing effects of the sequester. Our comparable hotels in the downtown area increased RevPAR by 8.8% in the fourth quarter, offset by 6.5% decline at our hotels in the Virginia and Maryland suburbs.","We expect our hotels on the East Coast to underperform the portfolio in 2014 with weak Washington D.C. and Philadelphia market, offsetting the stronger results forecasted for Boston and New York. Despite the supply in New York, we expect our hotels there to outperform our portfolio in 2014 with the Super Bowl and other citywide events.","Our fourth quarter RevPAR for the consolidated international portfolio grew 7.2% in constant currency. Canadian hotels grew RevPAR by combined 7.5% led by ADR growth of 13.8% in Calgary. In Latin America RevPAR increased 7.1% driven by strong double-digit RevPAR growth at our JW Properties in Rio and Mexico City, offset by a small decline in the RevPAR at a two hotels in Chile. The Chilean hotels were impacted by labor strike in the country during the fourth quarter.","Asia-Pacific portfolio grew RevPAR 7% through solid transient occupancy growth in Melbourne. Our international hotels had a great quarter. However, due to the negative impact of the unfavorable exchange rate this quarter, our nominal comparable international hotel RevPAR grew only 0.9%.","The comparable hotel RevPAR for the European joint venture increased 5.1% for the quarter in constant euros. Group revenue outperformed our expectations in the fourth quarter. The improvement was driven by increases in both occupancy and rate due to large citywide events highlighted by the Climate Change Congress event in Warsaw.","Strong group demand at several of our hotels, including group business generated by the newly renovated meeting space at Westin, Madrid, and a \u20ac1 million wedding at Hotel Arts, Barcelona, drove an impressive 8.8% increase of banquet sales.","We expect European joint venture hotel RevPAR to increase from 2013 level, so we will continue to underperform our total portfolio in 2014. However, there are encouraging signs of economic improvement in Europe. The GDP forecast for the majority of the European economies have increased since October of 2013 and are all trending positively.","Our fourth quarter comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points due to a rate driven increase in RevPAR and strong food and beverage sales and flow-through. Our fourth quarter food and beverage flow-through was a strong 54.2%. This is the third best food and beverage flow-through since the beginning of the recovery in 2010.","Looking to 2014, while we believe there is still room for occupancy growth especially in our group business, we expect that RevPAR will continue to be driven primarily by rate growth in 2014, and should lead the solid room flow-through. However, certain savings realized in 2013 will likely be difficult to replicate in 2014 such as the decline in utility costs we reported in 2013 and savings related to certain sales and marketing cost. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 60 basis points at the low-end of the RevPAR range and increase 110 basis points at the high-end the range for 2014.","In analyzing our EBITDA growth for 2014, consideration should be given to the negative effect on EBITDA from asset sales and one-time transaction. Approximately $45 million of EBITDA was lost due to our recent sales of five properties. These sales include the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, and the Courtyard Nashville was sold in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, there was a $21 million one-time gain related to the Newport Beach land sale in 2013. The negative EBITDA impacts are partially offset by certain positive factors we are forecasting for 2014, such as the benefits received from the non-comparable renovation hotels at the Ritz-Carlton, Naples, and Orlando World Center, a completion and opening of a Hyatt Place in Nashville.","The full year impact from the acquisition of Hyatt Place, Waikiki, and the EBITDA derived from the Hyatt Muai timeshare sales. I should also note that that EBITDA generated from the Hyatt Muai timeshare sales will negatively impact the first three quarters of 2014, as revenues from the sales cannot be recognized until the units are completed and can be occupied, which will likely occur in December of 2014. Until that time sales and marketing expenses, which are estimated to be approximately $5 million per quarter, will negatively impact EBITDA for the first three quarters. For the full year, we estimate that the timeshare project will increase EBITDA by approximately $12 million.","At this point, we are forecasting approximately 21% of our full year EBITDA will be earned in the first quarter.","Shifting to our balance sheet. We achieved a one notch upgrade to BBB-flat from Standard & Poor's due in part to low leverage, balanced debt maturities, and large pool of unencumbered assets.","In the fourth quarter, we refinanced 5.55% $134 million mortgage loan on the Harbor Beach Marriot with a new 10-year loan at 4.75% and we paid the 8.5% $31 million mortgage loan on the Western Denver Downtown. Subsequent to year-end we redeemed the remaining $150 million of 6.75% Senior Q senior notes. Further we intend to repay the $300 million mortgage debt on the Ritz-Carlton Naples Resort and Spa in the Newport Beach Marriot when due on March 1, 2014 with available cash.","After adjusting for the transactions that occurred or plan to occur subsequent to year-end we have approximately $310 million of cash, $779 million of available capacity on our credit facility and a debt balance of approximately $4.1 billion with a weighted average debt maturity of six years.","2014 cash interest expense is forecasted to be approximately $195 million compared to cash interest expense of $282 million in 2013, and $401 million in 2007.","Our year-end leverage would be the lowest in the company's history, the best in the industry and a significant reduction from 2007. In addition our fixed charge coverage have also improved significantly with $1.54 billion decrease in debt and 105 basis point reduction in our average interest rate since 2007. Even with the significant leverage reduction, we have meaningfully increased FFO per share over the last three years, as our industry leading FFO CAGR for those three years was 21%.","In summary, we are excited with our fourth quarter results, as this was the best performing quarter for the year. We have the best balance sheet in the history of the company with the lowest leverage, the highest fixed charge coverage ratio, and the lowest annual cash interest expense resulting in meaningful cash flow.","We are very close to achieving our leverage target of three times and would expect to reach that goal in 2014. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll go first to Joshua Attie of Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citi","The RevPAR guidance of 5% to 6% is similar to what you did in 2013, and consensus expectations are for GDP to accelerate this year. Plus the government shutdown in October, it seems like it was a one-time negative event. How did you think about these things when you formulated guidance? And I mean, I don't mean to split hairs, but why did you decide not to make the high-end 7%, which would've implied some acceleration?","Ed Walter","You know, John, it's a good question and we certainly would agree with all of the positive points that you raised, which is certainly, it feels like a lot of the basic fundamentals of the economy are better this year and a lot of the disruption that we felt in 2013 from whether it was the sequester or the shutdown, well it would certainly appear at this point we're not going to see that reoccur in 2014.","I think what you're generally seeing here is that as we move later into the cycle, which is we feel good about the year. We're probably trying to be may be a hair on the conservative side. But I certainly agree with all the positive points that you raised and we'll sort of see how the year plays out and hopefully that allows to be more optimistic later in the year.","Joshua Attie - Citi","And one more question -- your guidance assumes other hotel revenue growth of 3% to 4% versus the RevPAR growth of 5% to 6%. And you mentioned group business is getting better. And in the fourth quarter, you saw that GAAP narrow where hotel revenue increased at the same rate as RevPAR. I know it's only one quarter, but do you not expect that trend to continue, or is there just not enough visibility at this point to factor it into guidance?","Ed Walter","I think what we have seen throughout this entire recovery is that other revenue line has wagged even with food and beverage line. So whereas I talked about food and beverage revenues being up roughly 10% to '07, we're up may be more in 15% to 20% range in the other revenue area. So we've been hopeful that that will start to accelerate in the improvement in group activity will help that because a chunk of that relates to spas and golf, and a lot of times those revenues are driven by enhanced group travel.","But generally it's been lagging as we've watched this recovery progress and so we've assumed that would continue to be a bit more modest. But again as we sort of, we commented and my comment even on the food and beverage side, these things have been difficult to forecast and we've been pleasantly surprised in a couple of quarters. But certainly there exist the opportunity to be pleasantly surprised on that front too.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Didora of Bank of America.","Andrew Didora - Bank of America","And Ed, certainly appreciate your commentary on the comparison to prior peak. Just wanted to ask a question with regards to if F&B revenues relative to prior peak. When you look at them on an occupied room night basis, how far off are they? And I guess when you think about next peak this cycle, what impediments do you see in terms of reaching prior peak on an F&B basis? And I guess do you think you can exceed those at some point later on this time around?","Ed Walter","I guess since occupancy -- I don't have that number clearly in my head but just thinking through the fact if we're off about 10% in revenues and we are up slightly in terms of occupied room nights, then I would suggest we're probably off slightly more than 10% in F&B activity per room night just sort of working through the math.","I would say -- I would expect that over the next few years we should certainly close that 10% gap. Some of that's going to be tied to how, what ultimately happens on the group side. We have been I think collectively as an industry a little disappointed with the recovery in group. We are certainly feeling better about it in looking at 2014. And so I think that gives us an opportunity to do better on that side.","But also note that well I don't know that this effort is yet significant in the context of looking it getting back to 2007 revenues. We are where we can looking to outsource restaurants to third parties. And so when that happens our profits go up but our revenue growth goes down because we no longer in some of those cases report the revenues. So that may be a bit of a drag as we look to get back to that overall revenue number, but it will certainly help on the profit side.","Andrew Didora - Bank of America","Great, that's helpful, Ed. And then Greg, you obviously have done a lot of work around the balance sheet over the last few years. And with your leverage coming down pretty close to your goal, how should we think about your balance sheet capacity going forward? Will we see more acquisitions, some buybacks, or do you kind of want to maintain those levels through the cycle peak?","Greg Larson","Yes, as we talked about in the past our ultimate goal though has been to push down to three times leverage and you can tell that subsequent, if you look at those transactions that we completed subsequent to the quarter end you should assume that we're fairly close to our goal. And so I think going forward, we would like to keep it three times leverage or may be a tab below. So I think when we look out into the future it's really going to depend on the opportunities. We see acquisitions, we're certainly -- we certainly have cash to pay for some of those acquisitions. Obviously if we continue to sell hotels which we think we will do we will have those proceeds through by assets as well.","And so when I think about 2014 it's really going to depend on the level of acquisitions and the level of disposition on what exactly happens to our balance sheet. But I think the ultimate goal for us is to keep at this three times leverage as we go forward.","Operator","We'll go next to Joe Greff of JPMorgan.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","I may have missed some of your comments, but, Ed, it sounded like you didn't spend too much time talking about the acquisition market. Can you give us your views on that? It certainly sounds like you're a little bit more of a net seller than a net acquirer. And then with respect to your group-based commentary, I think implicit from your comments is that pricing was up about 2.5%, if you can just confirm that? Thanks.","Ed Walter","Yes, I think last -- I'm going to do those questions in reverse order. I think last year our pricing was up just a hair over that. I think if you look for the full year we were -- our rate was probably up right around 2.7%, 2.8% so I think you're generally right there. As we look at this year we're sort of, we're hoping that we'll see some stronger growth in that but we're probably in that same range right now.","If you look at the acquisition markets, I think generally we've seen, we saw some -- we're seeing increased activity in the second half of '13. We were I'd say that's driven by a combination of capital continuing to be attracted to the sector because of a perception that we would share which is that the cycle has room to run. That capital is just not just an equity capital I think we've been finding that while debt terms are nowhere near what they were during the 2006\/2007 timeframe you are seeing leverage being extended at higher levels and at attractive rates. And so I think that's helping to improve the acquisition market at least from a seller's perspective.","We expect to continue to be active in the sales market this year and I'd like to have a reasonable level of activity there as we continue to try to reposition the portfolio about selling what we view as slightly slower growing assets out of the company. I'd like us to be a net acquirer this year. So I think from a -- the way we're looking at the world we'd like to be more the -- buy more than we sell. But it ultimately comes down to pricing and opportunity and if we find that we can hit the number on the sales side and we can't get to the number on the acquisition side then that may mean we end up being a net seller.","Operator","We'll go next to Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","A couple of questions. First of all, Ed, did I hear you correctly that you valued the retail component of the Powell at $42 million?","Ed Walter","That\u2019s correct.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's about $5000 a square foot for the retail component. What gives you confidence that the value of the retail is so high?","Ed Walter","I think the best thing I have is that this building was originally marketed to retail buyers, not necessarily to the hotel world. And as we went through our process, we wanted to really understand the value of the retail in terms of just making certain that we were comfortable with the price we were paying. We have already received unsolicited offers from more than that valuation since we've acquired the hotel. So no guarantee that they will close, but based on the market commentary we have this is apparently one of the four top locations in the country and it's a very special space from their perspective, they've renewed their lease, they're going to invest a significant amount of capital in the space. They couldn't be happier with their location and my sense is they're fairly happy with us buying the building. But well, I agree with you, that's a big number and we look pretty carefully at that the reality is there appears to be pretty good market support for it.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","Can you give us any indication what the rental payments with Sephora are or what the cap rate was on the retail component given that big number?","Ed Walter","Yes, I guess what I would tell you is that we can't disclose the -- we have agreed not to disclose any of the actual pricing there. But I would tell you that it's mid-single-digit cap rate.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","And then the second question -- and you gave some good color on how you're looking at the dividend right now. By my calculations, it sounds like around 1Q you're going to be close to that target three times leverage level. You're going to have over $500 million in cash probably still available on the balance sheet. What is the plan for that cash? And are there more assets that you're looking to dispose of drop them into the cycle? And if you do, what will be the plan for that cash, obviously, in excess of the required dividend from capital gains, et cetera?","Ed Walter","I think our answer to that is probably consistent with what we've said in the past, which is that we would as we continue to sell assets the first thing we will look at is what is the opportunity to reinvest that capital that will be either be in new acquisitions, it will be in ROI investments in our existing portfolio. I think you're right it will be given where we've been -- well things we've been accomplishing on the leverage side there is less likelihood that it would be deployed to pay down debt, although remember when you're selling assets there is something that you're trying -- you do need to maintain leverage their it's not -- there's a little bit of adjustment that's required there.","And I think beyond that you look at what's the smartest thing from a shareholder perspective. So that could be a bigger dividend in a lot of cases, because we will be selling at gains, there will be a need to increase the dividend, because there will be taxable income associated with that sale. And obviously depending upon what the stock price is buying back stock is another option. So I think we'll ultimately look as we have in the past because as we generate those proceeds from sales and recognize sort of what amount of that is available to us that's outside of a dividend or a required debt pay down, we will look to see what's the best use of that capital and then used to do that.","Greg Larson","Ryan, I think the good news is right when you look at the cash balance of $310 million, you add in sort of the cash flow that's going to be generated by operation and then you add in some of the assets that you can sell that we can acquire a significant chunk of assets this year and not need to issue equity.","Operator","We'll go next to Harry Curtis of Nomura.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Hello?","Ed Walter","Hello. Hi, Harry.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Well, hey, sorry, I must have been on mute. Ed, going back to your answer to the first question, you commented that you were being conservative perhaps because we were later in the cycle. As far as it comes to buying assets, I guess the question is when is the wrong time to buy assets? And the reason I'm curious is that when I look at host stock versus some of the C Corps, the stock is underperformed. And I'm wondering if it's underperformed because you're really not returning as much cash to the shareholder as you might be.","Ed Walter","I can't say Harry that I have necessarily looked at, I think at that particular question related to the C Corps. As I have looked at how we have compared to the rest of the hotel REITs, I mean one of the things we consistently noticed is that we've been doing a better job at generating FFO growth, and Greg spoke to that at the same time that we've been seeking to accomplish our goals on the balance sheet side, which we think in the long-term were very beneficial for the company.","And I think our dividend is growing, it went up a lot from '12 to '13, and the fact that we have announced another increase and it will continue to growth at a relatively sizable rate, we were probably running, I guess at this current level just right around 3% in terms of the yield and I don't see any reason as the cycle progresses that we won't continue to see the dividend grow. So to the extent that that's been one of the issues, we're going to be feeding into the solution, because I would be expecting our dividend to continue to grow.","Harry Curtis - Nomura","Then back to the first question or first part of the question, is there a point in time when you and your Board feel a bit more defensive about making acquisitions, given where you guys feel we are in the cycle?","Ed Walter","Yes, I think there is and I think we sort of saw this, it happened in the last cycle, although this case it is probably a little bit different. I mean at the point in time, we've been pretty disciplined about what we thought. I -- in some way wished we had been able to acquire more in the last four years but we've been pretty thoughtful and careful about making certain investment. When we make an investment it's actually going to accomplish the recurrent goals that we have as opposed to just seeking to add size because obviously we already have a pretty good size.","So when we find that the market starts to get to be too pricy for us to hit our return target, which are generally going to be 100 to -- regular asset a 100 basis points to 150 basis points over our cost of capital then we tend to naturally back away from acquiring assets. When we're looking at that -- looking and trying to establish what the return is going to be from an investment we're also going to be taking into account where we're in this cycle and more particularly, where that individual market is in the cycle. So as you start to get to the point where supply is increasing and you begin to get concerned that that's going to exceed demand growth in a particular market that will naturally make us more cautious in our underwriting, which I think often times will have the effect of making us less competitive since others may not do that.","And we're -- as I think was part of my prepared remarks, right now we don't see that situation existing in any market other than New York where supply seems to be growing even at the -- New York is the only market that's got a high level of supply. Just about everywhere else, especially in the markets that we're looking at and especially in the price point where we tend to compete and tend to acquire, we feel very good about the overall supply demand equation.","So I think there is a point down the road just as in every cycle and is in every real estate cycle we will find that supply will start to exceed demand and that all end up, we'll have to be thoughtful about that in our underwriting and I suspect that if that happens you will see that we will just not be buying anything.","Operator","We'll go next to Nikhil Bhalla of FBR & Company.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR & Company","Ed, you talked about dispositions this year. Should we assume that a level of dispositions in 2014 mirror very closely to 2013, or do you have sort of a higher target? Any color you can provide there?","Ed Walter","We don't have a hard target and it wouldn't surprise me if we didn't end up in the sort of a level that we've been over the last couple of years. I think we've sold a little over about a $1.1 billion in '12 and '13 so that's an average of 550 a year. So that type of a number is not -- would certainly make sense from our perspective but it would be early right now to kind of commit to any particular number and a lot of that has been -- is all predicated on pricing, just as we try to be disciplined about what we buy, we're also fairly disciplined about what we sell.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR & Company","Sure thing. One follow-up question on RevPAR guidance that you've given here. When you think about quarters, do you suspect 1Q may be is at the low-end of that guidance range? If you could give us some color about the cadence of RevPAR growth this year, that would be very helpful.","Ed Walter","We actually -- certainly at the beginning of this year, we were actually looking that Q1 as being one of the stronger quarters of the year. And I think that's despite the fact that we knew we wouldn't get the benefit of inauguration activity in Washington, we were looking at both the benefits of the Super Bowl in New York as well as the fact that in the last week of March we would have a normal week from our perspective from group activity compared to an Easter week that we had last year.","We've obviously had a spare amount of weather especially in the Northeast and to some degree in the Southeast and so I think that's tampered our expectations a bit. Having said that though, and this is without knowing exactly how bad last week was but knowing that it wasn't great we still would expect that the first quarter would actually be as -- would -- if we were ranking the quarters we would still expect that to be at the high-end of the range that we talked about for the full year.","Operator","We'll go next to Ian Weissman of ISI Group.","Ian Weissman - ISI Group","Most of my questions have been answered, but just a quick question as it relates to deals. Jon Gray recently said that he has seen better opportunities in Europe than he has in the United States. I know you guys are active over there, and you've commented in the past about opportunities. I think you noted that the bid ask spread was built pretty wide in Europe. May be you could just comment about what the landscape looks like in Europe today given their recovery versus United States.","Ed Walter","Ian it's a great question because that is one of the places where we hope to be more active this year. Last year we purchased the one hotel in Stockholm. But as we look at Europe, while recovery there is still slow and certainly not progressing at the same pace that we hope to benefit from in United States in 2014, we do have a sense that the continent turned the corner and consequently in our discussions with our partners we are first need to finish investing the second fund that we had created, which I think has about a little over 100 million in euros of capital to invest.","But I think we're open to the notion of potentially doing a fund three years certainly or potentially investing on our own if necessary to try to do, have more activity in Europe. We see opportunity there. We do not see as much competition. We've never seen as much competition on the asset management side and consequently we think there's an opportunity to invest there.","Ian Weissman - ISI Group","Would you include London in that, I mean when you think about Europe and opportunities, is London part of that focus?","Ed Walter","We would like to buy more in London, but if I were to broadly characterize Europe and say that it is, there's not a lot of competition. I'd unfortunately need to leave London out of that characterization. London has seen some pretty aggressive pricing and we have looked at a couple of these transactions that have been on the market and have really not gotten comfortable paying the prices that we see there.","So we would -- probably -- we actually, the more we get -- the more we study the Nordics, the more interested we've gotten there. We're certainly still interested investing in Germany and we may even likely look at some smaller opportunities in Spain only because we're seeing some signs that some of the markets in Spain are recovering and it may make sense to be set back into those markets.","Ian Weissman - ISI Group","And finally -- if I missed this I apologize. But in your comments, you seem pretty bullish on New York City, which is counter to what everyone is saying in light of the supply, which you even talked about. Super Bowl I know was not great; it's not a big group market. So what are some of the core drivers of your optimism as it relates to New York City?","Greg Larson","Ian, this is Greg. We mentioned that we, yes we think New York will perform sort of better than the average of our portfolio. I mean part of that is because of the strong results from the Super Bowl. Part of it is, I agree with your comment on city wise but we do have some strong group activity for our hotels especially in 2014 already on the books. And then, as you know, the last couple of years we fully renovated all, most of our New York properties. And so they're all in great condition and I think ready to outperform New York in general just like they did in the fourth quarter.","Ed Walter","Ian, I'd add to that as Greg's point about the construction is that our Sheraton had its meeting space out of service for the first quarter of last year, and the W on Lexington was going through a pretty invasive HVAC renovation for the first five months -- five or six months of 2013. So we are getting the benefit there of overlapping a weaker time period.","Operator","We'll go next to Chris Woronka of Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","Just a quick question, drill down a little bit further on the groups if I could. Did you guys notice a change in kind of some of the booking behaviors in the fourth quarter? It sounds like what we saw in the first half, group didn't really come through quite as strongly as you guys and everyone else thought. Did something change there in the fourth quarter and that's may be giving you the optimism for 2014?","Ed Walter","Yes, I'd say fourth quarter was obviously great for us from a standpoint of group room night. As you look at the booking activity during the course of the quarter, it was incredibly inconsistent at least kind of compared to prior year metrics. You had good months, you had lousy months. Net, net overall as I said in my comments when you step back and look at the revenues that we booked in the fourth quarter for 2014 and for 2015, we were up compared to the prior year. So we take some comfort from all that in terms of looking at the direction of group business for 2014.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","And then just kind of going in a different direction. Could you guys may be give us an update on where you are in terms of some of the management contracts? And are you seeing any opportunities to -- are any of these things coming up, and may be there's an opportunity where you renegotiate or re-flag? Just an update on the portfolio generally.","Ed Walter","Yes, I guess I'd it's probably the most interesting opportunity for us that falls into that bucket is the Four Seasons in Philadelphia. And you may have noticed that Four Seasons have announced that they're going to be part of the development that's tied in with Comcast Communications building -- new building that they're going to create in Downtown Philadelphia and Four Seasons has decided to move to a smaller platform in Philadelphia. But we have certainly enjoyed our association and relationship with Four Seasons. We view this as a very interesting opportunity to take what is really one of the classic hotels in Philadelphia. As the timing happens to be quite good for us and that we're envisioning a significant capital investment in the hotel. We've been planning to reorient the food and beverage at the hotel.","And so we have the opportunity to do that and where we will not have to do it at the Four Seasons, but have the opportunity to look at other brands or look at an unbranded hotel, fairly exciting opportunity for us. And I think that's something that we're going to be working on over the course of the year. I'm sure we'll have more to say about that in the second half of this year and sometime early next year.","Greg Larson","I think Chris, I'd add also that if you probably know we also have a pool of Marriott property and start with properties that over time we can convert those properties here to franchise or a fully unencumbered and sometimes we can do that either today or we can do it upon sales. So those are also interesting opportunities and then as you sort of hinted to we always just have some contracts coming due or some flexibility on contracts for other reasons. So obviously we look at all of those ground.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","Okay, but nothing is really in the guidance, right, related to that?","Ed Walter","No, there was nothing that would be impactful to that EBITDA number that flows from that.","Operator","We'll go next to Wes Golladay of RBC Capital Markets","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","I'm just curious about how you see the Marriott Marquis opening in D.C. impacting the second half of the year?","Ed Walter","Yes, it's a great question. We assume that it's going to be a negative impact on the second half of the year. I mean, the convention business in D.C. is not slated to start to accelerate in response to the Marquis until '15 and '16. So since as we've watched that hotels progress we not have felt that it would be a long-term benefit to the city but we do not think it's going to be a benefit to us in 2014. Thus it appears as there was a quite not enough confidence in the group segment or the association group segment a few years ago to book an event into D.C. without really being -- them being really confident that the hotel would be finished.","And we're not real close to the construction schedule for that and my sense is that it is going to finish generally on time in the middle of the year. And so given that well I'm sure Marriott has actively trying to book business into the hotel. It's going to be competing in a market that is since being left in there than it's normally accustomed to. So it won't be a positive impact.","Well we have captured that in the investments we've made in the district and it has always believed that that was the likely result and certainly it is captured in our outlook for Washington for this year and the guidance we discussed before.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","And real quick on the -- you mentioned potentially doing a European fund three. And I was just curious what is the fee income you guys generate from funds one and two, approximately?","Ed Walter","Greg, do you know that?","Greg Larson","Yes, I think we're not supposed to disclose the fees from that. So I don't know that number off the top my head.","Operator","At this time I will now to turn the call back over to Mr. Walter for any closing comments.","Ed Walter","Well thank you all for joining us on this call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our results and outlook with you.","As you may have heard, we are planning an Investor Day for April 10 at our Ritz-Carlton in Tysons Corner, Virginia. We view that as an opportunity for you to learn more and hear more from our executive management team about how we look to create value for our shareholders. Invitations and additional information will be coming out soon. We hope to see you at our Investor Day then. Thank you for your time.

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second-quarter 2016 earnings call.","Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results.

Following their remarks, we will be unavailable to respond to your questions. And now I would like to turn the call over to Ed.","Ed Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. As you may surmise from our results, it was an interesting quarter. While the operating environment across our industry was a bit choppy, we executed as planned on the dispositions we have previously referenced and added two more planned sales. On the investment side, we acquired an irreplaceable ground lease, completed several major ROI investments and continued to repurchase our stock, all with a focus on creating value for our shareholders.","Let's start with a review of our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was 436 million for the quarter which represents an increase of 3.3% over 2015 and with 782 million for the first half of the year up 5.2%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.49 per share, an increase of 6.5% for the quarter and $0.90 per share year-to-date, an increase of 11%. Overall we are pleased with our bottom line EBITDA and FFO growth which generally met or exceeded both our expectations and consensus. But we were disappointed that our room revenue growth was not stronger. Our portfolio occupancy rate was 82.4%, an increase of 120 basis points compared to 2015. Constant currency RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter as rate growth was difficult to generate. This RevPAR result was well below what we had anticipated in April.","We expected that we would benefit from strong group bookings and that generally proved to be correct as group room nights increased 3% due to more than a 6.5% growth in our association segment and a very solid increase in corporate group. Our average group rate was up more than 2% leading to a revenue improvement in group of more than 5%. While it certainly qualifies as a strong group quarter, it is worth noting that short term group bookings declined to the three year average level falling short of last year's accelerated pace and we did experience a slight increase in cancellations.","However, our transient segment fell meaningfully short of our expectations. Overall transient room nights declined by 1% as corporate demand proved soft. This resulted in the hotels being forced to target price sensitive leisure business and government business with the latter segment up nearly 7%. The net result of this mix shift was our average transient rate fell slightly and transient revenues declined by slightly more than 1%. To help offset this transient softness, we increased our contract room nights by more than 20%.","Declining international demand was also a drag on our transient demand. While difficult to precisely calculate, our international business which represents slightly more than 10% of our total room nights decreased approximately 7% in the quarter further undermining our manager's efforts to drive transient rate. Fortunately a combination of strong group business and catering activity led to a 6.6% increase in banquet and AV revenue which enabled the portfolio to achieve food and beverage revenue growth of 4.5%.","Sales per group room night jumped more than 4% which is one of our stronger quarters during this cycle and a good indication that groups are still prepared to spend freely on events. Since nearly all of the F&B revenue growth came from the profitable catering business, the flow-through was quite strong at north of 70%. Other revenues at our comparable hotels grew 4.6% as spa revenues improved and we experienced an increase in attrition and cancellation fees which are now running slightly ahead of what we experienced in the last two years. The flow through in this area was also quite strong.","The solid flow through in all segments of our business combined with the benefits of various asset management initiatives and property investments, which Greg will discuss in more detail, led to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 65 basis points and EBITDA flow through of more than 50%. As a result, comparable hotel EBITDA improved by roughly 5%.","Year to date, our transient contract revenues have increased 3.3% and our group revenues have improved by 3.1%. Comparable F&B revenues have increased 2.8% driven by banquet and AV increase of 3.7%. Total comparable revenues have increased 2.9% and comparable EBITDA margins have increased 75 basis points leading to EBITDA improvement year to date of 5.7%.","Turning to asset sales, as I referenced at the outset, we continue to make solid progress in our non core asset disposition program. Closing the sales of the Atlanta Perimeter, Seattle SeaTac and Manhattan Beach Marriott as well as our two hotels located in Chile. The three US assets represented older hotels located in airport or suburban locations that we felt would likely not grow cash flows over the long term at the rate of our overall portfolio. These sales, plus the two Christchurch New Zealand hotels that we noted are under binding contract bring our total sales for the year to roughly $500 million. It is worth noting that the EBITDA we are receiving in 2016 from these assets totaled $13 million which should not be included in any of your 2017 estimates.","While we continue to market several hotels, the buyer pool has declined in size and pricing is not as attractive as when we commenced our sale program a few years ago. While we do expect to complete additional sales, we are only a seller if we can achieve acceptable pricing.","During the last 3.5 years, we have sold more than $2.6 billion worth of hotels or nearly 15% of our consolidated and joint venture portfolio, which has enabled us to further refine our asset base and improve shareholder value. We are very comfortable with our overall progress on this front.","Looking at investments, we are very pleased to have acquired the ground leases that sit beneath the Key Bridge Marriott. The second Marriott Hotel to be constructed, this property is situated in Arlington, Virginia at the end of the Key Bridge which provides direct access to Georgetown and has spectacular views of Washington and all of the national monuments. We are in the midst of evaluating the various options for this site and hotel which will clearly include alternate uses, and we look forward to providing updates on this exciting project in the future.","We have also completed the redevelopment of the Hyatt San Francisco Airport and the new 152,000 square foot ballroom and exhibit hall complex at the San Diego Marquis. Both of these projects were completed on time and under budget. In addition to renovating all of the rooms and meeting spaces at the Hyatt, we also completed 9,000 square feet of new meeting space and totally transformed the atrium and F&B platform. Our group bookings for this hotel for the next two years are 35% ahead of the pre-construction levels. We also expect to have a very strong fall operating season. At the San Diego Marquis, we have created the best combination of ballroom and exhibit space in the market and customers are responding favorably as bookings through the next two years have increased 40% compared to pre-construction levels.","As the second quarter proved, it is challenging to develop guidance during interesting times for the industry. The following factors provide some insight into our thinking about the second half of 2016. Based on consensus economic forecasts and general uncertainty around the U.S. election and international events, we expect that business profit growth and investment levels will not improve, which suggests that business transient demand will remain soft. Alternatively, continued strong employment and consumer confidence numbers suggests that leisure demand will remain solid.","We expect international travel patterns will remain challenged as demand from two of our largest international markets, Canada and Latin America, are impacted by both the strong U.S. dollar and weaker domestic economic growth. Our group revenue pace for the remainder of the year is up more than 4% with the majority of the increase occurring in the third quarter. While we would expect some moderation in the overall increase in our group segment, this compares favorably to the actual improvement we experienced in the first half of the year. Q3 will benefit from the calendar shift of the Jewish holidays into October, while the fourth quarter will be hurt by both that shift and less travel expected during the week that includes Election Day.","The combination of all of these factors suggests that RevPAR growth and the second half of the year will generally match what we experienced in Q2 with the third quarter considerably stronger and the fourth quarter somewhat weaker. As a result, we anticipate full year RevPAR will range from 2% to 3%. We expect F&B and other revenue growth will moderate slightly from the first-half growth of 2.8% and still generate increased profits over 2015.","The combination of solid flow through from all revenue generating activities, continued benefit from our asset management efforts and the strong start to the year is expected to lead to comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 40 to 70 basis points. The net result of these factors is an estimated range for an adjusted EBITDA of $1.435 billion to $1.465 billion which reflects a reduction at the midpoint of $7.5 million from our prior range. $1.5 million of this adjustment is tied to the sale of the two Christchurch hotels I referenced earlier and the remainder is due to the reduction in our estimated topline growth partially offset by improving margins. Our forecasted adjusted FFO range is $1.63 to $1.67. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Greg Larson","Thank you, Ed. I will start with specific commentary on performance within some of our major markets. RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles continued to outperform the portfolio with an impressive 9.1% increase in the second quarter. The results were driven by a 5% increase in ADR and a 3 percentage point increase in occupancy to 84.2%. A strong group base combined with solid transient demand at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase which exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 140 basis points.","Looking forward, our booking pace in Los Angeles remains very strong as the market is expected to host additional citywides during the remainder of this year. As a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties. Our two comparable hotels in Denver grew RevPAR 7.3% this quarter and outpaced the STAR upper upscale result by 260 basis points. Strong group and transient demand at the Westin primarily drove this outperformance. However, based on the softening of citywide pace and decreasing size of events, we expect our hotels in Denver to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 6.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.2% and occupancy increase of 2.6 percentage points. Once again a number of citywide events in the second quarter contributed to the outperformance.","Based on group revenues on the books for the remainder of the year, we expect third quarter results to be better than the fourth quarter. RevPAR growth of 5.5% at our DC hotels significantly outperformed the STAR upper upscale RevPAR increase by 230 basis points. This was driven by both occupancy and rate this quarter as occupancy increased 2.2 percentage points and average rate grew 2.9%. Several of our DC hotels benefited from planned renovations that we completed last year. Based on group booking pace for these hotels, we expect our properties in DC to achieve solid results in the third quarter.","Our Boston hotels RevPAR growth of 5% in the second quarter was driven by a rate increase of 2.2% and an occupancy improvement of 2.3 percentage points. Our manager's aggressive strategies to offer promotions and add high-end airline crews bolstered the RevPAR increase this quarter. These hotels also had an impressive increase in food and beverage revenues of 15.8% entirely from the increase in the more profitable banquet and catering sales. Overall, our Boston properties are experiencing softer special corporate demand from the financial and consulting segments. As a result, we expect RevPAR to underperform the rest of our portfolio in the third quarter.","RevPAR at San Francisco hotels grew 2.8% primarily driven by a rate increase of 2.9%. Overall transient demand softness and group room night declined due to the Moscone Center Convention construction led to demand weakness this quarter. However, strong catering business at several San Francisco hotels drove the outstanding banquet and catering revenue growth of over 33% this quarter. The expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will continue to negatively impact the San Francisco market for the remainder of 2016 and through 2017. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.","Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4.9% but outperformed the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR decline of 6%. Occupancy dropped slightly to 89.8% and rate declined 4.8% in the second quarter. Supply continues to outpace demand which is impacting our ability to drive rate. We have also witnessed European travel and tour business declining due to the strong U.S. dollar. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect our hotels in New York to continue to have negative RevPAR for the remainder of the year. As anticipated, our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR decrease of 2.2% in the second quarter. Occupancy declined 2 percentage points and rate increased 0.4%. The decline in RevPAR was due to softer leisure transient demand as well as increased group attrition and cancellations.","On a positive note, group customers increased their food and beverage spent in the more profitable banquet and catering business by 15.8%. In addition, based on a strong group revenue pace for the third quarter, we expect RevPAR in Florida to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter. RevPAR at our assets in San Diego grew slightly this quarter. Occupancy declined 2.9 percentage points and rate increased 3.6%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by and an 8.6% decline in transient revenues resulting from fewer citywide compression nights from downtown. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market to improve in the second half of 2016 as the city should benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year especially in the third quarter. In addition, the new 152,000 square foot Marriott Hall opened in June 2016 at the San Diego Marquis.","Moving to our international assets, these hotels had a constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 5% primarily from continued pre-Olympic business in Rio. Due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, we expect Latin America to have a spectacular third quarter.","Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio was negatively impacted by a number of macro factors including the lingering effects of the Paris attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre and post-Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 1.3% in constant euros this quarter. As expected, our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio while our hotels in Spain, Stockholm and Amsterdam outperformed. We expect the challenges that I described for our hotels in Paris, London and Brussels will continue into the third quarter.","Moving to our profitability, our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 65 basis points in an environment with 2% RevPAR growth is very impressive. This notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of decreases in our utility and insurance expenses as well as our continued cost savings initiatives. Utility costs decreased almost 6% and insurance expense decreased 5.5% in the quarter. Utility costs continued to decline in the second quarter due to favorable gas and electric prices as well as the benefits from our cost saving energy ROI initiatives.","As we have said previously, we have invested in numerous energy projects over the last year ranging from small to major projects which are favorably impacting our utility costs.","Further in June, we completed our annual negotiation of our insurance contracts and lowered rates for another year. Therefore, we expect our insurance expense to continue to decrease for the remainder of the year and through the first half of 2017.","Over the last two years, we have focused on improving productivity at our hotels by initiating time and motion studies at our largest hotel. These studies resulted in hotel managers establishing tighter labor model standards and the use of improved and expanded forecasting tools allowing managers to effectively schedule to demand and minimize excess staffing. For example, many of our housekeeping departments are now using an automated system integrated with a property management system to prioritize housekeeping room assignments using a Wi-Fi enabled device. These systems save on time and labor expense while getting guests into rooms faster.","Total hourly productivity at our hotels that have implemented the recommendations improved over 400 basis points more than those hotels that have not yet conducted a time and motion study. For all the discussion of technology as a disruptor in the lodging space, we are seeing real cost saving benefits of technology in our industry and at our properties. In addition, sustainability initiatives that provide guests with the option to forgo housekeeping services in exchange for reward points, like Marriott's Your Room Your Choice, and Starwood's Make a Green Choice program are also positively impacting expenses.","Given the positive margin results in the first half of 2016, we now expect full-year comparable EBITDA margins to increase 40 to 70 basis points. We also expect approximately 22.5% to 23% of our total and adjusted EBITDA to be generated in the third quarter.","As disclosed in our press release, during the second quarter we repurchased 5.2 million shares at an average price of $15.39 for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 48.6 million main shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $838 million. We currently have $162 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.","In addition, we paid a regular second-quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share which represents a yield over 4.5% on the current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage and expect to continue benefiting from it going forward. We ended the second quarter with approximately $266 million of cash, $739 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility and $3.7 billion of debt. We improved our leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility to 2.6 times.","During the quarter, we repaid the $100 million mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston Hotel. We also think it is important to note that 95 of our hotels, which represent 99% of our revenues, are unencumbered by mortgage debt. In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve, as a result of our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive market environment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many as you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hey Good morning, Ed, I wanted to ask you maybe a little bit more if you could share a little more color on the cancellations that you saw in the quarter and maybe through the balance of the year. It sounds like it was a little bit elevated in Florida. Do you see this as economic concerns, is it Zika concerns, if it Florida related? Maybe just a little more color around that would be good. Thanks.","Ed Walter","Yes, Smedes, that is a great question because we spent a fair amount of time talking to the operators to get a feeling for that. As best as we can tell, it seems like most of the cancellations were what I would describe as situational. So they were -- some cases there might have been a change around a product and so there was -- around the timing of her product launch. But in other cases it sounded as if certain companies were just trying to be thoughtful about the level of expense that they were incurring in 2016. And I attribute that in part to the weaker corporate profit numbers that we have seen.","So it didn't feel as if it was thematic. It seemed like it was specific to the individual companies that had cancellations. What I took some comfort from was the fact that the cancellations that we are seeing were generally focused on 2016. We are not necessarily seeing any increase in cancellations related to 2017. So that tells me that it is a little bit more of a short term orientation and people are not necessarily backing away from their plans to have events down the road.","Greg Larson","And, Smedes, as I mentioned in my comments, we actually expect Q3 to be pretty strong for our Florida hotels.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. And I mean can you share the group pace revenue pace for 2017 at this point?","Ed Walter","I would say it is up low single digits.","Smedes Rose","Great, okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now move to our next question from Rich Hightower, Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","A couple of questions. The first one I went to touch on the ground lease purchase. So was that something that was just opportunistic when the lease was expiring or what was -- just give us a little more color about the origin of that opportunity? And I know you said you would give details later on as to what you actually do with the property. But could you give us a hint -- any hints ahead of time there?","Ed Walter","Yes, I guess obviously this is a hotel that has been in our Company for a long period of time. And for those of you that know Washington DC, you probably know the hotel because you have driven by it a number of times on the GW Parkway. It really is a great location on the edge of Georgetown. And the views from the rooms are spectacular because you are looking right down the mall at all of the monuments. This was a land lease situation from the time the hotel was built.","We have spent off and on the last 10 years negotiating with the owners of the foundation that owned the property in an effort to try to get complete control of the property. So I guess I would say it was opportunistic in the sense that we finally had -- they were finally motivated to sell and we finally had the opportunity to buy. We had a right of first refusal, which is essentially what we exercised on. So it was sort of if we were going to buy it, we needed to do it now.","And I think as it relates to the opportunities for the property, there is, we believe, we haven't had extensive conversations with local officials yet. But we are fairly comfortable in believing that there is excess density associated with the site. So we are in the process now that we know we have control of the property, we are looking at a range of options that would include a complete scraping of the asset and a complete redevelopment of the entire parcel, which would involve for us probably selling off a number of those parcels to other parties. We are also potentially redeveloping a part of the hotel and then selling off portions of the hotel to third parties to develop either residential or office. So we are really in the midst of the effort right now to understand how to maximize the value. There is a lot of local interest in the site, local and national interest for that matter because of just the superb positioning of the property. So we will provide more of an update going forward as we have a clearer idea about how to maximize value for this property.","Rich Hightower","Okay. I mean generally what sort of a return would you expect on some, on a big project like this with multiple options?","Ed Walter","Yes, I guess what I would say is it should, some of that depends upon how we pursue it. I think it is early to try to quote what the value of the underlying land might be. A lot of that is going to relate to what approach do we ultimately take.","Rich Hightower","Okay. All right, I will move to the next question. So my last question here is just in terms of the non-same-store pool of assets, one of the big selling points I guess for Host in 2016 was that it is a renovation tailwind story, which is in opposition to what happened last year. So I am curious, are the renovated projects that have opened, are they performing in line with underwriting? Are you generating the ADR lift and the overall returns you were expecting? Just as we sort of compare it to the same store 2% RevPAR number for the quarter for instance?","Ed Walter","Yes, here is what I would say with this. I think overall we are still expecting that the four assets that we talked about earlier in the year are going to generate the improvement in EBITDA that we had forecasted. I would also tell you that in terms of looking at how we are going to get to that number, the ramp up in the first quarter, call it the first four or five months of the year was probably a bit slower than what we expected. But at this point we are generally in line with our expectation for where we expected to be with the properties. And I think we feel fairly confident about how that is going to play out for this year. And then we also expect that there will be an opportunity for incremental lift in 2017 simply because we are, in each instance for three of the four properties, the one in San Francisco, Camby in Phoenix and the Logan in Philadelphia, all of those because they were closed were essentially new hotels opening up in the beginning of this year and so they did not immediately jump to stabilized operating levels in the beginning of the year.","Greg Larson","And, Rich, the only thing I would add is if you are looking at our press release you can see our non-comp hotels actually had a decline in RevPAR for the quarter and that was primarily due to two big hotels. As you know, Denver Tech is under renovation right now and that is a fairly large hotel with over 600 rooms. And the RevPAR for that hotel is down over 30%. And then the Hyatt San Francisco, again another big hotel, 789 rooms, that hotel also had a RevPAR decline of 18%. So those two hotels are really driving the negative RevPAR in the non comp hotel set right now.","Rich Hightower","Okay, I appreciate that, guys. Thanks.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","I had a question on pricing in the leisure transient side. Have you seen any impact, the downside from some of the member discounts we are seeing from the brand companies on your ability to drive rate?","Ed Walter","I think that the discounts that the brands are offering to reward members is having a slight negative impact on RevPAR. My guess is that I think Arne was quoted yesterday in saying it was about 30 basis points to 40 basis points. And based on our conversations with them and others that seems to be about right.","This certainly initially right now we are bearing some hit for the implementation of those programs. And I think the expectation in the long run though is that they will accomplish share shift. And obviously the cost of a reservation through the brand website is considerably less than what we might book through other third-party alternatives.","Anthony Powell","All right, thanks. And moving onto asset sales, I think at the beginning of the year you were targeting $1 billion in sales. You are at $500 million now. Is it the case that you are essentially done with the asset sales or just being opportunistic? And how does that outlook impact your share repurchase activity for the rest of the year?","Ed Walter","Yes, I would say that one, we are not done with asset sales. We are still working on a number of transactions and would hope to complete some more. My also would probably say right now that at this stage I wouldn't necessarily be expecting to complete a $1 billion number within calendar year 2016 because I think some of the one of the sales that I think ultimately may prove to be more likely would be the sale of the Melbourne Hilton. But I have a feeling at this point that that sale is likely to be drag into 2017 as opposed to be completed this year.","I think as I said in our prepared remarks, we are very happy with the overall sale program that we have implemented over the last 3.5 years. We would like to continue to sell assets in part because we would love to use the proceeds in the context of our stock buyback program. But we do want to make certain that we are getting pricing that we think makes sense. If you look at the sales that we have announced so far this year without even taking into account the capital spending that might have been required as part of the transition of that property, I would say to a franchise status, we were in the mid 7s in terms of a cap rate on those sales which frankly compares very favorably to where we are trading as a Company. And if I looked at the relative quality of what we were selling compared to what we are retaining, that relationship looks even more attractive.","Anthony Powell","Got it. And just following up on that, so if there aren't materially more asset sales, do stock buybacks stop this year or would you just use cash proceeds or cash flow to fund share buybacks?","Ed Walter","I think we have with the sales that we have completed, we do have I would say some extra cash that could be invested in the stock buyback. Some of that will obviously get tied into what our ultimate dividend requirement is going to be. And I think we are still interested in buying back stock. Obviously as you look at the price that we have paid in this most recent quarter, part of what governs our activity in the stock is where the stock price is. But I think we are still open to additional stock repurchase.","Anthony Powell","All right, that is it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And will take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","If I maybe could just stick with the question on dispositions for a moment, Ed, I am just curious. I mean if assuming markets are cooperative, is there a particular goal that you have in mind? I mean where you would like to be with the portfolio looking beyond just the sales you are contemplating for 2016? I wasn't sure if you had a number of assets, a number of markets or other sort of metrics that shapes how you are thinking about where you would like to bring the portfolio?","Ed Walter","Jeff, it is a good question. I would tell you that with maybe just a few exceptions, I would say that we have sold the bulk of the hotels that we would have started, when we looked at the, started to look at commencing a sale program three or four years ago, we sold the bulk of the hotels that we felt we were either quality reasons, capital reasons or likely underperformance of the market reasons. We sold the bulk of the hotels that we would like to do.","There are a couple more that I think we would like to sell where we would view them as perhaps detractors in the long run from our likely performance. But not that many. I mean I am really talking about a small handful of hotels. So I would say that it ultimately moving past perhaps selling that handful of hotels, it really just comes down to a function of pricing and in a market that seems to be a little less robust than where it had been, I would probably say at this moment I am not as optimistic that we are necessarily going to be selling a lot of additional hotels unless we see pricing start to improve.","Jeff Donnelly","So in other words it is not $500 million down and $3 billion to go or something like that?","Ed Walter","No, I think that, no, definitely, definitely not. At least not on our current perspective.","Jeff Donnelly","And just sticking on the sales question, can you maybe just give us a little more color about what you have learned from the marketplace with dispositions in terms of how buyers are underwriting? Are they kind of looking at on a per key basis, is it sort of cash flow yields or is it an IRR driven buyer? And I guess if I could I just had one other question on just group trends.","Ed Walter","Yes, I think it is a little bit dependent on the type of buyer that you are dealing with. So the international buyers tend to be looking more at long-term storage of value and tend to, what we have found in our conversations with them trends toward the higher quality assets. The financial buyers that are probably, are using more leverage than what we might necessarily use seems to me that they are primarily focused on a cash flow stream that will generate a fairly attractive rate of return and provide some cushioning against what might happen later in the cycle and trying to rely less on a growth in the value of the asset in terms of either certainly cap rate compression or just a significant increase in value down the road. So it seems to be it is much more around current cash flow in terms of a driver for them.","Jeff Donnelly","Thinks. And the question I just had on group and I will yield the floor is that just earlier in the year I think you guys had shared measures on group attrition and cancellations and just in the year bookings that maybe they weren't necessarily moving in the right direction. Can you just talk about how those trends have moved from Q1 and into Q2 and maybe how that shapes your thinking for next year as we roll forward? And I think you gave a metric earlier on the call about your group pace being up single digits in 2017. Do you recall what that same metric was last year looking at 2016?","Ed Walter","Yes, let me try to address the first part of your question then come back to that. So I think what we indicated earlier in the year was that we certainly had very strong group bookings. And I think at the end of the first quarter as we look through the rest of the year, we thought we were up I think it was around 5% to 6%.","And what we said at the time was because we were running so far ahead in terms of the prior year in terms of group bookings that to some degree there was just not as many nights in rooms that were still capable of being sold in a lot of those hotels for group. And so we were expecting that what would happen over the course of the year is that group would still be very strong but that it would generally fall to a level of production or from a revenue perspective that was consistent with the overall range of RevPAR guidance that we were providing at that point in time. So we were suggesting that yes, we might be up 5% to 6% right now but given at that point in time, we were talking 3% to 4% in terms of RevPAR. We expected the group revenues would ultimately moderate and be more in line with that level.","If I were to look out today looking out for the rest of the year, I would say that what we generally were expecting was going to happen with group which was that the lead that we had over the prior year would probably condense a bit and that has happened. I think we still feel pretty confident about group for the second half of the year. I might on the margin say because we have seen a little bit of incremental weakness in short term group bookings that we are a hair less confident in terms of how group compares to what we thought in April. But by and large when we look at our booking pace through the remainder of the year and calibrate that with expectations of what we actually expect to generate, we still feel pretty good about our group business.","When we look into next year, I would say that we are probably running a little bit behind. Our growth for '17 is not as strong as our growth for 2'16. Our growth for '16 thinking back to calendar '15 was sort of mid single digits for most of 2015. So we are behind in terms of a rate of growth but of course remember, we have been saying for a while, including a lot of last year, that the group bookings for 2016 were quite strong. We are still saying that our group bookings for 2017 are better than our group bookings for 2016. So we are slated to have a better year for group in terms of absolute amount of group nights and absolute group revenues in 2017. But that rate of improvement right now would be slightly lower than what we were forecasting a year ago for 2016.","Jeff Donnelly","Thanks, that was very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","I just wanted to talk a little bit about the guidance reduction for the back half of the year. You gave some good color on group pace and the idea that you are expecting transient trends to slow, or not slow but remain soft I guess. Can you give us some color on what type of macro outlook -- I am assuming you have some type of macro model that you use to help drive kind of transient RevPAR demand trends for the back half of the year?","Ed Walter","Sure. I would say that what we have found over the years was the best indicator for what was going to happen to corporate transient is generally tied to what is happening in terms of business investment. If investment activity is higher, travel seems to be -- business transient seems to be stronger. And while I didn't have much time to absorb the GDP report that came out early this morning, I did note that business investment was off in the second quarter and I think it might have even been off more than 2%. So, I wouldn't say that our approach to this is so scientific that we calibrated with our expectations for business investment would be for the second half of the year. I think that would presume too much. But we did assume, based on the data that we have been seeing and the outlook that we will see from people that spend their time forecasting that, is it generally was expected to be weaker.","So, until that changes, we assume that corporate travel will probably, it will still be there but the growth and the demand from that side will not be as strong as it might have been in the past. And that is one of the reasons why, as we look at the transient side of our business, and I think it is clear from my comments that that is the part of our business that disappointed us in Q2, that is the part of our business that we think is weaker in the second half of the year. We are assuming that we will see weakness in corporate demand consequently push us more toward some of the more price sensitive segments of leisure discount business. And that is what underlies the fact that we are adjusting our RevPAR guidance down for the second half of the year and obviously for the full year.","Ryan Meliker","I think that make sense. So, just to make sure I understand it correctly, it sounds like you are assuming that the soft business investment spend dynamic that we have seen in the first half of the year really persists through the back half of the year. Is that correct?","Ed Walter","That is correct, that is correct.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, so no acceleration or deceleration necessarily?","Ed Walter","Correct. I would say that if you were trying to look at what might change this dynamic a little bit and lead to stronger growth, it would be improvement in corporate investment which could then turn around, and you know corporate travel reacts very quickly both down and up. So, to the extent that the investment side of their business starts to their perspective changes, they get more optimistic, that is the one place for upside too.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, that is helpful. And then just one quick follow up. Greg, you had mentioned that you are expecting San Francisco to be a little softer in the back half of the year. I am wondering if you guys have tried to quantify the impact of the Moscone Center renovation, what you think that is going to do in 4Q and then next year?","Greg Larson","I mean look, it is certainly going to impact the second half of this year and certainly next year. But I don't have an exact number for you. But we are within our guidance that we gave today for our portfolio, 2% to 3% RevPAR growth, we are actually modeling San Francisco to have a slight to be slightly negative in the second half of the year.","Ryan Meliker","Okay. And is it reasonable for us to assume that it will be slightly negative again next year?","Ed Walter","Expect it to be negative? I think it is awfully early right now to try to provide an outlook relative to 2017. But what I can tell you that at least as a concern is that when we were looking at our bookings for next year, one of the markets that was has been weakest in terms of bookings for 2017 was San Francisco. So, there is clearly going to be some impact from the closing of the the construction activity around the convention center.","Operator","Thank you. Will now take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","I was hoping that maybe we could drill down a little bit on the rates. And I know that in 2Q and I think even in 1Q your mix shifting had a lot to do with it. And so I am trying to get a sense for how much of the rate under performance may be relative to your expectations is just mix and how much of it is real time softening on the transient side?","Ed Walter","I would say it is a combination of both. So if I look across our different segments, I would say that in the lower price segments, government or in some of our discount segments, we actually had fairly strong rate growth. So for instance, our government business from a rate perspective was up 4.4%. And our discount business was up about 3%.","So we saw a good jump in those segments. Where we saw ,if we did see, as our highest price business in retail and some of the, that segment, we did see some rate decline. So I would tell you at the end of the day it is a combination of both. The good news is the segments we did more we had growth in also had higher rate. So that is positive. The downside is that the actual rates of business, the rate that we charge those customers tends to be lower than the rate that we would charge our most expensive retail customer. So it was a combination of at the top level some weakness, some negative rate growth combined with a lot of rate shift, mix shift.","Chris Woronka","Okay, great. And then also wanted to ask you, it seems to be with all of the uncertainty out there the trend is kind of lower shorter booking windows. Are you guys working with the brands? Do you think there, could this be more of a longer term trend and do you think the brands are kind of on top of it and are you working with them to maybe look at changes in policies or things like that?","Ed Walter","I don't know that we are necessarily seeing right now that the booking window is shorter. I mean I, we are, as we have reached higher occupancy levels, we have generally seen the booking window extended. And we are still seeing even looking out to 2018, we are still seeing good growth in our group business. So I don't know that we would necessarily sit here and say that we think the window has shortened so far this year.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed.","Operator","Thank you. We will take our next question from Harry Curtis, Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Ed, you have seen a couple of lodging cycles and certainly Greg is no spring chicken, right, Greg? ","Greg Larson","That is the pot calling the kettle black.","Harry Curtis","All right, let's get on with it. I did stir the pot. So the question is, if you have seen the deceleration in corporate investment, through these cycles have you ever seen it reaccelerate once you see these trends in group bookings begin to soften?","Ed Walter","Harry, that is a good question. And I am trying to think back. Certainly the last two downturns, my guess is is that your general assumption is that once it rolled over, it continued to head down. Now what is different though is that in both of those last two cycles in 2001, it had started to go negative in the beginning of the year and then obviously we had the attack on 9\/11 followed by SARS followed by the war. So we sort of had, once things went a little south, I don't know that we necessarily got a chance to see how the economic environment was going to play out in kind of in this context. There was a lot of other events that intervened to create a problem. And of course the financial recession had somewhat of a similar tempo to it.","So coming back to what we might expect this time, I do think that if you look at what the Fed just said in what they came out with earlier this week, I don't know that they are necessarily acting or speaking in the context of thinking that the economy is about to roll over. I have a feeling just sort of if looking at this through my own lens is that part of what Corporate America is trying to figure out is what does Brexit mean, what does this unsettled -- these attacks that have happened across the world, who in the world is going to be the next President of the United States and what exactly -- what policies are they going to pursue?","So I can't -- the last thing I am going to try to do is predict the future in terms of economics. But I could look at this and say that if the Fed is right that the underlying economy is actually fairly healthy, then if companies had a different perspective about some of these issues that I think do affect people's willingness to invest, I think there is an opportunity to see corporate investment improve. I believe that the consensus forecast for next year does call for some slight improvement in business investment, not robust but some slight improvement. So not that they have necessarily been right at all through this cycle, but if they were right, then that might offer an opportunity to see some improvement.","Harry Curtis","Okay, and then.","Ed Walter","Checking my data on that. The most recent blue-chip consensus talks about corporate investment next year at 3.1%. So that was down a little bit from where it had been the prior quarter but still pretty positive. So I think that will be -- in our mind based on given that we see that being a fairly influential indicator for us, we will have to see how that plays out.","Harry Curtis","Thank you for that. And then my second question is, what do you need to see to take the base dividend up?","Ed Walter","Generally what we have done is tie our dividend to our taxable income. So one of the biggest drivers there would be we would need to see our taxable income continue to increase. We have generated incremental taxable income as a result of our asset sales. And so one of the things we will provide more clarity on I would expect at our next conference call is the degree to which we would have a special dividend. I would say that certainly in terms of thinking about the dividend long term, we are certainly focused on having a dividend set at a level that we are comfortable in maintaining even to the extent we might go through a period of weakness. And we are certainly comfortable at the level we are at today that we could do that.","Harry Curtis","Okay, that is it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joe Greff","Ed, earlier in the call you talked about that the third quarter would be considerably better than the fourth quarter in terms of RevPAR growth. Are you anticipating that your third-quarter RevPAR growth will accelerate from Q2 levels?","Ed Walter","Yes.","Joe Greff","Okay. And your explanation for that would be September group, presumably and the timing of the Jewish holidays?","Ed Walter","Yes, I think we were not necessarily expecting that July would be any stronger than what we had seen in Q2 but we do have very strong group bookings in August. And we have strong group bookings in September. I think as you were I think alluding to there a part of that is due to the fact that the Jewish holidays have shifted into October. So we are not necessarily expecting acceleration in July but we do expect a strong August and September.","Joe Greff","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Will take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","When you look at prior election cycles, how do I guess transient and group react going into an election? Is it normal to see this type of pause?","Ed Walter","I don't know that we have necessarily identified a trend. I mean the two trends that we have seen is that sometimes a market like Washington will end up with a little bit softer business in the fourth quarter because when you are having a nationwide election, most of the elected officials tend to be out of the city. And since that they draw for business in Washington, we've sometimes seen some softening of business in DC related to that.","We have generally seen that the election week ends up being relatively slow on the group side because at least larger groups are reluctant to schedule an event that would overlap Election Day. And so that is one of the reasons why we have indicated really for the last couple of quarters now we have highlighted the fact that we were not overly confident about the fourth quarter. One reason is the holiday shift but the other was the fact that we felt that this Election Day would be one that groups would be reluctant to book in.","So, I think what we are going to find when we get to the fourth quarter, not to get too far ahead of ourselves here, is that you are going to see some incredibly strong weeks because group is going to be very compacted into the sort of the open weeks of that quarter and then those weeks that are affected either by the election or by the holiday will probably be fairly weak.","Wes Golladay","Okay and then going back to the San Francisco Convention Center next year, Marriott Marquis is obviously a headquarter hotel. It appears they are trying to put in as much in house group for you at the hotel. How much of the overall group in house and from the convention center do you think you can recapture just by their push the San Francisco travels push to help you fill up the hotel?","Ed Walter","Well, I don't know that that we don't have a precise forecast right now. But you've correctly identified exactly what we are trying to do. We do have a very good meeting platform there. We are trying to take full advantage of it to offset the loss of business that we might otherwise have gotten if the convention center had been not under construction and fully available.","Wes Golladay","Okay, so qualitatively maybe are you more encouraged maybe than at the beginning of the year?","Ed Walter","I am not certain that, I think we are still going to end up finding that we have a weaker year in San Francisco and that group bookings are going to probably at the Marquis will probably be down for the full year. I just think that we do enough business that is associated with the convention center that we have we do have a great meeting platform but I don't know that it is big enough to completely replace all of the citywide business.","The one thing I would say though is that while the convention business will be off in San Francisco, we do think we have a very attractive hotel or hotels that are in great locations in that market. So, we are going to have a it is going to be a struggle to overcome some of the weakness on the group side but we are in good locations from a transient perspective too.","Greg Larson","Wes, you really picked the most two extreme markets; DC has a very, very strong group booking pace for next year but then as Ed just mentioned, San Francisco is fairly weak for next year.","Wes Golladay","And to follow up with that comment, I guess San Diego is probably going to do quite well with the complete renovation of the ballroom? Is that going to start being a big lift next year?","Ed Walter","Yes, we are seeing San Francisco as being -- or San Diego, rather, being quite strong the second half of the year and I think we believe that carries into next year too. I mean San Diego should be one of our best markets in the second half of the year.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","We have a final question from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I was just wondering if we could get a quick update on your outlook for supply. We talked a lot about 2016 maybe last quarter and before but as you are looking out to 2017, any shift in some of your largest markets as we think about New York, San Francisco, LA, Boston and DC?","Ed Walter","Yes, I think in general what we are -- the pattern that we have seen the last few years is that there is of course estimates from the experts in terms of what is going to happen with supply growth for the beginning of the year. And then normally what seems to happen is by the time we get to this point in the year or a little bit later, we begin to realize that the supply growth that is actually going to materialize is slightly less just because projects have a tendency to be delayed.","And so this year I think we started off the year thinking that nationwide supply was probably going to be just under 2 and now it feels like it might be more in that 1.6, 1.7 range, which is not a huge difference. But still on the margin, a little bit better. So that is sort of 2016.","We are expecting that supply next year will increase somewhat. I think we see that both across the industry and we also see that in the upper price points in the top 20 markets. So again I would say we are probably expecting the industry supply to be a little bit over 2 and probably expect that the supply in the top 20 markets is a little bit higher than that. I would also guess though that at some point we are going to see the same sort of lengthening of the delivery time for that supply which will hopefully maybe pull back down a little bit.","New York continues, New York and Houston and Miami tend to be the markets that continue to see the strongest supply. Seattle might be one more that falls into that category. We are seeing while supply for New York will continue to be robust and a lot of it is under construction, my sense in looking at the data was we were seeing fewer projects that were projected to start in the next 12 months and fewer projects in planning. So we are hoping that that may signal a return to some level of rationality around New York supply. But we are not going to see the benefits of that in 2017.","Shaun Kelley","Great, that is helpful. And just one follow up or [nit] was I think you mentioned early on in the prepared remarks that international demand was down about 7% for the quarter. Could you just give us a sense of where that came in for, where that was trending in Q1?","Ed Walter","I think it was right around that same level, maybe a percent or so higher. Again as I have said in the past, this is a little bit of an imprecise science. But I think in looking back at our comments for the prior quarter, we were probably, we might have been just a hair higher in terms of Q1. And some of that would be reflective of the fact that the relationship between the US dollar in some of those other currencies is you are starting to lap over when we had an impact last year.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks.","Ed Walter","Great, well thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciated the opportunity to review our second-quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. We look forward to providing a further update during our third-quarter call in November. Have a great weekend. And travel often for the remainder of the summer. If you haven't looked at our website lately, it has got some great suggestions on places to stay. Bye.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."],"11551":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead.","Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Emma. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly-comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at HostHotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide his remarks on our 2017 achievements, our fourth quarter results, the pending acquisition of the three Hyatt properties and conclude with our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on the expanded disclosures, our fourth quarter performance including markets, margins, balance sheet and our guidance for 2018. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Gee, and thanks, everyone for joining us this morning. It's been a busy and exciting start to 2018, but I'd be remiss not to mention all that we achieved in 2017 as an organization. In addition to three spectacular hotels we are under contract to acquire and which I will speak about in a moment, we bought the iconic Don CeSar resort and the irreplaceable W Hollywood, while recycling capital out of low growth markets and high CapEx spend assets. We completed our Australian exit with the sale of the Hilton Melbourne and opportunistically sold the Key Bridge Marriott for a very low cap rate, even before considering the significant capital the asset required.","We made great progress on addressing our New York strategy, culminating in the announcement of the W New York sale, which we intend to close sometime in the second quarter. We made tremendous progress on creating value in our portfolio, most notably at The Phoenician, where we filed a new PUD enabling us to sell land zoned for residential unit development, which should net us an incremental $50 million to $60 million in profit in 2019 and beyond. And on the operations side, we drove very strong margin outperformance, despite a low RevPAR environment and an economy running at full employment, partially a result of the new enterprise analytics platform we established early last year.","Organizationally, we have a new senior team that is firing on all cylinders and better aligned under the streamlining of asset management and investments that we completed late last year. Last, but not least, we have listened to the investment community's call for greater transparency into our operations. You will note our enhanced supplemental and additional disclosure, which I will let Michael address in greater detail, but which helps illustrate the value of what we believe to be the best hotel portfolio in the public lodging space; all-in-all, a terrific year that we are looking to build upon.","With that, let me give you some color on the quarter and full year 2017 results. As anticipated, operations bounced back nicely in the fourth quarter, generating the second strongest results of the year and beating internal and consensus expectations on the bottom line.","Comparable RevPAR growth for the quarter on a constant dollar basis was 2.2%, driven by 140 basis points increase in occupancy and an increase in average rate of 30 basis points. The primary drivers of these results were strong transient performance, particularly on the leisure side, and better than expected group business in October. We always anticipated the Jewish holiday shift to positively impact October, but were pleased to see group revenues up nearly 5% in the month. As a result, our managers were able to push transient pricing to yield the second best RevPAR month of the year behind January, which benefited from the inauguration and Women's March.","We were also pleased to see some pick up in the business transient customer during the quarter, as that segment grew nearly 5%. Although some of this was simply a result of the holiday shift and one quarter does not make a trend, it was an encouraging sign to see business travel up, and we will continue to monitor this customer closely as we move through 2018.","As was the story during all of 2017, we did another fantastic job driving margins in the quarter through increased productivity and strict cost controls. Comparable EBITDA margins grew 10 basis points in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjustable EBITDAre of $375 million, an increase of 6.8% from the prior year. Let me remind you that this is on total revenue growth of only 50 basis points.","For the full year, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 1.3% to approximately $180, the company's highest full year RevPAR in its history. Adjusted EBITDAre was $1.510 billion and adjusted FFO per share was a $1.69, both significantly exceeding consensus estimates; really a strong finish to a solid year.","Moving to capital allocation and our initial outlook for 2018, I would like to spend some time discussing the strategic transactions we announced yesterday. As you have heard me say before, our strategy is to own the most geographically-diverse portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the U.S., utilizing our scale and investment grade balance sheet to grow externally through smart acquisitions and organically through operational improvement.","With our pending acquisition of three fantastic Hyatt properties, we are executing on the external growth part of our strategy to begin the year. We are under contract to purchase a $1 billion portfolio consisting of: two resort properties, the 301-room Andaz Maui and 454-room Hyatt Regency Coconut Point; and one large City Center hotel, the 668-room Grand Hyatt San Francisco in the heart of the city. We anticipate the deal will close in the first quarter, although it is possible it may fall to early in the second quarter.","These hotels are exactly the type of assets we have been targeting. Resort and large city center properties, segments where the supply outlook for the next several years is anemic. They're also in markets where we believe the near-term growth is significantly stronger than our broader portfolio and the country as a whole. We believe Maui and San Francisco will be two of the fastest growing markets in the country over the next few years. Maui is benefiting from improved air lift and continued strong leisure demand, while San Francisco will continue to improve from the combination of continued tech and business demand as well as the completed expansion of the Moscone Center.","Additionally, we continue to be bullish on the West Coast of Florida, where Hyatt Regency Coconut Point is located, which should benefit in the near-term from displacement from the Caribbean and strong group and leisure demand. These three properties are nothing short of spectacular.","In addition to supportive market fundamentals, we believe there are several initiatives we can implement to enhance value, once these properties are plugged into our enterprise analytics and asset management platform. These will include time and motion studies, food and beverage re-concepting and benchmarking with other Host assets in the respective markets.","As many of you know, we currently own major Hyatt properties in both Maui and San Francisco, which will provide for collaboration and centralization opportunities. Further, we own iconic non-Hyatt-branded properties in all three markets, such as the Fairmont Kea Lani in Maui, the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco, and The Don CeSar and Ritz-Carlton Naples in West Florida. Using our data platforms to benchmark these existing properties against this Hyatt portfolio should prove to be beneficial, not unlike the success we have had in San Diego between our Marriott Marquis and Manchester Grand Hyatt.","We also like the quality of this portfolio. These are modern hotels that have been invested heavily in by Hyatt, are in exceptional condition and require comparatively little CapEx in the near term. Further, with a combined 2018 RevPAR of nearly $290, we believe these assets will be able to live within the FF&E reserve much more comfortably than the assets we have been disposing of over the past 12 months, limiting our out-of-pocket investment throughout the life of the assets.","Speaking of Hyatt, I can't overstate the importance of our relationship with them. We currently own eight Hyatt managed properties and two Hyatt franchised hotels. I am confident that our strong relationship, combined with our ability to move quickly to evaluate the deal, complete our due diligence pre-signing, provide a competitive bid and close quickly with a high degree of certainty, were all factors in their decision to award us this opportunity. We are excited to continue to build upon what is already a very strong relationship with Hyatt and value their expertise as a first-class operator.","Looking closer at quality, these assets immediately will rank in our top 40 hotels ranked by RevPAR, with the Andaz Maui ranking in our top three. More importantly, the EBITDA per key generated from the portfolio is over 40% greater than the average of our portfolio. From a pricing standpoint, we are paying approximately $700,000 per room or approximately 17 times 2018 EBITDA and a 5% cap rate.","As I stated earlier, we expect significant growth out of this portfolio over the near-term. Given the quality of these assets, the relatively low CapEx in the near-term required and the substantial growth outlook, we believe this is an excellent investment of our capital.","On the disposition front, we also announced we are under contract to sell the W New York Lexington for $190 million. The buyer has a $13 million deposit at risk and the transaction is anticipated to close early in the second quarter. This sale is another example of Host executing on a strategic initiative, which was to reduce our exposure to New York. This hotel has been a particularly poor performer and requires substantial CapEx.","Our ability to acquire the right to terminate the management agreement at this property was paramount in completing the sale. As anticipated, on January 9, we closed on the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million. Again, this was a terrific opportunistic sale at a really attractive cap rate.","We intend to like-kind exchange both properties with the Hyatt portfolio acquisition, which also ensures we retain the ability to reinvest the substantial gain that would be generated. The cap rate on the nearly $900 million in assets we have sold since January of 2017, including the W New York, is just north of 5%. Both sales included hotels in lower growth markets with higher CapEx requirements and an average RevPAR of approximately $140. Needless to say, we are pleased with our ability to recycle capital out of lower quality assets and into a high quality portfolio of scale with a strong growth profile.","Shifting to our outlook for 2018, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic, with the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance improving 20 basis points from 2017 to 1.5% on a range of 50 basis points to 2.5%. This slight acceleration is based on what we are seeing in the macroeconomic environment, as the global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive to industry growth. What we discussed for nearly all of 2017, namely improving corporate profits, business investment, consumer sentiment amidst a low unemployment backdrop, all remain in place for 2018 and bode well for demand. The offset to the demand side of the equation is that overall supply and supply in our markets continues to tick higher, although not much greater than the long-term historical average. Looking out further, we expect to see supply moderating in 2019.","We also gained some confidence, as January results came in nearly 300 basis points higher than our property forecasts, which were completed in November. That, combined with some life in the business transient customer in the fourth quarter of 2017, certainly gives us some hope for 2018, although it is too early to call breakout just yet. And while we are also hopeful tax reform will prompt corporations to increase their travel spend this year, we have not included the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in our outlook. As I said, we are cautiously optimistic, but realize it is only February and we have a long way to go in 2018.","Group revenue pace sits about where it was the same time last year, up 2%, with approximately 80% of our group on the books. We feel group is solid and where we anticipated it to be. Our properties are running at record level occupancies and we continue to see the group booking window extend.","As far as the cadence of performance in 2018, we anticipate the second half of the year being stronger than the first half. The first quarter will be our weakest, as a result of tough comps due to last year's inauguration and Women's March in D.C. and Easter weekend starting on March 30 this year.","On the bottom line, our team continues to do a great job driving margin performance. And this is reflected in our 2018 comparable EBITDA margin guidance of negative 60 basis points at the low end and plus 20 basis points at the high end. Although we did a spectacular job on margins in 2017, that will be difficult to replicate in an operating environment with this level of employment. Having said that, we still have levers to pull internally through our enterprise analytics team, in addition to continued benefits we anticipate from the Marriott, Starwood integration. We would hope for breakeven margin performance around RevPAR growth of approximately 2%.","Our 2018 guidance does not assume any acquisitions or dispositions, other than those I have discussed this morning, although we are continuing to work on several transactions that would fit our strategy. I would also point out that per our stated strategy of ultimately focusing solely on the U.S., we are exploring the sale of our international assets, including our interests in our European joint venture. While there is nothing to report at this time, it is an area we will be investigating throughout the course of the year.","On the CapEx side, we anticipate spending between $475 million to $550 million this year, which is much closer to our historical average. Part of the increase from our 2017 spend of $277 million is a result of projects being pushed from late 2017 into 2018. In addition, we are undertaking a transformative repositioning at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in the second half of the year, which is responsible for the majority of the $114 million we announced in our press release. This will be a complete reimagining of the hotel that we decided to bring forward from its previously-scheduled renovation date in 2020 in order to complete work ahead of what we expect will be a very strong market in 2019 and beyond. Any disruption related to the higher level of capital spend has been captured in the guidance we have provided today.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and guidance as well as the recent changes we have made to our disclosure in much greater detail.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Before we begin, I just wanted to say what a privilege it is to have joined Host and this team. We have some of the most talented and dedicated individuals in the space, and I'd particularly like to say thank you to those who helped me prepare for my first earnings call as Chief Financial Officer.","With that, and before we review quarterly and full year performance, you'll notice that we have made some material changes to our disclosure, particularly as it relates to our financial supplement. Some of these changes were made simply to make it easier for you to find the information we had previously provided by putting it into one simple document. However, others were a significant step to providing more information and greater transparency into our operations in order to help the investment community better recognize and value the quality of this irreplaceable portfolio of world class hotels.","To that end, we've incorporated new and expanded disclosure, including key performance metrics for our top 40 consolidated hotels, ranked by RevPAR, including: RevPAR; total RevPAR; and full year EBITDA for 2017. This top 40 represents over 60% of the company's total EBITDA, has a 2017 RevPAR of approximately $230, total RevPAR of nearly $350 and an EBITDA per key of $35,000, exemplifying a portfolio of hotels that we believe is the highest quality amongst our peers.","We've also expanded the comparable hotels by locations, which you've seen previously, from 16 locations to 23 in our press release and financial supplement. This change was made to give you better insight into our submarkets, particularly as it relates to Florida, Manhattan, and CityCenterDC. We've included the same property detail for these markets as is provided for our top 40 assets.","Finally, we have provided more detail about our financial obligations, including additional credit metrics and a summary of our ground leases. You can easily download this information from our website, by scrolling down to the black box at the bottom of every page of our website at HostHotels.com.","Now, let me begin with a discussion of Host's financial performance by providing a discussion of the factors that led to our adjusted EBITDA outperformance as compared to the midpoint of our third quarter guidance. While comparable operations were approximately $3 million better than anticipated, there were three areas that provided the remaining outperformance. First, effective December 31, 2017, we adopted the new NAREIT guideline on EBITDAre and now have included the full EBITDA related to our consolidated partnerships, which increased our full year adjusted EBITDA by $10 million. And for the quarter, that would be $3 million.","Second, certain one-time sources of income related to business interruption proceeds and gain on sale of the Chicago land benefited the full year adjusted EBITDAre by another $10 million. And third, the remaining increase of $11 million resulted mostly from a decrease in corporate expenses and accruals and favorable foreign exchange rates, offset by a slight decline in non-comparable operations.","I will now expand on our quarterly and full year performance. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased with our fourth quarter results, driven by our strong leisure transient demand and better than expected group performance in October. Our leisure revenues increased 7% in the quarter and group revenues in October improved 5%, outperforming our expectations. For the full year, the performance was primarily driven by a 5% increase in leisure demand and a 16% increase in contract demand, as our managers strategically took on high-rated contract business in specific markets with new supply or softening demand concerns, such as San Francisco, New York, Orange County and Boston.","For reference, the ADR in our contract business was over $200 in 2017. Our best performing domestic markets this quarter were Philadelphia, Jacksonville, San Antonio, Orlando, and New Orleans. RevPAR increases ranged from 7% to almost 16% from these markets. Generally, these markets benefited from strong group business from additional citywides in the quarter. The strength in group business led to double-digit food and beverage revenues growth ranging from 11% to 39% in these markets, except for San Antonio. In addition, the hotels in these markets, with the exception of Orlando, exceeded comparable STR upper-upscale market results by 150 to 550 basis points.","Our more challenged markets were Miami, San Diego, Chicago, Washington D.C. and New York. RevPAR ranged from 0.1% to a decline of around 17% in Miami, where our Biscayne Bay Marriott suffered hurricane damage and approximately 230 rooms were out of service for the fourth quarter. All rooms were placed back in service by mid-January. You will recall that we kept this hotel in our comp set, despite the hurricane damage.","Hotels in San Diego, Chicago and Washington D.C. were impacted by the large citywides in the quarter, resulting in a lack of compression to drive transient average rates and requiring the hotel to provide more discounts in rates to drive occupancy. It is also worth mentioning that in Washington D.C., the meeting space was under renovation at the Grand Hyatt, and the parking garage restoration at the Hyatt Capitol Hill further impacted group business in the fourth quarter.","New York continues to be impacted from new supply and group weakness in the Times Square market as well as weaker international demand, overall contributing to underperformance as compared to our portfolio as a whole. Looking ahead to 2018, we expect Maui\/Oahu, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate Houston, Seattle, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and New York to underperform the portfolio.","Moving to our profitability, we remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property managers and asset managers in bringing more profit to the bottom line. Comp total revenues increased 2% for the quarter. A 10 basis point increase in comparable hotel EBITDA margin is quite impressive. Our full year comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 10 basis points is even more extraordinary, as full year total comparable revenues increased 0.7%. These are remarkable results in an environment with a 12 year low unemployment and rising labor costs.","While these results will be difficult to replicate, we will continue to have a keen focus on various productivity and operational efficiency initiatives in 2018. We will continue to execute on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies at our medium and small hotels. Furthermore, we expect to garner cost savings from the Marriott, Starwood merger through lower OTA commissions, better procurement costs, technology integration synergies, lower workers' compensation expense, reduction in charge-out rates from the consolidation of the rewards program and reduced processing fees from the renegotiation of the credit card program, among others.","Furthermore, we are encouraged by the strengthening macroeconomic conditions and the passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that could drive additional demand from the higher-rated business transient customers. Combine this with the all-time high occupancy levels, a potential positive mix shift to the business transient customer could lead to a rate-driven increase in RevPAR, which would bode well for profitability. Having said that, the guidance we have provided today does not contemplate this.","Let me discuss dividends for a moment. In January, we paid a regular fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share, bringing our total dividend for 2017 to $0.85, which represents a yield of approximately 4.4% on the current stock price. In addition, this represents the payout ratio of approximately 50% on our 2017 adjusted FFO per share. We have announced a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.20 per share and continue our policy of paying on our taxable income.","Let's talk about the balance sheet for a moment. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. I believe we have one of the strongest balance sheets among our peers. We ended the year with about $4 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 4%, a weighted average maturity of five years and no debt maturities until 2020. Approximately 30% of our debt is floating and none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt.","We ended the year with approximately $913 million of cash and $822 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.2 times, as calculated under the terms of our credit facility and after taking into effect the proceeds from the sale the Key Bridge Marriott, which we received in early January. We expect to close the Hyatt transaction in late first quarter, early second quarter, as Jim mentioned, which will be funded with cash and a draw on the credit facility revolver.","Upon completion of the sale on the W New York hotel in the second quarter, we expect to use the proceeds to pay down a portion of the draw on the credit facility. After taking these transactions into consideration, we expect our leverage ratio to be at the low end of our stated target range of 2.5 times to 3.0 times.","Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2018 guidance. In addition to the operating metrics provided in our press release and discussed by Jim, included in our guidance are three transactions: one, the acquisitions of the Hyatt portfolio for $1 billion by the end of the first quarter; number two, the sale of the Key Bridge Marriott for $190 million in January; and three, the sale of the W New York hotel for $190 million in the second quarter. No other acquisitions or dispositions have been included in our guidance.","These transactions, along with the 2017 disposition and acquisition activity, led to a forecast net acquisition EBITDA increase of approximately $16 million in 2018. We expect this will be offset by an increase in our G&A and incremental disruption from the increased capital expenditures Jim referenced. The G&A increase, a one-time charge of $7 million relates to technology cost associated with the update and move over enterprise analytics platform and systems to the cloud. Furthermore, certain one-time sources of income related to business interruption proceeds and gain on the sale of Chicago land, which benefited 2017 adjusted EBITDA by $10 million, will not repeat in 2018. The combination of all these factors decreases our forecast 2018 adjusted EBITDA from 2017 by $10 million. Lastly, keep in mind that we generally earn 23% to 24% of our total EBITDA in the first quarter.","To conclude, we are pleased with our strong operating results and completion of a large acquisition that is consistent with our strategic initiatives and financial discipline. Furthermore, we are delighted to introduce a more fulsome package of disclosure through our enhanced financial supplement.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To make sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will take our first question today from Andy (sic) [Anthony]. Powell from Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Anthony.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that correction on the name and congrats on the acquisitions. You mentioned that you're acquiring the assets at a 5% cap rate on 2018 EBITDA, but there's also some good near-term growth prospects in some of those markets. Could you talk about what you think the stabilized cap rate could be on the transactions after a couple years?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. We're looking at somewhere in the mid-6s. We're really bullish on these markets and these assets and, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, our ability to really get into the properties and bring our enterprise analytics platform to the table and our asset management expertise to just take a fresh look at how the hotels are being run.","I'll give you a little more color on this, Anthony, but let me back up and just make one thing really crystal clear. These assets are great hotels. And we can talk about the metrics of each individual property in the markets that we're in. But as we sat back and said, okay, we sold $900 million of assets over the course of 2017 at a relatively low cap rate, $140 RevPAR in the aggregate, with high CapEx needs in slow growth markets. And when the opportunity to acquire these three hotels presented itself in the markets that they're in and our familiarity with the markets, we said, wow, this is a really terrific opportunity to effectively recycle capital.","And we had the cash on the balance sheet. We have a great relationship with Hyatt. We feel that we could add value to this portfolio on many different levers. One thing that we didn't talk about with respect to the assets that I think is actually quite critical is based on our allocation of value, the cost per key for each hotel. So the Andaz Maui at a cost per key just slightly under $1.3 million, we think is really attractive. I don't know if you know the hotel, Anthony. I would encourage you to take a trip to Maui and go see it. I don't think I have to provide too much encouragement there. But it is a fantastic property and it sits next to the Marriott Wailea, then the Four Seasons, then the Grand Wailea and then our Kea Lani Palace.","So one of the things that really gave us an advantage across the entire portfolio is our experience in each of these markets and the fact that we had iconic Hyatt hotels in both markets and have the ability to collaborate and centralize services, in this instance between the Hyatt Ka'anapali, and the Andaz in San Francisco between the Hyatt Burlingame and the Grand Hyatt Union Square.","So we are just really excited and delighted to have the opportunity to acquire these assets. They are truly one of a kind, iconic properties in very fast growing markets and markets that we're very familiar with, and they underwrite. That's the other part of the story.","I could talk about capital recycling, but as a first step in any acquisition we adhere to our discipline that you've heard me talk about many times over the course of 2017. The first step is to develop a 10-year pro forma taking into account all the CapEx needs that we believe are appropriate in a 10-year plan, and then making realistic assumptions about the near-term performance of these assets, looking at revenue generators and expense savings and building out a pro forma that also is reflective of the cyclicality of the industry that we're in, looking at a reasonable exit cap rate on the back-end and discounting those unlevered cash flows back to target a return over our cost of capital of 100 basis points to 150 basis points. So that's the first screen that we look at on any deal and we looked at it on this deal and it passed muster. I can't say it enough times. We're really delighted. We have a great relationship with Hyatt. They are great to collaborate with and we've always worked with Hyatt in partnership.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We will now move to our next question today from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned in your guidance, you're including some disruption associated with the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco. Could you quantify that a little bit and kind of maybe talk about the timing of the improvements there in relationship to the Moscone Center coming back online next year?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, Smedes.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we had contemplated renovating Moscone, not renovating, but reinventing and transforming a great asset in a great market in 2020. And then of course we all know what's happening in San Francisco next year. I think the last I looked, there was about 1.6 million group room nights on the books being generated by Moscone. And we balanced and did the analysis of should we renovate this year or should we wait into 2020. We think 2020 is going to be another terrific year in San Francisco.","So we made a decision to pull the renovation forward and to put us in a position so that we can participate in the growth in San Francisco with a really truly reinvented hotel, which we believe will allow us to significantly increase our yield index in the property and drive more cash flow to the bottom line. The incremental disruption this year as a result of doing that, which is already included in our guidance, is about $5 million.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will now go to our next question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. One of the key changes to your release was the increased disclosures around the top 40 hotels. Can you just talk about that a little bit more and if any hotels you just want to highlight, that'd be helpful? Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I just think, Thomas, as we talk again, listening to the sell-side and the buy-side, your thirst for greater transparency, greater disclosure, giving you the opportunity to better understand the company and the assets that we have and how they perform, we listened, we heard, we provided. And really, at this point in time, it's nothing more than that.","I think that the top 40 provide a really good picture of the quality of this company, the quality of the EBITDA, the valuation of those assets. Take the Kea Lani Palace, which is on Maui, which is the top asset in our portfolio; we didn't provide EBITDA per key, but you can certainly do the math. And if you do the math, you'll see that the Kea Lani Palace is generating $90,000 per key of EBITDA. So, I just don't know how many folks really had a good handle on the performance of these top 40 hotels and we thought it was important to highlight them.","Additionally, as Michael mentioned, we also provided seven additional markets to give you a bit more granular look into Florida, as an example, where we have properties on the West Coast. We have properties in Orlando. We have properties on the East Coast. So the various submarkets in Florida, now you're going to be able to have a better gauge on what's coming out of each of those markets and how they're performing. And I think we truly are being very transparent here. I mean, we put a list in of our ground leases, our capital structure, debt statistics, so it's all in one place. You can go find it. You can download the information. And we're happy to answer questions.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. I'm sure we'll have a lot. Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I know you will.","Operator","Thank you. We'll go to our next question now from Harry Curtis from Nomura. Please go ahead.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Good morning. A quick question on the $1 billion of investment, is there a much incremental ROIC CapEx that you expect in this portfolio? And related to that, if the answer is no, as you look ahead, do you think that you'll be seeking incremental acquisitions that really don't require the kind of CapEx that, say, The Phoenician has?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. Harry, it's a two part question. So let me answer the first part of your question and then we can talk about the second part. Obviously, as we underwrote this deal and evaluated the transaction, we identified certain ROI opportunities. As an example, at the Andaz Maui, part of the consideration includes an entitled parcel of land at the property to add 19 villa units. Now, we bought the land. It's a dead asset. We're paying real estate taxes on the land. We haven't underwritten the value that we would derive from developing those 19 units. And I think we've got a pretty good track record here, given what we've accomplished at The Phoenician. So we're excited about that one.","There are other opportunities at the Andaz. As an example just putting a luau in place, those are real moneymakers. We have that experience up at the Hyatt Ka'anapali. At the Grand San Francisco, we will look at the opportunity to add eight keys to that property. We're looking at the re-concepting of the restaurant and room service.","So, yeah, there are opportunities around all these hotels. Those are things that we didn't underwrite in the context of the acquisition. With respect to other assets that are out there that we're evaluating, we're not far enough long at this point on any additional acquisition for me to give you color around capital needs, capital spend, but the one thing I can assure you is that that's all taken into consideration in our underwriting.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Instinet","Very good. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Shaun Kelly from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning, everyone. Jim or Michael, I think one of your peers yesterday discussed a little bit about possible sale disruptions at some of the Marriott hotels. Is that something you could comment on, just given that you guys have a lot of exposure there and you're probably the best to kind of give us your insights?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Shaun, are you talking about the integration of the Starwood Hotels into the Marriott platform. Is that....","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","...exactly, that was the context.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, we've been working closely with Marriott since the day they announced that they were acquiring Starwood. And there is always a little bit of uncertainty early in the process as the two programs are migrated together. We are very comfortable with the direction that this is taking. And not only are we comfortable with it, we're excited about it. Because when the Starwood legacy hotels that we own are merged into the Marriott sales system, we expect to see increases in revenue, increases in yield index going forward. So we've been on it from day one and it's not a concern to us.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So nothing specific on the sales organizations or anything that's changed in the last couple of months as it relates to trying to combine, whether it group sales efforts or anything else?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","They're putting new leadership in place. I mean, this is actually a question probably better asked to Marriott, but I can tell you that they're putting new leadership in place. They are putting the organization in place. They are putting the final bells and whistles on it and about ready to tie a bow here.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Easy enough. Thank you very much.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Rich Hightower from Evercore.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey, morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Rich.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","I just want to go back to some of the prepared comments around business transient commentary and I think we've been hearing a pretty consistent message for some time now that even though there's broad-based optimism on the part of corporate entities and CEOs, we're not seeing that show up necessarily in the demand patterns. And I'm curious as to why you think that might be happening. Is it just a function of kind of a choppy calendar for the first part of the year? Is there something else underlying that? I mean, what's Host's broader perspective on why we're not seeing that yet?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Rich, I think that the statistic that we follow with respect to the business traveler and group business is really business investment. And business investment for 2016 was negative 50 basis points. For 2017, it was 4.6%. For 2018, as of February, the forecast is 5.6%, so it's trending in the right direction.","And I think that over the course of 2017, in particular, there was a lot of uncertainty out there regarding whether or not we were going to have a tax bill. There was uncertainty just generally given what was happening in Washington, D.C. I think that now that the tax bill's in place, corporations are still digesting what the bill means to them. But I can tell you that the commentary that we have is people are feeling much better about the economy. They're feeling better about spending money and investing. And when they feel better about investing, that means that they're going to travel, and they're going to come back to our hotels.","So in past cycles, we have seen business travel, business transient accelerate when the business investment forecast gets up about 8%. So we're moving in the right direction, and that's why we're cautiously optimistic.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","One quick follow-up there, do you think that timing-wise, I mean, maybe after the Easter comp gets out of the way, that we would start to see some of the fruits of what you're talking about really show up in the numbers or we just don't have an idea yet?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I wish I could tell you yes. If I thought that, Rich, I wouldn't be holding back on you. I'd put it in our guidance. It's just too soon to tell. I think we saw a January that was stronger than we anticipated, based on budgets that were completed in November. We had a 300 basis point swing in January, from minus 1% to plus 2%. And that gives you a high degree of comfort, but I think it's too early to bake an acceleration of RevPAR as a result of the return of the business traveler into our numbers this year. One month doesn't make a trend.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Got it. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and welcome aboard, Michael.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","If I can squeak in maybe a two-parter, just first one was just what details can you share about the key terms of the management agreement with Hyatt for the three-pack that you guys purchased, just curious what you can talk about there? And then, maybe as a second question, I think there's long been a perception that Host has a segment of its portfolio in hotels that may be submarket dominant, but ultimately have lower growth prospects or have capital needs down the road, for example, airport or suburban hotels. Do you see this as a good moment to look at monetizing those sorts of assets or do you feel that they may be providing some earnings stability for the company?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Jeff, I'll answer your second question first. We have no systematic disposition plan in place for this year. I think that over the course of 2017, you saw us opportunistically sell hotels for a variety of reasons. And this year, of course, we've announced that we're going to sell the W Lex. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to dispose of assets that are in slower growth markets with higher CapEx needs and lower RevPAR assets. Are we sitting here today saying that we're going to package up $2 billion or $3 billion? We're not saying that. And the reason we're not saying it is because we really like what we own today.","And we continue to invest in our assets. There's obviously a differential between capital allocation to an asset like The Fairmont Kea Lani or the Hyatt Ka'anapali or the San Francisco Marriott Moscone (sic) [Marquis] relative to a suburban hotel. But there is nothing on the table right now to suggest that we're going to just blow out a bunch of those properties.","With respect to the management contract, I would tell you it's a market contract. The terms are proprietary. And really, it's a long-term contract, but beyond that, I really am not in a position to comment on it.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Gregory Miller from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Greg.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. I'm on the line for Patrick Scholes. Could you elaborate on your views of potentially disposing some of your international assets, particularly in an environment of recent RevPAR strength in some of the regions? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, as we discussed, we sold our assets in New Zealand. We sold the Hilton Melbourne last year, which took us out of both Australia and New Zealand. And there had been another Four Points that we owned in Perth, Australia that we sold a couple of years ago, several years ago. We have three hotels in Brazil, one in Mexico and two in Canada, as well as our interest in our European JV.","So from our perspective again, it's we start with the fundamentals. And the fundamental is what do we think asset's worth to us versus what is the market prepared to pay us for it. And that's the screen that we do on every asset, whether it's international or in the U.S. So, of course, if we are looking at the potential exit of an investment in a market where RevPAR is accelerating, we'll take that into consideration when we determine what we think the whole value is of that hotel.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now move to our next question from Robin Farley from UBS.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, guys, this is actually Raffi on for Robin. Just had two quick questions, first on group, what was the group pace in the quarter for 2018 and 2019?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I'm sorry, the current group pace for 2018? We have...","Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC","In the quarter, yeah. Yeah, for 2018 and 2019.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think that group pace has been around 2% in the quarter for 2018. 2019, I don't have that number in front of me. We're really focused on 2018 right now, but it's probably around the same, I would think, at this point.","Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, the last one is since kind of this overhang of the uncertainty over tax reform has kind of cleared up, what have you kind of seen in the change of behavior from buyers and sellers out there in the transaction market?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, frankly, over the course of 2017, we underwrote a number of transactions that would fit the profile of asset that we would like to own. We obviously weren't able to come to terms with a transaction that underwrote to our requirements. This year, we're hearing that there may be a few more assets of this ilk coming to market. Nothing's in the market right now.","I talked recently with an investor who owns some high-end hotels, of course, to gauge this individual's interest as to whether or not they might want to consider talking to us about selling them, and the response was given the interest rate environment that we're in, we just put 15-year financing on the properties and we're really not interested in disposing.","So I think that you'll see owners of hotels become sellers of hotels if they have unique reasons to do so. And one of the unique reasons that Hyatt had was that they're going to asset-light. And they announced on their call last quarter, that they intended to sell $1.5 billion of hotels. So there has to be, I think, a particular reason why someone today would decide that it's time to sell when financing markets are still relatively attractive.","Raffi Bhardwaj - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll now go to our next question from Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys, and appreciate the expanded disclosures. Wanted to ask you the Starwood, Marriott question, but from a different angle, which is, we've heard that they are continuing to kind of cull the portfolio and I know that's a lot of Sheratons and maybe few other things. To the extent that you guys maybe have a little bit of visibility into that, what do you think the net impact on you competitively is in terms of where some of those assets end up versus the markets that they might be in where you have overlap?","James F.

Of course, it's going to be much better for us once the Sheraton brand standards are reinvented and pushed out to the system. And I think Marriott is really making great progress on that front. It's going to take them some time to make this happen. But I think they're very dedicated to fixing Sheraton. Starwood had tried a number of times and really couldn't seem to get to the finish line.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Cindy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels and Resorts Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.

You can find this information together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on today's call is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Greg Larson, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy.","This morning, Ed Walter will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results, and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2012. Larry Harvey will then provide greater detail on our third quarter results, including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, here's Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are very pleased to report our best overall operating results of this recovery as exceptionally strong group demand fostered solid rate growth across all segments of our business. As we will discuss in more detail, this strong rate growth also allowed us to generate meaningful improvement in our operating margins. Our third quarter performance, combined with continued strength in group bookings gives us the confidence to raise our guidance for the year. We feel very positive about the fundamentals in the business and our outlook, which I will discuss in more detail. First, let's review our results for the quarter.","Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the third quarter increased 7.6%, driven by an improvement in our average rate of 4.7%, combined with an occupancy increase of 2.1 percentage points. Our occupancy for the quarter was 78.4%, which gave us our second straight quarter where occupancy exceeded our prior peak level in 2007. Our average rate was $182 and RevPAR was $143. Comparable hotel food and beverage revenue grew 4.5%, driven more by growth in outlet sales as several of our recently renovated restaurants saw significant increases in activity.","The strong rate performance combined with tight cost controls and low utility rates, lead to an impressive 285 basis point increase in our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter and resulted in adjusted EBITDA of $241 million, which represents a 14% increase over the prior year.","Adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.21, an increase of 31%. On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 6.7%, driven by a 3.9% increase in average rate and a 2 percentage-point improvement in occupancy. Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 6.3%, combined with an adjusted operating profit margin that increased 170 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $764 million. This represented an increase of more than 14% over the prior year. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 15% to $0.69. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our operating results this quarter.","The key driver of our third quarter results was the robust 20% increase in corporate group demand, which led to a more than 6% increase in group room nights. Not surprisingly, our larger group hotels, especially those in Boston and several resort markets, outperformed the overall portfolio.","Our luxury hotels also experienced strong group activity, especially on the rate front as rates were up more than 6% in the quarter. Benefiting from both mix shift and higher absolute rates in both the corporate and discount segments, our average group rates were up almost 3.5% and group revenues were up nearly 10%.","As expected, the significant increase in group demand allowed our managers to focus on driving rate in our transient segments, which was the primary factor behind our transient revenue growth again this quarter. Overall rate growth was north of 5% and was spread fairly evenly across all major transient segments. We were pleased to see a 1.5% increase in retail room nights which further increased transient rates during -- through mix shift. Luxury transient demand also increased by more than 3%, further enhancing this trend.","With a focus on rates in our transient business, our transient room nights increased a modest 0.5%. The slight increase in demand combined with the improvement in rate led to a nearly 6% increase in transient revenue.","Looking at the fourth quarter and into next year, we continue to be encouraged by the positive trends in group business. While current booking activity or current quarter booking activity will likely slow somewhat because fewer room blocks are available, longer-term activity continues to be strong as overall bookings in the third quarter were up nearly 9% compared to the prior year. Even with the disruptive timing of several holidays and the election, group revenues on the books are up 7.5% for the fourth quarter.","Our activity for 2013 continues to show sequential improvement, with revenues on the books now 8% ahead of the prior year. The great majority of this improvement is happening in our larger group hotels, which are benefiting as customers begin to plan more proactively.","On the investment front, the company's European joint venture, in which we hold a 33% interest, acquired its first hotel in Germany, the 192-room Le M\u00e9ridien Grand Hotel in Nuremberg, for a total purchase price of $37 million. The recently renovated historic hotel is situated in a prime city center location near multiple cultural sites and benefits from 3 primary demand drivers: Leisure, corporate and convention. The metropolitan region of Nuremberg is a major economic hub in Germany with a significant number of national and international companies located in the area. It also represents one of the most important trade fair destinations in Germany.","Looking at this position, we are making good progress in our efforts to market several properties. We continue to expect that we will complete incremental sales in the $300 million to $400 million range. However, the sale market and timing of these transactions is difficult to predict. While we hope to complete these sales by the end of the year, it is likely that the closing of some of these transactions could spill over into early 2013.","In addition to our acquisition and disposition transactions, we have been very active this year on several value enhancement projects. These projects represent innovative uses of existing hotel space or excess land to enhance revenue or generate new revenue. An example of this type of project includes the transaction we announced in August, where we leased retail and signage space at the New York Marriott Marquis to Vornado Realty Trust. Vornado plans to invest approximately $140 million to redevelop and substantially expand the existing retail space, including the conversion of some of the below-grade parking to superior high-end retail space, as well as adding a 6-story block front LED signage that will dramatically improve both the hotel and the retail space present from Times Square. The new lease will generate substantial economic benefits to Host, our rent has already increased by more than $6 million annually, and we would expect significant additional rent increases as the project is completed and leased.","Another important value enhancement project I'd like to talk about is the time share development on excess land at our Hyatt Regency in Maui. We are in the advanced stages of negotiating a joint venture with Hyatt Residential Group to develop, sell and operate a 131-unit vacation ownership project on what is currently an ocean-front parking lot. This project features a 6,500 square foot open-air lobby with direct ocean sightline, a pool with a capacity for 400 deckchairs, a 3,000 square foot fitness center, an owners' lounge, provisions market and casual dining and poolside bar. The timeshare will have access to amenities at our existing resorts for which the residents will pay an amenity fee covered by the timeshare association dues.","In addition to the profit we expect to generate from the sale of the timeshare units, we also expect to benefit from synergies created with the existing hotel. These should include savings related to shared expenses, room sales in connection with marketing efforts or transition nights, as well as ancillary business capture in the spa, food and beverage outlets and retail shops.","Host's contribution to the venture will include a combination of its land as well as cash for its majority interest.","Finally, we are also expecting to create value from some underutilized tennis courts at the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa. We are under contract with a luxury homebuilder to sell 4.2 acres of excess land adjacent to the hotel, which has been approved for the development and sale of 79 luxury condominiums.","The successful execution of these innovative uses of existing space or unused land is expected to create future value to Host of approximately $400 million to $500 million.","With respect to capital reinvestment, it is worth noting that the grand opening of the new Westin New York Grand Central will occur later this week on October 12. This $80 million conversion of the hotel formerly known as the New York Helmsley Hotel, included the renovation of all of the guest rooms, lobby, public areas, heating and air-conditioning systems, the ballroom and meeting space, fitness center, as well as the creation of a new restaurant and bar. This will be the only the second Westin in Manhattan, and we believe the hotel will benefit greatly from being part of the Starwood system.","Now, let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Recent industry RevPAR results for September have been weaker and have raised concerns over the strength of the fourth quarter. As you are probably aware, the recent weakness in September was anticipated due to the timing of the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur holidays, and is not an indication of slowing trends. In addition, the midweek timing of Halloween and Election Day, as well as the early Hanukkah season, will likely have a negative impact on fourth quarter results, in part by condensing the number of weeks available for larger group meetings. However, these holidays have been anticipated and have been taken into consideration in our forecast for the full year. And even with the negative impact of the holidays this year, we expect our comparable hotel RevPAR to be stronger in the second half of 2012 than the first half of 2012, as lodging demand remains strong and pricing power improves.","As we have outlined today, we continue to see strong demand trends, especially in our group business. And with load supply in our markets, industry fundamentals are expected to remain solid for the fourth quarter and into next year.","With that in mind, and with our strong third quarter results, we now expect the comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase between 6.25% and 7%.","Our year-to-date margin performance, combined with the expectation that we can continue to drive strong flow-through for the remainder of the year, gives us the confidence to raise our margin guidance to an increase of 135 to 150 basis points for the year. Based on these RevPAR margin expectations, the mid-point of our guidance is increasing by more than $12 million, and we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.155 billion to $1.175 billion. This operating forecast will result in adjusted FFO per share of $1.06 to $1.09.","Looking at our dividend, we increased our third quarter common dividend to $0.08 per share. Our fourth quarter dividend will depend upon our final operating results and the gains we may generate on asset sales.","While it's premature to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR or revenue growth for 2013, we do believe that the fundamentals for our business continue to be attractive. We expect to enter next year with an occupancy level higher than we had in 2007, the strong booking pace I referenced and supply near record low of 0.5% in our markets. We are very confident that our managers will have success in negotiating higher Special Corporate rates this fall. Additionally, international travel continues to grow at a high-single digit rate, adding demand in our priority gateway markets. All of these factors should result in solid RevPAR growth in the coming year.","Thank you. And now, let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Larry K. Harvey","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Overall, we had an outstanding quarter in numerous markets. Our top-performing market was Philadelphia with a RevPAR increase of 20.8%. Occupancy improved over 11 percentage points, driven by both group and transient demand, while rate increased 3%. Both the Downtown Marriott and the Four Seasons had another exceptional quarter with excellent growth in rooms and F&B revenues.","Results for the quarter benefited from the 2011 rooms and meeting space renovations at the Downtown Marriott. We expect our Philadelphia hotels to underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter due to a decline in group and transient demand, as well as a renovation at the Philadelphia Airport Marriott.","RevPAR for our Tampa hotels exceeded our expectations with RevPAR up 18.8%. Our Tampa Waterside Marriott hosted the Republican National Convention and the RevPAR growth was driven by improvements in ADR for both group and transient business for the quarter.","Our Boston hotels had an outstanding quarter, with RevPAR growth of 15.4%. ADR increased over 12% and occupancy increased more than 2 points to over 88%. The outperformance was driven by strong group demand which allowed us to benefit from rate compression for both group and transient business. We expect our Boston hotels to have a good fourth quarter due to strength in group revenues and an expectation of continuing strong transient rates.","Our San Francisco hotels continued to exceed our expectations, as RevPAR increased 12.7% due to an ADR improvement of over 9% and roughly a 3 percentage point increase in occupancy. The strong occupancy level of 88% allowed our operators to shift the mix of business to higher rated transient segments. We expect our San Francisco hotels to continue to perform very well in the fourth quarter as strong group and transient demand will allow us to continue to drive rate.","Our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had a great quarter as RevPAR improved 11.4%, well above our expectations. Average rate increased 9%, while occupancy was up nearly 2 percentage points. Both transient and group demand performed well. We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to have a good fourth quarter due to solid group bookings.","Our Los Angeles hotels had RevPAR growth of 9.1%. Strong group demand created compression to drive both group and transient rate. ADR increased nearly 5%, while occupancy improved by more than 3 percentage points to nearly 88%. We expect our Los Angeles hotels to have a great fourth quarter due to robust group and transient demand.","Our Hawaiian hotels continue to perform well with RevPAR up 7.7%, almost all of which was due to increased rate. Strong group and transient demand allowed the hotels to shift the mix of business to higher-rated categories. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to have a good fourth quarter.","RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 4.6% due to occupancy growth of over 2 percentage points and a 2.1% increase in ADR. Results were affected by renovations at 3 hotels. Driving ADR growth in New York had been challenging this year, and we expect that trend to continue in the fourth quarter.","As we expected, our Chicago hotels underperformed our portfolio due to lower levels of city-wide and group demand when compared to the third quarter of 2011. RevPAR increased 3.5%, driven by an increase in rate of nearly 3% and a slight improvement in occupancy. We expect our Chicago hotels to perform much better in the fourth quarter due to better group and transient demand.","Our Washington, D.C. hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 80 basis points. ADR increased roughly 1%, while occupancy fell over 1.5 percentage points. Both group and transient demand were weak as there was little activity on Capitol Hill and electioneer activities were outside of D.C. Results in the quarter were hurt by the rooms renovation at the Hyatt Regency on Capitol Hill. We have a series of meeting space and rooms renovations scheduled for the fourth quarter, and we expect D.C. to continue to underperform the portfolio. We expect 2013 to be a better year for D.C.","Year-to-date, Philadelphia has been our best-performing market with a RevPAR increase of 24.5%, followed by Boston with a RevPAR increase of 11.6%, and Houston with a 10.5% increase. Our worst-performing market has been San Antonio, with a RevPAR decrease of 2.8%.","Our European joint venture operating results continued to exceed our expectations. Excluding the Sheraton Roma, which is under a major renovation, RevPAR calculated in constant euros increased 4.1% for the quarter. EBITDA margins improved 120 basis points, and EBITDA was up over 9%.","The JV has high quality assets and the average rate for the portfolio was EUR 200 for the quarter. As we previously discussed, inbound travel to the Eurozone from the U.S., U.K. and Asia and the Middle East continues to be strong and is a major source of euro-lodging demand.","The Hotel Arts Barcelona, the Sheraton Warsaw and the Brussels Marriott all had strong RevPAR increases for the quarter, while the Westin Palace Milan struggled.","Year-to-date, excluding the Sheraton Roma, pro forma RevPAR in constant euros is up 3.8% and EBITDA margins increased 150 basis points, while EBITDA was up over 10%.","For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 285 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a per occupied basis were up only 1.4%. Despite a big increase in revenue, costs that are variable with revenues, such as sales and marketing and cluster and shared service allocations, were well controlled.","General and administrative, sales and marketing and repairs and maintenance increased only 3.2%. Utility costs were down 9.6% as natural gas rates declined nearly 17% and electricity rates fell roughly 7%.","Even with the hot summer weather, our energy consumption dropped as our considerable investments in energy and ROI projects over the last few years continued to reduce our utility costs.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that comparable hotel RevPAR will be driven by both occupancy and rate growth. But rate growth should be increasingly more important in the fourth quarter as we're approaching full year 2007 peak levels of occupancy. The additional rate growth should lead to solid rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit cost. While somewhat difficult to predict, we are anticipating lower growth in F&B revenue and profitability in the fourth quarter of this year due to an unfavorable comparison with 2011 where F&B revenue grew 6.8%, as well as the anticipated impact of a challenging holiday and election calendar. We expect unallocated cost to increase in line with inflation, particularly for sales and marketing, where higher revenues will increase cost. We also expect utilities to decline in the quarter, albeit at a much lower level of decline than we experienced in the third quarter.","We have had tremendous success relative to our expectations for this year in reducing our property taxes. We expected a property tax increase of roughly 9% for 2012. At this point, we expect a full year increase in the 6% area, as we have been successful in reducing several current year assessments and challenging prior year assessments.","Comparable hotel margins in the third quarter benefited from a $3 million reduction in prior year property tax assessments. However, we do expect an increase in property taxes in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect full year comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 135 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 150 basis points at the high end of the range.","In the quarter, we continue to take advantage of the favorable debt markets by extending debt maturities and reducing our overall cost of debt. We closed on a $500 million credit facility term loan that has a 5-year maturity and an all-in floating interest rate of approximately 2% based on our current leverage level. In addition, we issued $450 million of senior notes that mature in 2023 and bear interest at 4.75%, the lowest senior notes coupon in the history of the company. A substantial portion of these proceeds were used to repay debt with an average rate of over 6.6%. Since the beginning of the year, we have reduced our weighted average interest rate by 80 basis points and extended our weighted average debt maturity by one year to 5.4 years. We ended the quarter with $254 million of cash and cash equivalents and $751 million of available capacity under our credit facility.","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Ed, I wonder if you could just expand a little bit on the calendar issues. I actually have a couple of questions on this. But first, kind of simply, can you give us calendar third quarter RevPAR results for your portfolio and September results for your portfolio?","W. Edward Walter","David, we don't have September yet. We haven't really gotten much of the reporting in on a number of the monthly hotels at this point in time. I think our sense of what calendar would be for us for the third quarter would be just short of 6%. So still a pretty good quarter relative to the industry, but I think you're right in identifying it's not quite as strong as our headline number.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And any sense for the last few weeks of September or the first week of October? Is that about where you thought relative to expectations? Or was it weaker or stronger?","W. Edward Walter","No, I think, we had recognized a while ago that the timing of the Jewish holidays both sort of affecting group travel during the week and I think the prior year, one of the holidays, I believe, was on the weekend and the other was near the -- better positioned within the week. We knew it was going to be a difficult comparison year-over-year. So there was -- there really hasn't been any surprise out of that. It obviously does not look great when you get a few weeks. But to be honest, as we tried to highlight in our comments relative to the -- in our outlook, I think the fourth quarter -- we feel very good about the fourth quarter in general. So especially these last 3 months of the year, our bookings are very strong. Our transient bookings are very strong. So we don't see what happened in September as a sign of weakness for the fourth quarter. We think it was simply one of those year-over-year problems that happens in our business. We -- I think everyone should recognize that it probably will be a bit of a choppy fourth quarter because between the other items that we mentioned, Halloween, the election, early Hanukkah, all of those things are going to cause the results, I think, to be more abnormal than normal. And so we're going to see some great weeks and we're going to see some not so great weeks. But overall, as we assess it, and we obviously, we improved our guidance based on both the third quarter strength, but also the sense that the fourth quarter overall would continue to be strong.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's very helpful. On the group piece of that, given your comments about fewer group weeks, fewer weeks basically that are easy for groups to book meetings, do you think there will be less meetings overall? Do you think it will broaden the geography of where those meetings are held, as in a broader set of hotels or more markets? Or do you think that it'll just be more meetings in the weeks that can have meetings?","W. Edward Walter","I would suspect that at the corporate level, it will be the latter. Is that their corporate activity will be more condensed, and that may mean that other hotels benefit than might normally not have. The overall, as we look at the quarter, we are still expecting group to be, certainly, up meaningfully in the fourth quarter. We do not expect group to be as strong in Q4 as it was in Q3 but that we had a pretty remarkable Q3 in group.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I guess that means that overall, ADR in those weeks should be very, very good.","W. Edward Walter","That's what you would hope.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions or 2 topics. First is just on acquisitions. Just, I know this is a small amount, but I think acquisition cost guidance went down by $1 million from last quarter to this quarter for the full year. Was there anything behind that? And as you look to 2013, would you expect to be, given current market conditions, a net buyer or net seller? And then just more specifically, New York. I just want to focus in here on the supply picture, it seems that there's going to be a lot coming online, has come online, and even on the next couple of years, more will come online. What's your broader outlook for New York and how do you currently assess your current exposure to the market?","W. Edward Walter","Okay. On the $1 million change in acquisition cost, Larry, do you have a comment on that?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes. The actual acquisition cost on the Grand Hyatt was lower than we expected. So that was part of the forecast. So that's the reason for that.","W. Edward Walter","So that's a good reason for that to have dropped. As we look at 2013, I would say that while we are certainly happy with the disposition pricing that we seem to be attracting on the asset that we're looking at selling, I also think that we -- still fairly comfortable, but this is going to be an extended cycle. And so, I would expect that we would continue to be active in 2013. Whether it's we're net acquirer or a net seller probably depends more on how attractive are the actual acquisition opportunities that develop over the course of 2013. But I think, by and large, our intent is to continue to be active in the year. And if I were -- if I try to plan it out perfectly, I'd probably say we'd probably be about neutral in 2013. In New York, the supply challenges in New York continue. Our sense is that they are going to slowly but surely abate. When we look at our New York results, I mean, some of the softness that we experienced this year was relative to supply, but a lot of it is relative to levels of construction that just hit practically every hotel we have in the market. I think literally every hotel had some sort of construction going on this summer. So we still feel pretty good about New York. We certainly like the presence, the hotels that we've acquired in that market. We feel good about how they are positioned. We are certainly looking forward to seeing what our operating results will be next year with full rooms renovation at the Westin -- the W Union Square. The Helmsley will be open for business with no construction. The W in Lexington has also had some construction this year, that it won't be replicated next year. We're feeling pretty good about how New York should play out next year for us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","2012 was a big year, a sizable year in terms of capital investments, and this might be kind of more of an arts and science. But when you look back to the first 3 quarters of this year and what you're anticipating for the fourth quarter, what do you sort of quantify as the impact to EBITDA from renovation disruption? And then as you think about next year and in terms of capital investments, I guess just directionally as we're all trying to figure out forecasts for next year, do you anticipate whatever that renovation disruption was in '12, do you expect that to be more or less the same, a little bit less in '13?","W. Edward Walter","Joe, I don't know that we're in a position to give you a precise answer on what the impact is from capital from one year to the next. I mean, it's so much is dependent upon the particular hotel that certainly, we know that there has been impact this year. We have had a very full capital program in 2012. And so whether it's in New York or whether it affects some other markets across the country -- San Francisco had a fair amount of work done there, too -- it's really hard for us to give you any kind of a legitimate number there. I would say that as we are in the process now of discussing our capital budgets for next year with our operators, and I think we're fairly comfortable that our capital spending in 2013 will decline compared to the levels that we had in 2012, and it should be by a fairly significant amount.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ed, I don't know if you intentionally left it out, I missed it, you're not going to mention it. But I will ask, with the timeshare JV, how much will you guys be contributing to that?","W. Edward Walter","I'd love to give you that answer, but we are -- we literally concluded with Hyatt that we were going to wait until we had really finished all the documentation and a couple of other issues before we were going to provide more detail. So we'd obviously love to talk about it a little bit more. It's a project that we've worked on for a long time. It's a tremendous use of some available land at that property. But I think we're just going to need to wait a few more weeks before we give any more specific details.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So we'll anxiously await that. And then on -- you guys went through the different regions, very nice detail as usual. Just wondering if we could touch upon Canada for a moment. That was up very nicely. Just wondering how much of that was FX and what was the local currency RevPAR change there?","W. Edward Walter","I think what I would tell you is it was -- a lot of the increase there was at this particular quarter, the benefit from currency. We did have -- there was -- it was a positive RevPAR growth on a year-over-year basis, but certainly, some of the lift that we saw there came from currency, too.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then so -- okay. And then, this might be a little bit backwards looking and you might have touched upon this in one of your prior answers, but when we were having -- on the last call, you had said that you had anticipated that RevPAR growth in the third quarter, RevPAR trends in the third quarter would be similar to that of the second quarter. Clearly, there was a nice uptick. Just wondering, did you see something stronger out of group in the quarter or during the quarter, since July, than you would have anticipated. I'm just trying to figure out what changed.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I would say it was 2 things. I think what was a -- the first was that, as the booking cycles lengthened a little bit, at least in comparison to prior years, maybe not in comparison to historical times back in the earlier part of the last decade. But I'd say our -- the rooms that we had booked in the -- for the third quarter held up very well, meaning that at the end of the day, our group demand for the third quarter didn't -- and we booked almost as many rooms in the quarter as we had the prior year. And so, at the end of the day, we hadn't really expected that our final group revenue growth would be nearly 10% in the third quarter. I think that was really the big positive surprise from our perspective. And so it was the combination of continuing to book rooms in the quarter, for the quarter, and then, as we discussed, that gave us -- it gave the properties the opportunity to be fairly aggressive on rate. So what you ended up seeing in a variety of different ways is we had better retail business and our overall rate growth in all segments was relatively strong. But ultimately, I think it all -- for us, it all started with the group.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last housekeeping. You just -- you raised your CapEx guidance by about $25 million since the last quarter. Is that just finalizing budgets, or is there something new in there?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I think there's a couple of things going on there. Some of that is we have found -- we have accelerated, in some cases, some CapEx into 2012 that we might have thought was going to carry -- end up occurring in 2013. And I think that happened both on the maintenance side and a little bit on some of the properties where we were doing acquisition CapEx. So I wouldn't call it -- I don't think there was any new projects that were approved. It was really just a function of whether things were going to happen before year end or after year end.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with LM -- I'm sorry, MLV & Company.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick things. First of all, maybe I missed this as Larry was going through some of the things that impacted margins in the quarter. But you guys had fantastic margins this quarter. You're up 170 bps year-to-date, you said. But your guidance actually implies 4Q margin growth materially slowing to I guess, roughly 60 to 100 bps. Can you give us some color as to what's going on as to why margins would be slowing? Was that some of the strength in margins got pulled through into the third quarter out of the fourth quarter? Or is there something else going on?","W. Edward Walter","It's a little bit of that. I think one of the -- so probably, the best example of that is what Larry was describing on the real estate tax front. At the end of the day, our year-to-date taxes have grown at less than inflation. But we're still expecting, by the end of the year, to be up close to 6% in terms of taxes. So part of what's happening is the bulk of that increase in taxes is occurring in the fourth quarter. We have a little bit of the same sort of thing happening with insurance, too. And so it -- what I would say overall is that the combination of a couple of things like these items that are ending up being heavy in the fourth quarter, which we've always anticipated, is just that -- I think it shows up a bit more now because of the strength that we had during the summer in terms of margins, are causing the problem. The other element of it is that as you look at food and beverage and you look at other revenue, probably not quite as optimistic there as we were earlier in the year. And so a little bit lower revenue growth there is also weighing slightly on margins in that relative context. I think coming back to the -- probably the most fundamental point though is when we look at where we started in the year, which was well -- the mid-point in our guidance was well below 100 basis points in margin improvement, and looking at where we are now, where we're in the 135 to 150 range of improvement, we couldn't be happier with the progress that we've been able to make on improving our flow-through over the course of 2012.","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Last 3 quarters, you guys have gradually, actually had guidance up across the board, RevPAR margins, EBITDA, recurring FFO, et cetera, which is obviously nice to see. But I'm wondering, if you could take a step back and tell us, was it that you were more conservative at the start of the year and that's one of the reasons why your guidance was a little more cautious, then obviously, what you've seen throughout the course of the year. Or is it that over the course of the year, trends have really perked up that much more than you were expecting?","W. Edward Walter","Are you asking me whether we sandbagged at the beginning of the year? Or...","Ryan Meliker - McNicoll, Lewis & Vlak LLC, Research Division","Oh, I would never say that.","W. Edward Walter","No, the reality is that we did. I think we try to approach all of these numbers with what we hope is a balanced level of conservatism. But I think at the end of the day, we've been pleasantly -- if you look at the top line, the top line has actually grown more than we had expected at the beginning of the year too. We started the year thinking 4% to 6%, and now we're talking -- so call it a mid-point of 5%. And now we're looking at a mid-point in our RevPAR that's in the upper 6s. So I think it's -- that's a huge contributor to the improvement and just because a lot of that's happened in rate, which flows through very well. Larry commented on a couple of areas where we've been happy in terms of what's transpired. We saved money in real estate taxes that we hadn't counted on. I've been very happy with the efforts that we've made on the asset management side in working with our operators to, especially over the course of these last 2 or 3 quarters, our unallocated costs or support costs -- G&A, sales and marketing, repair and maintenance -- all of those numbers have stayed fairly low over these last 3 quarters, and I think that's contributed to margins. And then the last factor that is so hard to predict but certainly has been a huge benefit this year, is the reduction in utility costs. We've seen reductions in rates. It's remarkable to me that as hot as this summer was, at least from the perspective we had here in Washington, it's remarkable to think with fully occupied hotels, our energy consumption actually declined. And it's good to see that the investments we've made in energy efficiency are paying off in terms of less consumption, which is part of the reason why our utility costs are down as much as they are.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ed, just a question on dispositions and capital recycling. With the CMBS market so strong, have you changed your thinking about dispositions activity? I heard there's a chance you guys might have more coming to market. And maybe you could rank for us how you see uses of capital. Is Europe the most interesting opportunity today for you guys? Or is it something closer to home like continued investment in renovations or deals here in the U.S.?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, let's start with the first question about sales. I think, first, I think you're right that the CMBS market does seem to be strengthening, and we hope that, that proves to be a continuing trend because we would expect that, that would be a source of financing, not the only one, but a key source of financing for folks who are buying properties from us. I think we made it clear that we intend to be a fairly active seller over the course of the next few years. I think a lot of that has to do with just our approach in trying to overall -- improve the overall quality of our portfolio. One way you do that is by buying the sorts of assets we've bought, but the other is by selling assets in markets that ultimately don't fit our -- the strategy for the company going forward. So we're pleased to see the developments on the financing side and tend to be active through the, certainly active through the end of this year. And I am sure our targets for next year in terms of sales will be even more aggressive than what we have discussed today for 2012. Jeff, I forgot the last part of your last segment of your question. What was that again?","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, I was just asking how you would rank where you would actually put capital to work. If it's -- is Europe the most interesting opportunity to you today? Or is it something closer to home, like renovations or even your stock or just acquisitions here in the U.S.?","W. Edward Walter","I think, right now, it's really going to be driven by what looks to provide the best opportunity. So certainly, we still expect that the bulk of our investment is going to happen in the States. As you can tell from the purchase of the Nuremberg hotel, we're still looking in Europe and our partners are still very interested in trying to buy there. We're not seeing a lot of competition there. And we appear to be one of the few firms that are active there that can access financing, so we do have some competitive advantages there. But we're also at the same point in time trying to be somewhat cautious in the way we approach Europe for all the reasons that I'm sure are obvious. So I think we continue to be interested in looking at investments in Brazil. And we are pursuing some investments in Asia, too. But I'd still come back to the main point that as I think about '13, if it could work out the way I'd like it to, I would expect that the bulk of the sales proceeds we generate would go towards investments in the U.S.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just 2 quick questions. On group trends, I think earlier in the year, you guys were talking about situation where groups were showing up and sort of upscaling their event, if you will, in the days prior to the event. Are you still seeing that trend or are companies maybe getting a bit more frugal?","W. Edward Walter","I think we're still seeing it, although it's -- I don't know that we saw it as much during the summer. But I think some of that relates to the type of business that you tend to get in the summer in group anyway, which tends to be a little bit lower priced. So we'll get a better read on that in terms of what happens in the fourth quarter. One trend that we have had described to us that's consistent with what you just described is that the groups continue to not necessarily commit to a lot of food and beverage unless they're forced to. But we're still hearing of instances where they are showing up and a week or 2 out starting to raise their F&B spend. So I think it will be interesting to see exactly where food and beverage spend comes out in the fourth quarter. It is notoriously difficult to predict, despite the fact that we do try to do that every quarter. And certainly, the fourth quarter this year, just because of some of the holiday issues and other things, it's probably a little bit more complex than normal.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And just a last question. I know you didn't provide 2013 guidance. But do you have a reaction to Marriott's guidance for next year? Do you -- I guess, my question is, do you share their confidence, given negotiated rate in group trends, or do your hotels lead you to maybe have a different, maybe more conservative outlook?","W. Edward Walter","I want to be careful about doing it backdoor. But I think it should have been clear from the comments that I made at the end of my prepared remarks is that we're not putting a specific number on it. We feel really good about next year. It's just hard to -- you look at our starting point, where we're expecting that we're going to have more occupied rooms at the end of this year than we did in '07, we'll still be short of where we were in 2000 -- in 1999 and 2000. So we'd still see room to grow on the occupancy side. We don't think we've peaked there. But given the starting point of that high level of occupancy, combined with the level of group activity that we're expecting based on our advanced bookings, we see some occupancy increase and we see a lot of rate increase next year. So all in all, we're not seeing any signs that make us less bullish on 2013. We feel good about it at this point, and we obviously will look forward to giving a lot more insight into that in our February call as we get into 2013.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Looking at your balance sheet, will you look to retire the balance of the Series Q notes that are 6 3\/4%, and potentially, the Series 9 that are -- you can do the make hold [ph] with in 2013?","Larry K. Harvey","Those are the 2 bond deals that we are focused on, but we don't have a short-term plan to do that right now, Wes. It's something -- we've refinanced a lot of debt. Ed talked a little bit about asset sales and other things, but at the end of the day, we expect to generate a fair amount of free cash flow and other things. So we'll evaluate as appropriate with the market where the credit markets are. But we had a great year on the refinancing side and dropping our weighted average interest rate, getting that weighted average debt maturity over 5. So it's something we evaluate on an opportunistic basis. And those are 2 with a little bit of a bullet on them, so.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Yes, you've definitely been busy. Looking at the Vornado deal, do you expect any renovation impact, or I guess, redevelopment impact next year while you're doing the redevelopment, to the operator?","W. Edward Walter","I always hesitate to say -- to answer that and say, \"No, we don't expect any.\" Because inevitably, we're surprised at some point in time with some effect. But the reality is, is we think that the activity that they're going to have is separate enough from what's going on at the hotel that we would expect it to be fairly minimal.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Your RevPAR guidance at the mid-point moved up, but the hotel top line mid-point went down. Is the disconnect there just the food and beverage comp in Q4 being tough? Is that why the total hotel top line mid-point is going down while RevPAR is going up?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, that's the reason for that.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then just sort on your group business, when you look out, do you have concerns about kind of crowding out high-rate transient business when your group rates, I think you said were up 3.5% and your forward bookings are now up, I think you said, in the quarter, were up 9% for the forward year. Do you worry about at what point you are committing to more rooms that have lower rates than what maybe the overall RevPAR increase would be?","W. Edward Walter","No, that's a great question and a great thought. But we're -- if you kind of look at where we stand right now, we are still -- we're actually doing more transient business today on an occupancy basis than we were in '07. We're still doing less group business than we were in '07. So I think as we think about what's likely to drive the most overall profitability in our hotel, more group is -- would be a benefit to us. Not only is -- it's not just a rate game, because remember that we do get better food and beverage spend -- more profitable food and beverage spend out of groups. So increasing our group -- our overall percentage of our business's group will be helpful from that standpoint. But also, on the transient side, what will happen as we continue to add group into the hotel is, what we'll be displacing is not the highly rated corporate transient, we'll be displacing the more lowly rated discount transient. And so the net effect is that we should benefit, not only from higher absolute rates, but also from some mix shift because of that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Smedes Rose with KBW.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a little more about Europe because it sounds like your hotels and your JV there are holding up fairly well in light of what's happening there. But so on the transaction side, could you comment on the, maybe the valuation around the hotel you acquired in Germany? And just kind of in general, maybe what you're seeing in terms of the amount of property that's on the market and kind of where cap rates are heading. Are valuations kind of steady? Just sort of a general -- your thoughts there.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, it's interesting, Smedes. It's a good question. And as, first of all, as it relates to Nuremberg. We were -- this was a very unique opportunity. It developed very quickly. And we had an opportunity to buy the hotel because we had previously bought hotels from this group and we had been able to close relatively expeditiously. So I think they had a high level of confidence in our ability to purchase the hotel and purchase it quickly. We bought it all cash. We intend to finance it. And while, as I mentioned, it's not easy necessarily to get financing in Europe, the nice thing is that because it's a smaller German-based asset, there is a fairly liquid market in Germany that will provide the sort of 50% loan-to-value financing that we like to put on our assets in the JV. So we're expecting to be able to finance that at rates that would actually sound attractive in the U.S., so somewhere probably south of 4%. The pricing here was -- we also thought was fairly attractive. We bought this for about a 10 EBITDA multiple. Cap rate was 8.5 or so. So I think all the measures about this deal, for an asset that we're buying significantly below replacement cost in a great location within the city, all sort of came together pretty well. Not every deal that we're looking at in Europe, of course, has these kinds of metrics. But I think we feel relatively good about the pricing that we're looking at in Europe on the transactions we're evaluating. And wherever, we are certainly looking at things with a conservative eye for this year and next and really sort of thinking more in terms of returning to stabilized levels of growth much further out. I would tell you that the market is not extremely active, in part because most of the folks that are selling are doing it because they have a real reason to do it, either their fund is expiring or they have debt coming due. So I would say there's not a lot of normal sellers in the market. It's more a case of motivated sellers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Will Marks with JMP.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Yes. I just had a couple of other group questions. You've covered it pretty well. What percent of your rooms are typically booked before the beginning of the year?","W. Edward Walter","Well, if you, I guess, here's how I'd look at this. As we started -- as we start off a year, we would expect that probably about 70% or so of our group rooms would be on the books at that point in time.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And remind me what group represents as a total -- as a percentage of the total.","W. Edward Walter","I think we've been running in the 37% to 38% range the last couple of years. I think we're probably going to be pushing back up towards 39% or 40% this year. Interesting to see where it ultimately comes out.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay. And it sounds like there's not a whole lot of change in the last few months in terms of the group outlook for the future or. Is that the case? And are there any changes in kind of mix on which types of groups are booking?","W. Edward Walter","I think one of the things that we were pleased to see develop over the course of the summer was the significant increase in our corporate group. That has -- that was the -- that segment of our business that dropped the most in the downturn and has generally been recovering the best during the course of the last 3 years. So that continues to be the area where we've seen the biggest improvement. Our association business has been, I'd say, a bit more inconsistent. Some quarters have been really strong, and other quarters, it has not been as strong. The corporate group is the area that tends to make the decision probably in the shortest term, and that's been the area that's been growing the most.","William C. Marks - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And are you -- would you say there's been any change in the group outlook over the last few months based on the economy or anything else?","W. Edward Walter","I think the only changes that -- I think everybody should read our comments. We continue to see group get better and better. I mean, if I look at the way this year's played out, I -- we are certainly, pleasantly surprised by how strong group has been this year, far better than what we saw last year. When we look at 2013, each quarter, as we look at the booking pace for the -- for 2013, our -- the percentage that revenues booked is ahead of the prior year has continued to increase as we worked our way through the quarter. So we have been -- in the beginning of the year, we were in the low-single digits. So at this point now, we're up over 8% in terms of our -- the revenues that are on the books for next year. So that's been strong. I suspect we'll see the same sort of progress in 2014. So overall, we've been very happy with what we've seen on the group side. And from our perspective, it continues to strengthen.","Operator","And due to time constraints, at this time, we will take our last question. That question comes from Joshua Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How much did Tampa add to the RevPAR growth of the company in the third quarter?","W. Edward Walter","Larry, that sounds like your kind of question.","Larry K. Harvey","Yes, I didn't do the math, Josh. It wasn't significant. I mean, it's one hotel. It's a very small part of a portfolio of 104 comp hotels. I can have someone run it and send it off to you.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And what do you think the likely outcome is for your European debt investment, which I think matures this month?","W. Edward Walter","Well, that's a great question. That is still in play right now. I think -- the way I -- probably, the only right way to answer that at this point is to say we continue to feel very comfortable about the value of our investment relative to the value of the underlying portfolio. Certainly, the folks that own that portfolio have been actively looking to sell it. And I think it will be interesting to see what plays out over the course of the next 60 to 120 days.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Are those assets that you would feel comfortable owning in the JV?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, they are, Josh. We think it's a -- we actually think it's a very good portfolio. You've got one of the best group hotels in Paris included in there. You've got a very good corporate transient hotel in the middle of the La D\u00e9fense part of Paris, which is really their version of an edge city outside of Paris where a lot of their major corporations are based. There's a wonderful Renaissance in downtown Paris. As I mention that, now there's smiles around the table because everybody that's seen that hotel likes it. And then the other larger hotel that's part of that portfolio is a Renaissance in Amsterdam, which has just been completely renovated in the last couple of years. It's in a great spot in Central Amsterdam. So this is a portfolio that we had under contract in the past. And we ended up not buying it for a variety of reasons back in '08. But we liked it then and it's a portfolio that, if it worked out that way, we'd be happy to own it today.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Can you give us a sense for what kind of evaluation you're in at? Maybe what your last dollar debt is per room?","W. Edward Walter","I don't think we've disclosed that, Josh, and so I'm not going to do that here. Sorry.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And for the Vornado transaction, can you give us a sense for how the retail space is being valued? Maybe what sort of cap rate or EBITDA multiple is being used to price the sale auction?","W. Edward Walter","I think that, too, is -- we've agreed to certain levels of confidentiality, at least initially with Vornado. So it's a somewhat complex mechanism for how the valuation would be calculated at the time that either they would call the interest or we would put it to them. But so I can't get into more detail. I wish I could. But I think part of what we were trying to convey with the comments at -- my prepared comments is that we are very excited about both that transaction and moving forward with the timeshare in Hawaii. That is valued that, for all intents and purposes, I don't think it's being at all recognized in the value of our company right now. But it's meaningful. And it's pretty exciting to think that the work that we've put into this over the last 18 months on each of these projects -- $0.5 billion is a lot of money or a lot of -- or $400 million to $500 million is a lot of money to add to the value of a company.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks.","W. Edward Walter","Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss what we thought were very good third quarter results with you. We look forward to talking with you in February to discuss both our year-end results and give you much more detailed insights into 2013.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Host Hotels & Resorts' second quarter 2014 earnings call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the Company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets and our balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, here is Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid operating results driven by strong rate in demand growth across our business. Combination of our strong operations through the first half of the year and our continuing optimism about the state of the lodging industry have resulted in improved full-year guidance which I will discuss in a few minutes.","First let's review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $411 million for the quarter and $819 million year-to-date, which exceeds consensus estimates. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was in line with estimates at $0.43 per share for the second quarter and $0.76 year-to-date. These strong results were driven by several factors. First, for the quarter, our portfolio achieved a cycle high occupancy level of 81% which allowed our hotels to thrive rate increases exceeding 4%, resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant currency basis of 5.1%.","As Greg will describe in greater detail our consolidated comparable international hotels continue to perform quite well generating RevPAR growth of more than 16% in the quarter. Our growth in the second quarter was driven primarily by our transient segments as group demand moderated primarily because of the shift of the Easter holiday, from March of 2013 to April of 2014.","Transient demand increased 1.6%; transient rate jumped 5% which lead to a transient revenue increase of more than 6.5%. As expected, the holiday shift resulted in a smaller increase in group business, as group demand increased by just 0.8% and group revenues increased by slightly more than 2%.","Looking at our results for the first half of the year, which eliminates the noise generated by the higher holiday shift, provides a clear insight into the health and character of our business. For the first half of the year, group demand increased nearly 3.5%, rate increase by more than 2.5% and group revenues increased by more than 6%, one of our best performances since the last peak.","The primary driver of these excellent group business trends with corporate group which benefited from a 5% plus increase in demand and a 5% increase in rate, leading to a revenue increase of more than 10.5%. The increased group bookings limited transient demand growth to 0.7%, but allow hotels to push transient rate increases that average nearly 4.5% leading to transient revenue growth of more than 5%.","With these two key elements of our business performing quite well, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant currency basis for the first half of the year was 5.9%. Matching the strong group demand our banquet revenue increased 6.6% for the first half of the year leading to total comparable F&B revenue growth of 4.8%.","The increase in banquet spending fueled more than a 50% flow through in the food and beverage department. That combined with the rate driven RevPAR growth resulted in adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 60 basis points for the quarter and 80 basis point for the first half. Overall, we are quite pleased with our results for the first half of 2014.","On the acquisition front, we continue to look for opportunities to increase our investment in our target markets; we do have an active pipeline at this juncture and expect to complete additional transactions before year end. However, given the timing and certainty of these \u2013 given that the timing and certainty of these transactions is difficult to predict, we've not included any additional acquisitions in our forecast.","On the disposition front, we continue to actively market properties and we expect to close on one or more transactions by the end of the year, in this incidence while the sell market is also difficult to predict, the guidance I will discuss in a few minutes does assume that we will complete incremental sales of approximately $200 million by year end.","Turning to capital investment, this quarter we invested over $90 million on a variety of projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness and value of our portfolio. Specifically, we invested approximately $71 million on renewal and replacement projects including the renovation of the Sheraton Boston 428 room South Tower. In addition to 2700 square feet of restaurant and public space at that hotel.","On the value add side of the equation, we invested $4 million into our recent acquisitions. And more importantly $18 million on ROI capital expenditures, including the repositioning of 10,000 square feet of restaurant and public space at Denver Marriott West.","Looking at total capital expenditures for the first half of the year, we spent over $180 million on our properties, resulting in improvements to 2800 guest rooms over 100,000 square feet of meeting space and 60,000 square feet of public space. Of that amount $147 was spent on renewal and replacement CapEx, $7 million on acquisition CapEx and $29 million on ROI investments.","For the full year we would expect to spend $330 million to $350 million on renewal and replacement CapEx. $25 million to $30 million on acquisition CapEx, and most importantly $65 million to $75 million on redevelopment and ROI CapEx. We remain focused on this last piece of capital investment as we believe it provides an opportunity to drive superior returns from our already strong portfolio.","Now let me spend some time on our outlook as there are number of factors that keep us optimistic about the remainder of the year. While full-year expectations for GDP growth have obviously tempered most economists expect second half growth to be quite strong. That, supplemented by better job growth and continued strong inbound travel, bodes well for strong demand growth.","Supply growth in most of our markets, excluding New York continues to be constrained especially in the upper upscale segment. Our year-to-date occupancy is running well north of 77% and well above our 2007 peak which suggest that we should benefit form strong rate growth.","Our group booking pace for the remainder of the year is quite strong, with revenues exceeding the prior year's pace by more than 6%. This is an improvement over our position at the end of Q1. Bookings in Q2 for the quarter and the remainder of the year ran better than 14% ahead of the prior-year's pace.","It is worth noting that our third quarter bookings are trending better than our bookings in the fourth quarter which generally attribute to year-over-year comparability challenges, to change in holiday timing, and some increase in a renovation activity at a few large group hotels.","Overall in addition to providing a foundation for strong RevPAR growth, this group base should also support solid banquet activity, leading to good F&B flow-through. The combination of these factors some easier expense comps, reduced insurance expenses, and lower unallocated costs suggest that second-half margin should increase to the better rate than we experience in the first half of the year.","With that in mind, we expect the comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase between five and three quarters in 6.25% and adjusted operating profit margin growth will range between 100 and 130 basis points. These assumptions result in adjusted EBITDA of between $1.380 billion to $1.405 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.44 to $1.47.","The midpoint of this updated guidance reflects a $12.5 million increase in adjusted EBITDA and a $0.02 increase in FFO per share, compared to our prior guidance. I should note that this guidance also includes a reduction to account for the $200 million in sales we expect to complete in the fall, but does not include the benefit of any of the acquisitions we might complete.","In summary, we are pleased with our results for the first half of the year and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2015. We expect the fundamentals in our business will remain solid and with continued low supply growth, we will continue to deliver meaningful growth.","Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our dividend increase and operating performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson","Thank you, Ed. I am pleased with our solid performance this quarter, which exceeded our expectations. Our Latin America hotels were the best performing hotels in the quarter with an impressive constant currency RevPAR increase of 40%, as our JW Marriott Rio that benefited from the World Cup and our JW Marriott Mexico City benefited from the completion of its renovation. A few hotels combined to grow RevPAR 53% in the second quarter.","More specifically, June RevPAR at the JW Marriott Rio increased 182% to over $790. The World Cup continued to boost RevPAR in Brazil through mid-July, with strength in Rio and Mexico City's post renovation lift, we expect our hotels in Latin America to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter. As expected, the West Coast was once again the strongest performing domestic region with RevPAR growth of 7.1% for the quarter. The increase in RevPAR was driven primarily by average rate, which grew nearly 7%.","The San Francisco market continued to lead our West Coast market, with RevPAR growth 12.4% for the quarter. This was predominantly driven by an ADR increase of 11.3%, as our properties have benefited from the positive mix shift from lower rated special corporate and contract business to higher-rated transient and group. We expect our hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform the portfolio in the third quarter.","Seattle and Phoenix both had a great quarter with RevPAR growth of approximately 9.5% in each market. Our Seattle hotels increased ADR by 8.8% by positively shifting the mix from lower rated contract business to higher-rated transient business. Our Phoenix hotels RevPAR growth was driven by both occupancy and ADR gains. Our hotels in Phoenix had strong weekday group business which enabled the hotels to drive better transient mix.","For the third quarter, we expect our hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform the portfolio with a strong group phase and continued positive mix shift. And our Phoenix hotels should perform inline with the portfolio with good group and leisure demand. Our hotels in Denver exceeded our expectations with a RevPAR increase of 7.5% for the quarter driven by strong business transient demand which translated into transient ADR gains.","Based on the strong group business on the books for the hotels in Denver, we expect these properties to outperform in the third quarter. The Hawaii market underperformed in the quarter, with RevPAR growth of 2.9%, due to the negative impact of the timeshare construction next into the Hyatt Maui hotel. With stronger group activity and projected increase arrivals to Maui, we anticipate the performance of the hotels in Hawaii to improve in the third quarter. Generally, we expect our West Coast properties to continue to be our best performing markets in the third quarter.","As expected, Florida was the bright spot for the southern region. And our Florida hotels benefited from the Easter shift with RevPAR growing 16.5% in April, and 13.5% for the quarter. Since the summer months typically not strong months in Florida we expect our Florida hotels to perform inline with our portfolio in the third quarter.","Houston RevPAR grew only 2% in the quarter, as hotels lost 2.3 percentage points in occupancy while growing ADR by 5.1%. The occupancy loss was due both to a difficult comparison at the JW Marriott in Houston and attrition related to city-wide conferences. Due to the lack of city-wide events for the remainder of the year, and our planned renovations at the JW Marriott Houston and Houston Airport Marriott in the fourth quarter, we expect the Houston market to underperform the portfolio for the rest of the year.","Atlanta and Chicago both reported declines in RevPAR of 0.5% and 1.8% respectively. Atlanta experienced a difficult comp with the NCAA Final Four in April of 2013, while Chicago had a weak city-wide calendar when compared to last year. In fact, June 2013 was a record month with five city-wides, those events did not repeat this year which resulted in the RevPAR declined for the Chicago hotels. We expect improvements in the third quarter for both Atlanta and Chicago, as city-wides for both markets improve.","RevPAR in Boston increased 7.8%, driven by an average rate growth of 8.3%. Our properties in Boston were able to shift from group to transient business and raise the average rate. With reduced activity at the Heinz Convention Center, we expect our Boston hotels to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter. RevPAR in New York grew 5.5% exceeding our forecast with better an expected occupancy, offsetting weaker average rate growth. A strong May drove the quarter's group volume increase of 13.8% and contributed to the 8.5% improvement in food and beverage revenues for the quarter.","Despite the strong group business in New York, supply growth in the market hampered our ability to increase transit rates. We expect the New York market to experience similar growth in the second half of the year as the first half of this year. Washington DC and Philadelphia RevPAR declined 2.4% and 2.7% respectively for the quarter. The decline in Philadelphia was related to the loss of group room nights due to a decrease in city-wide events in the second quarter.","As expected our hotels in Washington DC are having a challenging year. The majority of our hotels experienced ADR decline versus last year with the entire deficit in group ADR. For the quarter, group room nights were down 9.2% compared with last year. For our DC hotels were able to replace the loss in group nights with transient and contract rooms, we have done so at lower rates. We expect Washington DC hotels will continue to lag in the third quarter.","The comparable hotels RevPAR for the European joint venture increased 0.6% for the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date and constant Euros. F&B revenues grew 2.5% for the quarter and 5.7% year-to-date, the strong banquet revenue growth of 7.2% in the quarter and 12.3% year-to-date. We continue to be impressed with our European hotels ability to increase food and beverage revenues as well as controlled costs and to drive EBITDA growth.","EBITDA grew 3% in the quarter and 4.5% year-to-date. International travel from the U.S. and other parts of the world for both leisure and business travel should have a positive impact on the rest of the year. We expect the second half RevPAR to significantly outperform the first half of the year.","During the second quarter, we refinanced the loan secured by three properties in Brussels at a very attractive initial all-in rate of 2% and extended and extended the maturity to 2019. Comparable hotels adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 60 basis points in the quarter and 80 basis points year-to-date. Lackluster group performance due to the Easter holiday shift in the second quarter resulted in a slight increase in comparable food and beverage revenues and modest margin growth.","However, our second quarter results were anticipated and do not represent a trend going forward as we had indicated that full year comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin growth is expected to be over a 100 basis points. Based on RevPAR growth that is driven by stronger ADR growth, easier comparisons for certain room expenses, and decreases in our insurance, utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses, we expect to achieve a full year margin forecast of 100 to 130 basis points which will result in second half margin growth well in excess of the first half.","We anticipate 22% of our full-year EBITDA will be earned in the third quarter. During the quarter, we amended and extended our existing credit facility. The borrowing capacity on the credit facility remains the same. Under the amendment the maturity was extended to 2019, including extension and we reduced pricing by 30 basis on the revolver and 32.5 basis point on the term loan. U.S. dollar denominated revolver borrowing today would result in an initial all-in rate of 1.35%. At this time, we have approximately $220 million outstanding under the revolver and $500 million under the term loan.","Based on our outlook for the industry and our operating performance, we have determined that we can sustain a meaningful dividend increase. Therefore, our Board approved a 33% dividend increase to $0.20 for the third quarter. ","Given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow, we anticipate this will be the dividend for at least the next several quarters. In addition, to ensure that a dividend represents 100% of our taxable income including gains from potential asset sales, we may need to pay a special dividend at the end of the year.","Finally, as we have indicated previously while we intend to use available cash predominantly for acquisitions or other investments in our portfolio to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment, we may elect in the future to use available cash for other uses such as a special dividend, which would be in excess of taxable income.","In summary, we are excited to have the best balance sheet in the history of the Company. And we are in a remarkable position with all options open to us as we progress through the cycle. We will continue to assess the best use of our free cash flow and ensure that we are focusing on creating value for our shareholders.","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer-Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) and we will take our first quarter from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Great. Thanks. Looking at your North American RevPAR performance and just kind of looking at the FTR data, there is a couple hundred basis points of difference. And I wonder if you could address that and it may just have to do with the comp set. You're seeing a same-store comp set and SCR is not seeing a same-store comp set. And if that's the case I wonder if you could kind of characterize your RevPAR increase in \u2013 using the same kind of non-comp set, just to give us a sense of how it's tracking versus the overall US number?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I think that certainly is a question or your question is one that\u2019s been highlighted on some of the other calls and I think that this particular last quarter, the differences between say the top markets, the top 19 or 20 markets in the country and the rest of the industry as a whole, that gap has expanded a little bit from a performance perspective. I think what you're seeing is a variety of things. I think number one is I think right now secondary markets have, in the last couple of quarters have performed better, compared to some of the leading markets.","I think that may just be a natural evolution of the lodging cycle. I think that we also are seeing that in this most recent quarter, the fact that the leisure segment was probably a bit stronger, in part because of the shift of the Easter holiday and the fact that our economy is growing at a better rate, ultimately led to some increased leisure travel, but it showed up significantly in some of the lower price points.","As we look at how we are performing compared to our comps and compared to our markets and leaving out some of the hotels that \u2013 including in our portfolio that might have had significant work done to them last year and so this year are benefiting from a big move in terms of RevPAR growth and you can see that in our results in some of our non-comp hotels had double-digit growth. The reality is that we are running \u2013 for the full year we're running slightly ahead of our comp set in terms of yield index. So we are pleased to see that we picking up share.","Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And just my other question is, in your opening remarks you mentioned your guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions between now and the end of the year. And I wonder if you could just give color on is that due to the transaction market or to kind of a change in your approach to being a net acquirer this year?","W. Edward Walter","No I think it\u2019s just reflective of the fact that we haven\u2019t \u2013 you know we don\u2019t have anything to announce at this point in time. We do what I view as a reasonably active pipeline. And frankly I would be surprised if we didn't complete a few acquisitions before year end, but since the timing of those is not completely set and they are not done yet, we didn\u2019t want to try to adjust our guidance to reflect the fact that we might be acquiring an asset.","I think in terms of how the year is going to play out, we still feel good enough about the overall length of the cycle that we would love to be an investor, but we're disciplined about this. And if we can't get the returns that we want from the acquisition then we won't be completing those acquisitions.","Robin M. Farley \u2013 UBS Investment Bank","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Bilerman with Citi.","Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Hi. This is Kevin Varin with Michael. Just carrying along with the acquisition pipeline, can you just give us a little bit more color on the pipeline and what you're kind of looking at the time? Because I know you've alluded to in the past that you've weighed international expansion. Just based on what we're seeing in the transaction market, is the pipeline skewed more U.S. or international?","W. Edward Walter","It\u2019s still a mix, it\u2019s still a mix and I think we are seeing decent activity in Europe. You're seeing both banks and certain funds look to begin to liquidate some assets in Europe. So we are certainly looking at a couple of opportunities there. We are also looking at a number of opportunities across both, what I call the higher end of select service segment and the full service segment in the U.S. Activity in Asia has been much quieter of late and so there is nothing \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say there is anything imminent in Asia today.","Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. And then just turning to asset sales. Can you go into more detail on the potential timing of the sales? Is it more backend loaded more in 4Q or is this something that can transpire in the next couple months?","W. Edward Walter","It\u2019s really hard to say. I think that it\u2019s really \u2013 the reality is we have a number of hotels that are now. So I would be expecting that we closings throughout, really the fall and into the early winter.","Kevin J. Varin \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Wesley Golladay from RBC Capital Markets.","Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Good morning, everyone. Looking at the group business, can you give us a little more color on that? And are you starting to see the increase in lead time for booking events? And when do you think you'll get more pricing power on the rate side. It looks like you had 2.5% for the first half and I imagine some of that's due to mix shift.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, you\u2019re right about that. We have been consistently seeing here now for the last year a pretty significant bump in corporate business and that has certainly happened throughout the second quarter and has happened throughout the year as I mentioned in my comments. So as overall as we step back and look at our group business, we were quite pleased with the level of booking activity that transpired in the second quarter.","Our room nights that were booked in the quarter for the quarter were up about 9% and as I mentioned in my comments, our room nights for the rest of 2014 \u2013 our room nights were up about 5% for the rest of 2014 and our revenues were up 14%. The rate growth for the rooms that were booked during the second quarter for the rest of the year in 2014 was up 18.5%. So the bookings that we\u2019re getting done now are considerably higher rates than the business that we would have booked last year.","Now, obviously our rate in itself in our group business is not going to go up anywhere near 8% because we obviously have a number of \u2013 the bulk of our rooms are already on the books. But I have to say we have been quite encouraged by the booking pace that we have been seeing.","Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay. Can you give us an update on what you have for 2015 on the books? How much of those higher ADR group might flow into next year?","W. Edward Walter","I think that the answer is it still a little unclear as to how \u2013 exactly how that's going to play out for 2015 \u2013 first half of 2015 looks quite good on both the rate and the occupancy side. I think as you look at the second half of 2015 which his obviously much further out. We are not showing is bigger than increase in room nights yet. And that also the rate growth there is still a little lower too.","","Wesley K. Golladay \u2013 RBC Capital Markets, LLC","Okay thanks for taking the question.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, I guess I'll follow-up on your potential acquisitions. We've been noticing a nice pickup over the last several quarters just in terms of overall pricing out there in the transaction market. Can you maybe give us a sense of, in terms of the opportunities you are looking at, what kinds of discounts to replacement cost you're seeing now? And maybe how this could compare to what you guys were seeing at the last cycle, say I kind of the 2005, 2006 timeframe?","W. Edward Walter","You really want me to open up my memory banks to try to remember exactly where it was back then. I think the answer on that varies so widely by market that it would be hard to really give you a realistic number, in terms of where things are trading compared to replacement costs. I would generally say that in most markets, if you're looking at full-service product, it is still better to be a buyer than a developer, which would generally tell you that you're at a point where assets are still trading at discounts to replacement cost.","Certain of the markets that have had stronger recoveries, some of the West Coast markets and probably \u2013 and maybe Miami \u2013 have started to show pricing that's beginning to approach replacement cost. But I'd still say it falls shy \u2013 or falls short of actually getting to that. If I were trying to compare more generally the market today versus 2006 and 2007, I would agree with the general sentiment that pricing has gotten stronger in 2014.","I think it's following a normal pattern, which is the further you work your way into the cycle the strong pricing tends to become. I would not say that we are yet at the levels of 2006 and early 2007. Where, at that point in time, we were finding that as we would evaluate acquisitions, the prices that others were prepared to pay routinely 15% to 20% ahead of what we saw was reasonable. And certainly there are occasions where that happens right now, but I'd say the market today \u2013 it's certainly more rational than it was back then.","Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That's helpful. And then my second question just relates to, in your prepared remarks you talked about how your occupancy levels are now at, or slightly above, prior peak. Could you maybe just remind us what your prior peak EBITDA was on your portfolio as it stands right now? And do you see any impediments to maybe getting back to those levels this cycle?","W. Edward Walter","Greg you have that number?","Gregory J. Larson","Yeah, if you go back 2007, our peak EBITDA was \u2013 call it $1.48 billion, so it was close to $1.5 billion and obviously Andrew we\u2019ve acquired \u2013 quite a few hotels since then and we sold some hotels as well. So I would that\u2019s not really a comparable number. But that's where our peak EBITDA was back then.","Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. I guess I was asking what peak EBITDA was on your current portfolio. If you had owned your current assets back in 2007.","W. Edward Walter","Andrew I think we are going to need to get back to you on that number. I just don\u2019t think we have right now.","Andrew G. Didora \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony F. Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Could you update us on our your F&B spend per group night trended in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And how do you expect that to trend for the rest of the year?","W. Edward Walter","It was up strongly in the first quarter. It was about flat in the second quarter. I think as we look at the second half of the year, we are expecting it to be up reasonably well in the third quarter. It\u2019s hard to tell on the fourth quarter right now because the lot of the F&B spending doesn\u2019t get pen down until relatively shortly before the events going to happen.","Most of the growth we are seeing right now is in corporate F&B and the pattern that we are hearing is the top to the hotels about how the F&B part of the booking occurs, is that they typically booked sign the contracted one level, but then as they get closer to when the event actually occur, they then finalize exactly how big of F&B program we are going to see.","So we have generally been seeing corporations making the decision to spend a bit more on food and beverage once they\u2019re having the event. And so we\u2019ll have \u2013 that\u2019s I feel relatively confident to spending in the third quarter should be fairly strong. A little harder to predict what\u2019s going to happen in the fourth quarter.","Anthony F. Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you. My second question is, you mentioned that there were some upscale full-service hotels in your pipeline. Given some of the RevPAR strength was on the second quarter, how much of a priority is it for you to increase your exposure there? Thank you.","W. Edward Walter","I don\u2019t know that for us right now investing is really just assumption of expanding our presence in our target markets if we find investments that achieve reasonable premium to our cost of capital. And I think as we look at the various opportunities that we reviewed where comfortable buying full service hotel \u2013 upper upscale hotels and upscale hotels.","I think just by virtue of the fact that upscale hotels tend to be smaller that as you look out over our \u2013 look at the way our portfolio was structure over the next couple of years. You are not going to see a meaningful increase in an overall context in terms of the representation of upscale hotel, but we\u2019ve had good success with ones that we\u2019ve acquired so far. And we certainly are open within our designated markets to acquiring more.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co","Hi. Good morning. This is Anto Savarirajan on for Steve Kent. First question on the European JV portfolio. RevPAR of 60 basis points for those 18 hotels. Can you provide us some color as to what you're seeing there? And how that 60 basis points compares to what others are seeing there in the market? And if there is any major topic that we need to be aware of? And again, when you say the second half should outperform the first half, what are the factors driving that?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I think what we have seen in Europe, for the first half of the year is somewhat similar to what we have seen in the U.S. Where we've noticed, especially in Spain and in the United Kingdom that the major urban centers that under performed some of the regional and the resort markets. I think they're for different reasons. I think a number of Europeans have been traveling inside of Europe instead of outside of Europe this spring. In part because some of the turmoil in the world. And so as a result, the Spanish resorts did quite well and the Spanish resort markets outperformed the Spanish urban centers.","In the UK, I just think you saw an increase in regional activity, but some of that is a function of that in comparison to London that had a much bigger opportunity to grow. I think the fact that we were \u2013 our numbers were weaker in Europe is somewhat of a combination of both of those factors as well as some \u2013 sort of just the ebbs and flows of our business. There were a number of big events, whether it's the celebrations that happened in Venice or the air show that moved Paris, I think to London, this year.","A couple of big group events that had happened in Amsterdam in 2013. They did not repeat on a year-over-year basis, and so unfortunately what that meant was that RevPAR growth in Europe and our portfolio was weaker. As Greg mentioned, we did have good solid food and beverage growth. And we were very pleased with the level of flow-through that we are able to achieve given our revenue increase. So all in all, we were happy with where the EBITDA came out, but a little disappointed with what the top line growth was.","I think the second half of the year, some of those trends reverse. There are some markets that are picking up some group business, so that should be a favorable plus. And all in all, the sense that the hotels have \u2013 of Americans and others traveling to U.S. given some of the challenges and some of the other source locations around the world, they felt that their bookings for the summer and into the early fall are quite solid. Hence the sense that we have that RevPAR growth and revenue growth in general would be quite strong \u2013 but quite a bit stronger in the second half.","Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co","","Got it. Thank you. The second question is, some of your key markets are already running occupancies in the high 70s to low 80s. And we get the reference when you say most of the gains in RevPAR should come from rate. If there is any occupancy gain to be had, how should that look and where can that come from?","W. Edward Walter","","I think that there certainly is still room for additional occupancy gain. But I think you're right in your general sense that most of RevPAR growth will come from rate increases as opposed to further occupancy increases. If you look across our portfolio, there's still room \u2013 the middle of the week we are running at very high 80%, almost 90% occupancy. So, the middle of the week is really about driving rate, which is great, because as we all know that flows through to the bottom line better. There's still room to drive occupancy on a Friday night or on a Sunday night to the extent that you can move group activity to those nights.","And in general, as long as we continue to have the situation we have, which is demand is growing quicker than supply, ultimately that means occupancies countrywide have to go up. And I suspect it will be a benefit of that. But as consistent with what we've described, we generally think the bulk of our RevPAR growth going forward is going to happen generally through rate growth and not occupancy growth.","Anto M. Savarirajan \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","","And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Good morning. With the operations there has been a lot of focus on incentive management fees, and so I guess it's relevant for you on the other side of things. How do you expect management fees to trend in the coming quarters and years? And I think at peak around 60 to 65 of your hotels were paying incentive fees. And I think about a year ago now, you were in kind of the low to mid 40% range. How do you expect that \u2013 where are you now and how do expect that to trend? Thanks.","W. Edward Walter","","Yes. It looks like this year we will probably end up in the low 50% range in terms of the number of hotels that pay incentive management fees. Our expected increase in incentive management fees this year is actually not particularly great. I think were generally looking at flat. A lot of that really stems from the fact that we have renegotiated a few of our contracts with our operators and achieved, for particular hotels, the meaningful reductions in incentive management fees. So the others are going up and there some more hotels that are paying it, but that's than offset by our negotiations.","As we look out past that, I think we generally would expect that we would see historical levels of increases in IMF in 2015 and 2016. But nothing \u2013 I don't know that we'll continue to see that 50% grow. And I don\u2019t know that I necessarily have a sense as to what that looks like in say 2015 or 2016. But I suspect we'll start to approach the prior peak again in terms of the number of hotels that are paying incentive management fees.","Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Helpful. Thank you. And then just, the high end of your RevPAR guidance, at least for the domestic hotels, is below that of Merritt's and Starwood's. Maybe I'm getting a bit cute, but any reason you're being more conservative?","W. Edward Walter","I don\u2019t know that there's any particular reason for why \u2013 to be honest I haven't looked at our guidance in comparison to theirs, so it's hard for me to be articulate about that type of comparison. I think that we are very happy with the way the first half of the year came out. Our RevPAR results, both domestically and internationally, have come in better than what we expected at the beginning of the year. When we look at the second half of the year, we feel fairly encouraged by the trends that we're looking at. And are essentially comfortable in really taking our RevPAR guidance from what \u2013 to the high end \u2013 the midpoint today is the high end of where we were at the last quarter.","So I think you should view that as a general endorsement of the fact that we think things are going quite well. We feel encouraged on both the group and the transient side. We're looking forward to the second half of the year.","Gregory J. Larson","","I agree. And I think if you just look at the quarter results. I know some people, some analysts talked about Marriott producing 6% of RevPAR. But, if you look at their upper upscale luxury properties, I think they reported 4.4% growth in RevPAR, which was comparable to our RevPAR growth for our domestic hotels at 4.5%. And if you include are non-comp hotels \u2013 our growth was closer to 5%.","Thomas G. Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And, we\u2019ll go next to Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","","Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. And it's been a busy earnings morning. So if you have already talked about \u2013 answered my questions I apologize. But Ed, with regard to your assumption of selling an asset for $200 million in the fall, which I think you referenced, how much EBITDA is coming out in the fourth quarter or in the back half of the year related to that asset sale? And then how much EBITDA have you recognized year to date and through the date of close of that asset as well?","W. Edward Walter","","Joe, I think that in round numbers, we've assumed about $4 million of EBITDA for that asset. We're thinking of it as an asset, but again I want to sort of caution everyone that we are marketing a number of hotels. So what we've essentially done is put about a $4 million deduction in our numbers to reflect the fact that we expect a number of sales to occur. In round numbers, probably the EBITDA benefit from that for the first part of the year is probably in that 10% to 12% range. Whether it's an individual hotels or it's a combination of hotels.","Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","","Great. And then you referenced in the press release, explaining the year-over-year performance in adjusted EBITDA. Among those things you talked about cost, primarily selling expenses, associated with the timeshare in Maui. Can you quantify that for us? And do we expect that going forward?","Gregory J. Larson","","Yes. Joe, I talked about it before, we are expecting to have expenses each quarter leading up to the fourth quarter. And then when we open the timeshare in the fourth quarter, we'll actually be able to recognize the revenues. And so when we think about the full year, we are looking for around $11 million or so of EBITDA from the timeshare. But I guess our point here is that, when we look at expenses for the second quarter of this year, we had timeshare expenses this year, but if you looked at our second quarter and the prior year we didn't have timeshare expenses.","So that was one delta, sort of comparing our adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter this year to the second quarter of last year. Obviously the other two big differences \u2013 one was the sale of some of our assets, including the Philadelphia Convention Center. Obviously, a lot of EBITDA in the second quarter of last year are not in our results this year. And then last in the second quarter of last year we also sold some tennis courts at the Newport Beach Marriott for approximately $21 million. So that was in our EBITDA last year and not this year.","Joseph Greff \u2013 JP Morgan Chase & Co.","","Okay.","Operator","","And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC","","Hey. Good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, as well. But I was just hoping you could give us some color with regards to the acquisition environment. Obviously, we keep hearing that private equity is very active, leverage levels, seem to be back \u2013 kind of approaching where they were in 2006, 2007 when you guys were net sellers, more than net buyers. You've been pretty disciplined with your capital in terms of acquisitions over the past, call it, two years or so. How are you able to find opportunities that might be appealing in the back half of the year, as you mentioned? Is there something different? Are these repositionings, renovations? Help me understand what is going on there. Thanks.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I don't \u2013 I think it's \u2013 what you generally described is correct and there's no doubt that the environment as, net capital has become more available, there\u2019s no doubt that the overall environment has become more competitive. We are certainly trying to take advantage of that on the sales side, especially trying to sell assets that are in markets that are not core, from our perspective, for our future, as a way of really benefiting from the strengths and the liquidity in the market. Obviously, as you correctly analyzed, when you have those sorts of conditions, it's much more difficult to be an acquirer. I think what it just comes down to is, we're looking for opportunities where we can create value at this point.","And so some of these transactions \u2013 you look at the Powell Street transaction that we did in San Francisco the Powell Hotel and that's an opportunity where we are going to invest meaningful capital in the building to try and create something new and different that we expect will be quite successful at a very attractive price. Some of the opportunities that we are looking at other places involve a change in operator or a change in brand. And so with that, with that new approach to a hotel there's an opportunity to generate better returns, than where the hotel is current \u2013 what the hotel is currently providing. And that allows it to satisfy our yield requirements.","Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC","","Ed, that makes a ton of sense. I guess when you think about whether it be a repositioning or some type of alteration. Are you looking at anything that's going to be materially lengthy, where it might take two years to get the massive renovation? Or it may take two years before you get the returns that you are looking for? Or are you more focused on things like you just mentioned were it's a simple rebranding or change in operator where you think things are being left on the table?","W. Edward Walter","If I were to look at today's pipeline, I would say that we're probably focused \u2013 the couple that would fall into that category are probably more near-term than long-term conversion opportunities. But that doesn't mean we wouldn't look at things that would take longer, I would just say that what we happen to be looking at today tends to be more near-term. And then of course we have a few opportunities within our portfolio, like the Four Seasons in Philadelphia where there's going to be an opportunity to reposition that asset. That will probably by its nature take a bit longer.","Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC","","That make sense. And then lastly, the economy, albeit slowly, seems to be improving in Europe. Are you guys getting more acquisitive overseas with your joint venture partner? It certainly seems like there's a lot more hotels hitting the market that might be of institutional quality today than there were a year ago.","W. Edward Walter","I think you're right in that assessment. We\u2019ve certainly seen a pickup in activity in Europe. And both we and our partners are certainly interested in looking at everything and then trying to decide which ones make the most sense. But we have \u2013 I think you're right in your assessment that there has a pickup in activity there and I will be disappointed if we don't get some transactions done in Europe in the second half of the year.","Ryan Meliker \u2013 MLV & Co LLC","","All right. That's helpful. That's all for me. Thanks a lot, Ed.","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust.","C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Hi. Good morning. Just two questions here. You briefly touched on your Hawaii project. I'm wondering what are your full EBITDA expectations from that project?","W. Edward Walter","Well, I think as Greg noted, we are expecting this year to generate about $11 million in EBITDA at the end \u2013 by the end of the year. All of which will ultimately show itself in our fourth-quarter numbers.","C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","","Okay. But how \u2013 I mean over the life of the project, what are your ballpark expectations for EBITDA?","W. Edward Walter","I don't think that we have disclosed anything on that. And so I'd rather differ on trying to give an overall sense of that project.","C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. And then just a quick modeling question. From $200 million of asset sales, ballpark how many rooms?","W. Edward Walter","You know what, I can't really give you a good number on that, because the reality is \u2013think about it \u2013 if it's a more expensive hotels, then it's not going to be as many rooms. If it's a combination of some older hotels that are at lower RevPAR levels, it'll be a lot more rooms. So unfortunately I don't think I can give you a really useful number for that.","C. Patrick Scholes \u2013 SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Okay. No problem. Thank you anyway.","W. Edward Walter","All right, thanks.","Operator","","And, we\u2019ll take our next question from Smedes Rose with Evercore.","Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Hi. Thanks. I was wondering if you could talk about any of sort of large redevelopment or ROI projects that you have in your pipeline now, I guess, into next year? And as you think about spending $65 million to $75 million this year, would you expect that to kind of move up or down meaningfully next year in either direction due to those projects?","W. Edward Walter","Smedes I would guess I mean we're looking at a number of projects. We talked about. We talked about the Houston Airport total renovation or redevelopment or before. We have the ballroom in San Diego, so that which is a considerable project that probably we\u2019ll run in the $90 million to $95 million. And that starts construction at the end of this year.","We have a couple of other hotels that we are expecting to invest a fair amount of capital in, because they are appear to be some opportunities to redevelop those too, both out in the western part of the country. So I would guess today we are about to go \u2013 your question about a week early because we are about to review our entire capital budget next week \u2013 our capital budget for 2015 \u2013 next week. But I'm guessing our ROI expenditures for next year will probably go up slightly.","Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","","Okay. Thanks. And then just curious about your view on the DC market over the next couple of years, what you guys are seeing? And is the new hotel and convention center, kind of doing \u2013 I guess \u2013 what the convention center had hoped?","W. Edward Walter","I think the answer is so far, when you look at the bookings \u2013 the bookings for 2015 are modestly better. The bookings for 2016 are considerably better. The last time I looked the bookings for 2017 were looking quite good. And so I think the answer is the conventions \u2013 the new hotel is helping Washington to grow its convention center business. I have been quite encouraged by some of the more recent employment data that I have seen, which has suggested that job growth has started to return to the Washington area.","And I'm generally very encouraged by just watching how the city is transforming itself over the course of the last, call it, 10 to 15 years. Where it really \u2013 Washington has become quite a different city from \u2013 the city that I remember when I first came down here in the late 70s. So, I think that the one negative, and it's a big one for Washington, continues to be what's been happening with the government. The combination both on the political side, the lack of activity on the Hill has to some degree stunted some business transient travel that we might normally have seen.","And then with the combination of government cutbacks, sequesters, and everything else has meant that instead of government travel and government groups being at least a modest contributor to growth, it has been a detractor. We are getting to the point here, where there is not a lot more to lose, so I think that the drag that that represents this year \u2013 second half of this year and into next year will probably be relatively modest. At least that's our hope. And so, I think we do still \u2013 Washington still is the city, it has high rate, it has high occupancy, it\u2019s highly attractive to investors, for both national and international.","So as an opportunity to create value and generate value, we still are pretty optimistic about Washington. But it will certainly \u2013 we're looking forward to getting that period of time our convention business starts to pick up again. And then hopefully at some stage here, we start to see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a little bit more broader growth than what we've experienced the last couple of years.","Smedes Rose \u2013 Evercore Partners Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","","And, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll like to turn the call back to Mr. Walter for any closing or additional remarks.","W. Edward Walter","Well, thank you for joining us on this call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight into the remainder of 2004 on our third quarter call in the fall. Have a great day. Enjoy the rest to your summer.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results and our outlook for 2018. Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide details on our first quarter performance by markets, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Gee, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report a quarter that materially exceeded our internal expectations on the top and bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. Based on this performance, we are raising our full year guidance for RevPAR, adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per share. For the full year, we have increased the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR guidance 50 basis points to 2%, increased the midpoint of adjusted EBITDAre by $25 million to $1.525 billion, and increased the midpoint of adjusted FFO per share by $0.05 to $1.70.","These results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our geographically-diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth, and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars formed the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT.","As mentioned in our press release, we closed on the previously-discussed three-hotel portfolio of iconic Hyatt properties on March 29. Recycling out of low RevPAR, low growth, and high CapEx assets into these high RevPAR, high growth, and low CapEx hotels at roughly the same cap rate with an outstanding use of capital and instantly upgraded the overall portfolio.","Although still early in our ownership, the Hyatt portfolio is performing above our initial underwriting. Keep in mind, this is before we begin implementing many of the value enhancement initiatives we identified in our underwriting. We are encouraged by early results and look forward to enhancing performance and value at these fantastic properties.","Looking forward, we are maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation and are not including any additional purchases in our revised full-year guidance. We anticipate closing on the previously-announced sale of the W New York this month for $190 million. Please note that we have included one additional asset sale in our revised guidance for 2018. This sale will result in the expected loss of $6 million of EBITDA.","As it relates to investing in our portfolio, we spent approximately $115 million on CapEx in the first quarter, which is consistent with our plan to spend between $475 million to $550 million this year on total CapEx. The most notable repositioning projects include the completion at The Phoenician and the start of a comprehensive renovation at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, in addition to significant facade and other work occurring at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples Beach Resort.","As I mentioned, our first quarter exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line, particularly given the difficult comparison of 3.8% domestic RevPAR growth in quarter one 2017, which benefited from the inauguration and Women's March in Washington, D.C.","These results are a testament to Host's scale and platform, particularly our asset management and enterprise analytics teams. While Michael will describe the quarter in greater detail, here are some of the highlights. While we expected to see some impact from the Passover holiday shift from April to March, and the earlier timing of the Easter holiday, transient demand significantly exceeded our expectations to the upside.","As a result, on a constant currency basis, comparable hotel RevPAR improved 1.7% in the first quarter to $177, driven by a 170 basis point increase in occupancy, partially offset by a 60 basis point decrease in average rate.","For the quarter, occupancy for our comparable hotel properties was 77.6%, the highest first quarter occupancy for the company in more than 15 years. This translated into adjusted EBITDAre of $370 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per share of $0.43; both were significantly above consensus estimates.","Transient demand increased 5.2% in the quarter, some of which was due to the holiday shift, but materially higher than we anticipated. Although average rate was relatively flat, this consistent demand throughout the first quarter resulted in transient revenues increasing 5.2%.","As mentioned on our last call, we begin to see signs that business travel was picking up in the fourth quarter of 2017. This positive trend accelerated in the first quarter, and we estimate that both business travel revenue for the comparable portfolio grew over 6.5%. This growth occurred in most markets and was driven largely by the consulting, technology, and pharma sectors.","While it is a bit early to predict where this trend is going for the remainder of 2018, we are optimistic that business travel will continue to strengthen over the course of the year and we will be monitoring this segment closely.","As we anticipated, our group business was impacted by difficult comparisons in Washington, D.C. and Houston, which benefited from the Super Bowl last year. In addition, the earlier timing of the Passover and Easter holidays impacted group demand, as these holidays are typically weaker for group demand and stronger on the transient side.","For the quarter, group revenue decreased 3.5% due to these events and holiday shifts. We expect group business to rebound in the second quarter as these calendar items abate. As we look to the remainder of the year, our group booking pace is strong, with group revenues up 4.5%. The fourth quarter of this year looks to be the strongest quarter with group revenue 6.5% ahead of last year.","Overall, our group revenue pace is up approximately 2.2% to where we were at the same time last year. With approximately 85% of our group revenues on the books for 2018 and occupancies at all-time highs, we continue to see the booking window extend. As was the story in 2017, we continue to do a great job improving profitability at our properties and driving comparable EBITDA margin growth.","In the first quarter, comparable EBITDA margins grew 60 basis points. We received a one-time tax rebate at the Westin Grand Central in New York, which positively impacted margins by 28 basis points. The balance of the margin lift was a result of increased productivity, strict cost controls, continued utility reductions as a result of sustainability investments and an increase in ancillary revenues.","I should point out that we had made over $170 million in sustainable investments since 2015 and are achieving combined annual saving yield in excess of 14% on those investments. We also received numerous awards and recognitions in this area, including the 2017 NAREIT Leader in the Light award. We are committed to sustainable business practices and happy to be recognized for our achievements.","Our asset management and enterprise analytics groups continue to be focused on driving cash flow to the bottom line. A 32 basis point improvement in margin on comparable hotel revenue growth of 1.5% is a testament to their efforts.","To further enhance our analytic capabilities, we entered into an agreement with IBM Research, to leverage IBM's artificial intelligence expertise. This will allow us to improve our predictive capabilities by extracting insights from both structured and unstructured information. This is another example of taking advantage of our scale and access to information to develop leading-edge technologies and processes to drive long-term investment returns.","This combination of better-than-expected first quarter results and increased macroeconomic optimism is driving the across-the-board raise to our full-year guidance. The global economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. The economic indicators we closely follow, corporate profits and nonresidential fixed investments continue to remain strong.","As mentioned earlier, the pickup in business transient travel is positive and gives us further reason to be optimistic. Leisure demand continues to be strong, given record levels of consumer confidence. We also began to see some improvements in international travel to the U.S. in the first quarter. Although, this is a smaller part of our overall business, improved international visitation should bode well for demand in some of our major gateway markets.","As a result, we are raising the midpoint of our comparable RevPAR growth guidance by 50 basis points to 2% on a revised range of 1.5% to 2.5%. This is predicated on our continued belief that the first quarter will be the weakest quarter of the year and that the second half of the year should be stronger than the first. The support for this outlook is the visibility provided by solid group pace for the remaining three quarters of 2018.","Correspondingly, we are anticipating comparable EBITDA margins of minus 10 to plus 30 basis points based on our revised RevPAR range. At the new midpoint of 2% RevPAR growth, we expect EBITDA margin growth of 10 basis points, an increase of 10 basis points from our prior guidance. 2018 adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $25 million at the midpoint to $1.525 billion on a revised range of $1.505 billion to $1.545 billion. I would point out that this increase would have been higher by $6 million if we had not included the expected loss related to the unidentified disposition that I discussed earlier.","Therefore, the $25 million full-year increase in EBITDAre includes our $17 million first quarter beat versus consensus estimates, an additional $14 million increase over the balance of the year less the expected loss of $6 million from the unidentified disposition. We are increasing 2018 adjusted FFO per share by $0.05 at the midpoint to $1.70 on a revised range of $1.67 to $1.73. We are anticipating continued improvement for the remainder of the year relative to our budgets, which were completed in December 2017.","In closing, we are pleased with our beat-and-raise quarter, as it continues to demonstrate the attributes of our premier lodging REIT. A diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to continue to outperform our peers in the near, medium, and long term.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and our balance sheet in much greater detail.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. Good morning everyone. As Jim mentioned, we had an outstanding first quarter with impressive beats to our internal top and bottom line results as well as consensus estimates, enabling us to increase guidance meaningfully for the full year. Comparable RevPAR increased 1.7% driven by an occupancy increase of 170 basis points, and comparable EBITDA margins expanded by 60 basis points.","Before getting into some of the details of our corporate performance, let me provide some operational results in our top markets for the quarter. Our best-performing domestic markets this quarter were Philadelphia, the Florida Gulf Coast, Maui, and Oahu. RevPAR increases range from 10% to 16% in these markets, generally benefiting from strong transient business exhibited by the double-digit transient revenue increases in these markets that range from 11% to over 26%.","Our hotels in Philadelphia significantly outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 16%, exceeding Smith Travel Research upper-upscale results by 190 basis points. Our hotels benefited from the post-renovation ramp at The Logan Hotel, the NFL Playoffs, and the parade that resulted from winning the Super Bowl. Group and transient revenues increased 7% and 17%, respectively, and the hotels grew average rate by 6.5%.","The RevPAR growth at our Florida Gulf Coast hotels exceeded our expectations with an impressive increase of 11.6% in a market where the STR upper-upscale results decreased by 30 basis points. Our iconic and irreplaceable hotels, such as The Ritz-Carlton in Naples, benefited from demand generated by the rooms out of service in the Caribbean and the Florida Keys because of hurricanes last year. Our hotels had a strong average rate growth of 9%. It's worth noting that the transient average daily rate at our Ritz-Carlton resort in Naples is over $1,000 for the quarter, an increase of over 10% last year.","In Maui and Oahu, our iconic hotels, including our top RevPAR asset, the Fairmont Kea Lani in Wailea, grew RevPAR 9.7% in the quarter and exceeded the STR upper-upscale results by 680 basis points. The growth was driven by an 8.4% improvement in average rate and 110 basis point increase in occupancy. Our hotels in this market experienced both strong transient and group business, which improved 10.7% and 5.6%, respectively. Demand continues to be strong for our Hawaiian assets, providing our managers the ability to grow rate at our hotels. I would also point out that even though they are non-comp, two of the three Hyatt assets we recently acquired were in Maui and the Florida Gulf Coast, two of the top performing markets this quarter.","Host, not unlike the overall industry, experienced challenges in the quarter in Washington, D.C., Houston, and San Antonio. While RevPAR at our hotels declined from 7% to 17.4%, these results outperformed our expectations and the hotels in Houston and San Antonio markets experienced better than expected transient demand.","RevPAR at our hotels in Washington, D.C. declined 17.4% this quarter, with a 400 basis point decline in occupancy and a 13% decline in average rate. As is well known at this point, city-wide events last year, such as the inauguration and the Women's March in Washington, D.C. provided for difficult year-over-year comparisons at our hotels this quarter.","In Houston, while RevPAR decreased 9%, the results exceeded our expectations due to stronger than expected transient demand. It was encouraging to see transient demand growth of 3.4% this quarter. However, our hotels were impacted by the decline in group revenues as our hotels posted high-rate Super Bowl groups last year. Interestingly, excluding Washington, D.C. and Houston, comparable RevPAR for our portfolio for the quarter would have been up 3.8%.","Our hotels in San Antonio experienced a RevPAR decline of 7% in the first quarter as weaker city-wide contributed to the declining group business. However, based on the improved group bookings through the remainder of the year for San Antonio, we expect these hotels in this market to outperform the portfolio as a whole for the rest of the year.","Looking at our forecast for the full year, we expect Miami, Philadelphia, and San Antonio to outperform our portfolio. Conversely, we anticipate Washington, D.C., Houston, and Atlanta to underperform.","Moving to our profitability and margin performance, we remain impressed by the exceptional job of our property and asset managers in bringing more profit to the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDAre exceeded our internal estimates at $370 million this quarter, which was $17 million or 5% above consensus estimates. In addition, adjusted FFO per share exceeded our internal estimates at $0.43 and was $0.03 or 7.5% above consensus estimates this quarter.","As Jim noted, comparable hotel margins were up 60 basis points in the first quarter with 28 basis points of that a result of a one-time tax rebate in New York at the Westin Grand Central. This rebate was an exchange for the investments we made to reposition the property. However, removing that one-time item, margins were still up 32 basis points on comparable hotel revenue of 1.5%, which is remarkable. We saw continued productivity improvements as room productivity improved 1.4% in the quarter. A primary driver of those results came from Marriott's Green Choice initiative which, we believe, still has room to improve going forward. We also witnessed the increased F&B productivity improvement as an additional eight hotels restructured their room service programs.","Finally, we saw continued savings from our time and motion studies, although the year-over-year benefit was less impactful on the overall portfolio because we're moving the studies to our small- and medium-sized hotels.","Additionally, undistributed operating expenses remained well below inflation at only 50 basis points, aiding margin improvement throughout the quarter. For instance, utility expenses remain low, increasing only 30 basis points for the quarter. This result was partially due to the benefits from our continued efforts to implement energy ROI-saving projects.","Other departmental revenue was also a contributor to margin outperformance this quarter as we saw a pickup in high margin ancillary revenues and cancellation fees. Cancellation fees were up primarily from group cancellations at only five properties, but we also witnessed increases in transient cancellation. With attrition flat in the quarter, this speaks positively to the overall customer demand and also indicates continued customer adoption of the longer cancellation windows our managers have been implementing across the portfolio.","Speaking of booking trends, travel agent commissions declined in the quarter, providing 10 basis points in the margin benefit. Notably, during the first quarter, we saw direct bookings grow more than OTAs since Marriott introduced its book direct initiative in early 2016. This is an encouraging trend at the end, demonstrates that customer habits are evolving, which is great as the customer acquisition costs are materially lower than what people book through Marriott.com.","Moving to our dividend, in April, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price.","In addition, this represents a payout ratio of 47% on our adjusted AFFO per share. We did not repurchase any shares in 2018 but have $500 million of capacity available under the current repurchase program, and used as one of the tools in our toolkit to create enhanced shareholder value at the appropriate point in time.","Moving to the balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility as we are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet. The advantage of our strong balance sheet was clearly demonstrated in the efficient execution of our $1 billion acquisition of the Hyatt portfolio.","As you'll recall, there was a tremendous increase in stock market volatility around the time we went under contract on that acquisition, which we believe hindered potential buyers. Host's liquidity and investment-grade balance sheet was a key differentiator of our ability to perform, thus, enabling us to secure that iconic portfolio of assets from Hyatt.","At March 31, 2018, we had cash of $323 million and $511 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $4.3 billion with an average maturity of 4.8 years and a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%.","In addition, we have no debt maturity until 2020. Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. We intend to use the net proceeds from the W New York sale and the newly-announced, unidentified asset sale to repay outstanding amounts under our credit facility or for general corporate purposes.","We have the only investment-grade balance sheet in the lodging REIT space, which we are committed to maintain as it is a prominent differentiator to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value-creation opportunities throughout the cycle.","Lastly, as you model and forecast out the remainder of 2018, please keep in mind that we generally earn 29% to 30% of our total adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results, which enabled us to increase our guidance across the board for the year. Furthermore, we are excited to close on the $1 billion acquisition of three Hyatt hotels and plug them into our industry-leading enterprise analytics and asset management platform.","Overall, our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable, and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value, combined with a powerful investment-grade balance sheet is a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to our stockholders over the long term.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To be sure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And first from Barclays, we'll hear from Anthony Powell.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Anthony.","Michael D. Bluhm - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning. Could you talk about your capital allocation priorities for the rest of the year? Are you seeing attractive acquisition opportunities in the market? And given the increase in merger activity in the space in recent years, are public company acquisitions a more realistic possibility for you right now?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","That's a multiple-part question, Anthony. Let me break it down a little bit for you as I answer it. First of all, I would tell you that we're not seeing a large amount of individual or portfolio acquisition opportunities that fit our profile. And when I say fit our profile, I'm not only talking about the nature of the asset, but I'm talking about the disciplined way in which we underwrite these potential investment opportunities.","So, that's one of the reasons why we didn't include any additional acquisitions in our guidance for the balance of the year. Of course, we're still looking at opportunities as they present themselves, and we're trying to get out ahead of the pack and bring to bear the attributes of the company and our scale and our access to information, and the fact that we do have an investment-grade balance sheet as opportunities present themselves.","On the M&A front, I would say that, as I've said in the past, we are very open-minded and we evaluate all opportunities to enhance NAV, and we'll continue to think about our strategy in that context going forward.","Anthony F. Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I wanted to ask about some of the changes that have come into play recently with some of the cancellation policies. I guess both Marriott and Hilton and \u2013 do you think those are beginning to have a more sustainable positive impact on rate growth and revenue management, given that the booking window has continued to extend out?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","We're very pleased with the implementation of the new cancellation policies. We have seen a, clearly, have seen a difference in booking patterns at the hotels. And most importantly, we're delighted that our property managers are enforcing the policies. We saw an uptick in cancellation fees in quarter one. It wasn't across the portfolio, it really dealt with the groups at five different hotels. But to be able to collect cancellation fees from groups, that is really something new. And we're also seeing it happen with the transient customer as well.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Very good. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Next from BTIG, we'll hear from Jim Sullivan.","James Sullivan - BTIG LLC","Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Jim.","James Sullivan - BTIG LLC","Jim, I wonder if you could comment about New York. The results were pretty decent in the quarter. And kind of two-part question here. What's your outlook for the balance of the year in that market? And secondly, in connection with that, do you have any read on international inward bound traffic trends, either in the quarter or currently?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","A couple questions. All right. With respect to international inbound, we did see a pickup on international inbound. And in conversations we've had with Marriott International, they've seen a pickup of about 13%. So, our total of our book of business, and it's spread across various gateway markets, New York being one of them, we generate about 10% of our business from international travel. So, we expect that that will help us not only in New York but in some of the other gateway markets where we operate, such as San Francisco, Miami, Los Angeles, and Seattle as well.","With respect to New York, Jim, I think our take on the city is, yes, we did see a pickup in the first quarter. We saw a nice bump in demand. We did see business travel return to our New York markets. However, there is still a lot of supply coming online this year and a lot of supply coming online next year. So, I would not anticipate seeing a material acceleration in performance in New York in 2018.","James Sullivan - BTIG LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hi. Morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Rich.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking the question here. So, I just want to go back to one of the prepared comments on the pickup in business transient during the quarter and the balance for the rest of the year. So it seems like demand is getting unambiguously stronger, but pricing was a little soft. Is that just sort of a timing issue? There's usually a lag between demand and pricing power, and if that's the case, is there any sort of ADR pickup in transient demand folded in the guidance at this point?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. Rich, I had a little bit of a difficult time hearing you. I think your question was related to the pickup in business demand in \u2013 if I could paraphrase it, tell me if I'm on the right track here. When is rate going to fall off?","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Yeah. That's generally correct. And then, how much of that is baked in the guidance as well?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, we have seen in the first quarter business transient demand pick up in really across the board but mainly in a handful of markets. We saw business demand pick up in Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Denver, and San Diego.","And with respect to the rate, we continue to look at corporate profits, and we continue to look at the business investment number, or non-fixed residential investment number, which is strong and has been increasing over the last several years. That's a pretty good indicator from our perspective of what's going to happen with the business traveler.","So in the first quarter in particular, while business demand room nights was up, as I mentioned, our group pace was down predominantly as a result of the holiday shifts, as a result of Easter and Passover shifting, and group business going down. So, we were not in a position in Q1 to really drive rate and yield the business traveler. We are hopeful that that will change over the course of the year.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks for that, Jim. Would you say that any such pickup is reflected in guidance at this point?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","No, it's not, Rich. As I mentioned, we're optimistic but \u2013 and we're going to be tracking business travel very closely over the balance of the year, but while I'd like to say that one quarter makes a trend, we're not ready to predict that just yet.","Rich Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","All right. Great. Thanks for that, Jim.","Operator","Moving on, we have Michael Bellisario from Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Mike.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Just want to go back to the first question on capital allocation. Maybe can you share your thoughts on the assets and portfolios that you have seen transact? And then maybe how has that changed the way you think about monetizing more of your assets or maybe selling some of the lower-tier properties within your portfolio?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, of course, we track every deal in the market even if it's not an asset that we may be interested in acquiring. So, we're getting a fairly good sense of what's happening on the acquisition side, the bid-ask between buyers and sellers and the debt capital markets are strong. So, as we sit back and think about what does that mean to us, I'll start with a premise that we're very comfortable with the portfolio that we have today.","That said, we would certainly be opportunistic sellers if we could achieve pricing on an asset or group of assets that exceeds our hold value. We look at every hotel at least on an annual basis, if not, more frequently to draw a point of view of what that asset is worth to us. And if we see the pendulum swinging in a way that we may be able to meaningfully beat those hold values, then of course, we would take advantage of that opportunity.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next from Citi, we have Smedes Rose.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. You mentioned in your opening remarks that the trends in the leisure markets were strong in the first quarter, and some of it, I think, was related to displacement from markets being out of service. I mean, when you talk to the operators, do you have a sense of how much of the incremental demand is that versus just continued strong trends from organic leisure growth? And I guess what I'm kind of wondering is, are we setting up for just sort of a really tough comp as those other markets come back online?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Smedes, I don't think we're setting ourselves up for a tough comp as other markets come online. Are the markets you're referring to the Caribbean and the Florida Keys in particular?","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Well, just the Caribbean in general. Post-hurricane, there's a lot of rooms out of service, and there's been a lot of negative headlines around Mexico. And I'm just wondering if you're saying \u2013 if we're just moving people from those places to your resorts, which is great, but I'm just wondering how sustainable is that?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think that, as we think about transient revenues in the first quarter, roughly \u2013 our rough breakdown is \u2013 if you think about our segmentation at the top line, we're roughly 40% group, 55% transient, 5% contract. Of the transient base, about 40% of that is leisure and about 50% is business, and about 10% is government. So, if you break it down from that perspective, we saw a pickup in leisure business, and we saw a pickup in business transient traveler really across the board.","I mean, the markets that drove leisure for us in the quarter, in addition to the Florida Gulf Coast, were Maui, Phoenix, and Orlando. And as I mentioned before, the markets that really drove business for us were Chicago, New York, San Francisco, Denver, and San Diego. I think this really points out, Smedes, to the nature of the assets we own and the broad geographic diversification of the portfolio that we have. So, we fill in where we can and we drive business in all the markets.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that color. I just wanted to ask you, so could you maybe just talk a little bit about group trending specifically in 2019 and particularly in San Francisco, and maybe any thoughts \u2013 are there any change in strategy with the Hyatt that you acquired there in terms of group versus transient of that property or any kind of thoughts you can provide there?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. Well, as we all know, 2018 \u2013 coming into the latter part of 2018, and 2019, and 2020, San Francisco is forecasted to have some very good growth. And we're excited to participate in that growth as we go forward. The Hyatt is roughly a 20% group house, 80% transient, 20% group. And I can tell you that, as we underwrote that transaction, we had a clear view into group bookings for 2018 and 2019, and we're very comfortable with the forecasted RevPAR performance for that hotel going forward.","The same with the Marquis, we took a look at that asset and made a decision that \u2013 just given the scale that we have and our ability to effectively manage complex renovations and think about displacement at that hotel, that it made sense to get the bulk of the work done this year, all the public space done this year, most of the rooms done this year, and modest rooms out of service going forward, so that we can also participate in a pickup in group business in 2019 at that hotel.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question will come from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. Couple of questions on current trends. Can you give us any commentary around either quarter-to-date or April RevPAR? And then, you may have given this, I didn't hear, but what would 1Q RevPAR been ex the holiday adjustments \u2013 the holiday? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thomas, I am not sure that I have the data to tell you what Q1 would have been ex the holiday. The only thing I will point to, again, which I think is impressive is if you were to exclude Houston and Washington, D.C. from our results, our Q1 RevPAR would have been 3.8%, which I think is really strong performance. I mean, it is really strong performance and we're very proud of the ability of our managers and asset managers and enterprise analytics to drive that number going forward.","With respect to April, we don't have April results in yet. We have most of them in, but given that we have a couple of days left in the quarter to report, I'm not comfortable giving you a hard number, but I will tell you April was in line with our expectations, maybe a little stronger.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then...","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","A little stronger than our expectations.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A little stronger. Okay. Perfect. And then just a follow-up, the UNITE HERE, the union put out a report about some of your peers talking about how they were entering to negotiations this summer after five years \u2013 after having not done so in five years. Where are you in terms of labor negotiations for major properties? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, we don't sit at the table with UNITE HERE or any of the other unions, but we do collaborate with our management companies with respect to the positions that we feel are most appropriate as conversations are had with representatives of the labor unions. And negotiations and conversations have begun in the Boston marketplace and in Los Angeles. So, our best guess of what that looks like is baked into our guidance for the year.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Next from UBS, we have Robin Farley.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","On the \u2013 great. I know you highlighted already some of the reasons that margins were up even though rate was down, and I guess my question is how sustainable is that when we look after your guidance for this year, when we look to next year, in terms of maintaining that?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Robin, we \u2013 there were a number of factors that drove margin performance in the first quarter. Clearly, we had ancillary income increases in a number of different areas that tracked increased demand. And as I mentioned, we had the one-time tax rebate at Westin Grand Central, which contributed 28 basis points. But that said, we were able to increase our full-year EBITDA margin guidance by 10 basis points. So, we saw improvements in rooms productivity. We saw improvements in food and beverage productivity. We saw a decline in food procurement cost. We continue to see benefits from Marriott's implementation of Make a Green Choice, which was a Starwood legacy program that is really helping us. I think we saw the Make a Green Choice program accelerate about 3.4% in the quarter. We think there's a lot more room to go with that initiative going forward.","We saw improvements in procurement cost on the Starwood legacy hotels as they get plugged into Avendra going forward. And there are a number of other things that we're excited about in connection with the Starwood integration into Marriott as we go forward.","And we think that we'll continue to find ways to improve margin performance both on the Marriott legacy hotels as well as the Starwood legacy hotels. Another example is that Marriott is implementing Starwood's best practices on worker compensation at our Marriott legacy hotels, which is also helping us reduce cost.","And then again, we have time and motion studies available to us on the balance of the portfolio, the medium and smaller hotels. We certainly wouldn't expect to see the same level of benefits as a result of those time and motion studies that we saw on the bigger box hotels. But we will continue to see productivity improvements and cost savings along those lines.","I just want to leave you with one thought, we're never done. So, we're always looking for the next opportunity to increase productivity and to reduce cost as we look at our assets going forward.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the sort of idea that RevPAR has to be up 2% to 3% in order to see margin growth, do you think that will be different in 2019? In other words, given the initiatives you just laid out for us, is that kind of benchmark lower than for 2019?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I would tell you that our forecast would have flat margins at 2% RevPAR growth. I don't see any reason to move off of that at this point. I mean, this year, we're going to increase margins 10 basis points to 2%. So, I think a good bet is if you have 2% and flat margins, that should be achievable.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Maybe kind of a two-parter. First was, just Marriott recently put through a plan to reduce third-party commission rates. So, I'm just curious, how much of your business came through that third-party channel, and maybe how that has affected your group pace in 2018 or 2019? And maybe just as a follow up, what is it about the opportunity with IBM that led you to approach them, and what specifically do you hope to improve? I'm just curious how, I guess, Watson is differentiated from the service the brands provide you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Let me answer the first question \u2013 second question first, Jeff, because we're really excited about our newfound relationship with IBM Research. The world is moving to artificial intelligence and predictive capabilities. And while we all, everyone in our space has access to a lot of structured data, we have access to new supply, we have access to historical RevPAR, we have access to projected RevPAR, which doesn't always turn out to be what the forecasts are. We had several meetings with the researchers at IBM to look at ways that we can predict RevPAR, which I think is something a bit different and it would be much more quantitative than is available to anyone today.","They were willing to enter into this arrangement with us, given our scale and access to information. So we can look at various markets across the country and look at unstructured data in addition to structured data, such as what's happening in, pick a city, X, Y, Z city, what's happening in terms of businesses moving to those cities. What's happening with respect to the municipality's support of the growth in industry and jobs? What's happening in higher education, in housing? And that data is out there, but it's pretty difficult to go into any particular market, particularly when we operate across the country and corral it and say, okay, this is where we should be allocating capital in 2019, 2020, 2021.","So we're hopeful that our relationship with Watson is going to give us that extra analytic capability to really look a little bit into the future, to understand trends that today are not so easy to predict. So your question regarding the Marriott's negotiation with the travel agent, the group travel agent commissions, most of our business \u2013 I shouldn't say most \u2013 but I'd say 60% of our group business is obtained through third-party intermediaries. That business has been growing over the years. We feel very strongly that decreasing the commissions will benefit the owners over the long term. We saw a little bit of an increase in booking activity in March.","As I'm sure you're aware, the way the program works with Marriott is the Big Four, the four biggest intermediaries, are maintaining their 10% commission through the balance of this year. Effective January of next year, it will be reduced to 7%. The balance of the group intermediaries saw that change occur as of April 1.","So, we saw a bit of a pull forward in some business, but as we sat around and talked about it yesterday, the order of magnitude of the business that we saw pull forward relative to our absolute level of group bookings, frankly, was immaterial.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next, from Raymond James, we have Bill Crow.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. That leads me into my question, which is, see if you can quantify the impact, not only of the 10% to 7% shift, but also in anticipation of Marriott's negotiations with the OTAs later this summer, let's call it, 100 basis points, every 100 basis points of take rate \u2013 commission rate goes down, what's the impact to you? I get the sense it's more impactful for Host than it is for many others.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Bill, you're referring to the OTAs or the tender stuff?","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. I think there's two topics, right? The one that was just discussed, which is the big group commissions , if you save 300 basis points on a full-year basis, what does that translate into for you all? And then the second one is the OTAs and the negotiations, what every 100-basis-point reduction in that take rate would mean to you all?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, I don't have the math in front of me, Bill, but I will tell you that we're getting roughly 10% of our business through the OTA channels. We can certainly do the math and get back to you on that number. With respect to the group commissions, we looked at a number of different scenarios before this program was rolled out. We sat down with Marriott and looked at upsides scenarios and downside scenarios. So, without giving a specific number, we feel that there will be benefit to the bottom line as we transition from 10% to 7% going forward. And that's why we were prepared to sign onto the program.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Do you have a number for budget for group commissions for 2018 that we get that adjust?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I don't. Not in front of me anyway. Well, let us look something up and we'll give you a call back.","Bill A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You got it. Appreciate it. That's it for me.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Next, we have Gregory Miller with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I'm on for Patrick.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Greg.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Morning. I have a couple of questions related to the Hyatt acquisitions. I'm hoping that you could elaborate on the short-term and long-term opportunities with the three hotels and how long do you think it will take until you're at a stabilized level of operating performance?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. I think whenever we announced the acquisition last quarter, we talked about a stabilized yield somewhere in the mid-6s over the next two to three years. We saw a number of opportunities, and I don't think that's changed, Greg, by the way. If anything, we're very pleased with the performance out of the box of these three assets. We see opportunities at the Andaz Maui to develop a 19-acre parcel of land which we've allocated $15 million to for either for-sale housing or additional units that we can pulled into the hotel that wasn't underwritten when we made the acquisition.","We see opportunities in Maui to collaborate with the Kea Lani Palace, which is four hotels up the beach from the Andaz and also collaborate and centralize services with our Hyatt Regency K\u0101\u02bbanapali which is also on the island. We also \u2013 just as a general statement, we will be rolling out time and motion studies at all three hotels as we go forward and looking at ways that we can enhance productivity and drive down cost.","In San Francisco, very much the same story. The Grand Hyatt Union Square, we see an opportunity to add some guest rooms to re-concept the food and beverage offerings to save money and make those offerings more efficient. Again, opportunities to collaborate between (56:50) and the Grand Hyatt which were in the same market, and opportunities to collaborate and centralize some services between the Grand Hyatt Union Square and our Hyatt Regency Burlingame.","And by the way, with respect to collaborations between the hotels that may be managed by different brands but owned by Host, we've successfully done this in San Diego, where we own the Manchester Grand Hyatt and it sits right next door to the San Diego Marriott Marquis.","And with respect to the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point, there are a number of initiatives that we identified in our underwriting that we will be moving forward on such as the possibility, early underwriting stages of building a new spa with a built-in base of business given some of the demographic trends that are occurring in that submarket, and also looking at how that hotel is performing relative to our other properties on the Gulf Coast, which includes three, the Don CeSar, The Ritz-Carlton Beach Resort, The Ritz Carlton Golf Resort, as well as a couple of other properties on the East Coast, The Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island and the Harbor Beach Marriott.","So, we're really excited about the ability to create value with these assets. One of the reasons that we got so excited about acquiring them, they truly are iconic. They're in markets which expect to be the fastest-growing markets in the country going forward. And we're delighted to be able to work with Hyatt. We have a great partnership with them. We now own 10 Hyatt hotels and enjoy the relationship.","Gregory J. Miller - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much. It sounds like there's a lot of tremendous opportunities there. Appreciate it.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure thing.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session for the day. I'd like to turn the floor back to Jim Risoleo for any additional or closing remarks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, everyone, thanks for joining us on the call today.

Good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter. Our operating results, given the trends the industry is experiencing, were quite good and in line with our expectations. We completed the sales of our last two New Zealand assets, continued to make progress on our redevelopment investments, and repurchased 44 million of our stock in September, breaking the year-to-date total return to shareholders to over $800 million.","Looking at our operating results, adjusted EBITDA was $342 million for the quarter reflecting an increase of 5.9%. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $1.123 billion, an increase of 5.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.37 per share for the third quarter and a $1.28 year-to-date, reflecting an 11.3% increase over last year.","A strong EBITDA and FFO performance was driven by the top-line growth and margin expansion. For the quarter, our average rate grew 2.2% complemented by solid demand growth in our portfolio, as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 1.2 percentage points, allowing our comparable hotels to achieve an occupancy rate of 81.3%. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 3.8%.","The primary driver of our RevPAR growth this quarter was our group segment. Our domestic hotels benefited from a 3.4% increase in group demand, all generated by a significant increase in association demand. Corporate demand was uneven in the quarter but the shift in the timing of the Jewish holidays from September of last year to October of this year led to a significant increase in corporate group during September. The net result was a 2.5% increase in average rate which was generally achieved across all of our group segments leading our domestic group revenues to increase by 6% for the quarter.","Our international assets also buoyed portfolio results this quarter as our Canadian hotels benefited from strong transient demand leading to RevPAR growth of almost 15% and the Olympic Games generated a 105% RevPAR growth in our Brazil asset. Since much of our Olympic business was booked as group, our overall group business actually increased by more than 9% to the quarter.","As would be expected, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand which has been a theme for most of this calendar year. However, unlike the first two quarters, our hotels were able to increase rates and also push business into more highly-rated segments leading to transient rate growth of 2% for the quarter. Taking into account the decline in transient demand, our transient revenue growth was slightly less than 1%.","Recognizing the trends we have been experiencing this year, we have been focused on layering in more highly-priced contract business at several of our hotels. Our contract business which is still only 5% of our total demand increased nearly 15% for the quarter and is up 17% year-to-date.","The one aspect of our operations that was disappointing in Q3 was our food & beverage department as food & beverage revenues increased by just 0.3% which was roughly 2% less than we had anticipated. While F&B has been notoriously difficult to forecast, the bulk of the shortfall occurred in catering and resulted from groups being more conservative with their entertaining budgets. Our revenue actually grew by nearly 2% which was an impressive result given that transient occupancy had decreased.","Offsetting some of the weakness in F&B, our other department revenues grew by a strong 10.5%. We saw a strong increase in spa revenues and an increase in attrition and cancellation fees which was largely concentrated at three of our convention hotels. Comparable hotel revenues increased 3.3% for the quarter. The increased level of higher rated group activity combined with the rate increase in our transient business as well as our continued focus on productivity improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through. This flow-through, plus reductions in utility and insurance expenses, contributed to our comparable EBITDA margin growth of a 110 basis points in the third quarter.","Year-to-date, comparable hotel RevPAR has increased 3% in constant currency terms. Food and beverage has improved by 2.1%, and hotel revenues have increased by 3.1%. Comparable EBITDA margin growth is 90 basis points, which has generated 56% flow-through for the year which is a very solid result.","An important focus of our company is actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. Towards that goal, as I mentioned earlier, in the third quarter, we completed the sales of final two New Zealand properties for $31 million bringing out year-to-date, non-core asset sale total to approximately $500 million.","We purchased this New Zealand portfolio for $190 million in New Zealand terms and received total sales proceeds in New Zealand dollars of NZD 266 million, which allowed us to achieve better than a 14.5% unlevered IRR on this investment.","We are currently marketing our remaining consolidated Asia-Pacific asset, the Melbourne Hilton, and we'd hope to complete a sale during the first half of 2017. In addition, we are marketing a select few other non-core asset while we are making reasonable progress on these sales, the transactions have not yet gone hard and we do not expect any additional asset sales will be completed in 2016.","On the investment front, the company invested approximately $46 million in the third quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. We completed the initial phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment, which included newly-designed guest rooms in one of the towers, a new lobby and lounge, new fitness center and some additional meeting space. While we are pleased with the progress we have made on this project, we are slightly behind schedule due to some permitting challenges, but still expect to be completed by year-end.","In addition, we have also made great progress on the first phase of the renovations at The Phoenician during the slower summer months. This phase included a complete redesign of the guestrooms, casitas and canyon suites. We are excited to have an opportunity to show you our progress at The Phoenician before NAREIT in less than two weeks.","For the full year, we expect to spend $200 million to $215 million on redevelopment, ROI and acquisition projects and $300 million to $310 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures.","Now, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Uncertainties surrounding the US Election and other international events lead us to believe that corporate profit growth and business investment levels will not improve meaningfully in the near term, suggesting that business transient demand will remain soft in the fourth quarter.","While year-to-date, our domestic group revenues went up nearly 4%, we expect to experience a softer fourth quarter as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election will reduce group demand and the traditionally lower occupancies in the fourth quarter will likely restrain rate growth.","Our group booking and revenue take for Q4 is only slightly positive and assuming continued short-term booking weakness could easily be slightly negative for the fourth quarter. A combination of these factors suggest that we will experience minimal RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter, leading us to conclude that our full year comparable RevPAR will increase between 2% and 2.5%.","Weaker group demand and negligible revenue growth will put pressure on operating margins in the fourth quarter, reversing to some degree the strong results we have seen year-to-date. As a consequence, we expect our full-year comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth improvement to be in the range of 40 basis points to 55 basis points. This should translate to full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.455 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.64 to $1.66.","Looking ahead to 2017, as we have indicated in prior years, our visibility at this time into next year is limited as we have just started on our detailed operating budget process. There are a number of factors that will influence operating results in 2017, starting first and foremost with the economy.","This year, we are experiencing weaker GDP growth and declines in corporate profits and investments, plus the strength in the US dollar. These factors have led to weak corporate transient demand and reduced international travel, resulting in industry demand growth of just 1.5%, which is well short of the average of nearly 3% for the last three years. The outlook for GDP corporate profits and corporate investment is more favorable in 2017, but the concept that it will be better next year has been offered frequently during this recovery and generally hasn't come to fruition. The current fee outlook is slightly more favorable, especially in countries such as Japan and Brazil, which could lead to better international travel trends.","As opposed to the uncertainty surrounding demand factors, it is clear that supply is increasing. In our top 19 markets, upscale and above supply has increased by roughly 2.5% in 2016, while a number of reports have correctly noted that our portfolio is less exposed to new supply than many others in the industry, primarily because we benefit from a more diversified distribution. Supply in our markets is still expected to increase by more than 3% in 2017. While we are experiencing record occupancies this year, this anticipated supply increase suggests that we will need to have stronger demand growth in 2017 to have pricing power.","Our group revenues for 2017 are up over 2.5%, but short-term bookings have been growing at a slower rate and so we would not accomplish expect to benefit (12:15) from the significant increase in group activities that we have seen in 2016. Combining all of these insights along with the trend of weakening top-line growth that we have seen over the last two years, we would not expect to see RevPAR accelerate in 2017 unless the economy improves meaningfully. We will provide much greater insights into our outlook for 2017 in our fourth quarter call in February.","With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Ed. I'll start with commentary on performance in several of our major markets. Our consolidated international hotels had a spectacular third quarter with double-digit RevPAR increases in Latin America and Canada of more than 61% and almost 15%, respectively. As anticipated, the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Brazil drove significant increases in our three Brazilian hotels.","Our hotels in Calgary and Toronto also experienced double-digit RevPAR growth. Toronto's outperformance was mainly the result of a Microsoft city-wide in July which caused compression in that market. Calgary experienced strong growth due to an increase in events at the convention center. Keep in mind that overall demand in Brazil, excluding the demand surrounding the Olympics, has been weak due to concerns over Zika, economic and political issues, as well as increased supply. As a result, we expect lodging fundamentals in Brazil to weaken in the fourth quarter.","As discussed last quarter, despite the slow start in San Diego in the first half of the year, RevPAR for our assets in the market grew at an impressive 11.8% this quarter, with occupancy growth of 5.6 percentage points and a 5% increase in average rate. Importantly, our RevPAR results exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 430 basis points. The increase in city-wide room nights from MLB All-Star Game and Comic-Con created healthy compression in the market and resulted in strong group business, which was up almost 26%. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our hotels in San Diego to continue to outperform our portfolio.","Our hotels in Hawaii grew RevPAR 7.7% this quarter, beating the STAR upper upscale market results by 220 basis points. Occupancy increased 4.8 percentage points and average rate improved 2.1%. Strong transient demand at our Mali hotel coupled with solid group business at the Fairmont Kea Lani and Hyatt Place Waikiki offset ballroom renovation displacement at Hyatt Maui. Short-term transient demand increased more than anticipated in August and September, as vacationers chose Maui over the Zika-feared Caribbean locations and airfare costs remained stable. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we should note that Hawaii is the market with the lowest expected supply growth out of the top-20 U.S. markets for the next couple of years, which bodes well for future performance. As expected, our properties in D.C. outperformed our portfolio again this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 6.8% outpacing the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR increase by 120 basis points. This was driven predominantly by an average rate increase of 5.6% as well as a 90-basis point increase in occupancy. The Westin Georgetown, JW D.C. and Grand Hyatt all had double-digit RevPAR growth this quarter benefiting from renovations in the comp set and a strong group base that created mid-week compression and enabled the hotels to drive strong average rate growth.","With elections next Tuesday and the resulting slowdown in legislative activity, we expect RevPAR growth to slow in the fourth quarter, but still expect outperformance relative to the portfolio. Even though we have not provided any guidance for 2017, it is worth mentioning that city-wides in 2017 look strong for D.C. Combined with Congress operating on a full calendar and Inauguration in January, we expect there will be additional demand in 2017.","Los Angeles continues to outperform the portfolio, with a 6.6% increase in the third quarter. The results were driven by a 3.5% growth in average rate and a 2.5 percentage point increase in occupancy. Strong group and contracts business at several of our hotels drove the RevPAR increase which exceeded the STAR upper upscale market results by 120 basis points. Year-to-date, our hotels in Los Angeles have grown RevPAR by 8.9%. Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group booking pace in Los Angeles remains strong and as a result, we expect continued outperformance from our Los Angeles properties.","In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.6% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 0.8% and occupancy increase of 3.6 percentage points. Continued strong city-wide room nights in the third quarter contributed to the outperformance. As anticipated, the city-wide calendar on a year-over-year basis for the fourth quarter will be weak. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter RevPAR to be flat for last year.","Moving to some challenged markets. New York RevPAR decreased 4% basically in line with the STAR upper upscale decline of 3.6%. Supply continued to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong US dollar continued to negatively impact our ability to drive rates. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect the hotels in New York to continue to have a RevPAR decline in the fourth quarter.","RevPAR of the San Francisco hotels declined 3.4% with a decrease in both occupancy and rate this quarter. Group room nights were down due to the Moscone Convention Center expansion which will continue to negatively impact San Francisco in 2017. Due to the lack of group compression, almost all hotels booked more lower-rated transient business resulting in overall transient ADR decline of 5.4%. Our San Francisco hotels will likely underperform our portfolio in the fourth quarter.","The Houston market continues to be impacted by the struggling oil industry and increased supply as evidenced by the superior decline in the STAR upper upscale of nearly 14%. Our Houston hotels' RevPAR declined 2.9% in the quarter, as a 3.7% decrease in ADR was partially offset by a small increase in occupancy. Two major city-wide events did not repeat in the third quarter this year compelling our managers to book group business at our hotels to maintain occupancy. This proved to be the right strategy as we beat the STAR upper upscale market by 11 percentage points. We expect the difficulties in Houston to continue in the fourth quarter and therefore anticipate that these hotels will underperform the portfolio.","RevPAR of the hotels in Seattle declined 1.5% in the third quarter. Occupancy declined about one percentage point to almost 91% and ADR decreased 0.3%. Last year, our hotels in Seattle had a record group business in the quarter and grew at RevPAR 9.8%, making for a difficult comparison this year.","Many of the groups during third quarter last year did not repeat this year and the market has seen a decrease in Canadian leisure weekend business contributing to the weaker results this quarter. We expect performance to improve in the fourth quarter as transient demand increases and the W Seattle will benefit from being under renovation last December.","RevPAR of the Phoenix hotels grew 0.6% in the quarter with an occupancy decline of 4.3 percentage points and an increase in ADR of 7.9%. Our hotels were negatively impacted by group cancellations, slippage and soft transient demand. We expect RevPAR of the hotels in Phoenix to improve in the fourth quarter.","Chipping to our European joint venture, the portfolio continues to be negatively impacted by a number of macro factors, including the lingering effect of the terrorist attack in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty pre and post Brexit. All this led to a RevPAR decline of 2.6% in constant euro this quarter.","As expected, our hotels in Paris and Brussels significantly underperformed the portfolio while our hotels in London, Spain and Stockholm outperformed. We expect our hotels in Paris and Brussels will continue to be challenged in the fourth quarter.","As noted in our press release, during the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $16.04 for a total purchase price of $44 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 51.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $883 million. We currently have $117 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.","In addition, in October, we paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents an annualized yield of over 5% on the current stock price. Based on our current operating forecast, combined with taxable gains generated from our completed asset sales to-date and our regular fourth quarter dividend, we expect to pay a special dividend of approximately $0.05, bringing total dividends for the fourth quarter to $0.25 per share.","We continued to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REITs and overall REITs space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage which enhances our ability to pay our dividends throughout the cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise to buy asset, buy back our stock or reinvest in high-yielding redevelopment or ROI projects.","We ended the third quarter with approximately $340 million of cash and currently have $628 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility. We improved our leverage ratio, as calculated under our credit facility, to 2.5 times.","It is important to note that when updating models for 2017, our 2016 adjusted EBITDA includes $12 million for the reimbursement of operating losses at the New Orleans Marriott due to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In addition, the 2016 full-year guidance includes adjusted EBITDA of $13 million that was earned by the hotels that have been sold during the year. Therefore, a total of $25 million in EBITDA will not repeat in 2017.","However, keep in mind that comparable EBITDA margin growth in 2016 was not impacted by these items as the business interruption insurance proceeds and sold assets are excluded from our comparable hotel results.","In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as the profitability of our assets continues to improve due to our aggressive asset management strategies in what continues to be a competitive environment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll go first to Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everyone. I believe you mentioned the group cancellations a few times in your script. So if you could give us more details on what exactly was going on there and what markets were impacted and if you expect that to continue next year?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. Overall, we've seen that cancellation and attrition fees, which is what we were talking about, have been higher this year than they have been in the last few years. Now, I would tell you that the level of attrition and cancellations we saw in the first half of this decade was below what I would describe as our long-term average, but the bottom line is they're up about 30% for the year. They were up closer to about 60% this particular quarter.","We saw the cancellations in Orlando and at two of our larger convention hotels, one in San Francisco, which I suspect might have been a little bit related to some of the activity out there at the convention center that you're all fully aware of, and also at the Marquis. I would imagine that you'll \u2013 that we think that will moderate a bit in the fourth quarter, but it's not abnormal at this part of the cycle to start to see a little bit more in terms of cancellation and attrition activity. So we would expect to see that continue at a slightly elevated level compared to the 2010 to 2015 timeframe.","Part of that, I would note, though, is I'd be careful to draw the conclusion that means that people are canceling it or not showing up to a greater degree in the past. I'm sure that's part of what's happening. Some of that, this is also reflective of the fact that we have better contracts from our perspective, which is enabling us to recover more when folks don't show up.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And Greg, I think you mentioned your ability to pay your dividend through the cycle. What did you mean by that? And are you committed to maintaining your current dividend even as taxable income goes down a bit next year?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. I mean, obviously, as I noted today, our taxable income actually exceeds the $0.80. And so, yes, I think we \u2013 what we've said in the past is that we would like to pay our dividend throughout this next cycle, and if our taxable income were to have a modest drop next year, yes, I think because we have one of the best balance sheets in the entire REIT universe, I think we're in a good position to be able to continue to pay the dividend.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Joseph Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning, everybody. Greg, can you help us understand how much the Olympics contributed to your Brazil results in terms of revenues and EBITDA in the third quarter?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I mean, when we look at our hotels in Latin America, I mean, they had a RevPAR increase in north of 60%, so obviously, a little bit.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. One way to look at that, Joe, would be that our \u2013 I think for the full year, we're probably expecting that our Brazil hotels will generate between, call it, $10 billion to $12 billion worth of EBITDA. So, they're not overly significant to our overall results, but there was \u2013 we had an incredibly strong quarter especially at the top line, and that obviously did influence our overall results for the quarter.","Having said that, if you look at our domestic results, we would still \u2013 we've still had a very solid quarter from a domestic perspective with RevPAR being up 2.8%. So, no doubt that that headline number is better because of Brazil, but we were strong in Mexico and we were strong in Toronto, too. So, all of our international hotels had a good quarter and domestic portfolio did, too.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then, you talked about this in your earlier prepared remarks about the transaction market, but can you talk about the asset sale transaction market? I guess how frozen is it now, especially when you look at markets with high supply growth, say, a city like New York? Thank you.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I would say that it certainly not \u2013 and I think you've heard this from others. The market is not as robust as it was in 2014 and the first half of 2015. Having said that, I would say that there's still activity happening. I just think deals take longer. The number of folks that are chasing a particular transaction is probably a little bit thinner.","We're hearing as we talk with the brokerage community, as we look at the experience we're having, we're finding that the international buyers are probably a bit higher percentage of the activity than in past. You're seeing some smaller operators associated with family offices chase after some of the smaller deals that are out there.","I've heard that some of the public but non-traded REITs or non-listed REITs have been a bit more active, too. So there's still a market out there. I feel reasonably optimistic that we're \u2013 I certainly feel optimistic we'll sell Melbourne. I think that there is a decent chance that we'll complete a few more asset sales. But as I started off in saying the market is not as strong as it had been, and that's why you're not seeing as many sales announced by folks.","Joseph R. Greff - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. Ed, maybe just to follow-up on that last point. You had laid out a program of I think $500 million to $1 billion. You're at the lower bound of that now, of what you wanted to target. Is there a chance that getting further, reaching too much further closer to the $1 billion, is increasingly off the table just given what you're seeing out there? How are you thinking about that target now?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Short answer is that I think we can still over the next three quarters get to the $1 billion number. But I would also say that that is totally dependent on us feeling comfortable with the pricing that we get. Greg talked about the strength of our balance sheet, and I think you all recognize that. We're not doing this for liquidity reasons. We're doing this because we're trying to be smart about how to continue to position our portfolio for the future. And the assets that we're selling now are just ones that we generally think will not perform as well as the remainder of our portfolio or may have higher capital needs.","The one exception to that would be Melbourne, where we've made the conscious decision to exit the Asia-Pacific market and so we want to sell that property. We won't sell that for a bad price, by any means, but that is one that we are more motivated to sell perhaps than some others. So bottom line is that I think we still have a reasonable shot at getting to the high end of that range, but we'll be thoughtful in terms of evaluating the sale opportunities that we have and making the decisions going forward on those sales.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is related to some of your comments on supply. So appreciate that color as we look forward to next year. If I recap, I think you guys said that in Host markets, you're looking for greater than 3% supply in 2017. Can you just give us a sense of where is that number this year in Host markets so we can compare and see how big of an acceleration you're anticipating?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, you mean what is that number this year? Is that what you were asking?","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, correct.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, so I think the number that we're quoting, what we're finding today as relevant is to look at upscale and above. So I think you know that the upper upscale segment generally has very light supply. And I think that's still coming in generally across the board in our markets at less than 2%. But it's clear to us that, depending upon the property, we may compete with upscale supply, too. And so if we look at that particular number, this year we would say that across our top 19 or 20 markets, we're looking at supply that's roughly 2.5% in 2016. We think that's going to escalate to slightly more than 3% in 2017.","Markets that we are a bit concerned about would be ones that you are, too, Seattle, Denver, Houston, and New York. I think the thing to note for us, though, is that while those markets represent about, call it, 15% of our EBITDA, we also have great representation in some markets like Atlanta, Hawaii, San Diego or San Francisco, that are expected to have much lower supply.","And in fact, those last four markets that I just referred to, we have more than 25% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. So hence my point in our prepared remarks that when we see our portfolio compared to others, we think we have a little bit less exposure to supply than some others because of the diversity in the portfolio.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Very clear. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning. Two questions. First, you added a disclosure on hotel management opportunities in the press release. Can you provide some additional color on how the new economics impacted results and also address how many properties are potentially still governed by above-market management fee agreements?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, we had agreed at least for the short-term not to provide specifics about that particular transaction. So, unfortunately, I'm going to have to abide by that agreement. But I would say that we had an opportunity there where a contract was expiring and there was a chance to both lower our management fees. We extended the term a bit, but we retained a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how the hotel would be operated going forward.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think if you look across our portfolio, we do continue to have a number of opportunities. It probably falls in the realm of a couple of years you space things out over the next five to seven years where there's an opportunity to consider either replacing the existing branded operator with a franchise operator or we may have contracts that terminate that offer us even more flexibility.","So I think it's an area that we've been able to have a fair amount of \u2013 we view that where we've may done conversions or where we've changed contracts, we're consistently seeing anywhere from a 10% to 20% improvement in EBITDA as a result of the changes that we're making. And it's something that we could build into our business plan for each year is to look at the opportunities that may exist for that year and then try to exploit them.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Then just as a follow-up, with the closing of the Marriott Starwood transaction, can you just give any kind of initial color on the potential impact there, and any difference in hotel level fundamentals between the two companies and comparable chains? Thanks.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Of course, at this point, they've only been closed for probably less than 45 days. And certainly, maybe the biggest issue that surrounds that whole transaction from our perspective as an owner will be how smoothly and how successfully the integration goes. I'm sure that Marriott and Arne will give you more insights into those issues on their call which I'm assuming is later this week.","I guess what I'd say is, as we've looked at this and we've consistently said this since the transaction was announced, our Starwood Hotels were operated under the Marriott expense and cost structure, not fee structure, but the operating costs of running those hotels. We think that there will be an opportunity to reduce expenses at our Starwood Hotels. There's a number of elements of the Marriott system, be it reservations or purchasing or some other areas, including their agreements with the online company where the Marriott contracts and the Marriott cost structure is cheaper. I can't \u2013 it's \u2013 we know that as they work their way through the integration process, we will start to see the benefits of those cost savings. But it's a little hard right now for us to predict how quickly that will happen.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Fair enough. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey, good morning. It seems like one of the bright spots during this earnings season has been leisure trends outperforming. I mean, how long do you think that leisure trends can continue to outperform given the corporate environment? And any other thoughts on leisure trends would be helpful. Thank you.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. I think as long as employment remains fairly strong then I would say looking back in past history, leisure should probably hold up fairly well. If you go back to the 2001 to 2003 downturn, we generally found throughout that downturn, because it was not from an economic perspective, it was not that severe.","Hence, unemployment, if my recollection serves me right, did not increase significantly during that time period. We found that our resort hotels outperformed during that time period, and we generally found that leisure travel was fairly strong. I think, going forward, the other thing that will affect leisure travel will be international leisure. We've had \u2013 the last 18 months have been a bit weak, primarily because of currency. But assuming that the currency stabilizes, I think there's an opportunity for some pickup there.","We're generally fairly bullish as you look out over the next five years about our resorts profile. We think it benefits from both a combination of the leisure trends that we just discussed, and secondarily, it benefits from the fact that supply in the resorts segment is much lower than the industry as a whole.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful. Thanks. And then, can you just give us an update on how you think the hotel brand's direct booking push is affecting your business? Thanks.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","We're generally in favor of what they are trying to do there. We know that there is some short-term pain associated with that. The best estimate that I have heard of that is it might have cost us a couple of tenths of RevPAR growth in the last couple of quarters. So we're watching it and well, obviously, to the extent that it doesn't seem to be accomplishing their goals, may urge them to reconsider it. But at this point in time, we're still comfortable with heading down that path. I mean, the bottom line is that the reservation made through an operator website is a heck of a lot cheaper for us than one that might come through an OTA in terms of the costs associated with that booking. And so to the extent that we can drive more traffic to that operator website, we generally think that makes a difference for us from the bottom line and that's what matters most to us.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, thanks. I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about, and I'm sure you'll give more detail on your fourth-quarter call, but just your CapEx priorities as you think about 2017 and where you are? You have about $100 million left on your share repurchase program, would you look to continue to buy back shares at these levels or just sort of some general thoughts around that?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. Let me answer the second question, first. We will be buying more of our shares back, especially if the price remains at the current level. And we do \u2013 we have the balance sheet capability to do that. We have the authorization from the board to do that. So, you should assume that we'll continue to pursue a share buyback.","CapEx for next year, I'd say that we've been \u2013 had been targeting for a few years now to be spending a bit less, especially on maintenance CapEx in 2016 and I think that will carry over in 2017. So, I would generally expect to see a little bit less capital in 2017. Our thought had generally been that we would prefer to \u2013 we would look to increase capital spending a bit later in the cycle under the theory that it costs us a little bit less maybe in terms of lost occupancy. And it costs us a little bit less because oftentimes as you get near the end of the cycle, pricing for construction projects drops, too. So, we're not at the point we're making any decisions about 2018. We are looking hard at our 2017 plan, and I'd say general \u2013 the general initial sense, without putting a hard number on it, is it will be lower than what we've spent in 2016.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. You know, you mentioned earlier, too, that all things being equal that Marriott Hotels run, I guess, at a higher relative operating margin versus Starwood. And I was just wondering, I mean just two similar hotels side-by-side, like what is kind of the difference, all things being equal? Is it like 50 basis points or is it a point of margin or just kind of very broadly?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","You know Smedes, I know that it is less, but I'm not confident enough, sitting here right now, to give you a direct answer on that question. So, let's \u2013 I don't think it's more than a point. Let's put it that way.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. I just \u2013 that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good morning. I wonder if I could just take you back to capital allocation. I noted the increased ROE spending in the fourth quarter, and I wonder if you could just comment about how you look at ROE spending versus buybacks? And how tightly tied are future asset sales and continued stock buybacks? Thanks.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I would say that the increase that you saw in the ROI CapEx \u2013 or the redevelopment CapEx is a lot more to just do with the timing of when we expect to complete projects, and probably even more so when we expect to close them out, rather than being an indication of any change in philosophy or change in quantity in terms of our projects.","There may be a little bit of a couple of projects being a hair more expensive than what we had originally anticipated. But the reality is that overall in talking with our construction group. Our overall budgets \u2013 our overall performance compared to budget is coming in pretty consistently with what we expected. And so that mild increase that you see in the numbers compared to the prior quarter really just reflects the fact that we expected to pay for more of the costs this year, and that's likely because we're finishing a little bit sooner for some of those projects.","I think as the \u2013 looking beyond that or thinking more broadly, we look at all of these different options, whether it's investing in the portfolio, buying stock or other investments on kind of a comparative basis. Opportunities to enhance the portfolio have generally driven higher rate or higher levels of return and will continue to be attractive.","Having said that, I don't think we have as many of those opportunities in 2017 as we've had in 2015 and 2016. And so I expect, the volume of activity in there will be lower.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hi. Good morning, guys.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","So just another twist on the Marriott-Starwood question. So I appreciate the color that you guys were able to give on in terms of how you're looking at 2017 at this point. But to the extent that Marriott is able to give an initial look on 2017 RevPAR when it reports next week and also given that I believe that the overlap in terms of concentration within Host portfolio is even higher today now that the deal has closed than it was before, do you think that there would be any material differences in how they view North American RevPAR growth next year versus what you guys might think about your portfolio?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Rich, that's a great question and I think to some degree we're all sort of chuckling here as we hear that. Here's what I will tell you. Clearly, our hotels, in the position they're in, both physically and locationally. Should generally perform in line with what Marriott would generally be suggesting their broad-based brands would deliver. Now, their optimism about what the numbers might be for next year versus our trying to be realistic could \u2013 in other words, it's hard to predict exactly how they're going to look at next year and what message they want to try to convey.","So I guess at the end of the day, we've tried to provide you with as clear a view as we can have at this particular time in terms of what's going to happen for 2017. Ultimately, as you're suggesting, I would expect our hotels to generally perform in line with what they would be predicting for domestic performance because our hotels represent a big part of their portfolio.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, I agree with all that. I mean, obviously, there are some geographic differences as well and plus, as you know, Rich, a lot of the supply growth recently has been on the select service side. And they have, obviously, quite a bit of select service. We do not. So that could be another difference as well.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Yeah, that's very helpful color, guys. And then my second question is just on G&A. As you think about the fact that you're exiting certain markets around the country and around the world as well, and I'm assuming that transaction expenses are included in the corporate G&A line item at this point. I didn't see a different number anywhere else in the release. Do you see G&A savings opportunities in some of those categories or other categories as we think about next year and beyond?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I don't know that I would \u2013 the short answer is yes in the standpoint that, as we have phased out of the Asia market, we are certainly cutting expenses in that market and so that there is some benefit that flows from that. I don't know that I would necessarily expect, though, in modeling our G&A expense that you should be thinking that there'd be radical differences from one year to the next, at least in the context of 2016 looking at 2017.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Robin Farley at UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. I think in the past you've talked about needing RevPAR to grow in the 2% to 3% range to offset increases in expense. Your comments about next year suggest that maybe you wouldn't expect more than a 2% increase, maybe even lower or just something similar to this year's levels around 2%. How should we think about expense growth without \u2013 or I guess impact on profitability if RevPAR is not up above the level to offset those higher expenses?","And your comment about maybe savings from the Starwood-Marriott transaction, if I'm understanding that right, it sounded like maybe that's only 100 basis points of expense to be offset. And I guess that would only be in the sort of \u2013 I don't know, is that like 20% or 25% of your room base that are Starwood, coming from Starwood. Maybe you could put some color around that. Thanks.","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. So first off, I would say that in terms of thinking about the level of RevPAR and revenue growth that we likely would need from one year to the next in order to maintain the margins that we have, I'd say today our thinking is that needs to be right around or just slightly above 2%. And that's based on nothing more complicated than expecting inflation to generally run at about that level. And so if our costs go up by inflation then we certainly need to match that at the revenue line in order to maintain our margins.","Now I will point out that that does mean that EBITDA grows at that same rate of inflation or slightly better. And so that's not suggesting that we'd be at flat EBITDA, but I think that's still a reasonable reference point. We do think that there are some things that we're working on now, including the continuation of the time-motion study work that we've done, which we talked about before and has saved us a fair amount of money this year. We do think there are some things on those lines that might benefit us next year.","And of course, to the extent that we end up with a lower level of RevPAR growth that we've been suggesting, then we'll be working hard at trying to find other ways to take costs out. Some of that will, of course, be dependent upon whether that lower level of RevPAR is generated more by lack of rate growth or perhaps a reduction in occupancy. The latter, obviously, gives us a better opportunity to try to take costs out of the system.","In terms of the benefits that would flow from the Marriott-Starwood merger, I honestly would not be expecting to see a significant amount of that benefit in 2017. There are a few things that could happen more quickly, but I think there's still some work to be done in this area. I believe that the opportunity benefit from the new Marriott-negotiated OTA agreements could probably take hold next year. But I think a lot of the other integration activity that would be required for us to get the expense savings are likely to take a bit longer to happen. And so I would not be counting on a benefit of that in 2017.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And for my follow-up question, do you think the current environment with at least not accelerating RevPAR growth, I don't know if you see it decelerating next year, but this current environment, do you see opportunity in maybe consolidation among just the REITs? In other words, you haven't been a buyer of assets, but would it make sense, could it make sense for you to be involved with consolidation among small or medium-sized REITs?","W. Edward Walter - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","That concept of consolidation on the ownership side has certainly gotten more attention since we've seen a bit more consolidation on the operating side. To-date, despite the fact that I think a number of you have offered good reasons why that should occur. We have not seen that occur. So I wouldn't rule out that it could possibly happen, but I would say that it's not a particular objective of ours. We're not concerned about getting larger, we're just concerned about essentially becoming more valuable. That could happen in the context of a larger transaction. But typically that has not proven to be the case.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Harry Curtis with Nomura.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Christina. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts\u2019 first quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer will provide an overview of our first quarter results, discuss our recent transaction, and conclude with our outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets, discuss our margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Risoleo","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Host\u2019s first quarter results. As reported this morning, we had a solid first quarter that performed above our expectations from both a top and bottom line perspective.","Operating results benefited from the inauguration in Women\u2019s March in Washington D.C. as well as the Easter holiday shift, which positively impacted March performance. We also took a number of steps to bolster our company in the first quarter, underscoring our disciplined approach to capital allocation and portfolio management.","We acquired two high-quality hotels, the Don CeSar and W Hollywood, which further improved our iconic portfolio of assets. Both properties immediately fall into the top of our portfolio and RevPAR and EBITDA for key metric, and our stronger examples of the types of value enhancing growth opportunities we are pursuing.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we disposed of the Sheraton Memphis for $67 million, and assets that we believe will underperform the rest of the portfolio, as a RevPAR of less than $100 and will require greater CapEx going forward. We also entered into a contract to sell the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf effectively ending our investment activity in Australia and New Zealand. This summer has significant money at risk and we plan to close sometime during the second quarter. We have no plans to reenter the region.","As Greg will go into in greater detail, we continue to demonstrate the strength of our investment grade balance sheet. We completed a 3.875% $400 million seven-year senior notes offering, which fills a gap in our maturity schedule and provides us flexibility to deal with multiple opportunities in economic environment.","Organizationally, we formed the Enterprise Analytics group, which contributed to the successful execution of P value-add activities during the quarter and helped drive strong margin improvement and profitability growth. Speaking of operations, let me provide some insight into our results for the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $367 million for the quarter, an increase of 6.4% and exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimate. Comparable hotel EBITDA growth was slightly higher, increasing 6.5%. First quarter adjusted FFO per share was strong, increasing 7.3% over last year to $0.44, which was also above consensus estimates. An increased level of group activity, as well as our continued focus on productivity improvement resulted in comparable EBITDA margin growth of 85 basis points in the first quarter.","While we expected to see some benefit from the Easter holiday shift, group average rate was strong and transient demand was better than anticipated. As a result, on a constant currency basis, comparable hotel RevPAR improved 3.4% in the quarter, as a result of a $2.4% increase in average rate, occupancy improving 80 basis points to 75.8%. For the quarter, comparable hotel revenues increased 3.1%.","As mentioned, our group business benefited from both the inauguration and the Easter holiday shift, with group revenue of 9.1% in the quarter, based on average rooms sold per night and leap year adjusted. This was a result of strong increases in both demand and rate up 4.7% and 4.2%, respectively.","Interestingly, January group strength was based more on grade, which March\u2019s group performance was more a result of strong demand improvement. In January, group rate increased 8.6% with demand up 1.3%, driven mainly by the inauguration in our Washington D.C. hotels.","In March, we saw group revenue increased over 14%. This time a result of demand increasing nearly 10%, an average rate over 4%. Despite the strong group results, and as we expected, group booking activity weakened as we move throughout the quarter with new group room nights being booked in the quarter for 2017, down 3% versus last year\u2019s bookings.","As a result, group revenue on the books for 2017 declined by 30 basis points from the beginning of the year, and it\u2019s now 1.7% versus last year. This excludes our three hotels in Brazil. Not surprisingly, the significant increase in group business in January and March had a limiting impact on transient demand in those months. Overall, we saw a transient revenue decline of 1.7% for the quarter and a \u2013 as a 1.4% increase in average rate was offset by a decrease in transient room nights of 3.1%.","Importantly, the Easter holiday is typically a strong transient leisure period. So the shift has a holiday into April had a more pronounced negative impact on transient performance in the quarter. Despite the cautious optimism we voiced on our last call, we have yet to see the special corporate transient customer return. Having said that, the rate of decline in this segment appears to be slowing.","In 2016, special corporate rooms declined 3.6%. And for this quarter, volume for this segment declined only 1%. While we remain hopeful, this customer can return in growth, particularly given the optimistic consensus forecast on corporate profit and business investment, we have not yet win its material signs of this at our properties.","Moving to food and beverage, the strong group performance this quarter drove banquet, catering in AV revenue, which increased 7.4%. This contributed to comparable hotel F&B revenue increasing 4.8% in the quarter. Combined with excellent cost controls, this generated a 330 basis point increase in comparable hotel food and beverage profit margin.","On the investment front, as I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we have completed two acquisitions year-to-date, the Don CeSar hotel and the W Hollywood for approximately $430 million. Since we last spoke, we added the 305 rooms W Hollywood to our portfolio.","We are very enthusiastic about the asset for a number of reasons. In addition to the hotel, which we purchased for $625,000 per room at a 6.25% cap rate. We also purchased 10,800 square feet of high-quality retail space and seven prominent supergraphic billboard signs for a total value of $219 million. The hotel immediately ranks in the top five in both RevPAR and EBITDA per key in our portfolio, and is essentially located in a dynamic and rapidly growing stock market of Hollywood.","The surrounding area features a strong base of business in transient demand generators and serves as a hub for a thriving creative community and entertainment-related companies, such as Viacom Netflix and Paramount. We think the deal compares quite favorably on a price per key basis relative to other transactions in the market.","We also were pleased to increase our exposure to the LA market, which represented only 5% of our total hotel EBITDA prior to the purchase. Having been built in 2010, the asset is nearly brand new with a limited amount of owner funded CapEx required. This was an attractive feature as was the opportunity for potential margin improvement under Marriott management.","Last but not least the contract flexibility of the W. Hollywood provide significant value that we did not take into account in our underwriting. The hotel is fully unencumbered by brand and management upon sale beginning in 2021, which allows us to create value in a married of ways, including but not limited to, enhanced sale price, potential franchise conversion, fee negotiations, and\/or contract trades on other assets within our current portfolio.","While we are actively looking for assets that will enhance the value of the portfolio, the difficulty in predicting availability and timing prevents us from including any additional acquisition assumptions in our forecast.","During the quarter, we also acquired the ground lease for the Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay Hotel for $38 million. We are excited about this deal, as it increases our flexibility on the asset either via sale our brand, but also opens up potential for numerous value-add incentives. For forecasting purposes, the Sheraton Memphis and Melbourne asset sales are the only additional dispositions included in our guidance. We continue to look to enhance the portfolio through value-add investment.","During the quarter, we invested approximately $16 million on redevelopment, return on investment, and acquisition capital expenditures. As expected, we also began to see the benefits from prior year investments in this category. For the quarter, our non-comp hotels had a RevPAR increase of nearly 16%. We spent approximately $64 million on maintenance CapEx, including room renovations at the Dallas Airport Marriott and San Francisco Marriott Fisherman\u2019s Wharf Hotels.","For the full-year, we expect to spend between $270 million and $300 on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and $90 million to $115 million on redevelopment ROI and acquisition project. However, our 2017 capital spend to be used with a bit of an aberration, as we would expect our normal CapEx spend to be somewhat higher.","Now, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2017. While we are very pleased with our results in the first quarter, we are aware that overall performance was aided by events that skewed results higher. In fact, we believe that the first quarter will be our best of the year.","Like quarter one, which benefited from the Easter shift, the fourth quarter will be favorably impacted by the Jewish holiday shift from October into September and we expect it will be our second strongest quarter in 2017. That being said, the events that benefit the first and fourth quarters will negatively impact the second and third quarters, leaving our full-year outlook relatively unchanged.","Despite this quarter is better than expected results, there does not appear to be compelling evidence of acceleration in RevPAR above where we initially guided. On our last call, we expressed cautious optimism this might occur, which was partially due to a positive forecast in business investment and corporate profit. It was also a function of the possibility of pro-growth legislation coming out of Washington in the back-half of 2017.","Sitting here now a lot of forecast for both business investment and corporate profits remain strong, we do not anticipate any material policy initiatives providing tailwinds to our business until 2018 at the earliest. Further, and as mentioned, group booking pace appears to be weakening for 2017, with February, and March bookings in the year for the year slightly softer than last year. This trend combined with continued economic uncertainty has tempered our outlook for the remainder of the year.","As a result, we are maintaining our full-year comparable hotel RevPAR range of flat to 2%. However, given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing both the low and high-end of our full-year margin guidance to negative 60 basis points and plus 10 basis points. The impact of this is a 15 basis point improvement to the midpoint of our range and translates to a full-year adjusted EBITDA range of $1.425 billion to $1.49 billion, and an adjusted FFO per share range of $1.60 to $1.68.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in greater detail.","Gregory Larson","Thank you, Jim. As Jim mentioned, we had a strong first quarter and are especially pleased with RevPAR and EBITDA margin growth, which exceeded our expectations. Our properties in D.C. significantly outperformed our portfolio this quarter. With RevPAR growth of over 20% exceeding the startup or upscale results by 400 basis points. These results were better than we had anticipated.","As we mentioned last quarter, January was a fantastic month for our properties in D.C. with RevPAR increasing approximately 75% from demand generated by the inauguration in the Women\u2019s March. RBC Market RevPAR growth was driven by an average rate improvement of over 16% and a 230 basis point increase in occupancy.","On the group side, additional citywide room nights contributed to a 35% rise in group revenues on the strength of significant increases in both room nights and average rate. The strong group business provide a compression that drove transient ADR growth of 15.2% and contributed to excellent food and beverage sales, which were up 19.5%, mainly in the more profitable banquet and catering business.","Having said that, citywide room nights in D.C. are expected to decline over the remainder of the year and bookings remained very short-term. As a result, we expect RevPAR to moderate in the second quarter. Our hotels in Seattle also outperformed our expectations and the rest of the portfolio with an 18% RevPAR increase in the first quarter, which was over a 1,000 basis points above the STAR upper upscale market result of 7.8%.","The impressive results were driven equally by occupancy and average rate increases of 6.8 percentage points and 7.4%, respectively, and aided by a strong citywide calendar displacement from a competitor\u2019s room renovation and the benefits from our W. Seattle hotel that was renovated last year.","Group room night growth of 26% created compression allowing our managers to drive transient rate of almost 12%, while increasing food and beverage sales by over 23%. In addition, the Western Seattle is now part of a unique special corporate rate program with a local business, which benefited the hotel in the first quarter and will continue to positively impact performance going forward.","We expect RevPAR growth at our Seattle properties to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter. In Denver, RevPAR at our hotels grew 13% in the quarter, driven by a 1% increase in average rate and a 7.6 percentage point growth in occupancy.","The RevPAR increase at our properties exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 910 basis points, which is partially a product of several competitors undergoing room renovations this quarter. Group revenues growth in this market was strong, up 24.8% and contributed to the food and beverage revenue increase of more than 66% predominantly in the more profitable banquet and catering business.","That said, we expect a lack of citywides in the second quarter to temper the RevPAR growth demonstrated in the first quarter. San Diego was again one of the top performing markets, as RevPAR growth in the first quarter increased to 11.3%, driven entirely by an increase in average rate. Four additional citywides in the market resulted in a 15.8% increase in group revenues, which created compression and yielded an increase in transient average rate of almost 12%.","The additional citywides were not the only contributors to the outperformance, a strong in-house group business and continued market share gains at the Coronado Island Marriott post renovation proved beneficial as well. It is also worth noting that our RevPAR result exceeded the STAR upper upscale market growth by 320 basis points.","Although, we do not expect RevPAR growth to continue at the same pace as the last several quarters, we do anticipate that RevPAR growth at our assets in the mark will outperform our portfolio in 2017. Over the next couple of years, the San Diego market has some of the lowest expected supply growth, which bodes well for future performance.","Now, I\u2019ll provide some color on some of our more challenged market. RevPAR at our hotels in San Francisco declined 6.3% in the first quarter, largely due to a difficult comp, given the Super Bowl last year. Renovations at the Moscone Convention Center and our rooms renovations at the Marriott Fisherman\u2019s Wharf. Going forward, we anticipate hotels in San Francisco will continue to struggle, as the Moscone Convention Center is scheduled to be completely closed in the second and third quarters, negatively impacting all hotels in the Bay Area.","However, keep in mind that once the expansion project at the Convention Center is complete in 2018, we expect citywide to return to San Francisco and business that follows to in a meaningful way in 2019. In New York, RevPAR decreased 3.9% in the first quarter, with an occupancy decline of 1.7 percentage points, at an average rate reduction of 1.8%.","Not surprisingly, supply continues to impact our ability to drive rate. We have also noted that European travel to the city continues to be weak due to the strong U.S. dollar and residual effects from the impact from Brexit. As we stated in February, based on our information on the market, we expect RevPAR growth at our hotels in New York to continue to be challenged in 2017.","Our hotels in Florida had a RevPAR decline of 0.4% in the first quarter, as the market continues to be negatively impacted by weaker group and leisure activity. Occupancy decreased 2.1 percentage points, but on a positive note that was offset by an average rate increase of 2.2% In the short-term, we expect our hotels, the Board that will benefit from the Easter shift in April. This should help our Florida assets outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.","Moving to international operation, our consolidated international hotels first quarter RevPAR declined 7.1% in constant currency. This is primarily due to the underperformance of our hotel \u2013 of our properties in Brazil. The continued weakness in Brazil was a function of economic issues and increased supply. However, our performance there was partially offset by the strong performance of our two Canadian assets. RevPAR in our hotels in that part of itself in Canada grew 3.9% with constant currency.","Our Calgary Marriott has a strong corporate group and contract business that helped boost performance this quarter. Looking ahead, in the second quarter, we expect the story of these two countries to continue, outperformance in Canada and underperformance in Brazil, which is a continued weakness in Brazil\u2019s economy in the difficult times related to the business leading up to be a Olympic last summer.","Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio showed signs of recovery this quarter, especially in markets severely impacted by terrorist attack at the end of 2015 and first quarter 2016. On a broader macro level, we are seeing improving GDP forecast across Europe. RevPAR for the 10 hotels in the portfolio improved 8.2% in constant euros, with occupancy growth of 4.7 percentage points with an average rate increase of 0.7%.","This performance was driven by strong corporate group demand at several properties, as well as increases in contract revenues through the addition of airline group. The group volume strength contributed the growth in food and beverage revenue of about 17%, most of the which came in the form of profitable banquet and catering business.","Going forward, we are encouraged by the positive signs in Europe and expect that RevPAR growth at these hotels for the full-year will outpace our comparable hotel results. We continue to be impressed by the efforts and results of our managers and asset managers that bring more profit to the bottom line. In the first quarter, we increased EBITDA margins by 85 basis points, driven by outstanding productivity improvements throughout the hotels, notably from excellent cost containment in food and beverage department.","Food and beverage margins improved 330 basis points. We continue to focus on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies, which we have rolled out at our medium and small hotels. As we have already seen at our large properties, our managers have made structural changes to processes and procedures enabling them to more effectively schedule labor, on-demand, and minimize excess staffing thereby reducing costs and increasing productivity.","With the benefit of one quarter behind us with these products \u2013 productivity savings in mind, we expect RevPAR growth of 2% will translate into a 10 basis point increase in margin expansion as opposed to the previous assumption break-even margins we guided to on our last earnings call.","In April, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents the yield of 4.2% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall REIT space. Importantly, key competitor is strategic advantage enhances our ability to sustain the dividend throughout the lodging cycle, while also allowing us to invest when accretive opportunities arise to either buy assets, buy back stock, or reinvest in a high-yielding value-add projects.","In March, we issued $400 million of Series G senior notes due April of 2024 at an interest rate of 3.875%. This transaction filled our gap in our debt maturity schedule and demonstrated the continued strength and flexibility of our investment grade balance sheet. Part of the proceeds were used to repay $250 million that have been drawn under the revolver portion of our credit facility, while the rest remains available for general corporate purposes.","We ended the first quarter with approximately $411 million of cash and $784 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.6 times, is calculated under the terms of our credit facility.","As Jim noted in his remarks, we have increased the midpoint of our margin guidance for the year and maintained our RevPAR guidance from our prior earnings call. In addition to the change in our margin assumption, our guidance now includes the loss of EBITDA related to the two asset sales we announced today and an increase in EBITDA from better than previously estimated profit to be generated from reposition, non-comparable hotels.","The interest expense from the issuance of the new $400 million Series G notes and the repayment of $250 million of the credit facility equates to the loss of approximately $0.1 of FFFO per share and explains while the midpoint of our our revised adjusted FFO per share guidance is a $1.64 compared to the $1.65 midpoint we articulated in February.","Finally, I would urge you to keep the impact of the holiday shift in mind. As second and third quarter RevPAR results are anticipated to be significantly weaker than the first quarter with a rebound expected in the fourth quarter.","Looking specifically to the second quarter, we expect nearly 29% of our total EBITDA for 2017 will be generated in that quarter. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our strong results today, particularly with the improving profitability of our assets when continues to be a competitive market and lower growth environment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Smedes Rose [ph]. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, thank you. Jim, it sounds like in your prepared remarks that group demand declined maybe more than you had expected over the course of the quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if the \u2013 and your assumption is to get to zero RevPAR for the year, if you are assuming that same pace of decline, or do you expect that to kind of flatten out? And I guess, really kind of the \u2013 my question is, how confident are you that you can, at least, achieve a zero or flat RevPAR growth and not go into negative territory?","James Risoleo","So I think, we are very thoughtful in our reevaluation of our prior forecast. I would tell you that we expected as we move through the quarter that group would weaken. As you may recall, we started the year with group up 2%. We saw a strengthening in February to 3%, and then we saw it weakening down to 1.7%.","At this point in time, I think, we\u2019re comfortable with providing our guidance of 02% RevPAR growth. I think if you step back and look at the comments with respect to the first quarter, the fourth quarter and the respective holiday shift. Second and third quarter is really going to be weak; but as we looked at group booking pace, we took that into account and that\u2019s why we have affirmed our guidance for the year.","Gregory Larson","Yes, and Smedes, if you look at that, the same thing sort of happened to us last year too, right. We started with group revenues on our books at one level and then as we moved throughout the year, the groups that booked sort of in the year, for the year were a little bit weaker than the prior year. And so, as a result, the group revenues that we had, group still outperformed transient in 2016; but the group level at the end of the year was just lower than where we started. So, as Jim mentioned, right, we started the year at 2% on the group side and when we gave guidance of 0% to 2%, we were certainly expecting that the bookings in the year, for the year would be a little bit weaker and would bring that group revenue numbers down.","Unidentified Analyst","All right thank you. Thanks for the color.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning guys. Just a bit more on the group piece decline. Are you seeing that concentrating at any hotels or any markets? And do you think meeting planners are just a bit more cautious given some of the policy uncertainty we\u2019re seeing?","James Risoleo","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any market in particular, right. I mean when we looked at it, again we had certain markets that were quite strong this year, this quarter. Yes, I\u2019m looking at it as I\u2019m talking to you now; I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any particular market.","Anthony Powell","All right and -","James Risoleo","Go ahead.","Anthony Powell","Well, I was going to say some of the other reads are saying that they are attempting to replace some \u2013 this lost group or corporate transient with things like LNR business, associations, contracts. Is that available to you and are you pursuing that strategy?","James Risoleo","Anthony, it is available to us. And in fact that\u2019s just a strategy we took last year. Where we had holes in occupancy because the high-end business traveler didn\u2019t show up, we were able to fill in with either lower rated group or more Government and other lower rated business and that\u2019s the same strategy we\u2019re pursuing this year.","Gregory Larson","Yes, in fact Anthony, if you \u2013 just to build on what Jim just said, I mean if you think about it, our occupancy ended here in this first quarter at 75.8%. For our first quarter occupancy, you\u2019d have to go all the way back to the first quarter of 2000 to see a higher occupancy level. So, again it\u2019s pretty easy in this environment to replace the business with other business; but as we talk about before, right, I mean what we would love to see at some point this year is to see the corporate, special corporate customer come back and the business traveler to come back, because at that point we would be able to have a higher rated customer. There would be a positive mix shift and then we could produce a higher rate growth and therefore higher RevPAR growth.","James Risoleo","Just to reaffirm what we said on the first quarter call, we discussed this very topic with respect to the fact that special corporate have not shown up. We indicated we were cautiously optimistic that they in fact would show up. And that\u2019s based on the forecast for business investments and the forecast for corporate profit. But the simple fact of the matter is, is that we haven\u2019t seen that happen today and that\u2019s another reason why we\u2019ve elected to keep our guidance in 02%.","Gregory Larson","Yes, I think that\u2019s the good news Jim and others is that, even though there certainly are some forecasts as Jim mentioned, corporate profits looks strong, business investments looks strong, our group revenues are sitting here up at 1.7%, which is sort of near the high-end of our RevPAR guidance. I think we ignored a lot of those positives and just really focused on the fact that supply is increasing at touch this year. And like I said, we ignored those positives in giving guidance of 0% to 2%.","Anthony Powell","Got it, and there is one more quick one for me. Do you have a year-to-date RevPAR growth number which is including April?","Gregory Larson","For April, you know we\u2019re expecting because of the holiday shift. We\u2019re expecting actually April for us that actually have a decline in RevPAR.","Anthony Powell","Right.","Gregory Larson","But we haven\u2019t finished the month yet, so \u2013","James Risoleo","We don\u2019t have the final data in, so it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re in a position to provide.","Anthony Powell","Got it, all right. Thanks a lot for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Hi good morning. Just when looking at your performance for San Francisco in 1Q negative six, is it fair to assume that as the \u2013 is it fair to assume for 2Q that things could actually be worse than negative six for you?","James Risoleo","Patrick, when we think about San Francisco, obviously our hotel are down 63 [ph] was worse than the SAAR data for the industry. So, because of that I actually think our Q2 could be slightly better than our down 63. You might be right though, for the industry could be a little bit weaker in Q2 than in Q1. I do think that that at least based on our group booking pace, you know our best quarter of the year at least in our forecast when we think about San Francisco is actually Q3.","Patrick Scholes","Okay and then just one follow up question if I may. Just for overall, not just San Francisco, but overall for 2018 group, how are you feeling about that, I think last quarter you mentioned that the group revenues pace for 2018 is looking very strong. How do you feel now?","James Risoleo","You know, we have seen continued strength in 2018 pace. However, we think it\u2019s too early to really provide any guidance. It\u2019s too early in the year and what we\u2019ve \u2013 if history repeats itself which it likely will, there will be some slippage in terms of what\u2019s on the books today. I would tell you the numbers today looks pretty good.","Gregory Larson","Very good.","James Risoleo","Very good, very good; but it\u2019s not a number that we\u2019re prepared to discuss.","Patrick Scholes","Okay, fair enough, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just to stick with the whole group conversation sort of in the year, for the year pattern, just curious if you could give us a little bit more color, it seems like some operators out there have actually entered the year with the strategy of trying to group up to gain some visibility just given how \u2013 just how challenging the demand environment has been in the last couple of years. But in most cases it seems like you knew that in the year, for the year would be tough to come by and now it is. I\u2019m just curious if you can kind of help us think about like why can\u2019t you source more group business and maybe even just try and push with this given that you kind of know or that you expected the environment to be a little bit softer.","James Risoleo","Yes, that\u2019s a great question Shaun. We had a meeting with our major operator Merlin International over the last couple of weeks to discuss group booking pace. I will tell you that we have today 85% of the group business is on the books for 2017. And I think that there is a general strategy that if we can find group business in an attractive price point that we will take it today. Now that said, if you think back to the trend that we\u2019ve seen over the first quarter where we started it, two went to three, and we\u2019re down at 1.7, these are said and done sometime, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re keenly focused on.","Gregory Larson","Yes, Jim, I think that\u2019s 85% of the group business that we ultimately think that we\u2019re \u2013 sorry that was like \u2013 it\u2019s a good number. You know, I also think, Shaun, you mentioned that the group bookings are I think you said very weak. I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Again, I think we\u2019re still booking group business at a descent clip. It just happens to be year-to-date we\u2019re booking and that\u2019s just slightly lower clip than we did last year; but we\u2019re still booking. There is still group business to be booked and frankly the groups that we\u2019re booking now are pretty high quality groups. I mean if you look at our first quarter, our food and beverage growth is quite strong. In my comments I talked about our banquet business has been quite strong. We\u2019re starting to charge groups for room rentals and that profit just drops down to the bottom line. So, I think we\u2019re still booking; we\u2019re just booking a touch, at a rate that\u2019s a touch less than last year.","Shaun Kelley","Okay, yes, I\u2019m sorry if I mischaracterized that. Thank you very much.","James Risoleo","Yes.","Gregory Larson","Yes.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Woronka","Hey, good morning guys. Jim I was hoping maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on the food and beverage margin improvements, because it\u2019s a pretty big deal to the bottom line and I think you said you\u2019ve done it in your small and medium sized hotels. And so, how should we think about the opportunities across the rest of the portfolio going forward?","James Risoleo","Well, I think that there are a couple of things that drove margin improvements in general this year, Chris. And then I\u2019ll come back to your question regarding food and beverage. We have been time motion studies throughout the portfolio and those studies are not done yet, but we have really gone through the bigger hotels and we\u2019ve rolled out the same process now to our smaller hotels. So what has driven our margin performance by and large is productivity gains and productivity gains both in hotel operations i.e. rooms productivity and undistributed, as well as food and beverage.","Food and beverage productivity or food and beverage margin gain this year is up 330 basis points, that\u2019s a combination of just the sheer increase in volume, but also in very strong productivity gains and really a decrease in food and beverage cost.","Gregory Larson","Yes, you know Jim mentioned the time motion studies, as you know Chris, we completed those time motions or we were completing them last year with our big hotels and what\u2019s happened here in the first quarter is, some of the time motion studies that we completed throughout 2016, you know in first quarter obviously we\u2019re getting all the benefits from those time motion studies and in first quarter of last year we probably hadn\u2019t fully implemented them. And then combine that with the fact, as Jim said, that this year we\u2019re starting to implement some of those studies on our medium and small hotels. So, in the second half of the year we\u2019ll get the benefit from that as well.","Chris Woronka","Okay.","Gregory Larson","And Chris, the final thing and you know this, the one thing that always helps out margins and Jim sort of mentioned it, is strong revenue growth, right. So, when you have strong F&B growth that\u2019s helpful, and then especially when it comes from the higher-margin business, the banquet business, that\u2019s also very helpful.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","It\u2019s been almost six months now since the Marriot-Starwood deal closed. Can you just give us your updated thinking on potential there? And I think Marriot\u2019s Investor Day in March, they talked about rolling out some better procurement and other cost saving plans in the next few weeks, so is that something you guys start benefiting from?","James Risoleo","I think what we\u2019re trying \u2013 we will definitely see benefit from the Marriott-Starwood acquisition. We\u2019re looking forward in a number of different places, Tom. First and foremost, I think that it is immediate as the travel agent costs with respect to the OTA. Marriott had a much stronger deal than Starwood did, with Expedia and Booking.com and we expect that that is going to benefit us over the course of 2017 and 2018.","Another area that we feel we will see benefit over time, does relate to procurement cost. The sheer size of the combined company will enable Marriott to drive a better deal for a good to be provided to the hotel.","Lastly, we continue to see Marriot make improvements in operations, they are running the properties tighter than Starwood did, so we\u2019re optimistic that that should continue to flow through to us and better margin performance as we move forward.","On the other side of it, you didn\u2019t ask the question for sake [ph], but I think that the fact that Marriott has a fantastic sales engine, group sales engine is going to benefit us going forward, as well as the combination of the two rewards programs which when combined will have over 100 million members and they\u2019re adding about 1 million members a month. So all-in-all, we\u2019re very happy about the Marriott-Starwood acquisition.","Going back to the rewards program alone, I mean, Marriott \u2013 this will impact the rewards program. Marriott is in the process of negotiating a new credit card deal, which we think will benefit us as well to lower credit card commissions. So those are some of the things that we\u2019re looking at as we move throughout 2017 and into 2018.","Gregory Larson","Certainly tailwinds for us both in 2017 and 2018.","James Risoleo","Yes, absolutely.","Thomas Allen","Is it okay to take from what you said that the margin outperformance during the first quarter wasn\u2019t really \u2013 it was more your own channel for measures and any kind of Marriott-Starwood synergy measures and so the opportunities\u2026","James Risoleo","I think that\u2019s right Tom. I mean it really was the effect of our \u2013 and we work very closely with our operators and we worked hard together to drive productivity improvements and to keep a tight lid on food and beverage costs. You know our time motion studies that we implemented at the hotels have been meaningful and we\u2019ve seen a meaningful uptick in productivity to allow us to outperform on the margin perspective to the tune of 85 basis points in EBITDA margin increase in first quarter.","Thomas Allen","Again, just a follow-up, your transaction in the quarter had mixed messages around whether you are trying to diversify away from Marriot, how are you thinking about the need to diversify?","James Risoleo","Which transaction are you speaking of?","Thomas Allen","It\u2019s more talking cheap bread, you bought the W Hollywood some more Marriott exposure there and then you bought the Don CeSar, so sold that and then you sold Hilton, so I was just \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like there was any, there was nothing suggesting a strategy to move away from Marriott exposure?","James Risoleo","No, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strategy to move away from Marriott. As I said, we are very comfortable and think that they are \u2013 they are the best is the space. I mean they were great before Starwood and now with their increased scale for a number of the reasons that I mentioned just a moment ago, we\u2019re very comfortable with Marriott and we love the relationship we have with them.","I think when we think about acquisitions and dispositions, every deal we do, whether it\u2019s a sale or an acquisition is with an eye toward enhancing shareholder value. And when we think about diversity, we think more about geographic diversity. As we look at balancing the portfolio among various markets and not necessarily looking at brand at the outset.","Thomas Allen","Helpful, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good morning guys.","James Risoleo","Hey, Rich.","Rich Hightower","Two questions here, the first one is on margins, really quickly. I don\u2019t know if I caught this in the prepared remarks, but can you give us a sense of what the better-than-expected mix shift in the first quarter did to our margins in the first quarter relative to initial expectations? And then how margins alongside sort of it\u2019s in RevPAR across the quarters that you mentioned, how margins will progress as well for the rest of the year?","Gregory Larson","Hey, Rich, this is Greg. I don\u2019t know if it is a much of a mix shift, it\u2019s just when our RevPAR growth is stronger-than-expected, which obviously occurred in the first quarter with 3.4% RevPAR and if you look at our domestic hotels 3.8% RevPAR and that\u2019s always helpful on margins, right, and so I think that that certainly helps our margins.","I think when you think about the quarter is going forward, you can think about that comment, in quarters where we\u2019re predicting very low and maybe no RevPAR growth, like Q2 and Q3 in aggregate, than you should assume margin will actually decline in those quarters. On the other hand, where we mentioned in our comment, we think RevPAR will rebound in fourth quarter and if that occurs and then obviously that will be better margin performance in that quarter than in Q2 and Q3.","I think the good news overall, obviously we had a great quarter on the margin front in the first quarter and that\u2019s why were able to comfortable increase the midpoint of our margin guidance by 15 basis points.","Rich Hightower","Yes, that is helpful Greg. And then the second question here, kind of hitting back on Tom\u2019s question about acquisitions and capital allocation. When you look at deals like the W Hollywood and Don, I think we all get the point that they, both of the those deals enhance average RevPAR for the portfolio, average EBITDA for each of the portfolio, but there is a risk of course that you can over pay for those sorts of things. And I just want to know kind of how you guys balance out each deal on its own in the sense that NAV accretion? And then also in a portfolio context, raising the average RevPAR for the assets in the portfolio, how you think the markets value for those right now?","James Risoleo","Well, I\u2019ll answer the first question last. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being valued fairly. With respect to the underlying quality of the assets that we have in the portfolio, when you look at the Don and the W, they are truly iconic assets that are exceptionally difficult, if not impossible to duplicate. And when we think about how we can enhance shareholder value, we take a very disciplined approach to any investment opportunity or frankly any sale that might \u2013 sale opportunity that might present itself.","By looking carefully at where we are in the cycle, underwriting the asset appropriately, and taking it to account all capital needs of the property as we look out over a ten-year period of time. And solving for a hurdle rate of return to our cost of capital that is at 100 basis points to 150 basis points at a minimum and higher depending on the risk profile in the transaction. So there\u2019s a lot of fact that goes into every deal that we underwrite and every acquisition that we make as we go forward.","And I think that when you look at the metrics on both of these deals, they are very unique metrics. The Holly \u2013 the W out of the box is going to be top five in the portfolio. And if you think about our hotels, another \u2013 and newer hotel, I mean the W is a new property, the Don had a significant investment, completed before we bought the hotel. But if you think about something like the W with a RevPAR that the hotel generates, that would lead to the conclusion that your owner\u2019s funding CapEx is going to be relatively de minimis compared to other properties, compared to lower RevPAR hotels, compared to properties that are older, that might need more money, so there\u2019s a lot that goes into our decision on every acquisition opportunity.","Gregory Larson","Yes, Rich, I agree, obviously as Jim said, we are always looking for that 100 basis points to 150 basis points return unlevered IRR above our cost of capital. But the other thing we do is we always compare that return to buying back stock and as you know, right, last year we bought back stock with a 15 handle on it. So, even though there were opportunities in the market, last year we felt that buying back our stock with a 15 handle was a better investment, so that\u2019s what we did.","And so again, if you fast forward to today, we found these two great acquisitions, the returns were good and so that\u2019s what we\u2019re look at, but when we look at things, we look at returns for assets, but we also look at\u2026","James Risoleo","Alternative uses of the capital.","Rich Hightower","Yes, that\u2019s all great color guys, thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll go next to Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Good morning everyone. Looking at the group bookings, can you comment on how in-house group bookings are looking and maybe if we would see F&B revenues close the gap versus RevPAR, and should that hang in there be a more in-house? And in particular San Francisco, how are you doing in 2Q and 3Q for the in-house?","Gregory Larson","Hey, Wes, this is Greg. So, as we said in our prepared remarks, right, of group revenues on our books today, up 1.7%, right. But what we also mentioned is, in our guidance, our assumption is as we progress through the year, even though we\u2019ll continue to book those at a pretty decent pace, the pace will be slightly lower than the pace that we booked through the last year, and so that 1.7% growth in group revenues well over throughout the rest of this year should end up trending lower. So that is sort of how we \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","Wes Golladay","So, as I was referring to all the in-house group, I was wondering if you had \u2013 does that include the groups you assigned, that gets assigned to you from the Moscone Center through that might be down and you might be having more in-house group and then you might get more F&GB, so total PAR would be a little bit better?","James Risoleo","Hey, Wes, I\u2019m sorry, I thought you were talking about in total and San Francisco, what I just told \u2013 talked about was our entire portfolio.","Wes Golladay","Yes.","James Risoleo","If you think about just San Francisco, yes, we have, like I mentioned earlier, we have some in-house group activity in Q3. And so because of that, I think, our hotel in the third quarter should \u2013 our hotel in San Francisco should perform much better than what the performance that you witnessed here in the first quarter.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then probably to the point they would maybe better on total total par. So I mean, F&B we price at a model that been down too much for the\u2026?","James Risoleo","Well, the interesting thing about San Francisco is even though our hotels in San Francisco had a decline of 6.3%. We actually had at the Marriott Marquis and San Francisco, we actually had a very strong group that generated very strong food and beverage growth for that hotel.","Wes Golladay","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. And I don\u2019t know if you commented on this at the beginning of a call because I had to miss part at the beginning. But have you sort of given guidance on whether you expect on a full-year basis to be a net buyer, or seller of assets this year?","James Risoleo","Robin, it\u2019s a great question, and we didn\u2019t comment on it. I think that we are very cognizant of some of the tailwinds that the lodging sector is going to face, given some supply considerations that we\u2019re looking at for 2017 and 2018. And also did add spreads on potential acquisition as we look at the landscape out there.","So I don\u2019t have a definitive answer for you today, because we are, as Greg mentioned before, in addition to having the ability to acquire hotels, we will also opportunistically sell hotels. And if the stock price drops to a level, where we feel the right decision is to buy back shares, we\u2019ll certainly do that.","So, as I mentioned, the \u2013 our guidance for the balance of the year includes the two dispositions, the sale of share to Memphis and the sale of their home in Melbourne, and it includes the acquisitions we completed year-to-date. We have not included any further sales, or dispositions in the guidance.","Robin Farley","Okay. All right. Thanks. And then maybe also, I don\u2019t know if you made comments on. When you look at your solid branded property, are you seeing an improvement there in index? And do you think it\u2019s coming from Marriott Board members? Is that where you\u2019re seeing occupancy coming from? And sort of the second part of that question would be, are you seeing impact on your Marriott branded hotels in the same market? In other words, is there to what degree is there maybe some occupancy being shared now with this reward program?","James Risoleo","We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 that\u2019s a great question. We haven\u2019t seen any deterioration in yield index on the Marriott Hotels. And the given the group sales engine that Marriott has in-house, which is very powerful, we would expect to see more RevPAR index improvement on some of our bigger shares in hotels going forward.","Robin Farley","Okay, great. Thank you.","James Risoleo","Thanks, Robin.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Bellisario with Robert W. Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a quick question on the moving parts and guidance. Can you quantify how much Memphis and Melbourne are impacting the full-year EBITDA range? And then what sort of benefit the ground lease buyout might have in those figures doing them? Any run rate figures would be great as well?","Gregory Larson","Hey, Michael, it\u2019s Greg. Yes, if you look at the two dispositions, I mean, obviously, because we increased our margin guidance for the year, and we mentioned that our non-comp forecast for the year is stronger today than what it was a quarter ago. That would lead you to believe that our EBITDA guidance should be higher.","The reason why the top-end remained the same is, because we\u2019re now baking in \u2013taking into account these two dispositions and those two assets combined probably reduced our EBITDA by about $10 million or $11 million.","Michael Bellisario","And then any benefit from the ground lease acquisition?","Gregory Larson","Look, as you know, ground leases are usually low cap rate acquisitions. I mean, as Jim mentioned in his comment, lots of good reasons to do it, adds a lot of flexibility to that hotel, and gives us a lot of really nice options going forward. But that\u2019s such a small acquisition at a lower cap rate, there\u2019s not much impact to that.","Michael Bellisario","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session, Mr. Risoleo. At this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","James Risoleo","Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to provide you with more insight into how 2017 is playing out on our second quarter call this summer. And I\u2019m sure, I\u2019ll see a lot of you and NAREIT in New York. Have a great day.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11593":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Noah. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today\u2019s call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at www.hosthotels.com. ","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by market and discuss our margin results. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, here\u2019s Ed.","Ed Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that 2015 is off to a solid start with another quarter of positive results for the company driven by strong rate growth and solid group demand despite the headwinds of business interruption from capital investments. We continue to feel good about industry fundamentals and our outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","First, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $321 million, which reflects a 4.2% increase over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.35, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflected 6.1% increase over last year.","These results were driven by several factors. First, RevPAR for our comparable hotels on a constant currency basis increased 3.8% for the quarter driven by rate growth of 4.8%, which was partially offset by an occupancy decrease of 0.7 percentage points.","As we detail on our call in February, our operating results at our comparable hotels were materially affected by a number of comprehensive room and meeting space projects at several of our larger hotels. At the 15 hotels that were under significant construction during Q1, RevPAR declined by more than 13% and EBITDA fell by nearly $17 million when compared to 2014.","When looking at the performance of our hotels that were not under construction in Q1 of either 2014 or 2015m RevPAR was up 5.5% and this portfolio saw meaningful improvement in market share. RevPAR growth in the portfolio was driven by transient rate growth and a combination of rate and demand growth in our group business. Our transient rate was up more than 4.5% as we experienced strong rate growth in all segments of our business and now achieved the average rate achieved in the first quarter of the prior peak.","On the group side, demand increased by 1% driven by an 8.5% increase in our association segment. Corporate business was flat to last year, which means we booked over 15,000 rooms to offset the loss of the Super Bowl group we had in 2014 in New York City.","Group rate was up 3% leading to group revenue increase of 4%. Perhaps providing better insight into the strength of our group business, demand and revenues increased more than 2% and 5.5% respectively over last year when we look at the hotels unaffected by renovation in either 2014 or 2015.","While only about 9% of our EBITDA comes from foreign sources, the dramatic strengthening of the dollar did reduce EBITDA in the quarter by approximately $4 million. The solid rate growth and positive group activity led to comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points and comparable hotel EBITDA growth of nearly 5%. As you might expect, the margin expansion of the hotels not under renovation was significantly higher than the level we experienced in the comparable portfolio.","Now let me spend a few minutes regarding our approach to capital allocation. First, I want to be clear that we continue to have a positive view on the lodging industry and on the cycle. As most of you know, forecast for supply in 2015 and 2016 indicate it will fall short of the historical long-term and short-term demand level. And while it is early to be predicting 2017\u2019s supply, based on the construction sites announced to-date, we do not expect it to accelerate meaningfully.","All this adjusted for at least the next two years provided there is no impact to the demand side of the equation, revenue should continue to increase better than inflationary levels, and the operating environment in our space will remain attractive.","As you might anticipate, we are not the only capital source with this view. Lending to our industry has continued to improve and equity capital has been drawn to the higher NOI growth our sector can generate. The natural consequence of these trends as pricing has continued to improve and anticipated returns on acquisitions have contracted.","Recognizing these facts, over the last two years, we have sought to take advantage of the market by selling assets generally in non-target markets or in suburban locations within our target markets, including some of our big BOSS Group hotels. In fact, in the last 26 months, we have sold over $1.2 billion of asset.","We expect to continue to improving our portfolio in 2015 with roughly $100 million to $150 million in sales in active acquisition currently and with a plan to market at least an additional $200 million to $300 million in asset over the remainder of the year.","Over the last two years, we have been clear about our desire to have a strong balance sheet view from both the coverage and a leverage perspective. Irrespective of our current view of the industry\u2019s, history and experience has taught us that a strong balance sheet is our company\u2019s and our shareholders\u2019 best defense against an unpredictable world. Today, we are comfortable that we have the balance sheet strength that we believe is appropriate. As a result, going forward, at some unique circumstances, we would expect to fund additional investments through a combination of proceeds from asset sales, cash flow generated by operations, and modest debt issuance.","As market conditions have evolved, we have found it more difficult to identify assets that satisfy our return requirements. As a result, we have renewed our efforts to generate value from our existing portfolio. Our initial success was the redevelopment of the Atlanta Perimeter Marriott and the Sheraton Indianapolis have lead to additional activity in this arena with the conversion of the Phoenix Ritz-Carlton to an independent hotel affiliated with the Autograph brand to be operated by Destination Hotels is just the most recent example. While there is near-term disruption from these types of investments, we expect that they will generate mid-teens or better returns, which clearly exceed what we expect to generate from acquisitions.","We\u2019re also expanding our focus on acquisitions to include transactions which require this type of approach as we believe there is somewhat less competition and a greater likelihood of achieving our return requirements. While we are aggressively pursuing several investment opportunities and do expect to complete more acquisitions this year than we did in 2014, we would not be surprised if our sales activity exceeded our investments. For that reason, our Board has approved a $500 million stock buyback program which will be effective once we file our 10-Q this week.","While our level of activity under that program will depend on our stock price, our sales and operating activities as well as our other investment alternatives, we felt it made sense to have such a program in place to give us the opportunity to effectively enhance our investments in our great portfolio of hotels. Purchases can occur during any of our open periods which generally begin after our earnings call and end slightly before quarter end.","In that respect, we do view our stock is very attractively priced. While we recognize the broader markets concern about the disruption we expect to incur from our increased capex spending this year, we believe the market is underestimating the benefit that capex will deliver in 2016 and 2017. While we have projected that we will lose $25 million of EBITDA in 2015 compared to last year and seven non-com hotels that are being closed in full or in part due to significant renovation. We expect to reverse the projected $25 million in disruption this year and add an estimated $25 million or more benefit going forward.","With respect to the disruption in our comparable portfolio I highlighted earlier in my comments, given our expectations of lower capex spending in 2016, we expect to see less general disruption next year that we are experiencing in 2015. And while it seems to be fashionable to some to criticize the strength of our balance sheet, we would view our investment grade rating which leads to superior access to the credit markets throughout the cycle and our highly liquid stock is benefit worthy of a premium multiple not at discount.","Finally, it is worth noting that we think the replacement cost for our portfolio which includes signature assets in virtually every major gateway market in the country average over 425 key [ph], well above our current trading level of 320.","Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 as there are a number of factors that keep us optimistic about our future results. As I described earlier, fundamentals in the industry continue to be positive as key economic factors driving demand such as GDP growth and business investments will trend positively over the full year. ","Overall, we expect group demand to remain solid through the remainder of the year. Continuing our experience in Q4 of last year, bookings in the first quarter for the year increased by more than 10.5% and the average rate was 8% higher than last year. Due to the strong bookings in the first quarter, demand in the second quarter is now up more than 3% with rate up more than 3.5% resulting in revenue growth of more than 7%. Overall for the year, our group rate is up more than 2.5% with group revenue up nearly 3.5% which represents a significant increase from where we started the year.","Construction activity will continue to affect operating results with meaningfully higher year-over-year spending in Q2 although the impact in Q2 should not be as severe as what we experienced in Q1. Over the last six months, the dollar is appreciated by more than 15% against the international currencies relating to markets where we own hotels and it is expected to appreciate further going forward. As a result, we now expect the year-over-year impact of this currency depreciation on EBITDA to be $25 million for the full year which is about $8 million worse than what we projected in February.","Offsetting the currency decline, we expect to see better than originally expected benefits from some of our cost saving initiatives suggesting that our margin improvement for the year will be higher than what we indicated in February. While we do expect to complete additional sales and acquisitions throughout the year, our guidance does not include any transaction activity beyond the one announced sale of the Delta Meadowvale Hotel, Canada.","With all of this in mind, we continue to expect our comparable domestic hotel RevPAR growth for the year to be 4.5% to 5.5%. On the margin side, given expected rate growth and solid demand growth we expect our adjusted margin increase to be 30 basis points to 60 basis points through the full year. Based on these operating assumptions our adjusted EBITDA guidance will remain at $1.420 billion to a $1.450 billion and a $1.52 to a $1.55 per FFO per share.","In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2015. Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our CFO who would discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Greg Larson","Thank you Ed. As expected our market results for the first quarter were mixed, while there were some outstanding performing markets with double digit RevPAR increases and were partially offset by negative results for hotels in New York, DC, Houston, and Canada. However it was encouraging to see that in most of our markets RevPAR growth was predominantly driven by rate increases.","Let me now provide some commentary on our individual markets. It was encouraging to see that for a first time in a long while in East Coast market Boston lead performance with an impressive 20.5% increase in RevPAR, resulting from a 6% growth in occupancy, coupled with a 9.5% ADR increase. Despite the negative impact from the record-breaking winter storms four of the five hotels in that market posted impressive double-digit RevPAR growth ranging from 13% to 37%, with two of those hotels benefiting from prior year room renovation. Without the benefit of these renovations remaining hotels grew RevPAR over 13%.","F&B revenues increased approximately 19% leading to EBITDA growth of nearly 200 basis points. Our hotels in Boston outperformed the STAR upper upscale hotels in the market by 600 basis points. In addition to positive renovation impact at Sheraton, Boston [00:02:09], our managers in Boston focused on a strategy to improve group occupancy, especially at our two large hotels. As a result, group occupancy in the first quarter improved 670 basis points at our Boston Copley Marriott and Sheraton Boston properties, which helped drive the increase in RevPAR in F&B revenues.","Looking west, once again our hotels in San Francisco had an excellent quarter with occupancy growth of 3.6% each point, and an increase in average rate of 10.3%, resulting in RevPAR growth of 15.4% in the quarter. This growth is even more impressive when taken into account that this is a comparison to last year's first quarter RevPAR growth of 25.3%. All five of our comparable hotels in San Francisco posted double digit RevPAR growth, benefiting from strong transient and corporate group demand in the market this quarter.","Group revenues increased approximately 15% and transient revenues improved 12.1%. Our properties in San Francisco are expected to have strong RevPAR growth for the remainder of 2015 and the city will continue to be a top performing market for us. Our Phoenix assets also had a very strong quarter with an increase in RevPAR of 14.5%, driven entirely by strong ADR growth of 15.8%. ","Group revenues increased over 27% for the quarter. Extraordinary demand was created by the Super Bowl, spring break, and baseball spring training allowing hotels to capitalize on the market compression which drove premium rates. We expect our hotels in the Phoenix market to be one of our stronger performers for the year.","Our hotels in Asia posted strong results for the quarter with RevPAR growth of 11%, with a significant portion of the growth coming from a rate increase of 9.2%. Our New Zealand and Australian hotels benefited from the demand generated from the Cricket World Cup matches held across several cities of both countries in February and March. The strong events calendar allowed the hotels to yield both transient and group rates.","Our markets had outperformed the portfolio in the quarter at Los Angeles, San Diego, Florida and Atlanta with RevPAR increases ranging from 6.3% to 8.3%. Strong transient business and excellent average rate increases drove our performance at the hotels in these markets. In San Diego, strong citywide events created compression and drove growth group and transient rates for the hotels in this market allowing us to outperform.","All these markets are expected to continue their strong performance in the second quarter. Although the market conditions were strong in Chicago and Seattle in the first quarter, our portfolio was hampered by continued renovation, which limited our RevPAR increases in these cities to 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively. The good news is that in both markets, although one renovation was completed in the first quarter and we anticipate the remaining project, the Embassy Suites Chicago rooms\u2019 renovation will be completed in May.","As expected, due to increased supply, renovation, and oil issues, RevPAR growth for the first quarter in your New York, DC, Houston, and Canada, was difficult to achieve as all of these markets experienced declines in RevPAR.","Our hotels in New York remain challenged because of the tough Super Bowl comparison, ample new supply, winter storms, and a lighter city-wide calendar continue to affect our hotels ability to drive rate this quarter. Our hotels had a rough start with January and February RevPAR down 17.7% and 5.3% respectively. However, the bright spot was that margins results were exceptional with RevPAR growing 7.4%.","It should be noted that the first quarter is usually the weakest for New York and we\u2019ve anticipate that the rest of the year will perform better than the first quarter. And in fact, we are expecting positive RevPAR growth in remaining quarters. We have not yet seen any impact from the strong U.S. dollar to the New York and anticipate that some of our traveler tourists from abroad may be impacted by recent currency changes.","Moving to DC, continued renovations and the absorption of the new supply in the market hindered results for the quarter. Three of our larger hotels in the city continued to be under major renovation during the quarter, which was the main reason for DC\u2019s 5% decline in RevPAR. We expect the performance of our properties here to improve in the second quarter as the group booking pace is strong and renovations are expected to be completed in the quarter.","I should also note that the city-wide are looking strong for 2016 and 2017. DC\u2019s best convention center years were in 2005 and 2008. The city\u2019s booking pace for 2017 is very close to the peak of 2005 and has surpassed the pace achieved in 2008.","In Houston, the continued renovation at our JW Houston and the decline in the energy segment negatively impacted RevPAR this quarter resulting in a decline of 9.7%. While the renovation at the JW Houston was completed in April, the travel declines related to the energy industry, an industry that has commenced with nearly 50,000 layoffs recently, will continue to negatively impact the Houston market for the remainder of 2015.","Finally, our two hotels in Canada had a RevPAR decline of 21.7% for the quarter mainly due to the continued extensive renovation at the Calgary Marriott. The room renovations are expected to be completed by the end of June and the meeting space renovations of property is expected to be completed by the end of August. This renovation disruption combined with the declining oil prices translates to continued underperformance for our Canadian asset in comparison to our portfolio for the remainder of the year.","Shifting to our European joint venture, our hotels in Europe had a great quarter with RevPAR increase of 4.2% on a constant euro basis. Strong transient business more than offset the softer group business and help drive the RevPAR increase this quarter. With a strong increase coming from transient customers, outlet revenues increased 2.8%, but were offset by banquet and AV revenue declining 3.4% resulting in a total food and beverage revenue decline of 80 basis points. Even with the decline in food and beverage revenue, our hotels in Europe were able to generate a 3.6% increase in food and beverage profit with productivity and cost control initiatives.","Our outlook for the European asset remains encouraging as sentiment in the eurozone has turned positive. The economic outlook for the eurozone significantly improved in April from 1.1% to 1.5% driven partially by quantitative easing policies, cheap oil, and a cheap euro. Most notable increases in our economic outlook for the rest of the year were in Spain and Germany with both countries GDP forecast increasing 50 basis points from the prior forecast. We continue to expect that domestic and international demand will improve in Europe with these stronger GDP forecast and the benefit of the cheap euro.","Moving to our margins. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margin increased 50 basis points in the first quarter on RevPAR growth of 3.8%. This margin increase would have been 20 basis points higher without the USALI adjustment. We are pleased with the increase be achieved in the first quarter as our hotels attained impressive rooms and food and beverage flow-throughs. More than anticipated rooms, wages, and benefits and changes in cancellation policies contributed to strong rooms flow-through.","In the past room reservation could be cancelled up at 6 PM on the date of arrival. Beginning in 2015, certain hotels had changed the policy so that reservations must be cancelled within 24 hours or the guest will be charged for the room for tax. This policy will continue to improve room profit going forward as the hotels have been somewhat lenient in the beginning that will begin enforcing this policy in full force going forward.","Other factors such as utilities and property insurance expenses help increase margins this quarter. Utility expense was down 7.7% and part due to energy ROIs completed in 2014 such as the steam to gas conversion at the Sheraton, New York. Property insurance was also down 10.3% in the quarter. Looking forward to the remainder of 2015, we believe that RevPAR growth will continue to mainly be driven by average rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through.","On the other hand, our incentive management fees will continue to increase at a more normalized level and we also anticipate real estate taxes to increase well above inflation as our property values have grown. In addition, as Ed mentioned in his prepared remarks the strength in U.S. dollar is expected to continue to impact our EBITDA for the full year. With this in mind, we continue to expect 2015 comparable hotel EBITDA margins to increase 30 basis points to 60 basis points. As previously mentioned, we estimate that without the USALI adjustment, 2015 margins would be higher by 20 basis points.","In summary, we feel good about the industry fundamentals and our results. We are focused on executing our renovation and repositioning plan to deliver long term value for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi good morning guys.","Ed Walter ","Good morning.","Greg Larson","Good morning.","Anthony Powell","Ed, thanks a lot for the comments on the renovation and also you\u2019ve appetite to do more acquisitions that could require some Capex, does your renovation activity imply that you are having more positive view of a lodging cycle then maybe some censuses right now?","Ed Walter ","I don't know that I\u2019d, I would say, it shouldn\u2019t be compared to what other people think, but I think we certainly do have a very positive view on the lodging cycle as I outlined in my comments and feel this certainly is the time to benefit from the investments we're making in the properties that we already own.","Anthony Powell","Thanks. And I guess, also on the change in the investment team, has that changed your target markets for acquisitions or your overall acquisition philosophy for the rest of the cycle? Thank you","Ed Walter ","No it doesn't. I think actually the changes that we've made will hopefully allow us to focus even more carefully and thoughtfully on the markets that we are interested in acquiring in, but by splitting up to U.S. between Jim Risoleo who was our Chief Investment Officer previously and now is located out in the West, and then bringing in Nate Carroll, who is the senior leader within the company, who has been an active member of the investment committee and a very strong executive. Putting them in charge of the Eastern half and the Western half of the country, I think will allow us to be even more focused in our investment efforts and I\u2019m expecting to see good results out of that change.","Anthony Powell","Just one follow-up, final follow-up on the repurchase of $500 million, how did you come up with the $500 million number was there leverage ratio you were targeting or just what were your thoughts on that number versus maybe a larger number like $1 billion?","Ed Walter ","I think in part, I would say that we typically, when we were issuing stock we tended to look to get authorization to do that up to $500 million and I think in terms of buying back stock we felt that $500 million was sort of a good round number. It obviously, if we execute fully on that program there is the opportunity to initiate another one, but a lot of this was tied to our expectations around sale activity.","Anthony Powell","Alright. Good quarter. Thanks a lot.","Ed Walter ","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Hi, good morning guys. Wanted to ask you may reference to potentially doing some more brand or manager changes and that kind of thinking to the history of your company, you guys have successfully renegotiated some management contracts overtime. I think you\u2019ve typically done them kind of in bunches at once. Is there any thought to going back to some of your operators and just revisiting certain things?","Ed Walter","Chris, I would say that we are always looking at opportunities to may be make changes in one property and then acquire benefits in another. We\u2019ve done it a couple of times where we done what I would sort of view is very large transaction, both of those with Marriott when we renegotiated our contracts back in 2002 and then again in 2005. I would say what more likely to happen in the near term is something similar to what happened in Calgary, where we agreed to extent the Calgary contract in written for getting flexibility on to other properties one which we subsequently sold.","Flexibility that we acquired was the ability to sell that property unencumbered by management. And so, we are always looking at opportunities like that. I think it\u2019s reasonable to assume that over the course of the next couple of years or couple of more opportunities like that would develop.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. And then just a quick follow-up on the share buyback and I think you just mentioned that it could relate to some future asset sales. To the extent you do that, do you envision that being more of a programmatic buyback or would it kind of be more opportunistic and price based and spread out or maybe come together in a short period of time.","Ed Walter","I would say that given that our basic plan is to fund it primarily through asset sales, I would suggest that it would more likely be spread out. But having said that, consistent with how we both pursued stock buyback programs in the past and stock issuance in the past and a lot of that relates to where the stock price is. So to the extent that the price where to be more attractive than we might \u2013 we would accelerate our buying in those circumstances and in situations where it would might increase significantly then we may be out of the market for a period of time. So it will be dictated a bit by the pace of sales and then furthermore \u2013 and then offset by to the degree to which sales might be reinvested in other assets, your existing ones or new ones and then ultimately also affected by the stock price.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed.","Ed Walter","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks, its Smedes. I also just wanted to ask you on the buyback. It seems like in light of your comments about 2016 and even some early comments about 2017, why wouldn\u2019t you want to frontload this now using your line and I am not suggesting you trash the balance sheet or something. But if you feel it fairly confident that you could pay it down pretty quickly with the proceeds from asset sales, why not take advantage of what looks to be really a very compelling discount to NAV particularly in light of what you just threw out as kind of per key value. Could you may be speak to that a little bit?","Ed Walter","Steve, I think the point we are trying to make in our comments is we do feel good about the cycle and we do feel the part of that cycle that we can predict is the supply side, which we can reasonably predict that. And we are not seeing at this point any problems on that side. Having said that I think there is always risks on the demand side, so I think we are comfortable with where we are. We will have flexibility to perhaps do a bit of what you were describing as we move forward, but I think some of that again is tied \u2013 I mentioned we are looking at some deals that we want to be thoughtful about how we fund those transactions and would obviously like to see the asset sales occur that [indiscernible] going to use to fund the buyback. ","So it doesn\u2019t all have to happen sequentially, you don\u2019t have to sold the property in order to fund the buyback but you want to have a reasonable expectation that the sales will occur in order to fund the buyback. And of course some of this gets tied to just the availability of those periods of time when you can actually be in the market to buy. So I get your point and I don\u2019t disagree with it in total, I just think we \u2013 at the same time I don\u2019t believe that the Board was comfortable with the notion that we would aggressively frontload that program in anticipation of things that would happen. I think, that alludes - I've seen people do, maybe move aggressively on expectations in the past and the world can change on you and surprise you as a matter of fact.","Smedes Rose","I guess just on that as well, is there any thought to maybe reducing your exposure to international markets, which have proven to be maybe extraordinary relative versus the domestic market?","Ed Walter ","There certainly are some international assets that are part of for sale program for this year, so that\u2019s something that we are looking at. ","Smedes Rose","All right, thank you.","Operator","We will take our next question from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hi good morning guys. Maybe just a follow-up on the last question, but very specifically Ed, is there a magnitude of discount to NAV that makes it so attractive that you need to look at buybacks instead of doing an acquisition, is there like a, kind of a, I mean is it 20% or 30% type number that just makes it \u2013 that makes that the compelling rational?","Ed Walter ","Yeah, I haven't thought about it specifically in terms of a percentage reduction to NAV, but certainly as we\u2019re looking at other alternatives we are looking at both what's the opportunity with that acquisition versus what do we think the return would be on the stock and to the extent that the stock is a more compelling investment then that's going to see more capital.","Shaun Kelley","Okay, thanks to that. And to switch gears, you know you talked about keeping some fire power for continued M&A and so the question there is, I think in the past you guys have talked about and maybe it was even just last quarter, some potentially larger scale, I think single asset, but probably at larger scale type deal that might be out there, do you still think that larger or bigger assets are available or things we looking at more opportunistic smaller scale and more like some of these independent hotel deals we\u2019ve seen around this sector recently.","Greg Larson ","We\u2019re looking at a combination of both. Some are larger single asset possibilities and then we are also looking at a number of the smaller deals that might be out there. So, both of those would potentially be on the play.","Shaun Kelley","And has anything changed from your comments last quarter in terms of just the availability of some of those big assets?","Greg Larson ","No I don't know, I wouldn't think that we see a difference in terms of where we were last quarter, maybe one point that you are getting at indirectly is that we - when we talked about the options that we had last quarter, I think we suggested at that stage that we might be in an either or position relative to stock buyback versus investing. And I guess what I would say is as we look forward as we look at what we would be interested in trying to sell this year and have thought about that, the conclusion that we reached is that we probably have the capability to both do new investments and buyback stock, obviously the relative balances of those two will change and will obviously work our way through the year. But we didn't see it as an either\/or proposition and so that's why we wanted to go ahead and implement the program at this point in time because our stock price is attractive. We do want to have the ability to be able to purchase it and then we will - the degree to which we execute on one version versus the other will be based upon the relative returns that we\u2019d see from each of those alternatives.","Greg Larson ","Yes, certainly we can do both of those things, but I would add we could also put out over $600 million in the form of a dividend.","Shaun Kelley","Great, thanks guys. I appreciate the color.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Harry Curtis with Nomura.","Harry Curtis","Good morning guys. Following up on renovations, I don't know, I jumped on the call late, Ed as you look at the make-up of your portfolio today do you see a more large-scale renovations for 2016 that are likely to get done?","Ed Walter ","Harry, there are a few projects that we are going to start at the end of this year. That will be sizeable renovations of individual hotels that will happen during the beginning of 2016. Lease based upon our current expectation, but overall when we look at the program that we are envisioning for 2016 and compare it to 2015, we expect that the dollar amount that we invest will go down and the impact of those activities next year will be less than what we are feeling this year.","Harry Curtis","By what magnitude, please.","Ed Walter ","I don\u2019t want to give you a number right now because we are very early in the process on the capital budget. But I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not talking 5% or 10%, I\u2019m talking more than that.","Harry Curtis","Yeah. I mean it is important with respect to return of capital to see that CapEx being to come down and to give investors a sense of what percentage of your assets still need innovation.","Ed Walter","You know, Harry, the one thing to recognize in our sector is you\u2019re always in some level of renovation. And I know you know that. A big chunk of the larger investments that we are making this year, it relates to the \u2013 really what we call ROI or redevelopment projects and I continue to believe that those are the projects that you also want us to be doing because, as I mentioned in my comments, we think the returns from those investments are in the mid-teens and those are attractive way to both enhance value of the portfolio and enhance the valuable of our cash flow.","So that part of what we\u2019re doing to me is very much value accretive. I think the part that \u2013 and I would like to do more of those to the extent that those opportunities such as what we are going to end up doing in Phoenix with the Ritz-Carlton, which present themselves.","On the other hand, what we\u2019ve talked about before in the first quarter, I think we talked about in February and are continuing to highlight is, both Greg and I talked about in our comments is, we did have a number of larger renovation projects to comparable hotels, which certainly had a negative effect on those comparable hotel performances during the course of the first quarter.","That CapEx, which deals more with maintaining the portfolio, is accelerated a bit in the beginning of this year because of some contractual negotiations we had whether it was with extending a ground lease or extending a management contract in return for other benefits. That level of capital is what I expect will be declining next year and that\u2019s why I believe the level of disruptive will be lower. But we will know more about that as we work our way through the year. Our budget process, we\u2019re coming up with next year\u2019s capital program really happens over the course of the summer.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Thanks, Ed. And just a quick question on the importance of scale in the REIT segment. It certainly matters in the C-Corp segment. And do you think for the REITs that the bigger the better? And to that extent, do you expect any consolidation within the lodging REITs this cycle?","Ed Walter","I think there are certain benefits of scale that just relate to either your ability to access the unsecured debt market as the foundation of your portfolio and sort of your ability to perhaps develop in-house capabilities in certain areas. In our instance, I think our ability \u2013 our scale forces us to develop a really comprehensive construction team, which I think makes the difference in terms of what we been and when we are pursuing construction project and the like. So I do think there are some benefits to that.","On the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t say that scale in and of itself, certainly for us at this stage, enhancing that scale is not necessarily a goal. For us, it is about enhancing profitability and share value. In terms of predicting what\u2019s going to happen within the sector, I think many of you have commented that there \u2013 you could certainly see some logic for some consolidation that hasn\u2019t happened in our sector in the past, I think it will be hard to predict, but it\u2019s necessarily going to happen in the near term.","Greg Larson","Harry, I think the other big benefit as you know from size is just \u2013 increase stock liquidity as well.","Harry Curtis","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla","Hi, good morning, Ed, Greg, and Gee. Just a couple of questions here. The first question is for Ed. I think you mentioned early on that the market may be underestimating the positive impact from renovations into 2016 that you might expect. I just want to kind of dig in a little bit into that, specifically, what kind of gives you confidence that going to be the case, is it your pace for 2016, that continues \u2013 got stronger than 2015 or just city-wide in your major markets that look a little bit stronger next year than this year, any color? Thank you.","Ed Walter","Yeah, Nikhil, what I was referring to there was that, we \u2013 my sense is that the market may be underestimating the benefit that be expected to arrive out of the seven projects that are essentially going on are non-comparable this year because we\u2019re closing parts of those properties. And as a result of closing parts of those properties, all parts of those properties this year, we are losing about $25 million in EBITDA this year compared to last year. As we \u2013 most of those projects with the exception of the San Diego will be coming back online no later than the first quarter \u201916. ","And so as we are in \u201916 and \u201917, we would expect to both recapture the $25 million that we are losing in 2014 because they won\u2019t be closed anymore and then based on the rationale under which we undertook those projects, we would expect to see another $25 million or so of incremental EBITDA that would flow to the company in \u201916 and \u201917 as a result of our successful completion of those projects. So that\u2019s what I was talking about as part of my comment. So it\u2019s not \u2013 its inherently the assessment and the underwriting of those individual project takes into account what\u2019s going to be happening in those markets. ","And so the strength of the convention cycle is San Diego in \u201916 is one of the benefits that we expect to derive from having our ballroom complete. But I was really referring to those projects as opposed to a blanket statement about how well the portfolio of the industry would perform in 2016.","Greg Larson","Ed, I agree with that but I also would say that we are also experiencing a lot of disruption in our comp portfolio as well. And so for instance, as I mentioned, three of our largest hotels in D.C. were all under renovation in the first quarter. So as those hotels, as those renovations are completed by call it May of this year, then those hotels will start outperforming this year and obviously in 2016 as well. Again, the same thing, I think we mentioned the Calgary Marriott, a lot of disruption going on there. The RevPAR is actually down 42%. That hotel is actually in our com set. So again when that hotel \u2013 we will look at that hotel next year, my guess is that RevPAR growth can be substantial.","Nikhil Bhalla","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that. And one other question on asset acquisitions, do you still see some assets in portfolio that you might be interested as the price will rise, both nationally and internationally.","Ed Walter","Yeah, I don\u2019t want to necessarily comment on any one company portfolio, but you should assume that we regularly look at whatever the brands are interesting in selling, we have strong relationships with all of the brand. And so we would always be in conversations with them about what options might exist.","Nikhil Bhalla","Thank you.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hi, good morning everyone. Two questions here. The first is a follow-up to the earlier question on capex for this year. Correct me if I am wrong, I think that the ROI portion of the total capex budget is going up slightly from what was announced last quarter. And if I am correct in saying that, is that an increase to the budget versus what was originally expected or is that just pulling forward some of those other 2016 projects that you mentioned just pulling them forward into this year. And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up after that.","Ed Walter","Sure. Yeah, I would say as usual in this area, it tends to be a combination of factors. So as part of some of the redevelopments that we are looking at, we have identified some incremental opportunities that we think will add value including a one I would say a meaningful energy ROI project where we\u2019ll end up producing our own power for our particular hotel which we think will significantly reduce our utility cost. So some of it is an increasing scope, some of it is the fact that as we look at the timing for when we\u2019re going to be completing some of the improvements, the reality is we are hopeful of being perhaps completing things a little bit earlier and then that result would further dollars allocated for this year to go up a bit.","Rich Hightower","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then my follow-up is just on the guidance largely unchanged from prior. It does sound like FX is getting a little worse than you expected and you said that was offset by cost savings. But in the prepared comments, it did sound like group booking activity and some of the forward numbers that you guys are looking at are getting a little bit better incrementally. So I am just wondering if that\u2019s the case, why guidance didn\u2019t go up slightly on that alone relative to these other factors.","Ed Walter","I guess what I would say is, first of all, I think you\u2019ve assessed all that correctly in the sense that we basically are feeling a bit more pain from the current or anticipating that we will feel some more pain on the currency side, which is being offset by the margins. And I\u2019d say you\u2019re right about what's happening on the group side and we were very encouraged by the strong increase in rooms booked in the first quarter and perhaps even more encouraged by the fact that the rate was up 8%, compared to what we booked last year. So our group booking pace for this year is continuing to look better and better as we work our way through the year. ","We certainly hope that that trend continue and I think to the extent that we benefit from that trend continuing that might offer an opportunity for an improvement in our top line estimates, but it\u2019s really, it was just one quarter and I think we just simply - we are certainly - in a sense we've improved our guidance because we've offset the decline in the currency impact, but it obviously doesn't show up when you look at the aggregate numbers in nominal dollars, but we're feeling good about where the year is headed and hope we continue to feel good.","Rich Hightower","Okay, that's it from me, thank you.","Ed Walter ","Right.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Ryan Meliker with MLV & Company.","Ryan Meliker","Hi guys most of my questions have been answered though one thing, I was hoping you could give us some color on was back in the third quarter 2013, you guys issued equity via the ATM at around $18.39 [ph] now with the stock $2 higher and essentially trading at the same forward multiple and consensus estimate, you guys have instituted a buyback and I think that's great, I'm just curious how you reconcile those two things? Is it just based on the opportunities you have for investment then versus now or is there something else are you not even concerned about the fact that you wish you clearly had a price $2 below where the stock is trading now in terms of buybacks, just how do you think about that, that's helpful, thanks.","Ed Walter ","Ryan I can't necessarily tie that specifically to that particular issuance of stock and I'm not debating your numbers, I'm just simply saying, I don't know that we would necessarily tie specifically to that, but as we approach issuing equity through this last or five years, one is I know that the average multiple that we issued that activity at whereas a couple of terms higher than we always did today, more than a couple of times higher. So, I think we felt very comfortable whenever we were issuing equity previously that we were issuing at a premium to our NAV. I think at this point in time as we look at where our stock sits and having achieved the leverage objective that we have, we tend to view our stock is trading at a discount to that NAV. ","So, I think the way, the general way we looked at this is that we've tried to issue stock when it\u2019s above our NAV, we used that to buy assets, we did not interesting pay down debt, we used that to buy assets as we grew and then at this point in time given where we are we are perhaps a bit \u2013 while we would like to continue to buy assets as I indicated in my comments just looking at where the markets are [indiscernible] prices if we were to sell more and so in an environment like that when we think we are buying the stock at less NAV, we think that's a fair trade.","Ryan Meliker","Okay.","Ed Walter ","The stock, as the market gets better and as the value of the portfolio improves the stock is going to go up. I\u2019m comfortable with any of the stock issuances that we made because as we worked our way through the cycle, we are working more now than when we issued that stock previously, but at this point in time, I think we are not as being as fairly valued as we should be, which creates the opportunity to buy stock back.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, just out of curiosity, I would be curious about your perspective if you talk about trading at a discount to NAV today, but a premium to NAV when you were issuing the equity, do you think that's more driven by the underlying cash flow growth in the assets, or do you think cap rates have compressed in your assets over the past couple of years?","Ed Walter ","Probably a combination of both and then we clearly had strong cash flow growth in our portfolio and the cap rates have certainly compressed leading out certain individual markets. I think they did compress from earlier in the cycle. We are at a point in the cycle with now, where I think you\u2019d like to see cap rates generally - you are comfortable if they continue to maintain their position, but certainly over the course of the cycle we have seen cap rate compression and we have benefited from that.","Ryan Meliker","All right, thanks for the commentary, as it\u2019s all from me.","Ed Walter ","Thanks.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Thank you, sir. Can you help us think about trajectory of RevPAR growth quarter-by-quarter in 2015. It\u2019s been a pre-coming in a lot of lodging earnings call this quarter. I think companies, if they expect U.S. RevPAR growth to continue accelerating through 2015? And then for you specifically, can you just help us think about kind of the renovation impact and also group trends and seasonality in specific markets like New York and how to think about the overall impact. Thank you.","Ed Walter","It sounds what \u2013 I think your first part of your question was just to talk about maybe our RevPAR growth as we progress through the year. As you know, we really do not give quarterly guidance. We give full year guidance. Having said that, I think when we look at our quarters for this year, I think the strongest quarter for us should be the fourth quarter.","Greg Larson","And in general, if you look at where our expectations are and our guidance are for the full year, it\u2019s clear that the first quarter is all that. So we are obviously expecting things to improve as we work our way through the year.","Thomas Allen","Okay, helpful. Sorry...","Ed Walter","And then what was \u2013 I think you had some questions about some of the individual markets.","Thomas Allen","No. That was basically what I was trying to get out of it. You obviously have company specific things going on. So it was kind of a two-part question. One, kind of asking what your thoughts on general market U.S. RevPAR growth and if you try \u2013 to accelerating in the second part was just idiosyncratic if something happened for your portfolio specifically.","Ed Walter","Yeah. The other thing I would mention Tom is obviously RevPAR is important but margins are important as well if not more important. I would say that clearly when we look at our \u2013 we had a great first quarter with an increase in margins of 50 basis points. I think when I think of the second, third, and fourth quarter, the fourth quarter clearly will be the best quarter from a margin growth perspective. So that way, that helps you in modeling the quarters as well.","Thomas Allen","Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, on the European JV RevPAR was obviously 4%, but you had food and beverage, it was down 1% and we heard some comments about [indiscernible]. Do you think that, that decline in F&B is anything, is it indicative of group trends at all or is it just really one-off things. Thanks.","Ed Walter","Yeah. I would say that group tends to be a little bit lighter in the first quarter and allow European hotels anyway. So I think that that was \u2013 I don\u2019t know that I would read a lot into that in terms of full year in Europe. I would say about Europe is the best as we could tell is that, we did get some good look from enhanced international travel coming into Europe. And so I think actually it\u2019s just obviously \u2013 just the first part of the year and the summer travel season will be more significant in that respect. But it looked like our visitation from the U.S. was up 6% to 8% in the first quarter compared to last year, but I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why we lease to price RevPAR growth in Europe.","Thomas Allen","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi, just to follow on Tom\u2019s question, on the international travel front, you mentioned earlier that you might see some weakness into some of your gateway cities from Europeans. I think you mentioned that. As we get further in the year, what\u2019s the normal booking curve for your international customers meaning are they booking two months in advance, six months in advance, 10 months in advance, so maybe that\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen that negative implication yet. And the counter is as you just noted, you maybe saw some benefit of Europe for Europe or U.S. to Europe. Is that a shorter booking cycle?","Ed Walter","Yeah. Steve, a lot of that has to do with where the source of the travel. So in other words, the tourists tend to book a bit longer out. I think that individual travel is probably a bit shorter. It hard to put a specific timeframes around that, but I would imagine based on this example as opposed to real data that you and I would both be comfortable with. The individual piece of it is maybe 60 days to 90 days but the tour business tends to be a bit longer.","We certainly \u2013 we are obviously aware of the changes in the currency and the dollar relative to \u2013 especially the euro. And so, we\u2019ve been interested to see what that was going to do to our business.","In terms of best international travels that we see unfortunately ends in December, but I was surprised to see that at least in the month of December, even during a period of time when the euro had already started to fall appreciably compared to the dollar and same I think with the pound too, are two largest countries that send folks to the U.S. and UK. And Germany was actually up in December compared to the prior year, which I thought was a good sign.","What we are hearing so far here is that there has not been any real trend of less international travel into our hotels in the gateway market. I think there is a sense on the West Coast that the Asian travellers are really \u2013 other than Japan, are continuing to grow at a pretty rapid rate in terms of their visitation to the U.S. Now as you circle back to the East, we do think \u2013 we continue to think that there could be some risk in terms of travelling to New York and into Florida. But a gain the feedback that we\u2019re getting from the hotels so far is they are not seeing a reduction in reservation and so we are going to watch that carefully over the course of the summer.","Steven Kent","Okay. Thank you for that","Operator","And this does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Ed Walter for any additional or closing remarks.","Ed Walter","Yeah, well, thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight as to how 2015 is playing out on our second quarter call later this summer.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President.","Gee Lingberg","Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today\u2019s call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8K filed with the SEC and on our website at www.HostHotels.com. In our efforts to continually improve on our disclosures, we have added an EBITDA by market supplement to our website. You can find this information on our investor relations section of our website under financial information. We hope that this information is valuable in understanding and analyzing our company.","Now with me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by market and discuss our margin results. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. Now, here\u2019s Ed.","W. Edward Walter","As we predicted in October, our fourth quarter results were impacted by a combination of weaker group activity and disruption from renovations. Overall, we were pleased to record another very positive year for our company. Revenue growth was strong and superior cost controls led to another year of excellent margin improvement. In addition, we made significant progress on several value enhancement projects and on our asset sales initiative. ","Before we get into the details, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter and the year. Adjusted EBITDA was $351 million for the quarter and $1.402 billion for the full year, representing a 7.4% increase over the prior year. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.40 for the fourth quarter and $1.50 for the full year exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 14.5% increase over 2013. These results were impacted by several factors. ","For the full year, our portfolio achieved a 77% average occupancy allowing our hotels to drive rate increases of nearly 5% resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR of 5.7%. For the quarter comparable hotel RevPAR increased 3.2% due entirely to rate growth as occupancy declined by .6 points. ","As outlined in our press release, we had a large number of room and meeting space renovations that began in the fourth quarter. These projects reduced our capacity to attract our customary level of corporate group business as well as some of our higher priced transient customers. Overall, we estimate that our renovation activity reduced our quarterly RevPAR by 160 basis points. More specifically, demand in our group segment declined more than 1% in the fourth quarter but was largely offset by a 1% increase in average rate. ","As we explained in October, the timing of the Jewish holidays clearly accelerated association business into the third quarter which resulted in the decline in demand from this segment in the fourth quarter. Despite this headwind we were quite pleased with our bookings in the quarter for the quarter which improved by more than 12% with rates up 15%. For the full year group rate was up nearly 3% while demand was up over 2.5% resulting in an increase in group revenues of more than 5.5%. ","Looking at our transient business, in the quarter we experienced some weakness from the shift in holiday timing and renovations, but much less of an impact from what we experienced in the group side. Demand decreased by less than 1% but importantly rate increased in all segments leading to an average rate increase of nearly 4% and revenue growth of over 3%. For the full year, our strong group demand allowed us to increase our transient rate by nearly 5%. Combining the rate increase with the slight increase in demand, led to a more than a 5% increase in transient revenues. ","Food and beverage revenues increased by .4% for the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. Banquet and AV revenues were up slightly in the fourth quarter but increased more than 5% for the full year, driving better margins in our food and beverage systems for both the quarter and the full year. The initial benefits of our latest round of cost cutting initiatives combined with lower incentive fees due to prior negotiations, resulted in comparable hotel EBITDA margin improvement of 15 basis points for the quarter and 120 basis points for the full year.","Now, let\u2019s move to our transaction activity. On the disposition front, during the first quarter, we sold the Tampa Marriott Waterside, the Greensboro Highpoint Marriott and the Dayton Marriott for a combined total of $239 million. The latter two transactions were completed by taking advantage of franchise conversion rights we had previously negotiated with Marriott International and the buyers have committed to significant capital improvement as part of the management transition.","For the year, we completed more than $515 million in dispositions. These transactions further reduced our exposure to non-target markets and to lower RevPAR hotels. We have one additional smaller asset under contract with an anticipated Q1 closing which has been included in our guidance for 2015. ","On the development front in the fourth quarter we opened 149 room Novotel and the 256 room ibis Rio de Janeiro Parque Olimpico in Barra de Tijuca, both managed by Accor. The total investment in this project is $65 million. We expect to be active on both the acquisition and disposition front as we look to increase our investments in target markets and remain focused on reducing our exposure to non-core markets and hotels located in suburban locations or secondary markets. While we have active pipelines for both sales and acquisitions given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any additional dispositions or acquisitions. ","As we highlighted at our investor day last spring, we continue to look for ways to extract value from our assets in various and creative ways including the development of underutilized space in hotels, [indiscernible] excess land, rebranding or repositioning, or by restructuring management agreements and ground leases. With an acquisition market that is growing increasingly competitive, these types of value add projects will allow us to continue to provide strong returns for the company. ","In 2014 we completed two notable value enhancement projects in the fourth quarter. First, in December we completed the development of the 131 Hyatt Ka\u2019anapali Beach, a Hyatt resident club resort adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort in [Baja]. We recognized EBITDA of $7 million for the full year from this project. The second project was at our New York Marriott Marquis Times Square Hotel as part of the redevelopment and lease of the retail space to Vornado Realty Trust, the new 25,000 square foot eight story high definition digital boulevard was activated in November. The redevelopment of the entire retail space is expected to be completed late this year.","For 2015, we plan to increase the pace and volume of these value enhancement projects to put us in a position to better drive long term outperformance in 2016 and 2017. These projects include properties where we will be completing a rebranding or transformational renovation that will reestablish the property in its marketplace and provide meaningful increases to the hotel\u2019s profitability going forward. ","The first example of this is The Axiom Hotel in San Francisco which will be managed by Kokua, an operator we have previously retained for our Hyatt Place in Waikiki. As you know, we acquired the former Powell Street Hotel early in 2014. We closed the property on January 2nd to complete a transformational $30 million plus repositioning that will touch every corner of the hotel. We anticipate that the asset will reopen later this fall. ","We are also very excited about our plans for the Four Seasons Philadelphia which will reposition the hotel as a contemporary independent luxury hotel in a vibrant part of the city. We have retained Sage Hospitality as the manager and intend to use their F&B expertise to completely transform their current offerings to better attract our guest and local customers alike. In addition to creating a luxurious rooftop lounge we are adding a high end coffee bar, and under taking a complete gut renovation of the spa and fitness center. We estimate the total project will cost $28 million to $30 million and we plan to shut the whole property down in June for the renovation and reopen at the end of 2015. In addition to these two projects, we are currently working on similar plans for a third hotel and hope to announce this exciting project later this spring. ","Another major project is the development of the $106 million new Marriott Hall Ballroom and Exhibit Space at our Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina Hotel. Demolition of the existing Marriott Hall commenced in the fourth quarter and the new expanded meeting platform is expected to be completed in June of 2016. This state of the art meeting space will benefit not only the Marquis property but also our neighboring Manchester Grand Hyatt, as those properties will be able to drive group business through the utilization of this fantastic new meeting space.","Finally, at the Denver Marriott Tech Center, we have converted the asset to a Marriott franchise with Sage Hotels to implement a transformational renovation which will include creating an executive level tower that will house our new concierge lounge and fitness center and the other tower we are combining rooms and reducing the room count to allow us to attract both family weekend business as well as extended stay customers. In addition, we will be upgrading the meeting space, F&B offerings, and creating a new lobby. The renovation is expected to begin in November and will cost $60 million plus.","We continue to be optimistic about fundamentals in our industry as we expect overall supply to fall short of long term averages for at least the next two years. Expected continued growth in the economy, strong capital investments, and growth in domestic travel should lead to revenue growth that comfortably exceeds inflation at a long term industry averages. The results should be improved asset and company valuations in our industry. ","Our outlook recognizes the following factors. Given that we finished the year with occupancy at 77%, our highest since 2000, we expect that the great majority of our RevPAR growth in 2015 will come from rate increases. Our maintenance capital expenditures, which are projected to increase approximately 5% to $330 million to $350 million, will have a more disproportionate business interruption impact than normal, because the renovations often include extensive bath and shower conversions which are more time consuming, and we are enhancing several lobbies. ","A significant portion of the business impact will be felt in our group business as meeting space and lobby renovations discourage group bookings. Despite this concern, overall group bookings for the year are up modestly with the first half of the year looking quite solid. Recognizing the inherent strength in transient demand, our focus over the last six months has been on pushing rate in our group business and our advanced bookings over that period reflect the nearly 7% increase in rate. ","While we view the overall supply picture as favorable, two of our key markets DC and New York, are experiencing elevated levels of supply and in the case of New York, face significant year-over-year headwinds. As a result, these markets, which represent 27% of our revenues, our expected to underperform in 2015. With all of these factors in mind, we are expecting comparable hotel RevPAR for our portfolio to increase 4.5% to 5.5% in constant currency with our domestic portfolio to increase $475 to $575. ","Four our international portfolio, primarily because of the extremely difficult comps JW Marriott Rio faces in the year after World\u2019s Cup, we are projecting RevPAR on a constant currency basis to be flat to up 2%. This RevPAR growth when combined with our [indiscernible] impacted margin increases of 20 to 50 basis points, will result in adjusted EBITDA of $1.420 billion to $1.550 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.52 to $1.55. ","I should note the following when comparing our 2015 adjusted EBITDA estimates to last year\u2019s results. First, because our dispositions significantly exceeded our acquisitions in 2014, the overall net reduction in EBITDA compared to last year from investment activities is roughly $20 million. Secondly, while we expect meaningful long term benefits from the brand conversions and major capital investments we are implementing in 2015, our seven non-comp hotels are expected to experience a net reduction in EBITDA of $25 million compared to last year as a result of the closing of all or a portion of the hotel. Finally, while only 8% of our portfolio EBITDA is generated from international properties, the significant appreciation of the dollar is currently projected to reduce the nominal value of our international EBITDA by roughly $17 million. ","In summary, I am pleased to say that the lodging industry continues to be strong through the continued demand that exceeds low supply growth in most markets. Given the positive industry outlook and underlying economic fundamentals, we believe this cycle will continue to be strong throughout 2015. The capital we are investing in our hotels ensure that our portfolio is in excellent condition and has the opportunity to achieve strong NOI growth. Our industry leading balance sheet is only getting stronger, our cost of capital remains attractive.","Thank you and let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson","Our hotels in the west continue to lead the portfolio in RevPAR growth. Excellent results from our properties in Hawaii, San Francisco, Florida, and Phoenix were offset by weaker results at our urban New York, DC, and Boston hotels. One thing to note, our urban assets, especially those in New York, are operating at very high occupancies and as such RevPAR growth has been limited to increases in average rates. With the abundant supply in New York, the growth in average rate has flowed and the flat room revenues at our hotels in New York impacted our portfolio RevPAR growth by 100 basis points in the quarter.","In addition, as discussed during our third quarter call, a larger share of the renovations for 2014 occurred in the fourth quarter and the impact of those reservations have been greater than anticipated. While these capital improvements strengthen and create long term value in the portfolio, the negatively impacted the fourth quarter RevPAR growth results by approximately 160 basis points. Many of the disruptive renovations will continue into 2015 and will adversely impact our short term results. ","Let me now provide some commentary around our markets. We posted very strong results at our Hawaiian hotels as the Hyatt Regency Maui strategically reduced group volumes as well as higher rate transient room nights [indiscernible] our owners. This contributed to an increase in occupancy of three percentage points and growth of ADR of 10.5% resulting in impressive RevPAR growth of 15%. ","Our hotels in San Francisco grew occupancy 2.3 percentage points and grew average rate 8.5% resulting in RevPAR growth of 12% in the quarter. All five of our comparable hotels in San Francisco posted double digit RevPAR growth benefitting from the strong group demand in the market this quarter. Corporate group ADR increased 14% and transient ADR improved 10.4%. Our properties in San Francisco for the full year, grew RevPAR by an impressive 15%.","Our Phoenix assets also had a strong quarter with an increase in RevPAR of 8.8% driven by strong group business that also led to robust food and beverage growth of 23%. In Florida, our hotels also outperformed our portfolio in the quarter by significant margin with RevPAR growth of 9.4%, primarily driven by a substantial transient rate increase of approximately 10%. We believe our Florida assets are poised for another strong year in 2015 as the group revenue pace is up over 9% in 2015. ","As expected, RevPAR growth for the fourth quarter in New York, DC, Boston, Houston, San Diego, and Canada was challenged. The challenges arose primarily as a result of disruptive room, meeting, and public space renovations that were ongoing during the quarter at many of the hotels in these markets which negatively impacted RevPAR growth. New York and DC were impacted by supply increases that limited rate growth in those markets. However, it is important to note that even with New York\u2019s challenging supply environment, our hotels grew market share by 1%.","In the first quarter of 2015, in addition to the continued impact of supply, the disruption to travel caused by severe snowstorms in the Northeast region will also impact RevPAR growth in New York. Further, we have difficult year-over-year comparisons in the first quarter as our hotels in New York strategically took on group business during the Super Bowl last year with both our hotels in Times Square serving as the headquarters for the media and the NFL. All these actors will combine to negatively impact 2015 first quarter results.","In addition to the supply challenges, our hotels in DC had a disproportionate amount of disruptive capital expenditures in the quarter, limiting RevPAR growth. The JW Marriott was under rooms renovations and the Grand Hyatt was under meeting space renovations in the quarter which negatively impacted overall results for our hotels in the DC market. These renovations will continue into 2015 further impacted the operations of these hotels or the next couple of quarters.","Boston, while not impacted by renovations this quarter, had less city wise at the Heinz Convention Center and difficult comparisons due to the World Series last year. For the first quarter 2015, the record breaking snowfall in Boston will negatively impact results. Houston and Calgary were impacted by falling oil prices in addition to the disruptive renovations at the JW Houston, Houston Airport, and Calgary Marriott hotels. The negative impact from renovations at these hotels and the falling oil prices will continue into 2015. ","The 2.2% fourth quarter RevPAR growth for San Diego was primarily impacted by renovations at two large hotels in San Diego. Group business was negatively impacted by the meeting space renovation at the Manchester Grand Hyatt and the start of the Marriott Hall construction at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina. The construction of the Marriott Hall will be completed in mid-2016. The meeting space renovations at the Manchester Grand Hyatt have been completed and the hotel will benefit from those renovations in 2015. It is encouraging to see a 6.5% increase in our San Diego hotels 2015 group revenue [indiscernible]. ","Shifting to our European joint venture, our hotels in Amsterdam, Brussels, Nurnberg, and Milan had excellent RevPAR growth ranging from 8% to 15% in the fourth quarter. This strength was partially offset by weakness in many of our hotels in the other European markets resulting in a 2.9% increase in the European joint venture\u2019s comparable hotel RevPAR. Food and beverage revenues increased .8% which led to a total revenue increase of 1.7%. Even with a total revenue growth of only 1.7% for the quarter, with good cost control measures these hotels grew EBITDA by 5%. ","Looking to 2015, lodging fundamentals in our domestic hotel market with the exception of New York, DC, and Houston, will continue to be strong in 2015. We expect all but these markets to have strong year of RevPAR growth that will meet or exceed the midpoint of our domestic RevPAR guidance for 2015. On the other hand, our own international properties will perform below our domestic portfolio primarily due to the expected significant decline in RevPAR at our JW Marriott Rio which is a result of the extremely difficult comp from last year\u2019s World Cup. ","In addition, on a nominal currency basis, the strengthening US dollar will have a significant negative currency impact on our international properties affecting RevPAR as well as EBITDA generated from these hotels. For the hotels in the European joint venture with the continued economic challenges in many of the European countries, we expect comparable portfolio RevPAR to lag US RevPAR growth, however, the six month long international art exhibition returns to benefit this year and Milan is scheduled to host the World\u2019s Cup which is also a six month event in the city. These two large events will drive outperformance at our hotels in Venice and Milan in 2015. Moving our margin our comparable hotel EBITDA margins increased 15 basis points in the fourth quarter on RevPAR growth of 3.2%. Lower RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter slowed the strong margin expansion we still had on the third quarter.","In addition, $4 million of severance costs associated with the Four Seasons Philadelphia and San Francisco Marriott Marquis further impacted margins by 35 basis points in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, margins expanded a strong 120 basis points. During 2014, we were able to drive this increase through initiatives such as renegotiation of several management agreements. As a result, incentive management fees for 2014 decreased 4.1%. We renew our insurance each year and in 2015 we were able to decrease our insurance costs by 6%. ","The cost savings realized from time and motion studies and deep dives conducted at various properties contributed to excellent rooms and food and beverage flow through of 76% and 48% respectively. We continue to expect that these third-party time and motion studies as well as the company initiated deep dives will continue to help improve our margins going forward. ","Looking to 2025, we believe RevPAR growth will primarily be driven by average rate growth which should lead to solid rooms flow through. However, certain savings realized in 2014 will likely be difficult to replicate in 2015. Our incentive management fees will increase at a more normalized level and real estate taxes are projected to increase well above inflation as hotel values have grown.","As I mentioned previously, we also expect the strengthening US dollar to impact our EBITDA for the year. With this in mind, we expect 2015 comparable hotel EBITDA margins to increase 20 to 50 basis points which equates to 40 to 70 basis points without the USALI adjustment mentioned in our press release. ","As a reminder, our operators adoption of the updated Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry, USALI, affects the comparability of our results. These changes include declassification of items such as service charges which will now be included in both food and beverage revenues and expenses in addition to certain other reclassification. Accordingly, the adoption of USALI will negatively impact RevPAR growth by 10 basis points while food and beverage revenue will be positively impacted by 250 basis points. EBITDA margin will be negatively impacted by 20 basis points while growth in total EBITDA is unaffected. ","With regard to dividend, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.06 per share for the fourth quarter. Our total dividend for the year was $0.75 per share which represented a 63% increase over 2013. Today, we announced that our first quarter common dividend will be $0.20 per share given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow we are committed to sustaining this meaningful dividend. ","In summary, we expect overall lodging fundamentals to continue to be favorable in 2015. Having said that, our portfolio in 2015 will face a short term negative impact as we work to improve our properties through renovation and take advantage of other value creating opportunities. We believe these efforts will continue to create long term value for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, we are now interested in answering questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Smedes Rose \u2013 Citigroup.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask just a little bit around the renovations having kind of an outsized impact for this year. When you think about that and the timing around renovations are they market dependent so the asset is just considered on its own and you need to do what you need to do, or can you look kind of holistically across the portfolio and maybe mitigate the impact better? I\u2019m just kind of curious how you think about that? It just seems you have a lot going on this year and I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you came about the timing on that?","W. Edward Walter","I think it sort of breaks into two categories. The first is where the redevelopment, the conversions of properties such as what we\u2019re doing in San Francisco and what we intend to do at the Philadelphia Four Seasons and hopefully with a couple of other hotels, with those I think it really \u2013 we see such an opportunity to improve the cash flow from those assets that the timing simply was driven as much from the acquisition or in the case of the Marriott Hall it was when we were able to get the approvals to start the ballroom. In the case of Philadelphia it was both resolving contractual issues with the Four Seasons originally and then ultimately having the opportunity to have flexibility to change the brand and change the hotel.","I think in those cases to some degree I look at those similar to an acquisition that the timing was right, the opportunity was great, and so we moved forward with those as expeditiously as possible. We do take into account with those \u2013 we try to look at what\u2019s the best timing in the year to commence the renovations. One of the reasons why \u2013 the timing in Philadelphia is to close in June is to take advantage of the spring season including the May wedding season and then we will roll into the renovation with the goal being done for the fall. ","In the case of the San Diego ballroom, we\u2019ve actually had the approval to build that ballroom for quite some time now but we made a conscious decision to really plan far out in advance for when we would demolish the original ballroom and start to build the new one to give the hotel the ability to plan as much as possible around that timing and most importantly, from our perspective, to complete the renovations to the Hyatt meeting space next door so we were in a position where if we had in effect surplus rooms at the Marriott that they could take advantage of some of the meeting space that the Hyatt and have the two properties work together. ","With respect to the overall large cap ex hit that we generally described, I think some of that is a little bit it\u2019s just this is the right time for each of those assets to pursue those renovations. You heard a lot of them start in the fourth quarter carry into the first quarter, that\u2019s all about trying to do these renovations at the point in time where they will least affect business. But the good news about our portfolio and our business right now is we\u2019re 77% occupancy on a full year basis. The bad news is when you\u2019re that full unfortunately any kind of renovation work that you\u2019re going to do is going to hurt you because you\u2019re business is that strong.","We were aggressive back in \u201910 and \u201911 about accelerating renovations at a point in time when we thought they would be less impactful from a business interruption standpoint and so you\u2019ll remember we talked about increasing our spending then. We\u2019re trying to be as thoughtful as we can about what\u2019s happening right now. It is the right time to do these things, but unfortunately we are paying a price in terms of business interruption.","Gregory J. Larson","The only thing I would add is we\u2019re also fortunate enough, we have a tremendous amount of work going on both in Houston and Calgary and both of those markets were going to be fairly weak in 2015 so we\u2019re fortunate on that front. ","Smedes Rose","Then just as you look at the potential sale candidates, are you able to negotiate these franchise conversion rights or is that kind of played out now? It seems that that makes the properties easier to sell?","W. Edward Walter","It certainly does and we\u2019ve referenced the fact that we have probably about 40% of our portfolio by number has some sort of contract flexibility. The bulk of that flexibility exists in assets that we have would generally be on, not necessarily specifically on sale lists today, but certainly covers most of the assets that we are targeting for sale. We have a lot more opportunity on that front.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs","A couple of questions from the results, first just the strategic nature of New York City, and even DC for that matter, I get it from a long term perspective but the supply issues aren\u2019t going to go away and they\u2019re actually going to accelerate so is this a onetime event, or should we look at this as this could be pulling you down for a couple of years? Then, staying with that theme, have you started to see any impact of fx on visitation into DC or New York City, especially amongst the international leisure traveler?","W. Edward Walter","Let me answer the second question first. We are certainly concerned about the impact of the stronger dollar on international travel. Clearly, international travel has been a driver in what we view as stronger than anticipated demand growth over the course of this cycle so that I think that is something to be watching. So far, we have not seen an impact from that in New York. Some of that I would say we consciously sought out international business because we were trying to replace the hole that existed at those hotels from having had had the Super Bowl there the prior year, knowing that that was not going to repeat and there was also, I\u2019m not remembering which one it was, but there was a fairly large group event too that was in town in January or early February of last year that also was not repeating.","So, we had sought out additional international business and we were able to get that extra international business primarily through foreign travel. What we\u2019re hearing so far from the properties is that their international business has continued to be maintained strong. I think we\u2019ll have to watch that as the year progresses because a lot of these sorts of international trips are planned way in advance so we\u2019ll have to see if that situation remains the same as we work our way into the spring.","DC is frankly, less affected by international travel. We\u2019re actually part of a group in DC that\u2019s working to try to encourage incremental travel to DC from international locations and so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve noticed anything in Washington that would suggest that had softened at all. ","With respect to the two markets, you\u2019re right the supply especially, in New York, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re worried in the next two years about supply in DC, but supply in New York continues to be strong. It has continued to generate good demand growth. Obviously, we talked a little bit about it already on the international side and the market has generally absorbed the new supply, but where the problems have come about is we haven\u2019t been able to drive rate. Looking at the numbers, I\u2019d have to say that looking at the next couple of years I do think that\u2019s going to continue to be a challenge in New York.","I think New York from a capital perspective though continues to rank very highly as a place for both domestic and international investors to invest and so that has allowed cap rates in New York to remain low and we frankly don\u2019t see that that situation is likely to change in the near term. So the value of the assets feel good to us but we would certainly like to see additional growth there. DC on the other hand, I think DC\u2019s strength this year will be more dictated probably in the short term, by how active the calendar is on the Hill and whether or not there\u2019s a fair amount of legislative and lobbying activity. As we get into next year the conventions business in DC finally starts to improve in a material way. We would be expecting better results in 2016 from DC. ","Gregory J. Larson","I think the only thing I would add and you probably know this as well, DC was actually a really strong market in the fourth quarter with RevPAR for the industry up over 8%. Unfortunately for us, because we have two very large hotels in renovation, our RevPAR growth was only 2.5%. But, I agree with Ed, when you look at the future of group bookings pace in \u201916, \u201917, and beyond it looks pretty exciting and as Ed said, supply growth in DC remains at 2% or below for the next couple of years so we do feel pretty good about DC especially once our hotels are fully renovated.","Steven Kent \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just one separate note and aside, I\u2019m intrigued by the move, the changing of the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, and I know you announced it a couple of months ago, but could you see yourself doing more and more of that or was this just a one off? I\u2019m just intrigued by how you\u2019re thinking about the portfolio and brand affiliation versus non-brand affiliation.","W. Edward Walter","I think you should assume that we\u2019re going to try to do more of these types of projects. The one that we referenced that is premature to announce would be somewhat similar in approach and I think as we look at how we would like to invest we would look at both opportunities in the portfolio where we have flexibility to convert to this type of approach, or certainly to acquire new assets that are either independent or soft branded already, or have the potential to be that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Richard Hightower \u2013 Evercore ISI.","Richard Hightower","A couple of questions here. The first one is a follow up on New York, I think a lot of the REITs this quarter and previous quarters have kind of made the same point, the fundamentals are opportunely going to underperform but cap rates continue to fall in the market yet no one seems to be interested in selling anything and I\u2019m wondering if you guys have an opinion on that? Then my second question is in the release I think you mentioned some incentive fee changes in a handful of contracts and also some ground lease renegotiations that helped EBITDA. I\u2019m wondering if you can quantify maybe what the potential opportunities in the rest of the portfolio are on that front?","W. Edward Walter","As it relates to New York I\u2019d say we certainly each year go through the portfolio and think about what the best strategy is for each individual asset and we certainly doing that on an ongoing basis, looking at our assets in New York to determine if now would be a good time to sell them. The number of cases in our New York assets, we have different elements of them that we\u2019re working on where we think we can enhance value. There also are some things happening within the city with respect to rezoning opportunities which can potentially be beneficially value to the hotels too. ","I think we like the exposure that we have in New York although we obviously wish that the performance was a little bit stronger. As I said, we are comfortable on the valuation side. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re necessarily looking at those values saying, \u201cNow, is the right time to sell those assets,\u201d but that\u2019s an ongoing conversation within the company and we\u2019ll continue to look at that opportunity. ","As it relates to the management fee side, I would say that we were able to, on several assets, negotiate as part of broader considerations whether it was extension of an agreement, whether it was part of a capital plan, and a desire on the part of the operator to have us invest and on our part to invest more in the asset or other circumstances to meaningful reduce our incentive management fees in 2014. Now, as we go through 2015 we still retain the benefit of those negotiations. We\u2019ve effectively reset our incentive management fees at a lower level as a result of those negotiations. ","We\u2019ll get the benefit of that in \u201915 but in \u201915 we are returning to a more normal growth rate and incentive management fees based on the growth rate in EBITDA in the hotels. I would say that there are probably going to be opportunities to do this. I don\u2019t know that I can see on any the horizon immediately but part of the benefit of having a broad portfolio and broad relationships with operators is that overtime these sorts of opportunities present themselves and when we\u2019re there we try to take advantage of them.","Gregory J. Larson","We did mention a couple of ground leases that we\u2019ve been working on and we\u2019re working on several others as well, but what we really did is one ground lease we extended by 30 years so that\u2019ll just make it much easier to sell that asset one day, when we elect to do that. Then on another ground lease we actually fired the lease and so again, that will make it much easier for us to sell that asset going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Anthony Powell \u2013 Barclays Capital Management.","Anthony Powell","Just watching on the timing of the renovations given some of the positive views that we\u2019ve heard from you and others on the [indiscernible] cycle for this year and \u201916, why not maybe wait on some of these renovations and take advantage of the overall positive environment that we\u2019re seeing right now?","W. Edward Walter","I think that\u2019s a fair question and to be honest, we are doing that with some hotels. As we\u2019re thinking through the capital plan for hotels, we\u2019re going to be thoughtful about which of the renovations it makes sense to do now and which of the renovations that we should try to postpone. To some degree, the existing condition of the hotel drives part of that answer. If we feel that we are not benefitting fully from the market in our current condition, given the fact that we remain confident about the outlook for the lodging cycle for the next two years, this isn\u2019t sort of the decision where you\u2019re sitting here saying, \u201cWell, don\u2019t do it in \u201915 because you can do it in \u201916 or do it in \u201917,\u201d because we\u2019re not looking at the outlook thinking that there\u2019s going to be some drop off in that time period.","The postponement decision is more than just a year or so. In some cases too, like with what we\u2019re doing in Washington, the reality is that we knew group bookings were not as strong in \u201915 as they were going to be in \u201916 so this was the right time to go ahead and do the room renovations at the JW Marriott and to tear up the lobby and transform the lobby at the Grand Hyatt. It is going to hurt us, it hurt us in the fourth quarter, it will hurt us in the first quarter, but as we get into the second half of this year and as we get into next year in DC, we\u2019re going to have fully renovated hotels that are going to be, I think, doing quite well in what will be a stronger market. ","Anthony Powell","Kind of along the same lines you seem to be changing a lot of the management contracts into third-party, you\u2019re going more independent, do you mean to do that on a larger scale across your portfolio and if so, what kind of long term cap ex spend do you believe will be associated with that?","W. Edward Walter","I would say we are going to continue to look at opportunities to switch from \u2013 what we\u2019re trying to do across the board here is match the right operator and the right brand with the right hotel. So, with large hotels we continue to be comfortable that the major brand operators are the best solutions for those type of hotels. They have the best marketing platform, the best sales platform to drive large groups into our larger hotels. ","As we look at some of our smaller hotels we\u2019re not always convinced that they\u2019re the best solution and so that\u2019s why in Denver we made the solution to convert to a Marriott franchise and brought in Sage Hospitality which is a very strong operator based in Denver, knows the market extremely well to run that hotel. We have some flexibility through the portfolio to take similar type steps. I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re talking about dozens of opportunities like that, but we have, I would say, it\u2019s probably somewhere in the five to 10 hotel opportunities to do things like this in the next three to five years.","We\u2019ll continue to look at those opportunities as to whether or not that\u2019s the best solution for that individual hotel. Depending upon what we chose to do in connection with that conversion, there may be a renovation that\u2019s timed with that. In some cases the renovation is a good way to sort of announce the arrival of a new operator and new approach to the hotel. But I don\u2019t know that in the grand scheme of things that\u2019s going to radically cause a big change in our overall cap ex program.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Kelley","I just wanted to ask for the Hawaiian timeshare development which you guys called out as contributing around $7 million, if I caught it correctly, for 2014. Do you have a general estimate of what\u2019s kind of built into your guidance or a range of what\u2019s built into the guidance for 2015 that you could share with us?","Gregory J. Larson","Just over $12 million.","Shaun Kelley","What\u2019s the general life cycle here? How long would that project last for sellout? Is it a couple of years or is it going to be more front end loaded?","Gregory J. Larson","I think it\u2019s going to be right around four years for us. It\u2019s going to depend on obviously, the pace of sales but I think right around four years for us.","Shaun Kelley","Then my other questions would be obviously, New York and DC have sort of dominated the discussions but you guys also called out Houston and Calgary given some of the oil exposures. Could you give us just a little bit of a sense of A) how much earnings contribution or revenue contribution you\u2019re getting to be from what you consider oil sensitive markets and B) just what you\u2019re seeing in behavior in some of those hotels, bookings, cancellations, are you seeing outsized moves at this point or would you say that it\u2019s just a little bit lackluster and people are more in wait and see?","W. Edward Walter","I don\u2019t know that right off the top of our head we have a Calgary or Houston number although, intriguingly the additional disclosures we provided will give you some insight into that. I think it\u2019s probably about 4% to 5% would probably be roughly what we get from there. We have seen in those markets some general weakness, but I\u2019ve got to be honest, with the level of capital that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the fact that we\u2019ve had room renovations going on at those hotels and both of those room renovations have involved bathroom renovations, which as I described in my comments, are just more impactful and more time consuming, the bulk of what we have seen in terms of weak operating results we are attributing to the renovation disruption. ","Gregory J. Larson","I agree. In Houston for fourth quarter for the industry RevPAR was up over 8.5% and our Houston properties had a decline over 5% because of the disruption that Ed mentioned. ","W. Edward Walter","I think the sense that we have from talking to the GMs there is that there is \u2013 it has gotten weaker, there is some reduction in corporate level activity. It doesn\u2019t feel like the bottom is dropping out of the market by any means, but Houston has had an incredible run over the last four or five years. It\u2019s really been one of our strongest markets in terms of performance. It will not be one of those this year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Crow \u2013 Raymond James & Associates.","Bill Crow","If I go back to your analyst investor day I think you talked about the conundrum of getting net debt to EBITDA down to like 1.5 turns by mid \u201916 and $700 million of free cash flow before the dividend if those numbers are in the ballpark and here we are, we\u2019ve gone through another year and the 800 pound gorilla has sat out the dance again from an acquisition perspective and that seems to be a pretty consistent theme throughout this cycle relative to your size and the size of your peers and we haven\u2019t heard anything about repurchasing the stock. You\u2019re down 6%, 7% year-to-date, worse performer in the group today of course, and I\u2019m just wondering what your thought process is from the allocation of capital perspective and returning capital to shareholders?","W. Edward Walter","Well, that\u2019s a great question. I think I would say the net debt to EBITDA number that you quoted is where things would happen were we not to do anything because certainly our net debt to EBITDA is nowhere near that level right now, I think it\u2019s more around 2.5 times which is a level that we\u2019re certainly very comfortable at. As you\u2019ve seen us do, we\u2019ve increased the dividend pretty materially over the course of 2014. As we generate cash flow from operations, as we generate cash from sales, I\u2019d say I think our answer to this is going to be consistent to what we said in the past which is the first thing we\u2019d like to do is invest that either in our existing assets, as you can tell from everything we\u2019ve talked about today whether in our comments or our press release, there\u2019s a fair amount of that happening already. ","We\u2019re putting a lot of capital to work and we\u2019re putting it to work in areas that we think will frankly drive better performance than what we would expect to get out of an acquisition. But in addition to doing those types of investments, we would like to acquire additional assets. You could say we\u2019ve sat out the dance and I would say to some degree we\u2019re trying to be thoughtful about underwriting and recognize that cycles do come to an end and take that into account in our underwriting and I think some of the folks that we\u2019re competing with may have a slightly different perspective about how to approach that. ","The bottom line is that we certainly feel good about our overall portfolio and are only looking for opportunities to enhance it as opposed to being worried about just getting bigger. As we generate those extra proceeds from sales and\/or from operations I\u2019d say first of all we would look to enhance the dividend in part because the dividend will probably, if it comes from sales will be generating incremental taxable income from those sales which [indiscernible] some incremental distributions and that\u2019s part of the reason why we had to do the special dividend as part of our most recent distribution, is because we did have taxable income that had to be distributed.","Buying back stock is something that is clearly something we\u2019re looking at. I think we have a few things that we have in the pipeline right now that we would like to see how they play out, but we are certainly open to buying back stocks. We\u2019ve done it in the past and [indiscernible] a more productive use of the capital then we would intend to return it one way or the other. I think then the issue there just becomes trying to understand what might generate the best long term return to the shareholders, whether it\u2019s through a dividend or whether it\u2019s through buying back the stock.","Gregory J. Larson","Or, really a combination of both a strong dividend and buying back the stock.","Operator","Your next question comes from Harry Curtis \u2013 Nomura Securities.","Harry Curtis","Can you talk about or give a little bit more color on when you believe that your current renovation program will result in stabilized EBITDA going forward? Is it the end of 2015, is it the middle of \u201916, and what are the odds that you do, at that point, begin to layer in other renovation projects?","W. Edward Walter","I guess as we look at the major renovations that we were talking about, the ones that really are causing the $25 million worth of disruption, with the exception of the San Diego ballroom, I think most of those projects are going to be completed at some point this year. In general, I would be expecting that the loss in EBITDA that we\u2019re experiencing in \u201915 will be restored in \u201916 by virtue of the fact that those properties will be open and operating. ","Over the course of \u201916 and into early \u201917, we would expect to see meaningful EBITDA enhancements from all the investments that we\u2019ve made that would then start to kick in and we\u2019d start to get the benefit out of the investment activity that we\u2019ve had. Without putting too fine number on it, if we\u2019re going to suffer $25 million of displacement this year, we would expect to make that up and our outlook for \u201916 and \u201917 is we recruit at least that incremental.","Harry Curtis","Then the follow up is, in the fourth quarter with New York City occupancy at roughly 88%, what is it that your managers are nervous about when driving rate more aggressively? It would seem that despite the capacity growth at 88% occupancy one would think there would be a greater opportunity to push rate?","W. Edward Walter","I would agree with you, it would seem that the level \u2013 I think some of the \u2013 our world has gotten a little bit more transparent in terms of pricing over the last decade and the reality is that because the New York market \u2013 a sizeable component of it is driven by leisure, people are quick to price compare. So, what we\u2019ve been finding is that when properties try to push rate, they have to be very thoughtful and sort of tactical about how to do that. At times of the week, at times of the month we are able to drive month but you\u2019ll find that people do move as they start to see rates push beyond certain levels and our world\u2019s gotten easier for people to do that to be honest.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Allen \u2013 Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Can you help us with color on what your EBITDA exposure was to each of your major markets in 2014?","W. Edward Walter","I don\u2019t have that information right in front of me, but that\u2019s exactly what our new disclosure is designed to provide you so if you go to the website you\u2019ll be able to get a pretty good insight into that.","Thomas Allen","Then just on your Hawaii business, you highlighted it was strong in the fourth quarter, it seems like that\u2019s getting the benefit of the rooms that were converted into timeshare, but we\u2019re getting mixed messages from companies on the potential strength of Hawaii in 2015 just given everything that\u2019s going on with the weakening yen and that market being driven by Japanese customers. Can you just help us how to think about that market?","W. Edward Walter","I think you\u2019re right that that\u2019s one of those markets that is susceptible to challenges based upon the strength in currency. I think in our Waikiki asset we have seen some signs there that Japanese travel has not been perhaps as strong as it has been in the past. Having said that, our outlook for Hawaii this year is right down the middle in the portfolio in terms of RevPAR growth. I think where we\u2019re being helped is Maui is more US focused than internationally focused. Our booking pace at our hotels is up very strongly in \u201915 and also is up quite strong in \u201916. I\u2019d say that Waikiki and Oahu is probably a little bit more exposed to some of the challenges from international travel, but Maui is looking quite strong this year.","Gregory J. Larson","You\u2019re correct, fourth quarter was extremely strong for us in Hawaii with RevPAR up almost 15%, but you\u2019re also right about 2015 that when we look at Hawaii I think it will be a good year but it won\u2019t be that strong. I think RevPAR growth in Hawaii next year will be right within our domestic overall portfolio.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session. Mr. Walter, at this time I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","W. Edward Walter","Thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our year end results and outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in the spring to discuss our fourth quarter results and to provide more insight into how 2015 is playing out. Thanks everybody.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11586":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Cathy. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts' fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer will begin by providing some thoughts on his transition, then will provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full-year results, discuss our recent transaction, and conclude with his outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter performance by markets, margins, balance sheet, and our guidance for 2017. Following their remarks, will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss Host's fourth quarter and full-year results. I'll begin by saying how honored and humble I am to lead this great company. Not only do we have an incredible portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, but we have some of the brightest, innovative and hardworking professionals in the industry. I am excited to help take Host to the next level alongside them.","I would also like to thank Ed Walter for everything he has done for Host over the past decade. Personally, I would like to thank him for his friendship over the past 20 years and wish him all the best.","In my first two months at the helm, I have had the privilege to meet with many of our employees, investors, analysts, and operating partners. Many, if not all of them, have asked the same question. How will Host be different going forward? It's an important question, but before I can answer that, I think it's worth reaffirming what remains the same and why I am so confident in our future.","First, we will continue to own the most geographically diverse portfolio of irreplaceable hotel real estate in the industry. Second, we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, providing us a flexibility to navigate the inherent volatility of our business over the course of the cycle. Finally, we will continue to take advantage of our scale, both on the acquisition front where we have a competitive advantage to pursue large complex transactions and in analytics where we can utilize our wealth of property information to mine and create value for our stockholders. We are in the early stages of assessing the organization and its strategic direction. I'm actively reaching out to all stakeholders to gain an understanding of their perspective on Host and what it is they would like to see from the company going forward. I look forward to speaking with many of you over the next several months to receive your input and help shape my perspective as we work to refine and advance our strategy.","Having said that, the first item we're looking to strengthen is our culture, which I believe is the cornerstone of any successful organization. For Host to continue creating long-term value for our stockholders, we believe we need to empower employees by fostering an entrepreneurial environment that is dynamic, nimble and efficient. I have been encouraged by our early efforts and believe these changes are resonating with employees.","We have established an enterprise analytics group, which allows us to streamline several critical functions and enhances our ability to leverage information to create benefits for current and future investments throughout the cycle. When I refer to Host as being more nimble, I think of us as being much more opportunistic in acquiring great real estate that will enhance the quality of the portfolio and ultimately, drive the value of the company.","To do so, we will be more open to investing outside our historical top 10 to 12 markets and using our strong balance sheet to pursue accretive acquisitions where we can add real value. Of course, we will remain disciplined in our approach to external growth opportunities. A great example of our acquisition strategy is the transaction we just announced this morning, the Don CeSar in St. Pete Beach. The resort is an iconic Grand Dame Floridian resort on one of the top beaches in the U.S. and was available free and clear of brand and management.","While the property immediately fits into the top 20 and 10 from a RevPAR and EBITDA per key perspective, we believe there is a substantial upside to our underwriting with the installation of Davidson Hotels & Resorts as the new operator along with a targeted capital plan.","And while I anticipate we will be more active on the investment front, should the economy and markets falter and our stock trade down to some of the levels we witnessed last year, you can also expect us to be prepared to repurchase shares, which is why we have also announced an additional $500 million share repurchase program this morning.","I also note that whether we are evaluating new acquisitions or share buybacks, we fully intend to maintain a strong balance sheet, which we believe to be one of our core strategic tenets. Hopefully that provides you with some color on my near-term focus. With that, let's discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results.","We are pleased to report a better-than-expected fourth quarter and full-year results for our company. Our results were driven by strong group and leisure demand growth, which led to the highest full RevPAR in our history. We saw outstanding margin improvement in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by a combination of productivity improvements and lower utility costs. The lower utility costs are partially a result of the energy saving ROI projects we have implemented over the last several years.","Adjusted EBITDA was $348 million for the quarter and $1.471 billion for the full year, an increase of 4.4%. Comparable hotel EBITDA growth was even better, up 5.8%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.41 per share for the fourth quarter and $1.69 year to date, reflecting a 9.7% increase over last year. Both our EBITDA and FFO results for the quarter exceeded consensus estimates. Despite the expected deceleration due to the shift of the Jewish holidays from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, results were better than anticipated.","For the quarter, hotel occupancy grew 80 basis points to 75%, and our average rate grew 60 basis points. As a result, comparable RevPAR growth on a constant dollar basis increased 1.7%. For the full year, comparable hotel occupancy increased 130 basis points, and average room rate increased 1%. On a constant currency basis, full year RevPAR growth increased 2.7% to approximately $177, which as mentioned, was the highest full year RevPAR in our history.","The primary driver of our results this quarter was our group business. On our third quarter call, we had anticipated a weakness in this segment due to the holiday shift, the November election, and Hurricane Matthew. Fortunately, the hurricane did not materially impact our Florida properties, and despite the election, November was our strongest month in the quarter with a 9.7% increase in group demand, and a 2.9% increase in rate. Throughout the fourth quarter, our higher rated corporate group business was our strongest segment with a 9% increase in demand.","Overall, group demand increased 1.8% with a 1.3% increase in average rate, leading to fourth quarter group revenues increasing by 3.1%.","For the full year, group revenues were up 4.5% as a result of demand increasing 2.1% and an average increase in rate of 2.4%. As we anticipated, the strength in group demand was partially offset by a decline in transient demand, which was a theme for most of 2016.","The solid group performance in November and early December displaced mid-week transient volume. As a result, transient demand declined 1% in the fourth quarter, while rate increased 80 basis points. We continue to see positive demand growth from leisure business, but that was offset by declines in special corporate demand. For the full year, our transient business was up 1.2% as a result of a 50 basis point increase in demand and a 70 basis point increase in average rate.","The solid fourth quarter group business led to favorable results in food and beverage. While fourth quarter F&B revenues increased less than 1%, profit margins increased 140 basis points. For the full year, F&B revenues increased 1.7% and margins increased 90 basis points.","The margin increase is mostly related to productivity improvements and somewhat to food and beverage cost reductions. Total comparable hotel revenues increased 1.9% for the quarter. The increased group activity, combined with our continued focus on operational improvements, resulted in strong rooms flow-through.","As a result, comparable EBITDA margin grew 65 basis points in the quarter. For the full year, total comparable hotel revenues increased by 2.8% with comparable EBITDA margin growth up 80 basis points.","As I mentioned earlier, we acquired the 277-room Don CeSar resort and its sister property, the 70-unit Beach House Suites in St. Pete Beach for $214 million. The main resort features over 38,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor event space. The Beach House is an all suites property with rooms averaging over 600 square feet. The resort is distinct in historical architecture combined with its unprecedented location on one of the best beaches in the U.S., making it an ideal hotel for leisure, corporate and social groups.","We are acquiring the resort unencumbered by brand and management. We have selected Davidson Hotels & Resorts to operate the property as an independent hotel under the Pivot Hotels collection.","After the completion of a strategic renovation, working with Davidson and utilizing proprietary internal benchmarking and cost saving initiatives, we believe we can materially increase existing performance at the resort. Further, there are several ROI opportunities we did not underwrite that we believe could drive incremental value.","As part of a like kind exchange with the Don, we sold the JW Marriott Desert Springs and Palm Desert, California on January 11 for $172 million which deferred a taxable gain of approximately $65 million. The property was encumbered by a long-term management agreement with Marriott and due for an extensive renovation.","With a RevPAR of less than $140, materially lower than the average of our portfolio, the hotel is projected to require CapEx spending of nearly 9% of total revenues over the next 10 years, and resides in a historically volatile market where airlift is a challenge.","As far as our outlook on the investments front, I think you can expect that we will be a bit more active in 2017 than we were in 2016. If fact, we are working on several other transactions and while we are not ready to announce any deal at this time, we have included an acquisition in our 2017 guidance. Again, we will be prudent in managing our portfolio and disciplined in allocating capital.","You can expect us to only move forward on deals that are accretive to the value of the company. Our focus is on value enhancing growth, not growth for growth sake.","We're also continuing to take an opportunistic approach to dispositions. We're very pleased with the quality and diversification of our portfolio, which we think is the best in the industry. As such, we're comfortable holding our assets unless we can achieve attractive pricing and we will be less likely to engage in a systematic asset sale program.","Having said that, we are open to selling any asset, whether it be iconic or one of our prime suburban properties, if we believe it materially increases shareholder value.","On the CapEx front, the company invested approximately $39 million in the fourth quarter on redevelopment, return on investment and acquisition capital expenditures. Notably, we completed the final phase of the Denver Marriott Tech Center redevelopment and the first phase of a comprehensive renovation project at The Phoenician. As I mentioned at our November Investor Day, the second phase, which includes the public and retail areas, will be renovated in the second half of 2017, during the property's low occupancy off season.","Now let me briefly touch on our outlook for this year. In many ways, we entered 2017 with (16:09) the same uncertainty that we felt at this time last year. Lodging fundamentals continue to decline in 2017, as supply continue to increase, particularly in the major markets, where we have exposure and group booking pace and RevPAR continue to decelerate.","However, the difference this year is that a wave of economic optimism has taken hold in both, the overall stock market and the lodging industry, with promises on material economic policy initiatives from the new administration.","Unfortunately, the turnaround in the stock market and economic sentiment has not yet translated into consistently improved results for our business. Part of this has been the result of continued weakness in corporate business travel, resulting in a negative mix shift with operators, replacing high rated corporate business with lower rated corporate business, such as contract, discount or government.","Given historically high occupancy, in order for RevPAR to reaccelerate, corporate business will have to return and reverse this trend. We are very pleased with our November and December results, which led to performance that was stronger than forecasted.","However, we believe it is too early to determine if that was simply pent-up demand or the start of a more positive long-term trend. Our hope is for the latter, if the new administration can follow through on its proposals for lower taxes, reduced regulation and infrastructure spending. In addition, January was a very strong month driven primarily by the inauguration in D.C., but we are still in a wait and see mindset.","One potential negative offset of the new administration's pursuit of growth policies is an appreciation of the dollar, which could potentially impact international demand to gateway U.S. destinations. We also could face potential demand shortfalls from the negative sentiment surrounding the administration's proposed travel ban.","Another difference between now and 2016 is in our group booking pace. At this time last year, group revenues on the books were stronger than our current levels of up 2%. This is tempering our 2017 outlook. But I would point out that January bookings for 2017 were extremely strong, which we expect to push 2017 group revenue pace to nearly 3%. We have approximately 75% of 2017 group business on our books which is near record levels. And although it is still early, 2018 group revenue pace is looking very strong.","We also should benefit from the tailwinds from less disruption from capital expenditure projects as spending is expected to be lower by 25% this year. Further, we have noted stronger forecast from economists on GDP, consumption, business investment and corporate profits, all of which bode well for our business. All in all, we are looking forward to getting to work in 2017 and producing another solid year of results.","With that, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our performance and 2017 guidance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. We had a very solid quarter and are especially pleased with RevPAR and EBITDA margin, which exceeded our expectations. Six of our 14 identified markets had impressive RevPAR increases ranging from 6.4% to 12%. A common theme for these markets, which included San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., Hawaii, and Chicago was that strong group performance created compression and enabled our managers to increase transient average rate.","San Diego continued to outperform the portfolio and was the top-performing market with RevPAR increasing 12% in the fourth quarter. Occupancy increased 6.5 percentage point and average rate increased 2.8% as a result of strength in both transient and group business. Importantly, our RevPAR results more than doubled the STAR upper upscale market growth of 5.4%.","Our hotels in San Diego benefited from city-wides, good in-house group business and market share gains at the Coronado Island Marriott post renovation. In 2017, we expect our hotels in San Diego to outperform the portfolio. RevPAR at our Phoenix hotels grew 8.3% in the quarter, driven by a 3.1% increase in average rate and a 3.4 percentage point growth in occupancy.","Our hotels' RevPAR increase exceeded the STAR upper upscale results by 420 basis points. Strong group room nights, which increased 12.4% in the quarter enabled our operators to improve transient rate by 4.2%. We expect that our hotels will continue to outperform the portfolio, partially driven by The Camby continuing to ramp up as it becomes comparable in 2017 for reporting purposes.","Our hotels in Los Angeles continue to outperform the portfolio with an 8.1% RevPAR increase in the fourth quarter which has nearly tripled the STAR upper upscale market result of 2.9%. The impressive results were driven by a 5.8% growth in average rates and a 1.7 percentage point increase in occupancy. Group room nights were up 26%, creating compression that allowed our managers to drive transient rate. We expect RevPAR growth at our Los Angeles properties to moderate in 2017, as certain hotels in this market will be negatively impacted by renovation, as well as a weaker group booking pace.","Our properties in D.C. also exceeded our expectations and outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 7.8%. This was driven by an average rate increase of 3.6% and a 290 basis point increase in occupancy. Strong citywide events contributed to a 13.2% increase in group revenues, which provided compression to drive improvement in transient ADR of 4.4%. As we mentioned in the last quarter, city-wides in 2017 continue to look strong for D.C., which should allow the positive dynamics we witnessed in the fourth quarter to carry over into this year.","In fact, January was a fantastic month for D.C., with our hotels' RevPAR increasing approximately 75% from demand generated by the inauguration and the women's march. In addition to the city-wides I mentioned, we see additional demand from ongoing legislative activity and expect our hotels in this market to outperform our portfolio in 2017.","Moving to Hawaii, our assets achieved a RevPAR increase of 7.3% this quarter, significantly beating the STAR upper upscale market growth of 0.4%. These exceptional RevPAR results were driven by robust group business at both our Maui hotels, resulting in a 15.2% increase in group revenue. This created internal compression and drove significant rate increases in both transient and group average rates of 6.7% and 7.9%, respectively.","Over the next several years, the Hawaiian market has the lowest expected supply growth out of the top 20 U.S. markets, which bodes well for future performance. Based on these expectations, as well as strong group revenues on the books for 2017, we expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to outperform our portfolio.","In Chicago, our hotels increased RevPAR by 6.4% in the fourth quarter, with an ADR increase of 3.5% and occupancy gaining 2.1 percentage points. Strong in-house group and citywide room blocks helped the hotels outperform the STAR upper upscale market result by 320 basis points.","Based on the lift we expect from the Chicago Marriott Suites renovation and strong city-wides in the first quarter, we expect our hotels in Chicago to outperform the portfolio in 2017. While those markets have been outperformers in the portfolio, we also have some challenged markets, which partially offset RevPAR increases.","Our hotels in Houston continued to struggle in the fourth quarter, due to persisting weakness in the energy sector, increased new supply, and the fact that there were only four city-wides in the fourth quarter as compared to 13 in the same quarter last year. Collectively, these factors contributed to a decline of more than 14% in the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR for Houston.","While our hotels' RevPAR outperformed the STAR market by more than 9 percentage point, the challenging conditions resulted in a 4.9% decline in our properties' debt. (25:34) Although the city hosted the Super Bowl in February, the same negative fundamentals are anticipated for 2017. So we expect our hotels in Houston to continue to underperform the portfolio. However, keep in mind that our hotels in Houston only account for 2% of our total EBITDA. In fact, a wide geographic diversification means that no single market makes up more than 11% of our EBITDA.","Our hotels in Florida had a RevPAR decline of 4.7% in the fourth quarter. This market has been negatively impacted by weaker group and leisure activity. Occupancy declined 2.7 percentage points and average rate declined almost 1%. We expect our hotels in Florida to continue to be challenged in 2017.","In New York, RevPAR decreased 2.4% in the fourth quarter with an occupancy increase of 60 basis points and an average rate decline of 3.1%. Supply continues to outpace demand, which when combined with lower European travel and tour business due to the strong U.S. dollar continued to negatively impact our operators' ability to drive rate. Based on our outlook for the market, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in New York to continue to decline in 2017.","RevPAR at our hotels in Boston declined 1.3% in the quarter primarily due to a 1.4 percentage point decline in occupancy, offset slightly by a 0.5% increase in average rate. The business transient market in Boston is softening as demand from financial services and pharmaceutical sectors have weakened.","With the possibility of decreased regulations on both sectors from the new administration, we are hoping this trend may reverse moving forward. That, combined with solid group booking and stronger in-house group business, leads us to expect Boston to outperform the portfolio in 2017.","Our consolidated international hotels had a challenging fourth quarter with RevPAR down 9.5%. The decrease was primarily due to the underperformance of our hotels in Brazil. Following the strong third quarter results driven by increased demand around the Olympics, overall demand in Brazil has been weak due to the economic and political issues, as well as increased supply. In constant currency, we anticipate our international property to underperform the overall portfolio in 2017.","Shifting to our European joint venture, the portfolio continued to be negatively impacted by two major macro factors, including the effect of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels and the political and economic uncertainty around Brexit. This led to a RevPAR decline of 1.1% this quarter in constant euro.","Understandably, our hotels in Paris significantly underperformed the portfolio, while those in London, Stockholm, and Berlin outperformed. We expect our hotels to improve in 2017 driven by continued growth in Barcelona and Madrid, and an expected recovery and favorable comparisons in Paris and Brussels.","An important highlight for the quarter and for the year was our impressive EBITDA margin growth. With a RevPAR increase of 1.7% in the fourth quarter, we had EBITDA margin growth of 65 basis points. On a full-year basis, our RevPAR increased 2.7%, resulting in margin expansion of 80 basis points. In addition to decreases in insurance and utility costs attributable to a combination of reduced rate and consumption as a result of our energy ROI, our focus on improving productivity at our hotels over the past few years has resulted in our operators establishing tighter labor model standards and improved and expanded forecasting tools. This has allowed our managers to more effectively schedule labor based on demand and to minimize excess staffing, thereby reducing costs.","We have completed the time and motion studies at most of our largest assets and reaped the benefits in 2016, as evidenced by our outsized margin growth. The good news is that opportunities to derive benefits from additional studies at our medium and small hotels still exist, albeit at savings rates that will be lower than those achieved at our large hotels. With these productivity savings in mind, we expect RevPAR growth at 2% will result in breakeven margins.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 0.7 million shares at an average price of $15.82 for a total purchase price of $11.8 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in April of 2015, we have bought back 52.1 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $894 million. The share repurchase program ended on December 31, 2016, and the board of directors authorized the new program to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock depending on market conditions.","In addition to our share buyback efforts in January, we paid a regular fourth quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special cash dividend of $0.05 per share bringing our total dividend for 2016 to $0.85, which represents a yield of approximately 4.5% on our current stock price.","Over the past 12 months, we have distributed approximately $848 million of capital to our stockholders through cash dividend and stock repurchases. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and the overall REIT space. Importantly, we view this as a key competitive and strategic advantage, which enhances our ability to pay our dividend throughout the lodging cycle and allows us to invest as opportunities arise either by buying assets, buying back stock and reinvesting in high yielding redevelopment and ROI projects.","We continued to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet and ended the fourth quarter with approximately $372 million of cash. We improved our leverage ratio to 2.4 times as calculated under our credit facility and as of year end, had $788 million of available capacity under our revolving credit facility.","Moving to our 2017 guidance, we're cautiously optimistic about 2017 and are prepared for a number of economic scenarios, which leads us to project our 2017 comparable hotel RevPAR range will be flat to up 2%. With the high end of our range at near inflation, we anticipate EBITDA margins to be flat at 2% RevPAR and down 80 basis points if RevPAR growth is flat. This translates to full year adjusted EBITDA range of $1.42 billion to $1.49 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.60 to $1.70.","Keep in mind that the quarterly results will once again be impacted by the Easter and Jewish holiday shift. Easter shifts from the first quarter last year to second quarter this year and the Jewish holidays shift from the fourth quarter in 2016 to the third quarter in 2017. We expect approximately 23.5% of our total EBITDA will be generated in the first quarter.","To help bridge the gap between 2016 adjusted FFO per share of a $1.69 and the 2017 midpoint of $1.65 per share, I think it is worth noting several items. First, assuming a 1% increase in RevPAR and a decline in EBITDA margins of 40 basis points, 2017 adjusted EBITDA will decline by approximately $10 million.","Next, our disposition and acquisition activity will lead to a net decline of approximately $10 million. This includes the loss from operations of the 10 assets we sold in 2016, as well as the JW Desert Springs sale and the acquisitions of the Don CeSar and the unidentified hotel Jim mentioned in his remarks. Also, as we referenced on our third quarter call, the BP oil spill proceeds from last year that will not be fully repeated in 2017 reduces FFO by a net amount of $10 million.","Finally, we are anticipating an increase in interest expense from our floating rate debt, as well as increased taxes due to higher leakage which results in a reduction of approximately $25 million. Offsetting these reductions is a $22 million benefit in outsized EBITDA growth from our non-comp hotels that were under major renovation or repositioning.","In addition, due to our 2016 share buyback activity, our weighted average share count in 2017 is lower. The combination of these factors decreases our 2016 adjusted FFO per share from 2016 to the midpoint of our 2017 guidance by $0.04 to $1.65. Overall, we are pleased with our results this quarter, particularly with the improving profitability of our assets in what continues to be a competitive market.","This includes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Anthony Powell from Barclays.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","First, a clarification on the EBITDA impact of the acquisitions you announced today and the disposition. If you isolate the Don CeSar, JW Marriott and the unidentified deal, what is the EBITDA total change from those three transactions?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Anthony, this is Greg. So I think if you remember from prior conversations last year, obviously, we sold 10 hotels last year for approximately $500 million. And as we talked about, those hotels generated $13 million in 2016 and that will not be replicated in 2017. So that's a minus $13 million. The acquisitions that Jim talked about today, the Don, the unidentified asset and the disposition of Desert Springs, those three things combined results in plus $3 million of EBITDA. So if you take the minus $13 million from the 2016 disposition, combine with the plus $3 million, that gives you the minus $10 million that I talked about in the bridge.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right, that's very helpful. And just going to the overall acquisition and transaction philosophy, Jim, you sold an asset and you're buying two. Are you a net buyer, or seller and how do you approach the leverage at this point in the cycle?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Anthony, I think that's a great question. We are going to be opportunistic and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will look for transactions that create shareholder value. We are not interested in buying assets just for the sake of growth. We underwrite every transaction in a disciplined manner. We underwrite each deal to a 800 basis point increase, plus over our cost of capital and if the right opportunities present themselves, we will pursue them. That goes on the sales side as well.","As I mentioned, we are not implementing a systematic sales program in 2017, but every asset in the portfolio is for sale. If we get an offer that is truly accretive to shareholder value, we're not going to be shy or bashful about pulling the trigger and selling a hotel. So to say today that we're going to be a net buyer or a net seller, I really can't \u2013 I can't give you a definitive answer on that, because I just don't know how the year is going to unfold. I will tell you that we are working on a number of opportunities and if they pencil, we would intend to pursue them, but at this point in time, the only thing I can refer to is the guidance we've given.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question goes to Smedes Rose of Citi.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Jim, you mentioned in your opening remarks the potential fall-off in international visitation, can you remind us what does international visitation comprise out of Host's overall demand at this point?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Smedes. It's roughly 10%. And...","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Portfolio-wide demand?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Pardon.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I'm sorry. So portfolio-wide demand, 10% is driven by international visitation?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Correct","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","That is correct.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","As you realize, Smedes, I mean, certain market \u2013 it varies by market, right. New York certainly would be a market with more demand than 10% and there would be other markets with a lot less than that.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then can I just slip in one more, your acquisition of the Don CeSar, could you talk about, obviously, we can look at the per key, but what sort of EBITDA multiple or cap rate was that and where do you think its stabilizes when you've managed to exploit some of the opportunities you mentioned?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, we think that Don is a terrific acquisition. It's just the kind of asset that works for Host for a lot of reasons. First of all, it is truly iconic, it's on one of the best beaches in America. We were able to buy that asset at a price that puts it in the top 10 on an EBITDA per key basis today within our portfolio as it is. Bringing in Davidson Hotels and implementing a strategic capital plan, as well as using our proprietary internal benchmarking that we have, given our broad resort exposure, we believe is going to allow us to meaningfully increase the net cash-on-cash return and the EBITDA, as if that we're open and operating today. So roughly the going in cap rate is 6.5% to 7%. We think we can meaningfully increase that return over the next several years.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley from Bank of America.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning. Jim, also in the prepared remarks, you mentioned sort of the willingness to kind of move outside of the top, I think you said, 10 to 20 markets. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? That's not really been where many of the public, full service retail have focused, and does this mean we'd expect to see generally smaller transaction sizes versus some of the big flagship Phoenician style group properties that Host has often specialized in the past?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure, Shaun. I think it's \u2013 we're currently operating in the top 10 to 12 markets. We are prepared to look beyond those 10 to 12 markets and to opportunistically acquire assets where the opportunities are. I would point out that The Phoenician was not in one of the top 10 to 12 markets when we made a decision to acquire that asset in mid-2015.","Similarly, the Don really wasn't in one of our top 10 to 12 markets, but we saw opportunity in both of those deals. Our ideal preference would be to acquire bigger, chunkier assets where we can use our scale and our information to add value. That is the focus that we're going to have going forward.","Shaun Clisby Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question goes to Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the guidance, could you just provide a little bit more color on some of the cost savings that you've implemented, I guess, that will occur this year in the back half that they impact next year and some of the offsets that you anticipate? Thanks.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. So I think when I think of business over long periods of time, I think, in the past, I probably would have said that, that breakeven on the margin front would have probably been at 2.5% to 3% RevPAR growth. Obviously, last year was sort of a unique and powerful year with 2.7% RevPAR growth, we are able to achieve 80 basis points in margin growth and some of that is because of the things we talked about, the time, motion studies with some of the bigger hotels, better productivity, some of the benefits we've seen on technology, we've also reduced insurance costs by over 10% and utility costs, because of our energy ROI projects reduced utilities as well.","So, all those things came together to produce, really, I think record level margin growth for us with that level of RevPAR. I think, when I think about 2017, some of those things will still benefit us. We renew our insurance once a year in June and so that double-digit decline in insurance will certainly benefit us for the first six months of 2017. We continue to implement additional energy ROI projects. So even though it's sort of hard today to predict utility cost, I do think we will continue to have benefit from the energy ROI projects that will help us.","And as I mentioned in my remarks, we're still implementing, or we will implement this year some of our best practices from the time, motion studies and we'll start looking at some of our medium size and smaller hotels. So again, there'll be benefits on that front, but just maybe not as much as what we achieved last year.","And so again, I guess, when I think about it, when I think about all those statements in general, I think to have flat RevPAR with 2% RevPAR growth is actually a pretty good outcome. The other thing I'd just mention, it's a technicality, but I think it matters, is that this year, we're comparing to last year, which was a leap year. And so, when we say 2% RevPAR growth, it's really (45:24) 1.7% revenue growth. And so, to end up with flat margins that means that the high-end of our guidance, we're only expecting 1.7% total expense growth.","I think if you look at the midpoint of our guidance with RevPAR growth of 1%, we're only predicting total expense growth to be 1.25%. So again, I think it's going to be a great year with keeping costs growth low, but maybe not quite as great as last year.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful. And then if I could sneak one other follow-up in, maybe I missed this. But maybe if you could provide bit more color on the ROI initiatives that you anticipate at the Don?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. We have a number of identified ROIs that we haven't underwritten, Stephen. And we don't have hard numbers around them right now. I can generally give you a sense of what we're looking at. As an example, we think that there's an ROI if we were to reposition the food and beverage operations. Likewise in the retail space, we think there's an ROI there. We have a parking lot at the Don that may very well have a higher and better use than as a block surface parking lot. We've been able to do that in other instances on the acquisition front that we've done over the years. So those are some of the broad things that we're looking at right now.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I think I would add, and Jim mentioned that earlier today, obviously, we have some of these ROI projects that Jim just mentioned. But also, I think, because we're bringing in Davidson and because our analytics team has looked at this hotel, I think, even without those ROI projects, I think we've identified $3 million, $4 million, up to $5 million of cost savings.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah.","Stephen Grambling - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Thanks so much. Best of luck.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Yeah. Just to get a little more color around \u2013 it sounds like you are shifting more to being acquirer of assets rather than a seller. Are you leading towards more of single assets you mentioned, some example of single asset acquisitions outside the top 10 to 12 markets or more portfolio, or actually even potentially a smaller cap REIT overall, I guess, just to think about how you think about those different options?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think we think about all the options in the same way, Robin. If the transactions are accretive to shareholder value, if they're going to drive growth, profit and value for our shareholders, we will opportunistically pursue them. So it's difficult to really go beyond that at this point in time. I think we're very open-minded, and we are going to evaluate the opportunities as we see them and as they are presented to us.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","So yesterday, there was a little bit of activity from others in the market, and if we think about a REIT that might interest you, maybe before your comments today about looking outside of the top 10 to 12 markets that you're already in, we might have thought there are certain REITs that you wouldn't be interested in. But could it be of interest to you now a REIT that is in maybe some more of those secondary markets than what you've typically looked at?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think it's premature for me to speculate on anything along those lines at this point in time.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, all righty. Thank you very much.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower from Evercore.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. And...","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Rich.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","...sort of along similar line of questioning here. Just with respect to maybe the change in investment strategy and focus, so let's assume that hurdle rates and the spread versus your cost of capital haven't changed over time, can you give us a sense, maybe an example, a post-mortem of sorts of yields that you had looked at in the past, but maybe weren't as attractive under the old regime or the old paradigm that you think maybe would be a good fit under the new paradigm, for instance?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, Rich, that's a good question. And I just want to reiterate that we have a fantastic company here. We have a truly iconic portfolio of hotels, well diversified across the United States. We have scale and flexibility, which gives us the ability to buy larger complex deals. We have unparalleled information and insight based on the portfolio that we have in the proprietary systems we put in place. And we have a strong balance sheet, which we intend to exploit going forward within reason. We're not talking about going beyond our investment grade category. I'm looking to the future and that's where I'm focused right now.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I think that's right. And obviously, as we mentioned today, and as Jim has already mentioned, right, that Don is a great example of an asset that's outside of the top 10, 12 markets, the Phoenician was too. In fact, both of those hotels are resorts and as you know, Rich, the nice thing about resorts when you look at supply growth over the next three years, supply growth in the resort segment is half a percent or less. So obviously, sort of very compelling to us.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Yeah. Just two questions on RevPAR. First, just a clarification, you said that January RevPAR growth was very strong. Can you actually quantify it? And then second, just on the fourth quarter transient result, you said there have been some transient weakness, was that just a result of group replacing it, or \u2013 so higher-quality business replacing it or was that some corporate demand weakness as well? Thanks.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Thomas. This is Greg. So obviously, we had a fantastic January for a number of reasons, but primarily because one of our largest markets for us is D.C., and D.C. had really a spectacular January. And so for us, our January RevPAR was north of 7%. So a great way to start off the year. I mean, that certainly beat our internal expectations and it certainly beat our managers' expectations for our portfolio. So that is a great way to start out the year.","I think, when we were talking about some of that weakness in transient, I think what we were talking about, you've seen it \u2013 we witnessed this all of last year is, all of the companies including Host, we're really in a sort of record occupancy levels, we know leisure business has been very strong on the transient side, group business has been very strong, but the one customer that has been a little bit weaker is the corporate, the corporate transient customer. And so, we saw some of that weakness in October, certainly, in fact, in October of last year, we actually missed our forecast because of that. I think the good news from our perspective is after the election, both November and December were very strong for us, primarily, because the group business and some of that group business, as you mentioned, probably did display some of the transient customer, but both of those months were strong. And as Jim mentioned in his comments and as I just mentioned, January was much better than our original forecast as well.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Helpful.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","The other thing that's been interesting for us is just the bookings and we've talked about that a little bit. But again, when we looked at the bookings in November for 2017, they were very strong. Unfortunately, in December, when we looked at group bookings for 2017, they were weaker. So that was sort of the inconsistency that we were talking about in the comment. But again, if you fast forward to January, the bookings, the group bookings in January for 2017 were extremely strong. And that's one of the reasons why our group revenues started the year up just over 2%. As we sit here today, our group revenues on our books are up closer to 3%.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Yeah, good morning, everyone.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sticking with that corporate travel, what level of demand do you need to see from that customer in order to get that up-mix at the hotel?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","What's interesting about it, as I mentioned, right, our group business has been good, the leisure segment of transient has been strong. Obviously, in 2016, the weak segment is this corporate business traveler that we're talking about. But what's happened is, if you look at the average rate for that traveler, our highest rated customer and compare that to special corporate discount, there is a big rate delta there, right, between our highest rated customer and special corporate, it's about a $60 delta between our highest rated customer and our discounted segment, it's about \u2013 it's approximately a $100 discount. And so, what happened in 2016 is, even though it was very easy for Host and other lodging companies to replace that customer with other forms of business, whether it was government business, contract business, or group business, there was sort of a negative mix shift that was occurring while we were replacing our highest rated customer with the lower rated customer, and so that put pressure on rates.","I think what \u2013 not to get too optimistic about 2017, but what's interesting is, if we can get that customer back in 2017 and if we can have this, a positive mix shift, I think that could be a pretty, powerful thing for 2017.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","So maybe if that customer grows faster than the supply growth around 3%, should be able to get that mix?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. No. I think, look at, we already have strong occupancy. So I think if we can get customer back, I think even with the supply growth in 2017, that would look really good.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","And one other thing. Look, we're speculating on that today. It's hard to know if that customer is coming back. I do think there are a couple of metrics that we always look at that that again if they come true for 2017 will be useful for us, right. One thing we always look at is business investment and if you look at the business investment stat for 2017 compared to 2016, they are up about 350 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Same thing for corporate profits, right, corporate profits declined in 2016 and they are expected to be up over 5% in 2017. So again, on a relative basis, that could be meaningful for 2017.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think the way I would describe it is cautious optimism at this point. The forecasts are looking great, but we haven't seen it borne (57:04) on the numbers just yet.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And that's something you wait to bake in the guidance at a later point if it does occur. Did you kind of bake in in the status quo right now?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. Correct.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Correct.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Greg, I guess a question for you. I want to dig in a little bit on the non-comparable hotels, is that, I think you did a $150 million of EBTIDA in 2016 which is ahead of your initial guidance. I think you're saying, $148 million to $154 million this year. But is there \u2013 is that \u2013 I guess, how much surprise does there tend to be in the year on those non-comparable hotel results?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","So the non-comp \u2013 you are referring to, when I mentioned that our non-comp hotels, we're expecting the EBITDA to increase by $22 million in 2017, is that what you are referring to?","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, right.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think that \u2013 I think those just like any forecast, sometimes, you can beat it, sometimes, you miss it by a touch, but I think those are good forecasts. I think what's interesting about it, if you look at some of the hotels in the non-comps that, for instance, Denver Tech, and the Hyatt in San Francisco, is both of those hotels are in, what I would consider, sort of weaker markets for us this year. But because there was so much disruption last year, I think both of those hotels, Denver Tech looks fantastic, and sort of the San Francisco Hyatt, I think both of those hotels should have very strong EBITDA growth in 2017. And then, the other hotel that we're benefiting from in the non-comp set is our San Diego Marriott. The meeting space there looks outstanding, groups love the meeting space. They are booking that hotel in a very aggressive manner right now. And so, when I think about those \u2013 the hotels in the non-comp set, I think I feel very confident with that $22 million.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, that's great. And just follow up on the prior, I guess, question about group and tie \u2013 tie and group \u2013 try to tie the group and transient conversation up. Do you think \u2013 do you have enough capacity kind of left in 2017 in terms of \u2013 I know there was talk last year of grouping up a little bit. I mean, do you think you have enough space left during peak periods of 2017 or is some of that already consumed by group?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I mean, look, some of it is consumed, right. I mean, as Jim mentioned, if we look at our group business today for 2017, I mean, we have over 75% of that booked today, but I still think it can be important going forward that the bookings in the year, for the year are strong. I mean, if you look back to our comments about January, right, in one month, we improved our group revenue pace for the full year from up 2%, up 3%. So those group bookings in the quarter sort of in the year, for the year are still important.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","The other thing I would add, Chris, is, while group is strong, we're hopeful that as the special corporate customer comes back, that we can see positive rate shift as opposed to negative, like we saw last year.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sure. Understood, very good. Thanks, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just one quick housekeeping question. The $22 million in uplift from the non-comp hotels, is that apples and oranges with what was in the non-comp set in 2016 versus what will be in the non-comp set in 2017, because the $150 million going to $148 million to $154 million doesn't add up?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, our non-comp set that \u2013 two of our hotels that we performed work on in 2015, The Logan and The Camby, are now in our comp set, right. And so, when I think about the non-comp growth of $22 million, it excludes Logan and Camby. However, when I think about those two hotels as we mentioned last year, they're still ramping up, right. So those two hotels combined are going to produce RevPAR growth of close to $8 million and in EBITDA.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Your customer, especially at resorts, have you seen any change in demand or booking patterns from this customer, given the high levels of consumer confidence, then also maybe due to the brands' initiatives to book direct and book more prepaid rates earlier?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I think you broke out. We didn't hear the beginning of that question, sorry.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On the leisure customer, have you seen any change in demand or booking patterns given the high levels of consumer confidence today? And then any impact from the brands' booking initiatives trying to get customers to book sooner and maybe some prepaid rates earlier?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","We haven't \u2013 as Jim mentioned, we really \u2013 we have some reasons to be cautiously optimistic for 2017. But we really \u2013 leisure was obviously a strong segment in 2016, so far it's been strong in 2017, but we haven't seen a material increase in that at this point.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","And then just lastly circling back to scale and your comments about leveraging the platform, but you said G&A to come down as a percentage of assets, as you potentially acquire more or is there an opportunity to scale that number down ahead of any potential growth opportunities?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Michael, I think that we're just a little early in the year to address G&A. I will tell you that we're focused on how we can take what is a terrific organization and make it better and make it more nimble and more efficient. We've already undertaken a few steps early in the year by \u2013 the most prominent one to allow us to become more nimble and more efficient is to form the enterprise analytics group where we moved business intelligence, feasibility, CapEx and our corporate financial model under one individual, who is now reporting to Greg. And as we think about the organization going forward, as I have an opportunity to talk to our various stakeholders, we will just have to wait and see how the year turns out.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I agree with that and I also agree with the concept that as we buy hotels, the G&A as a percentage of our hotels and revenues will go lower. I mean, obviously, if you think about the acquisition of the Don, or this unidentified asset that Jim just mentioned, I mean, obviously, we're not going to have to hire anybody else based on those two acquisitions.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","That's correct, absolutely.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Makes sense. Thanks for the comments.","James F.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, April. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2013. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter results, including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we'll be available to respond to your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to remind everyone that at the beginning of this year, we adopted calendar quarter reporting periods and to enable investors to better evaluate our performance, we have presented 2012 RevPAR and certain historical results on a calendar quarter basis we call the 2012 as-adjusted-results. The following discussion of quarterly and year-to-date operating performance will include a comparison between the 3 months and 6 months of operations ended June 30. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another solid quarter of operating results, which were driven by strong rate growth and improvement in both transient and group demand. Strong F&D and other revenue growth combined with improved flow-through led to earnings results that exceeded consensus estimates. We continue to feel good about the fundamentals in the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","Let's review our results for the quarter. Our comparable hotel RevPAR for the second quarter increased 6.1% to $163 driven by an average rate improvement of 4.5% combined with an occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage points. This increase exceeded starts total U.S. industry RevPAR by 110 basis points. Our comparable average rate was $204. And our average occupancy was nearly 80%, our highest occupancy level since the third quarter of 2000. Comparable hotel food and beverage revenue grew 6.6% as banquet and AV rental increased by nearly 8%. And outlet revenue improved by more than 4.5%. Total comparable revenue growth for the quarter was 6.3%.","Excellent flow-through across all departments led to 180-basis-point improvement in our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter, resulting in adjusted EBITDA of $431 million, a 23% increase over the prior year. Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.45 in the second quarter, an increase of more than 36%. On a year-to-date basis, comparable revenues grew 4.5% as hotel RevPAR increased 5.7% and F&B revenues increased by 3%. Operating profit margins increased 140 basis points, resulting in a year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $714 million. This represented an increase of more than 17.5% and generated adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.73, which exceeds last year's total by 28%.","Overall, we are extremely pleased with our bottom line adjusted EBITDA and FFO growth. While our room revenue growth was slightly impacted by weaker short-term bookings, as well as some unique circumstances in a couple of markets, this was more than offset by our F&B and ancillary income growth, which was above expectations. This overall strength in revenue growth, combined with very strong margins, resulted in a very good quarter.","The key driver of our second quarter results was solid increases in demand combined with strong increases in our average rates across all segments of our business. Both our group and transient segments saw demand increases of roughly 2.5% and rate increases of more than 3.5%. Overall, for the quarter, transient revenues were up 6.4% and group revenues increased 6.2%. As a result, our portfolio easily surpassed the industry-wide performance for the quarter.","As we discussed in May, the timing of the Easter holiday significantly affected both Q1 and Q2 comparisons and segment trends. As a result, examining the segment performance for the first half of the year may yield better insights from several perspectives. All segments benefited from mix shift as our highest-priced transient demand increased by nearly 9%, and our high-priced corporate demand increased by over 7%. Conversely, our lowest priced business, discount group and contract, decreased by more than 10%.","While government business represents just 6% of our overall room nights, we experienced meaningful declines during the first half. Government group was off roughly 35% and transient declined 4%. Excluding the government group business, our overall group demand was roughly flat to last year, but up more than 2.5% in rate. And 2013 rates now exceed 2007 levels. As in the first quarter, our near-term group bookings continue to fall slightly short of last year's levels.","Transient demand for the year exceeds 2012 base by approximately 3.5% and ADR is also up 4%. Our transient segment has also outpaced the industry-wide growth for the second quarter. Overall, while we could have expected a stronger contribution from our group segment, we have been pleased with the strength and price of our transient demand. We're also pleased with the strength of our higher-priced group segments as the weakness in demand has been largely focused in the lower rated discount segment. As we look at the remainder of 2013, we expect the group will be weak in the third quarter, as the middle of the quarter tends to be more influenced by discount business and a few events, such as the presidential nominating convention, will not repeat this year. However, our advanced transient bookings continue to look quite solid. Fourth quarter group bookings continue to be quite strong, both in demand and in rate. Looking out further into 2014, both group room nights and rate continue to tread ahead of last year.","On the investment front, as we reported in June, we acquired the fee-simple interest in the 426-room Hyatt Place Waikiki Beach in Honolulu for $138.5 million. The hotel underwent a $45 million renovation in 2012 and was converted to a Hyatt Place. It is located approximately a block from Waikiki Beach and from the destination shopping and entertainment districts. Overall, the Waikiki market is a high demand leisure market that is experiencing occupancy rates that run north of 85%. Most of the competitive inventory resides on lease plans. And there are higher barriers to entry for future development. So we are excited to add this hotel in Hawaii to our portfolio. We have an active pipeline at this juncture, and hope to complete additional investments before year-end. But given that the timing in certain of these transactions is hard to predict, we have not included any additional acquisitions in our forecast.","On the disposition front, as we announced last month, we sold the Ritz-Carlton, San Francisco for $161 million or approximately $479,000 per key, which represents the highest price paid for a hotel in San Francisco in the last 5 years. We are actively marketing several assets and anticipate completing between $100 million to $150 million in sales before year-end, which is reflected in our guidance.","Turning to capital investments, we invested $26 million in redevelopment and return on investment projects in the second quarter as we completed the lobby great room renovation at the Philadelphia Airport, Marriott, as well as the restaurant and bar renovation at the Hyatt Regency Reston. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $100 million on redevelopment and ROI projects.","We spent approximately $7 million on acquisition projects this quarter. We've completed the renovation of all 1,625 guestrooms at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego. And later this year, we will begin renovation on approximately 100,000 square feet of ballroom and meeting space at this hotel. For the full year, we expect to spend $35 million to $45 million in total on these projects.","In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $76 million in the second quarter and expect to spend $280 million to $300 million for the full year. Projects during the quarter included room renovations at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and a lobby renovation at the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley.","Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we have outlined today, we had a great quarter with solid rate growth and increases in food and beverage revenue, which generated exceptional margin performance. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect industry fundamentals to remain favorable. And supply growth will remain low. We expect the transient demand will remain robust, but the short-term group will continue to be slightly weaker than last year. With these trends in mind, we are tightening the range of our guidance, forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $1.290 billion to $1.315 billion and adjusted FFO of $1.28 to $1.32 per share. We now project the comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase between 5.5% and 6.25%. Our year-to-date margin performance gives us confidence to raise our margin guidance to an increase of 100 to 120 basis points for the year.","Looking at our dividend, we increased our second quarter common dividend to $0.11 per share. Dividends for the remainder of the year will depend on operating results and gains generated by asset sales.","In summary, I'm pleased with our second quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of this year and into 2014. We expect the fundamentals in our business will remain strong. And with low supply growth, we will continue to deliver meaningful growth. Thank you. And now, let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Houston continued its strong growth, and was our top-performing market for the quarter with RevPAR gains of 16.1%. Occupancy improved 70 basis points. And ADR improved 15% due to the strategies implemented at the end of last year to shift out lower-rated contracting group business while pressing for aggressive special corporate rate increases. We expect Houston to continue with robust first half growth trends, as solid group and transient demand will continue to facilitate a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments.","Likewise, our Seattle hotels had another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 14.5%, driven by a 3.8 percentage point increase in occupancy and an improvement in ADR of 9%. Strengths in both group and transient bookings allowed our hotels to drive rate. As in Houston, we expect our Seattle hotels to have a good third quarter due to a solid group base on the books and strong transient demand, creating compressions that will drive group and transient ADR.","Our Atlanta hotels also performed well in the quarter with RevPAR up 11.4% as ADR increased 7.8% and occupancy increased 2.3 percentage points. The increase in rate was primarily driven by the NCAA Final 4 in early April. We expect our hotels to continue to outperform in the third quarter due to a strong citywide calendar.","Moving out West. As a result of driving rate, RevPAR at our San Francisco hotels increased 11.2%. Although occupancy decreased 1.2 percentage points, ADR increased at a very healthy 12.8%. This rate increase was mainly driven by business mix shift from contracts to higher-rated transient and group business, as well as the San Francisco Marriott Marquis taking advantage of a successful rooms renovation by increasing its rates. With continued high transient demand, we expect our San Francisco hotels will see strong results in the third quarter.","Looking to Chicago. Our hotels there increased RevPAR by 10.9% with occupancy improving 1.7 percentage points and ADR increasing 8.6%. The strong performance was boosted by healthy citywide demand in May and June. Substantial group business provided the downtown hotel with the opportunity to yield much higher transient ADR while reducing low-rated discount channels. Further, F&B revenues were up 17.6% with the downtown Chicago hotels as increased group demand translated into excellent catering business. As we look forward into the third quarter, we expect our Chicago hotels to continue to outperform.","In Los Angeles, our hotels saw RevPAR increase 8.8% on occupancy growth of 60 basis points and ADR growth of 8%. All hotels in this market had significant rate growth with transient business standing out in particular. We believe that Los Angeles should also experience third quarter, solid third quarter as transient demand strength persists.","Although there has been well-documented supply growth in New York, our hotels RevPAR increased 5.7% with a mix of occupancy growth of 3.8 percentage points and an ADR improvement of 1.4%. New York's inability to compress rates has been due to the substantial amounts of new supply. However, our hotels have performed better than the New York market in the face of this temporary adversity as we continue to work with our operators to ensure we are maximizing operations. We believe the third quarter should continue to hold up relatively well when compared to the New York market.","As a result of citywide weakness and cancellations related to the Boston Marathon bombing, RevPAR for our Boston hotels underperformed our portfolio in the second quarter. Occupancy increased 1.3 percentage points and ADR, 70 basis points, resulting in a 2.2% increase in RevPAR. In-house group sales have materialized at the pace we had anticipated, but we expect our Boston properties to improve in the third quarter. Having said that, these hotels will likely continue to underperform the rest of our portfolio.","It is not a secret to anyone listening in on this call that our Washington, D.C. hotels continue to struggle in the second quarter due to weakness in government and government-related travel stemming from the sequester. However, we did see a slight increase in RevPAR of 30 basis points resulting from growth in ADR of 40 basis points, offset by an occupancy decrease of 10 basis points. Our hotels in the central business district outperformed the hotels in the suburbs. RevPAR for our Hyatt Capitol Hill and our non-comp Grand Hyatt Washington increased nearly 6% on a combined basis. Given the continued weakness in government travel, we expect our hotels in DC to underperform the portfolio in the third quarter.","Although our hotels in Latin America have significantly outperformed in the past 2 years, these hotels have struggled in the second quarter. The extensive renovations at our JW Marriott Mexico City and the political unrest in Brazil contributed to our RevPAR decline of 10% in the second quarter. Despite the civil unrest during the Confederations Cup soccer tournament and uncertainty surrounding government policies negatively affecting Brazil, the JW Marriott Rio's RevPAR only decreased 4.4% on local currency. However, our 2 properties in Chile declined 13% in local currency due to the unrest in Brazil, coupled with the reduction in trade with China and the slowing demand for copper. In addition to the political and economic issues surrounding our Latin America hotels, JW Marriott Mexico City has been under extensive renovations in nearly all public areas and guestrooms. The renovations are expected to be completed in the third quarter.","The devastating floods in Alberta, Canada in late June forced the Calgary Marriott to evacuate its guests. And it was closed for 9 days. Even with the closure in June, our Calgary Marriott posted positive RevPAR results of 3.6% in local currency in the second quarter, but the hotel underperformed our forecast by almost 17 percentage points. The timing of the floods could not have been worse for that area as it impacted both the second and third quarters, including Calgary's largest event, the Calgary Stampede. It's an annual event that begins in early July and runs for 10 days. Hotels during this time are usually sold out at very high rate. But due to the flood, out-of-town demand significantly decreased. Therefore, we expect the Calgary Marriott will underperform in the third quarter.","Despite the continued overall weakness in the eurozone economies, less citywide events and weaker trade fair demand, the pro forma RevPAR for the 19 hotels in our European joint venture, which includes the 5-hotel portfolio acquired in 2012, increased 3.9% for the quarter in constant euros. ADR improved 1.9%. And occupancy was up 1.6 percentage points. The ADR improvement was mainly due to an increase in higher-rated corporate group bookings, which allows the hotels to yield higher transient rates. The best-performing hotels in the quarter were Courtyard La Defense, Marriott Rive Gauche and Pullman Paris Bercy, as all 3 benefited from the air show in Paris in the second quarter. In addition, the Westin Europa & Regina also outperformed, primarily as a result of high-rated incentive and corporate group business. Sheraton Warsaw, Sheraton Skyline and Le M\u00e9ridien Nuremberg underperformed this past quarter due to less citywide events and weaker trade fair demand. We remain cautiously optimistic about the third quarter for our European hotels. We expect to see some occupancy increasing while ADR will likely decrease due to the inflated rates during the London Olympics last year.","One additional item to note. We've successfully refinanced the mortgage loans secured by our portfolio of 5 properties in the European joint venture during the quarter. In the connection with the refinancing, the joint venture reduced the outstanding principal amount of the mortgage loan by EUR 95 million to EUR 242 million. Our portion of this reduction was EUR 37 million, which was funded through a draw on our credit facility. The new loan carries a 3-year term with a 1-year extension and bears interests at an initial all-in rate of 4.5%.","For the quarter, comparable hotel adjusted operating margins increased 180 basis points. Margin growth benefited from 75% of the RevPAR growth being driven by improvements in ADR. Also helping the improvement in margin was a 6.6% increase in food and beverage revenues with F&B profit growth of 15.5%. The F&B profit increase was due to the positive mix shift to banquet and AV sales, as well as a solid catering contribution. Strong group demand, which led to group revenue growth of 6.2%, further contributed to the increase of F&B. We also saw that corporate group business was particularly healthy throughout the quarter and association group business primarily benefited from the shift of the Easter holiday into the first quarter. Support costs, which include G&A, repairs and maintenance, sales and marketing and utilities, increased slightly less than 1%.","Looking to the rest of the year, we expect RevPAR will continue to be driven primarily by rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through. However, we are not forecasting F&B and other revenues to increase at the same pace as the second quarter. We expect support cost to increase slightly for the remainder of the year. And we forecast that utility rates will likely increase. We should also note that we've successfully completed the process of renewing our property insurance program, which translates into insurance cost increasing at about inflation for the next 12 months. As a result of the items I have just outlined, we believe full year comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin should increase 100 basis points at the low end of the range and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range. At this point, we are forecasting that roughly 20% to 21% of our full year EBITDA will be earned in the third quarter.","Moving to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid or redeemed $846 million of debt with an average interest rate of 7.2%, which was funded through the issuance of $400 million of 3.75% Series B senior notes and available cash. Since the beginning of 2012, we have reduced our total debt by $1 billion, decreased our weighted average interest rate of 5% and extended the weighted average debt maturities to 5.6 years. We have significantly improved our credit statistics, including decreasing our leverage ratio. As of June 30, 2013, we have approximately $393 million of cash, $798 million of available capacity under the credit facility. In the quarter, we issued 4.8 million shares of common stocks at an average price of $18.31 per share for net proceeds of approximately $87 million through our at-the-market program. The proceeds were used to fund a portion of our Hyatt Waikiki acquisition. Additional issuances will be based on the level of acquisition and disposition opportunities and the level of our stock price.","In summary, it was a successful quarter, highlighted by strong margin growth, driven by increases in RevPAR outperformance, especially in the markets such as Houston, Seattle, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles. We completed a complex refinancing for our European joint venture, and we continue to work to improve our industry-leading investment-grade balance sheet. This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll hear from Joshua Attie of Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You highlighted that food and beverage and audiovisual revenue was a strong contributor to profitability. And I think you also said that you don't expect that to continue. Can you just talk about what were the drivers of that growth in the second quarter? Were they a couple of large meetings? And can you provide some commentary on why it's not sustainable or why you don't think it's the start of a broader trend?","W. Edward Walter","Well, Josh, I think that the primary driver of the strong performance in food and beverage in the second quarter was the strong level of group that we had in that quarter. Our group room rates were up about 2.5%. And that obviously contributes to better F&B performance. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our banquets and AV revenue were up about 8%, which is really -- we didn't quite research this, but my sense is that's probably the best we've seen over the course of this recovery. On the other hand, because we also had some expansion on the transient side, our outlets did quite well, too. And that's been an area of focus over the last couple of years. So we were pleased to see that. Now as it relates to the second half of the year, here's how I would probably explain this. Our first half of the year, if you combine the first 2 quarters, food and beverage growth was about 3%. Now one of the things to remember is that 3% doesn't take into account the fact that last year had an extra day because of the leap year. If you adjust for that, food and beverage growth in the first half of the year was really more like 3.5%. As we look at the second half of the year, consistent with my comments, we see weaker business, group business in the third quarter and stronger group business in the fourth quarter. We would assume that food and beverage would probably -- performance would track those trends. We're estimating in our guidance that food and beverage could range from 2.5% to 3.5%. The midpoint of that is obviously 3%. So that would suggest that we'd be about equal with what we achieved in the first half of the year. But I wouldn't really rule out the fact that we could do better in the second half of the year than we did in the first. I wouldn't be expecting to do as well as we did in the second quarter. But if you compare the halves, I think there's an opportunity for upside. But as we commented in the past, food and beverage is notoriously difficult to predict. And consequently, we've gone with what we think is the realistic but hopefully conservative estimate.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And sort of a related question, your occupancy for the portfolio is running pretty high at close to 80% and that's even with group being slower. I know it was good in the second quarter, but generally your occupancy was pretty high and that's with even kind of weaker group. So you've been able to replace it with other segments. Can you kind of remind us what is group on a full year basis today versus what you think it should be at this point in the cycle? And then I don't know if you have this number handy, but can you kind of help us think about what's kind of the profit opportunity of closing that gap, of remixing toward greater group? And how much incremental profits do you think you can get just from that remixing from having greater food and beverage and ancillary revenue?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I don't know that we can really respond to the second part of your question other than we would obviously expect that as we close the gap on the group side that it's because that will help both with food and beverage revenue, as well as with driving better transient pricing because we will essentially shrunk the hotels. We would certainly expect that, that would be higher. To put where we are into context on group, at this point, as we've talked before, in the downturn, we lost about 19% of our group room nights overall. And at this stage, we're running about 9% or so behind where we were in 2007. So broadly speaking, over the course of the recovery so far, we've closed about half of the gap that developed in the 2008 and 2009 downturn. So obviously as we -- we're already back to the occupancy level that we had in 2007. So part of what would be happening as we continue to add group in future years is you'd be expecting both the prices on that group would go up. And as I mentioned in my comments, our pricing on group this quarter was already above where we were in '07. But that pricing should continue to improve. And just as importantly, transient pricing should also begin to accelerate further.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Felicia Hendrix of Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ed, your quarter and the outlook were relatively more optimistic than your peers. So you've already reported in general and on group even though that you've hedged some of the strength that you're seeing in group in your comment. Just wondering if you could talk us through what some of the differences are here?","W. Edward Walter","Well, I think as it relates to the quarter what I'd like to think is it's a combination of us being -- earning the right assets in the right markets. Combined with the fact that, as we've commented previously, we've invested a fair amount of money in our hotels over the last 3 to 4 years. And we were expecting to begin to reap the benefits of that this year as our construction spending declines a bit. And therefore, we had less business interruption. So I think that's, in some ways, if I were look at the primary driver of it, it really ties into the fact that it's the right assets in the right condition and the right market.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Are you marketing to groups perhaps differently than your peers are?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we would necessarily assume that. I mean, it depends on which peers we're talking about, of course. I mean, to the extent of the peers share the same operators that we do. I don't know that we would be marketing any differently to those groups. We have -- I think that part of this, again, ties back into some of the capital investments we've made. We have tried to wherever we could create more flexibility in our meeting space platforms. So as trends ebb and flow relative to the size of groups and the frequency of groups, we're in the best position possible to be able to track that business.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And your answer actually is a good segue to my next question, which really is that you'd still have a fair amount of properties under renovation. So how should we think about the RevPAR impact of those as they roll off?","W. Edward Walter","Well, certainly, as we continue -- as we work our way through this cycle as a particular hotel has been renovated, I would expect that you'd see better performance in the following year, both because the disruption; and secondarily, because we would have made the property better. Yes, if I were to look at this year though in the context of what we would call maintenance CapEx, we're talking about a range of $280 million to $300 million for this year. So that to me is a level that we would generally expect to sustain going forward. So -- and it could drop down in a particular year. But the reality is that, that's probably a relatively -- that would be what I would expect we would need to spend.","Operator","Joe Greff, JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With regard to the non-room revenue performance in the second quarter, was there a noticeable divergence in performance between April and then May and June?","W. Edward Walter","I think April was stronger in general, but in part because there was probably some better spending as it related to some of the group events in golf and spa and things like that. But a lot of the improvement that we saw in the first half of the year in other revenue was probably most affected by the fact that we're getting the benefit of the new retail deal that we have at the Marquis, which, of course, has significantly increased the rent that we are paid relative to the retail there. And that would apply across the quarter. That wouldn't be specific once a month.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And Greg, looking at the weighted average diluted share count contemplated in the guidance, it looks like -- you contemplated within the guidance additional ATM proceeds. Is that correct? And roughly how much do you have in there?","Gregory J. Larson","That is correct. In our forecast, if you look at it for the rest of the year, we're forecasting that we'll issue another 5 million shares for the rest of the year. But of course, as we've said in our comments, that's all really going to depend -- it depends on our outlook for acquisition. It clearly depends on our outlook for dispositions. And certainly, it also depends on our stock price. So look, that number could vary, but that's what we have in our forecast.","Operator","And next, we'll move on to Ryan Meliker of MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Obviously, group has been kind of the big topic this week with regards to earnings in the lodging space. You gave us some good color on the quarter. Can you put some numbers behind where your group pace is looking for the rest of the year? I know you said that you're looking weak in 3Q and strong in 4Q. Last quarter, I think you had said that demand was pacing up 3%, and revenue up 6% for the year. How much is that falling off now?","W. Edward Walter","I'm not certain it was quite that high as the last call. I think the numbers were a little bit lower than that, to be honest. But what I would tell you is that at this point for the year, we would be expecting that -- as we look at the second half of the year, I think we're going to find that room nights are probably about flat, but that we've got a pretty solid rate increase for the second half of the year. So we would expect revenues to be up, call it, 3% to 3.5%, but the room night element of it to be roughly flat. I think if you go back to look at where we were at the end of the first quarter, I think we were looking there -- we probably were thinking for the remainder of the year, we were higher. But that, of course, included what we knew was going to be a very strong second quarter. So that might be what you were remembering.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Sure, that makes sense. And then do you feel like you guys have any material mix shift left in the portfolio that can help boost RevPAR without necessarily seeing like-for-like demand or like-for-like rates moving on it?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I think we do. We're still at a point where despite the fact that we've had, say, just to stick with group for a second, despite the fact that we had really strong corporate group improvement in the second quarter and in the first half of the year, we've only recovered about half of the decline that we saw in that area from '07 to '09. So I would really expect that as we continue to see the economy recover, and in our minds more importantly as we continue to see employment recover, that we will see continued growth in corporate group. And that will displace the discount group that we had taken in when that number had -- when the corporate group had declined. When you switch up to transient, certainly, what we're going to be attempting to do over the course of the next few years is continuing to try to drive all of our transient business into higher-priced segments. And so I would expect that we would see a continued mix shift. I'd also expect to see continued increases in rate within segments, too.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then one last question, your margin assumptions for the back half of the year imply pretty material deceleration for the front half. I know 2Q was really strong in terms of margins. But is there anything else going on in the back half of the year that's going to limit margins? I know, Greg, you mentioned utilities being higher and lower F&B revenues in the back half of the year, and group not being quite as strong. Was there anything else we should think about that might limit margins?","W. Edward Walter","No. I think that, yes, when we looked across the board, most of the difference relates to the fact that -- and I mentioned previously that we were benefiting in the first half of the year from the significant increase in rental that we were receiving relative to the retail project on the Marquis. We began to receive that increased rental in the third quarter of last year. So when we -- as we look at the second half of the year, we're generally expecting lower levels of other income than what we saw in the first half of the year in terms of -- or lower levels of growth in other income compared to what we saw in the first half of the year. And that's a primary driver because of that. On the food and beverage side, we have been both, I think, trying to be conservative relative to the level of revenue. We've also been conservative relative to the level of flow-through on that revenue. So that makes the difference. And then as Greg mentioned, we've been pleased to see utility expenses down in the first half of the year. We have forecast modest increases for the second half. I'll be honest. That's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen because it's not -- it's both rate and how hot or cold it is. So both of those have an effect. So I think we've gone with a more conservative estimate there. But that could turn out differently. So I don't know that there's -- certainly, we're incredibly pleased with how well we did in Q2. And we're going to strive our best to try to continue that type of success. But we didn't -- we're not going to predict that it's going to stay that strong for the second half.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from David Loeb of Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Could you give us a little color on your return expectations for Waikiki and what kind of cap rate you achieved in the sale of the Ritz-Carlton San Francisco?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. Our return expectations for Waikiki would to be -- we think we're going to generate a fairly significant premium to our cost of capital. And I think in terms of unlevered ROI, we'll be expecting to be in the 9.5 to 10 range for that asset. And then, Greg, what have we ended up -- what have we disclosed relative to the Ritz?","Gregory J. Larson","The Ritz, look, I think the cap rate, David, on the Hyatt property was north of 6%. And I'd say on the Ritz, it was probably the cap rate was half that.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's a nice spread. Ed, to follow up on the renovation question. You have finished some major projects. You've really put the portfolio in a very good position. Are you seeing -- do you think you're seeing some RevPAR tailwinds now from those renovations? And how long do you think those continue?","W. Edward Walter","I think we are seeing some tailwinds from that. And I think that would account for the outperformance in the second quarter. I would expect that, that should continue through the year, to be honest.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And can you comment a little bit on transaction markets in Europe and Australia? Do you see portfolio deals coming together? Is there financing for that? Is there a lot of competition for assets in those markets?","W. Edward Walter","There's more -- speaking of Europe first, we're not -- I haven't really seen much in the way of portfolio transactions there or at least one set had a realistic chance of happening. There were a few portfolios that were on the market because there were some challenging financial circumstances, but it does not look as if it was possible for anyone to structure a deal that would work, that would appease the lender. So generally, what we're looking at there is more single-asset transactions. And we are certainly looking at a couple of transactions over there right now. In Australia, I'm aware of 1, maybe 2 smaller portfolios that are on the market. But our sense is that those portfolios will probably end up being broken up and sold in 1s and 2s as opposed to in 5s and 6s. The market there is fairly healthy and fairly rational, which is good to see. And while we have some concern in Australia about the impact of lower demand for commodities, overall, we still feel pretty good about economic growth in Australia. So that continues to be a market we are interested in acquiring in.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And one final housekeeping. Was there any onetime charge related to severance with Larry's departure?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. There was -- there would be a normal severance charge related to that, which is incorporated in our...","Gregory J. Larson","Corporate expense.","W. Edward Walter","Corporate expenses for the second quarter.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions here. Ed, can you just remind us, is group, what, 40% of your total demand? Is that a fair number?","W. Edward Walter","Just a little bit less than that, Bill. I say right now, we would probably expect on a full year basis, it's about 37%. But you're right, in the past, it had been more along the lines of 40% to 41%.","Gregory J. Larson","And I think at the peak of the last cycle, we were as high as 42%.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if you look at how you typically enter a year, you typically have, what, 80% of it on the books and 20% is in the year for the year? Is that a good way to think about it?","W. Edward Walter","I would say it's probably more of a 70% to 75% at the beginning of the year. And then you fill in during the course of the year. At this point, as we look at the full year, we have gotten 95% of the group rooms we would expect to do on the books at this point.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","So how does next year look from a percentage of your expected total, as well as the pace?","W. Edward Walter","We are over 50% of the rooms that we would expect to do in '14 are on the books. And we're continuing to trend ahead of where we were at this time last year for 2014.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","And so your pace is up?","W. Edward Walter","Yes.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Right, right. And I think I've heard you say before that you could ultimately sell $2 billion worth of assets that you've identified, the portfolio that may not be core long-term for the company. Is there any sense of urgency given interest rates moving up, et cetera, getting further into the cycle to start accelerating the pace of those divestitures or maybe taking the place of ATM issuances therefore?","W. Edward Walter","Well, certainly we -- as we highlighted in, I believe, both the press release and our comments, we are hopeful of completing at least a couple more sales over the course of this year. And we will be intending to put about a handful of properties on the market in the fall with the goal of selling all of them. So I think it's fair to say that we do have a goal of selling more properties. And while we feel good about the length of the cycle, and therefore don't feel as if we're running up against the deadline that where we need to push things out quickly. On the other hand, we also recognize that you got to start, and each of these deals tends to be a process. And we generally feel that we're at a point in the cycle where we can achieve for the assets we're selecting to sell, fair prices relative to the whole values we would assign to them.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then finally for me, any update on your thoughts for next year for both D.C., which is obviously mired in some government issues and new supply, as well as New York?","W. Edward Walter","As it relates to D.C., we're still not seeing group bookings or convention bookings picking up for '14. I think the general sense was that '14 would be relatively flat to '13. So I think what will be the driver for D.C. will not be group, but rather whether what happens with government and what happens on the Hill to the extent for the downtown hotels, that can drive business if there is an enhanced legislative activity. New York's a little bit harder call. I think most of the industry experts and certainly our analysis suggests that supply growth in New York will be fairly considerable next year. I think we're looking at numbers that approach 7%, which is a pretty big number, especially given the amount of supply that has hit over the course of the last 3 years there. New York market has been remarkably resilient in accommodating the new rooms. But as all of you have commented, it has been difficult to achieve rate growth in New York given the new supply. New York will get a little bit of a boost in the beginning of the year because they will be hosting the Super Bowl. And so I've noticed that our group bookings in New York are up meaningfully. And I think a lot of it relates to the Super Bowl event, which is especially when it hit the market during a nonpeak time, which is what will be happening here, can have a considerable impact. But I think unfortunately, we'll find that New York is still going to be not as strong as we'd like it to be because of the supply coming into the market.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess not to beat a dead horse on group demand, but Ed, do you think that ultimately we'll see group reclaim a historical share of industry revenue and profit? And I guess how long do you think that could take?","W. Edward Walter","Well, first of all, that certainly is a very good question. And I know that I hope that it does. It's hard to tell right now whether it will. And certainly, this has been a topic throughout the industry over the course of the last couple of years. And I would say broadly speaking, we're probably all a little bit disappointed with the pace of the group recovery. I've probably, in terms of assessing this, the broader perspective that we have is in some areas, it does seem as if the sort of overall level of demand, and in this context, I'm thinking of association business, may have reset itself at a slightly different trajectory than where it was pre-downturn. And by that, I mean that in the course of the downturn, we have the sense that a number of the association shrunk their events by a day or so in an effort to reduce costs and continue to attract attendees. And it seems that those events were successful enough in the shorter form that we may have seen a reset in association demand. I'm not certain that, that necessarily applies as much to corporate level demand. As I commented earlier, corporate demand is still in our portfolio, and I'm going to assume for the industry, well behind where it was in the prior peak. But as I mentioned last year, or last quarter rather, we have often found a relatively close correlation between employment growth or employment and corporate demand. And I think that when you're still in the -- I think the stats today came out of, what was it, 7.4% unemployment. We're still at an area where companies are being very thoughtful about costs. And I'm not convinced that they're necessarily as focused on having events that are designed to retain employees. If we get back to 5%, 5.5% unemployment, and the employment markets become a bit more competitive, it seems logical to me that companies will have a different perspective about that. And so I'm probably more optimistic about the ability to recover this shortfall that we're seeing on the corporate side than I am necessarily the shortfall that we're seeing on the association side. So at the end of the day, I think it will take a while to get back to where we were before. In our case, we may have a better shot at getting to those levels in part because of the investments we've made in incremental meeting space. But clearly, it's been a slow recovery from what was an incredible downturn in '08 and '09.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And concerning the Grand Hyatt you purchased in D.C., I know Washington D.C. has probably been a little weaker than you guys originally underwrote. But I guess, I'm curious, how does that property perform maybe versus your original expectation? And did it cause you to maybe reset particularly with the Marriott coming online in the next year or 2, what your prospects are for that property?","W. Edward Walter","We're not -- we had been fairly conservative in our underwriting for 2013 for the Hyatt. We had known that group would not be particularly strong. We also knew that we were going to be doing some renovation at the hotel, carrying over into the first quarter. So my guess is the only part that we were probably a bit disappointed in so far this year was that inauguration turned out to be less of an event that it typically was. And I think that probably happened for a variety of reasons. Other than that, I think we've actually been relatively pleased with how that property has done. We would still be of a mind that the completion of the Marriott and the enhanced positioning of D.C. from a convention perspective will be a good thing for the market. And while we are leery of having one other big competitor in the market, we would tend to view our hotels as better positioned for the leisure customer relative to the new Marquis just because of where we're located in the city. But we'll also be in a position that because they will be the primary convention hotel, it will afford us more flexibility of when events are held in town to be able to be maybe a little bit more aggressive in the pricing that we look for because we will not need to commit the same amount of group block that we did in the past in order to attract an event.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And maybe just 2 more questions. One is just to angle in a little differently, maybe the numbers you have on trends and asset prices. If you had to sell the Grand Hyatt again today, do you think you could sell it for more than you purchased it for?","W. Edward Walter","Hard to say. My guess is the pricing would be about comparable where we are recognizing what's happened with the asset. But I would also say this, we obviously bought the property for less than what we had originally contracted for it. And I wouldn't be anxious to sell a lot of properties in DC right now. I think it's DC is the red letter, one of the red letter markets in the country. And so if anything, we still believe in the long run that Washington is going to continue to be an attractive market. The things that are happening in the city, if you leave out some of the challenges around the government side, the things that are happening in the city are making the city that much more attractive from a leisure perspective and, frankly, from a business perspective, too. So I -- we haven't really lost any confidence in Washington. We had assumed that this was going to be -- and recognized because of some of the weaknesses on the group side that it was going to be a more challenging market for the next 2 years. But as I think Arne commented in either his comments or in his answers to questions, we've lost so much government business already. There's not a lot more to lose. So at some point, you're going to start to see things turn around. And it's still a great place to visit.","Gregory J. Larson","Yes. And Jeff, despite the challenges that Ed mentioned, I mean that hotel this quarter, I mean its RevPAR growth is north of 5.5%.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one last question, I guess, certainly due respect to my friend, Greg, but can you talk about maybe what led to the decision to remove Larry as CFO because it's just from our perspective, it seemed rather abrupt. And I was just curious what color you're going to offer there?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I would -- I mean, I think, Jeff, it's only appropriate to really refer back to what we've said in the press release, that it was really just a decision to make some restructuring in terms of management. And that was -- in this case, that was -- Greg was the best answer in that role.","Operator","Next, we'll hear from Smedes Rose of Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to ask you about your disposition of Ritz, that it looks like you have an operating guaranteed for payments of up to $4 million a year. Is that just sort of a special situation for this particular hotel? Or is that these kinds of guarantees is such what you need to offer to get deals done now? Or maybe just a little more color around that? And would you expect to fund that?","W. Edward Walter","Smedes, I think this is a special circumstance. And as we talked about the cash flow, this property was quite low. And so I think we've realized early on that it was going to be difficult for a buyer to really put property level debt on this property. And so we felt comfortable putting up this 3.5-year guarantee where we're guaranteeing a certain level of cash flow each year. And as you point out, it's really capped at $4 million per year. And there's an overall cap of $11 million. And we think that when we look at our forecast for that property, we think we'll be out a small amount under the guarantee. So when we looked at everything, we thought that by offering the guarantee, we could really increase the price significantly. And so we thought it was worth it.","Operator","Robin Farley of UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I think you had commented previously that you expect to see a net buyer of assets for the year. Is that still the case?","W. Edward Walter","I would say that we still hope to be a net buyer. If I look at the number of assets that we are at least evaluating right now for purchase, I think that it's very conceivable that we could be a net buyer. But I would also say that we -- if we end up being a net seller at the end of year because we're getting attractive pricing for our sales, and we're not able to buy at levels that we're comfortable with, then that's also fine.","Operator","And that will conclude the question-and-answer session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our presenters.","W. Edward Walter","Great. Well, thank you for joining us on the call today. And we appreciated the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight in the remainder of 2013 on our third quarter call in the fall. Have a great weekend, and enjoy the rest of your summer.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation."],"11556":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Senior Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Evony. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2019 earnings call. Before we begin, I like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our first quarter results, our capital allocation strategy and our outlook for 2019; Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our first quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Risoleo","Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another strong beaten raised quarter.","Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 10% to $406 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per diluted share grew 11.6% to $0.48, beating consensus estimates by $20 million, and $0.04 respectively. While we do not provide quarterly guidance, we indicated in our prepared remarks last quarter that 25% to 26% of EBITDA would be earned in the first quarter, we beat that forecast by $11 million.","These strong results were primarily driven by an impressive EBITDA margin improvement of 50 basis points. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins improved for the sixth consecutive quarter and meaningfully exceeded our expectations, demonstrating the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver operational performance.","We continued to benefit from our internal initiatives, the Marriott, Starwood merger synergies, the receipt of operating profit guarantees from the Marriott transformational capital program and increases in other ancillary revenues. These bottom line results are remarkable, considering the comparable constant dollar RevPAR decline of 1%.","The RevPAR results were driven by an occupancy decrease of 180 basis points, which was partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average rate, the factors that affected RevPAR this quarter, including estimated 40 basis points of impact from the disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program, an estimated 30 basis points impact from the government shutdown and a softer than expected March.","Despite these headwinds comparable total RevPAR which includes all hotel level revenues, including food and beverage and other revenues increased 30 basis points to $274 million. These strong results continue to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment grade balance sheet. Together these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT.","Next, I would like to discuss our disciplined capital allocation as Michael will provide additional color around the key segments of our business and provide further details around our margin expansion. In addition to achieving industry-leading margin improvements, we advance our long-term strategic vision through active portfolio management, which ensures that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth.","Specifically, we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions of properties in key markets with strong demand generators while divesting non-core assets, including international assets, as well as profitability challenged assets like those in New York. This capital recycling strategy has been highly effective, enhancing our strategically advantaged competitive position to continue outperforming our industry.","Consistent with this approach, during the quarter, we closed on the previously announced acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach and the disposition of the Western New York Grand Central. We have been very prudent and disciplined in our underwriting and balance sheet position.","And as I stated last quarter, we intend to maintain our investment grade balance sheet with a high end of our leverage target set at three times. This provides us with a total investment capacity of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity.","However, we will continue to be opportunistic and adding value enhancing assets like the 1 Hotel South Beach, and plan to use our current investment capacity to make similar smart, targeted acquisitions. We will also continue to invest in our portfolio, as we are doing with the Marriott transformational capital program. And we will continue with our opportunistic approach to returning additional capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Our capital allocation decisions over the last few years have improved the composition and performance of our portfolio. Since early 2017, we dispose of $2.8 billion of non-core and profitability challenged assets, many of which required meaningful capital investment and acquired $2 billion of high RevPAR, high quality, irreplaceable assets with no meaningful near term capital requirements in markets we expect to outperform the industry.","As presented in our investor presentation on our website, on a trailing 12 month basis, since 2017, we sold 10 assets with a blended RevPAR of $186, total RevPAR of $266 and EBITDA per key of $24,000, at a cap rate of 4.9%.","We recycled much of that capital into six assets with a blended 2018 RevPAR of $313, total RevPAR of $505, and EBITDA per key of $55,000 at a cap rate of 5.8%. The improvement of these transactions to the portfolio is impressive. You can see this transformation even more clearly by comparing our top 40 hotels today to where it was just two years ago.","Since 2016, as a result of our investment decisions, we turned over approximately 20% of our top 40 hotels, resulting in an increase in total RevPAR and EBITDA per key of $15 and $2200 respectively.","In addition, the case studies provided in our investor presentation show that our recent acquisitions have performed well. Our disciplined approach to capital allocation is yielding the desired results and we intend to continue to pursue this strategy going forward.","Shifting to reinvesting in our existing portfolio. We anticipate spending between $235 million and $275 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures, and between $315 million and $350 million on redevelopment and ROI projects this year. The ROI projects include $225 million, related to the Marriott transformational capital program for which we are being well compensated.","The program which carries through 2021, began last year with the San Francisco Marriott Marquis. As we have described, these portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio as even stronger competitors in their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sales.","Notably Marriott is providing operating traffic guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental span. In addition, we will receive increased priority returns on the agreed upon investments which will result in reduced incentive management fees. We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders' capital, as transformational capital projects had typically resulted a meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index which translates through strong improvement in EBITDA.","We anticipate the ROI on these investments to be in the low to mid-teens. In 2019, as I have stated, we intend to spend approximately $225 million on 10 projects with four to be completed during the year. Those four are the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, New York Marriott Downtown, Santa Clara Marriott and the Coronado Island Marriott which is already complete.","Only three of the 10 hotels where we're allocating this capital, the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, the Minneapolis Marriott City Center and the San Antonio Marriott River Center are excluded from our forecast comparable results. The seven that are still included in our comparable results have impacted RevPAR in the first quarter by an estimated 40 basis points and we expect the impact - we expect will impact full year comparable RevPAR by 45 basis points.","However the RevPAR impact is mitigated by the operating profit guarantee of $1.5 million and $10 million that has been included in comparable hotel EBITDA for the quarter and full year forecasts respectively. For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantee payments for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects which has been included in our guidance for EBITDA.","Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of 2019. Our bottom line results for the first quarter exceeded our expectations and we expect improvement as the year continues. While I recognize that we are in the latter part of the economic cycle, the U.S. economic outlook is healthy and appears supportive of industry growth. Importantly the economic indicators we follow closely, including corporate profits and non-residential fixed investments while slightly lower than last year are still strong and we anticipate that will continue.","We are monitoring the impact of stronger U.S. dollar, the ongoing global trade dispute including its impact on business' willingness to invest and the performance of the overall global economy. While our modest 2019 GDP deceleration is wildly anticipated as the benefits of the tax cut paid and the government shut down gave the industry a slower start than we otherwise would have expected, we believe that overall industry fundamentals are on solid ground.","While the elongated spring break season impacted the demand in March for business travel, based on the solid non-residential fixed investment in corporate profit outlooks, we expect business travel to improve as the year progresses. In addition we expect leisure travel demand to remain steady, as this segment is supported by strong consumer income growth, solid employment and healthy settlement.","Given our optimal group and transient mix, we are pleased with our position. As we mentioned last quarter 2018 was a record year for group room nights with over 5 million room nights booked for the year. Group revenue booking activity in the quarter for the remainder of the year was up 5% and up 20% for the second quarter. For 2019 total group revenue pace is up 70 basis points.","Our outlook for the full year has not changed and we have reaffirmed our initial guidance of comfortable constant dollar RevPAR growth of zero percent to 2%. We believe RevPAR for the first quarter will be the weakest quarter of the year with the second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first.","Based on our margin outperformance in the first quarter and our confidence that the increases are sustainable through the remainder of the year which Michael will discuss further in his prepared remarks, we are meaningfully increasing our comparable EBITDA margin guidance to minus 25 basis points to plus 35 basis points, lifting the midpoint by 25 basis points, equating to an additional $13 million of comparable EBITDA for the year. We also expect an additional $7 million of EBITDA related to our non-comparable hotels, bringing the total increase from operations to $20 million.","In addition, we are now including the sale of the Westin Mission Hills and two additional unidentified assets, which decreases our EBITDA forecast by $7 million from our previous guidance. This is mitigated by an increase in forecasted interest income. In assets, our total full year raise is $27 million. These assumptions result in full year adjusted EBITDA ROE of $1.535 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.76 to $1.84. At the midpoint, adjusted EBITDA ROE increases $20 million and adjusted FFO per share increases $0.03.","Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with yet another beaten raised quarter is that again underscores the strength and advantages of our premier lodging REIT. We are also pleased with our ability to continue to outperform our margins, and note that this is our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, despite the fact we are in a lower RevPAR growth environment with record low unemployment.","Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable hotels, our unmatched scale and platform, and our investment grade balance sheet all position us to continue to outperform in the near, medium and long term. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail.","Michael Bluhm","Thank you, Jim and good morning everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with the strong results we delivered in the first quarter. Through active portfolio management we have ensured that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth.","With that, let's discuss the details of our results. As expected demand was impacted by the government shutdown earlier this year and some renovation disruption as part of our Marriott transformational capital program. As a result on a constant currency basis, comparable RevPAR decreased 1%, driven by 180 basis point decrease in occupancy, partially offset by a 1.3% increase in average rate.","Comparable total RevPAR which includes all hotel revenues, including food and beverage and other revenues, however, exceeded our internal forecast and improved 30 basis points to $274. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins, as Jim mentioned, improved for the sixth consecutive quarter exceeding our expectations and improving an impressive 50 basis points. These margin enhancements, the details of which I will discuss in a moment demonstrate the benefits of our scale and integrated platform, key elements underpinning our ability to deliver operational outperformance.","These results led to an increase of 10% in adjusted EBITDAre to $406 million and 11.6% growth and adjusted FFO per share to $0.48, which exceeded both our internal and consensus estimates.","Let me provide some additional color around our margin outperformance. Our asset managers and enterprise analytics team in collaboration with our managers continued to drive comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth and generate impressive profitability at our properties at this stage of the cycle. Our 50 basis points of margin expansion was 180 basis points greater than we would have expected with a RevPAR decline of 1%.","Let me provide a quick high level context to our margin outperformance. First, the timing of the tax rebate related to the New York Marriott Marquis benefited the quarter by approximately 25 basis points. As you may recall, we did not start receiving the tax rebates related to the Marquis until the second quarter of last year. The remaining improvements are divided roughly evenly between our internal initiatives and the benefits of our relationship with Marriott.","Let me give you little bit more details about our internal initiatives which are driving productivity improvement in rooms and food and beverage while decreasing operating expenses. Some of these initiatives include, working with our operators to reimagine operating models to more efficiently deliver services to guest when and where they want them. It can be as simple as messaging with guests prior to arrival to expedite check in process or more substantial like creating marketplace and grab and go food concepts in place of traditional restaurants and room service.","During a quarter with essentially flat comparable revenues in declining occupancy, we saw a year over year productivity in rooms and F&B. Lengthening the cancellation window and implementing technology to ensure consistent charging of cancellation fees. This has continued to help drive other revenue growth and has the added benefit of allowing for more reliable short term revenue management at the property level.","In addition the increases in other revenues from the improved collection of attrition and cancellation fees, ancillary revenues increased from the newly renovated Golf and Spa destination. Minimizing utility expense the investment in energy efficiency ROI projects. Over the past year, Host has completed 25 energy ROI projects which are expected to generate not only utility savings, but also take advantage of rebates available on projects such as low flow water fixtures, LED lighting and guestroom energy management systems. Utility costs in the quarter was down 2.7% at the same time last year.","Our enterprise analytics team, along with our asset managers have done a fantastic job working with our operators to streamline food and beverage operations and improve the cost of goods for a number of years now. Properties continued to improve on pricing, menu design, waste and leveraging of major food purchasing programs. During the quarter where F&B revenues were essentially flat, two thirds of our properties had year over year reduction in food costs.","In addition to these initiatives, we continued to improve benefits from the synergies of Marriott Starwood merger, Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs in combined systems to lower charge rates to its owners. This quarter we see a reduce fees related to the loyalty and rewards program, credit card commissions and group and travel agent commissions.","And finally, the receipt of $1.5 million related to the operating profit guarantees for Marriott for the comparable hotels that are part of the Marriott transformational capital program is enhancing margins by 12 basis points this quarter and will continue through the remainder of the year and into 2021.","Let's move to the performance of the segments of our business. Starting with our transient segment. Overall first quarter transient revenues decreased 0.6% as demand declined 1.6% it was partially offset by a 1% increase in average rate. The decrease in demand was due to the partial government shutdown in January an Easter holiday shift.","Group revenues declined 1.5% as occupancy fell 3.9% partially mitigated by a 2.5% increase in average rate. The decline in group occupancy was driven by a decrease in association business predominantly due to the lack of city wide events in San Diego, Boston and Chicago. To partially mitigate this decline, our managers pursued corporate group business which improved 4.1% this quarter. The increase in corporate group business which represents the largest segment of all business this quarter for the banquet and catering out performance.","Overall, we are pleased with our optimum group mix for our portfolio. As you recall, 2018 was a record year for group nights with 5 million group rooms booked for the year. Consistent with last year, we have 85% of our group business booked for 2019 providing a strong base of business. In addition, as we think about our business for the rest of the year, activity in the quarter for the remainder of the year was up 5%.","Looking at individual markets, our best performing domestic markets this quarter were Atlanta, Jacksonville, Phoenix and San Francisco with RevPAR increases ranging from 6% to 16%. Atlanta's RevPAR improvement of 16% exceeded our expectations, primarily driven by the strong average rate growth of 17% due to the Super Bowl. In addition, we were able to capture stronger group demand the week following the Super Bowl and throughout March.","Our hotel in the Jacksonville market outperformed the STR upper tier market by a wide margin with RevPAR growth of 14%. This growth was driven by a 7.3 percentage point increase in occupancy and 3.6% improvement in average rate. Exceptional group performance at the Ritz Carlton, Amelia Island fuel the growth with volume up 32% over last year, which enabled the hotel to drive transient rate up 11%.","RevPAR for our Phoenix hotel outperformed our portfolio this quarter with RevPAR growth of 7.5%. This was primarily driven by 22% and 12% increases in RevPAR at The Venetian and Scottsdale suites respectively, both of which benefited from strong corporate demand. We also saw an increase in Golf and Spa revenues their definition from the redesign Golf Course and the new Spa, which was under construction in the first quarter last year.","In the San Francisco area comparable RevPAR grew by 6%, which was driven by an increase in average rate of 12% and partially offset by a decline in occupancy of 4.2 percentage points. This performance reflects the Santa Clara Marriott and the Marriott Marquis being under renovation. Additionally, the Grand Hyatt San Francisco which remains non-comp, because it was acquired as part of the Hyatt portfolio last year, saw a double-digit RevPAR growth.","Now looking at the markets that were more challenged in the first quarter. Our hotels in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia, saw RevPAR declines ranging from 7% to 13%. Our hotels in New York saw RevPAR decline of 13.2%, which lagged the results for upper tier hotels in the New York market.","We performed in line with the market if we adjust for the renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Marriott New York Downtown, both of which are part of the Marriott transformational capital programs and remain comparable in our portfolio. It was a tough quarter in New York for everyone with first quarter demand declining for the first time since 2009.","The magnitude of the impact, the New York market has had in our portfolio was interesting. If we removed New York hotels from our comparable results, comparable RevPAR would have increased 0.4%.","Importantly, through reducing our exposure to profitability challenge hotels in the market, which we have executed upon over the past year, strengthen the overall portfolio. RevPAR in our Chicago hotels declined 11.5% due to weaker citywide activity impacting transient and group demand. Many of the conferences held in Chicago during the first quarter of last year rotated to other cities this year.","Despite the hotel's ability to increase corporate group business, the software market conditions hindered results. While Philadelphia's RevPAR declined 7.5%, it still exceeded our expectations and achieved 180 basis points improvement above the STR upper tier market results. Last year, we benefited from the 2018 NFL playoffs and Super Bowl parade as well as a January 2018 citywide [indiscernible].","Looking ahead to the full year, we expect RevPAR at our hotels in Atlanta, the Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Philadelphia to outperform the portfolio due to strengthened corporate and leisure demand, as well as strong citywide. Conversely, we expect RevPAR at hotels in Seattle, New York and Chicago to underperform our portfolio due to weak citywide calendars and ongoing room renovations at our New York assets.","Moving to our balance sheet. In April, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investor grade balance sheet, which we are committed to maintaining. We believe it is a prominent differentiator relative to our peers and provides flexibility to capitalize on value creation opportunities throughout the cycle.","At quarter end, we had unrestricted cash at $1.1 billion, not including $191 million in the FF&E escrow reserve and $944 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Total debt was $3.9 billion with a weighted average maturity of 3.9 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%.","In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter is approximately 1.9 times as calculated into the terms of our credit facility. As we have discussed before, our investments grade balance sheet is a competitive advantage and we intend to maintain that position. And as Jim mentioned previously, with the high-end of our leverage target at 3 times, provides us with a total investment capacity of $2.2 billion to $2.5 billion.","We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity. We will continue to be opportunistic to increase long-term shareholder value and potential smart targeted acquisitions, reinvesting in our portfolio and through share repurchases.","Let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. Our comparable RevPAR guidance for the year of zero percent to 2% remains unchanged. As Jim stated, we believe RevPAR for the first quarter will be the weakest quarter in the year, with second half of the year expected to be stronger than the first.","We continue to estimate a 45 basis point impact on RevPAR due to renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects. Without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately 1.45%, which is mitigated by $10 million of the operating profit guaranteed that has been included in our comparable hotel EBITDA.","For 2019, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA.","In addition, I hope the details that I provided surrounding our outsides leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration and the internal initiatives of our asset managed enterprise analytics teams, help you understand how we can continue to drive margin outperformance. Based on a strong margin performance in the first quarter, we have increased the midpoint of our EBITDA margin outlook by 25 basis points to negative 25 to plus 35 basis points. These assumptions result in adjusted EBITDAre of $1.535 billion to $1.6 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.76 to $1.84.","At the midpoint, adjusted EBITDAre has been raised by $20 million. This increase would have been higher by $7 million if we had not sold the Westin Mission Hills, and included two additional unidentified dispositions. Therefore the $20 million full increase in EBITDAre includes $13 million from our comparable hotels and additional $7 million related to our non-comparable hotels. With decrease in EBITDA from asset sales of $7 million is mitigated by our anticipated increase in interest income. Lastly, keep in mind that we expect to earn 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA in the second quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with the strong bottom line operating results, which meaningfully beat guidance we provided in February. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value and maintaining a powerful investment grade balance sheet creates a strong strategic position to deliver superior value to our stockholders.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] We'll take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony Powell","Well, good morning, everyone.","James Risoleo","Good morning, Anthony.","Michael Bluhm","Good morning.","Anthony Powell","Good morning. Wanted to focus on the Marriott-Starwood integration benefits. It seems like","you're doing even better than a 50 basis points of improvement that Marriott itself identified for it's a managed portfolio this year. What surprised to the upside from that integration? What's next for Marriott later this year and next in terms of further benefit? And as a result of this, do you think that you can maintain growing margins slightly at a 1% RevPAR growth level next year and year after?","James Risoleo","Anthony, I'll give you a little color on some of the benefits in a more granular level that we receive this year. The - we calculate the total benefit in the quarter of about 78 basis points from Marriott Starwood integration, and roughly, let's call it 40 basis points to 50 basis points of that, is a result of lower travel agent group intermediary commissions, loyalty program, expenses and the establishment of that program services fund, that is very helpful and our ability to control costs, charge off and alike.","The other piece of it is that we have, say - call 30 basis points or 40 basis points immediate ranges here in savings that are related to the new credit card program and the operating profit guarantee. So, we're confident that the margin performance is going to carry through for the rest of this year, and we would expect to see, I'm not going to say full point, but, call it another 50 basis points over the next couple years.","Michael Bluhm","I mean, Anthony, I would say, to your question, it really wasn't any surprises. I mean, much of this is what we've been annotating to the market about what our expectations were around the benefits of these synergies and to your question of kind, what's coming next. I mean as you recall there is fair amount of things that really just start getting put in place over the past six months or so, in particular things like the reservation and yield management systems which really just integrated the end of last year. And so we still really haven't seen the benefits of that, particularly from revenue synergy.","Group commissions for the large group intermediaries going through that reduction in group commission going to - into place until the end of last year. Last March was a smaller intermediaries where they changed it. The integration of the loyalty program just occurred towards the end of last year, the program services fund was in place at the beginning of this year.","So there is still a fair amount of things that we sort of expect to continue to help drive the 40 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement for the next couple years that we've consistently talked about.","James Risoleo","The other thing I would add, Anthony, is that a big driver for us in the quarter was the transient cancellation being pickup. The fees are now being automatically charged. So it's not like we're --- I'm not suggesting for a moment that we have higher cancellations, but the cancellations do occur are being charged to the customer.","Lastly, too early to quantify but were very confident that over time as a result of the integration when it's done and we look back we will see significant top line impact going forward. I mentioned this a couple calls ago, our Starwood legacy hotels gained access to 30,000 business-to-business accounts that were in the Marriot pipeline that Starwood didn't have. So I don't even think we have seen the tip of that going forward.","Operator","And our next question will come from Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask you just about - and so being a large owner of Marriott's hotels, your thoughts on Marriott entering the home sharing business here in the US. Do you see that it's just a totally separate business or what are your thoughts around that?","James Risoleo","Yeah. Smedes, we view the business as really complementary to our business, it is a different business. We actually view it positively because it's going to give our existing guests another place to go and to earn points or redeem points as part of the loyalty program. It will take some pressure off some of our hotels from that perspective. And it should also over time reduce the charge our cost associated with loyalty.","We spent a fair amount of time looking at this and talking to Marriott about it and the test program that they run in London Tribute Homes by Marriott generated 7,000 room nights from customers who went on the Marriott website to look at a Tribute Home but ended up booking a standard hotel room.","So we think more traffic through the system is good. These - the properties that they are contemplating putting into this program are not going to be competitive with us, there is going to be a minimum of three night stay whereas, our average stay is two night and its geared toward the leisure customer.","Lastly, I would tell you that it's going to be initially heavily weighted internationally in markets that Marriott doesn't have a presence today. And in the US it's, for the most part going to be rolled out in markets where they don't have a presence today. So complementary, not competitive. And were excited for it going forward.","Operator","Moving next now to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeff Donnelly","Yeah. Just circling back on the synergies, the Marriott and thinking about what's transpired since Marriott and Starwood got together. Do you guys know offhand how your RevPAR index of your hotels has performed in the past year? Ideally those hotels, not affected by renovations, I'm just curious if you have also seen revenue share gains, as well as expense savings as a result of the combination.","James Risoleo","I would say - no, it's a good question, Jeff. No, we've actually seen a slight uptick in our index from our Starwood hotels.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Banc. Please go ahead.","Chris Woronka","Hey, good morning guys.","James Risoleo","Good morning, Chris.","Michael Bluhm","Hey, Chris, good morning.","Chris Woronka","Want to ask about some of the internal initiatives that are driving the margin performance, you guys have been working on those for a lot of years you are getting really strong results right now and you did last year too. I guess the question is kind of; a, how sustainable.","But more than that, it's really, I think it would be a strong term just say, you're redefining the cost structure hotels. But some of these things relate to food and beverage, seem like they still have legs. So maybe give us a big picture view of what you still want to do in the hotels on the - on some of these costs initiatives.","James Risoleo","Sure. Our outperformance on margins is directly tied to our scale and our integrated platform, which we think distinguishes us from other lodging REITs in this space today. The amount of data that we have available to mind throughout the portfolio is - it is quite extensive. And we receive monthly data feeds from all of our properties that allow us to identify best practices from property to property.","And as we wrap our arms around, something that property a might be doing and decided has the ability to be rolled out to the entire portfolio. That's something we take up with the brand. So we think that puts us in a very unique position. And, if you want to get a little more granular about it, we're going to continue to think about consolidating kitchens and reducing costs from that perspective, to be more efficient,","New marketplaces grab & goes, we're doing them in New Orleans and the Logan and the Sheraton in Boston. And where we can we will consolidate wage codes and combine jobs but being very thoughtful about our associates and making sure that they're well taken care of.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.","Mike Bellisario","Good morning, everyone.","James Risoleo","Hey Mike.","Mike Bellisario","You may be talking about your disposition outlook a little bit, how you're thinking about some of the non-core properties that still might be in your portfolio. And then also New York City too with what remains there to potentially sell just kind of buyer interest pricing trends and kind of how you're thinking about the potential sources and uses of that capital that might be coming in the door. That'd be helpful.","James Risoleo","Yeah, it's - as you know, Mike, it's a hypothetical question, but I'll give you some color around it as I can. As we think about continuing to prune the portfolio, we will be opportunistic in taking assets to market, responding to unsolicited offers, where we feel that we can achieve a value that's in excess of our internal hold value. And we continue to be very disciplined with respect to our underwriting for new investment opportunities, as well as for assets we might want to sell by looking at the near term, RevPAR performance of an asset in a particular market, the capital needs and what we think is a fair and reasonable residual cap rate.","So, if market opportunities present themselves we will continue to prune. If they don't, we're very comfortable with the portfolio we have today. We're not in any rush to grow the portfolio or shrink the portfolio. I want to make that really clear. We're very comfortable with the assets that we own today.","So, you asked specifically about New York. You can look at what we've done in New York over the last year and the fact that we've sold three hotels which we deem profitability challenged. We're very happy with the execution that we were able to achieve. And much like the commentary I just gave you around how we view value, that's how we view value on all assets, regardless of what market we might be in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. The margin improvement in the quarter was so strong. I wonder if you can help us think about how much the reduction in occupancy, just since losing occupancy is kind of a better piece of RevPAR to lose and losing the rate because of all the variable expenses. Just maybe help us think about how to quantify how much margin is helped by losing, 100 basis points of occupancy, rather than losing 100 basis points of REIT? Thanks.","James Risoleo","Robin, I don't know that I can quantify that to the detail today. But I will tell you that we are very, very happy with the fact that we were able to increase productivity, both at the room's level and at the food and beverage level with a decrease in occupancy.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jared Shojaian with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Jared Shojaian","Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So I want to ask you about your RevPAR in the quarter which was down 1%. And appreciate all the color you've given us on the call so far. But you're also keeping the guidance unchanged for the full year of flat to plus 2%. Is there anything you're seeing in bookings rather than some of the macro day that you talked about that's giving you the confidence you'll see accelerating RevPAR growth throughout the year?","And I guess a different way to ask this is, do you need demand to accelerate or does the current booking environment support flat to 2% growth as some of the non-comp hotels and other noise rolls off?","James Risoleo","Sure. If you look at the 1%, down for the quarter and you take into consideration the disruption from the Marriott capital program of 40 basis points and the effects of the government shutdown of 30 basis points that left us with, call it another 30 basis points to get back to even.","A lot of that was the result of a slowdown in business travel in the month of March, that we saw as a result of - and we are proud about this a lot and talked to a lot of people about it, including our operators and others, the spring break season this year, given the late Easter was elongated. And that really put a crimp in business travel.","So as we look at the remainder of the year, I mentioned in my comments and Michael did as well that we saw strong booking activity in the quarter for the second quarter of 20% and 5% for the year, we have 85% of our group business on the books, which is exactly where we were last year. We were very encouraged in the quarter with a pickup in corporate group bookings, which was up 4.1% and higher food and beverage spend, which was quite profitable business and we hopefully we would continue to see that over the course of the year.","And then lastly we saw a pickup in business transient pace, revenue pace for the year, up about 1.3% in the quarter. So all the factors we look at make us - put us in a very comfortable position to maintain our RevPAR guidance of zero percent to 2%.","The other thing I would add is that we always anticipated that our first quarter was going to be the worst quarter of the year. And as we look out, I've said that the second half of the year is going to be stronger. And it gives us confidence to hold the course.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Richard Hightower","Hey, good morning guys.","James Risoleo","Hey, Rich.","Richard Hightower","So, Jim I want to ask, I guess one question about out of room spend, but it's a two parter question. First of all, are you guys able to quantify the margin benefit from some of those spend categories, whether it's on the F&B or the catering side and just help us understand the margin and flow through profile of that segment.","And then secondly, it's not the first quarter or the first company where we've seen non-room spend outpace room revenues. And I'm just wondering is there anything structurally related to that, in terms of the ability to price, one segment of the business versus the room segment and anything we should be paying attention to there?","James Risoleo","Yeah, there's a lot in that question. I just want to make sure I heard it clearly. So the question is, give it a little bit more background on the margins in different departments, as well as sort of understand kind of what's happening with trends out of room spend.","Richard Hightower","Yeah, that's right. And then, on the second part, is there anything structural that we need to focus on between room revenue and out of room revenue, in terms of pricing power overall?","James Risoleo","Yeah. Rich, I don't know that there's anything structural that we're seeing in the business, per se, but as we think about our absolute margin performance, and really break it down a little more granularly; food and beverage operations contributing 19 basis points; rooms productivity contributed 8 basis points; so - utilities was another 9 basis points; fund distributor operating expenses was 5 basis points; so - and I mentioned earlier today the pickup in cancelation fees 20 basis points.","So it's a number of different areas of the P&L that are being touched. And our intention, going forward is to continue to be focus on this and look for other opportunities to improve our margin performance whether it's - we have continued lower charge out rates for the loyalty program, we're receiving benefit from lower travel agent commissions from Marriott's book direct campaign and we saw a pickup of about of 2.3% in the quarter. So I don't there's anything really that's structurally has changed.","Operator","Our next question will come from Patrick Scholes with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Scholes","Hi good morning. Two questions for you. How do you think the quarterly trajectory of RevPAR growth looks for the rest of this year? That's my first question. And how are you pacing overall for your Company for group in 2020 and in 2021?","James Risoleo","Yes. For us for the balance of the year, and it may be different for others in the industry and for the broader industry, we would expect that our third quarter will be our strongest quarter; our fourth quarter will be the second strongest; the second quarter, third; and the first, the weakest.","So it's in line with we anticipated at the beginning of the year. For 2020, Patrick, our group revenue is - group revenue pace, total revenue pace is up 3.5% and we have about 50% of the room nights on the books for the year compared to 34% last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Katz with Jeffries. Please go ahead.","David Katz","Hi good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. You've covered a lot of ground and a lot of detail and I appreciate that when you made some comments earlier about some of the detail that's available to you in the operating model, from the plethora of data that's available to you. And I found some of those examples to be interesting.","Can you elaborate a bit more on those and what inning you are in and how much more of that bodes for you to do and further degree that we can maybe process that into some earnings power overtime, that would be helpful.","Michael Bluhm","Yeah. Look, I think there's a couple of things to talk about here. I mean if you kind of think about how operationally we've been [technical difficulty] of these markets that we talked about in our prepared remarks and it is very broad, right. It was sort of top line right, stronger the revenues, strong F&B capture particularly from our corporate group business.","Rooms and F&B productivity we continue to find ways to beat that savings and as Jim pointed out in a declining occupancy environment, it's pretty spectacular. We did point out utility expenses and how much we save here, but in aggregate undistributed operating expenses in total were sub-inflationary which is very impressive when you sort of think about an environment that we're in today. The Marriott's sell with synergies we continue to really hold tight on sort of the 40 basis points to 50 basis points a year.","So as we sort of think about the duration of our ability that really ease our savings as compared to our peers we feel pretty good that we've got a nice setup going in the year or two to continue.","Operator","Moving next to Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Grambling","Thanks. Coming at the M&A environment from a slightly different angle. What are you seeing in the supply of iconic assets coming to market and where a seller expectations? And perhaps as a follow up as we think about the $2 billion to $2.5 billion in liquidity, did I hear you correctly that you're more focused on individual assets versus portfolios and where do buybacks fit into that creation?","James Risoleo","Yeah. I'll take the part on the M&A landscape today and how we're thinking about the market. I have been very clear that our investment capacity is $2 billion to $2.5 billion assuming we go to three times leverage. And we don't intend to invest beyond that level. I would tell you that we're rather agnostic with respect to whether it's a one property deal or a multiple property deal.","It all starts with the assets, the markets, seller expectations, our underwriting. And that's how we're approaching the business. So with respect to the landscape today, we always have an ebb and flow of assets in our pipeline. And that exists today, we have a fairly healthy pipeline of assets and we're underwriting.","It is very difficult to opine on hypothetical situations of what seller expectations are until you get to the table and see if you can make a deal. So it really is all over the board. Sellers are motivated by different reasons.","Michael Bluhm","Yeah. Let me - just a quick comment on buybacks. I mean, it remains obviously one of our - one of our key investment opportunities, and we think about it in the context that we think about any investment opportunity, whether it's investing in our own assets, whether it's buying, growing externally. And so as we sort of think about different opportunities, it absolutely sort of factors into our thinking about sort of where we think we can generate the highest rate of return for our shareholders. This quarter, we did not buy back any shares. But that again, is more of a function of just sort of our investment opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, guys. A lot of the ground's been covered. So just a quick one on, could you just elaborate on the program services fund savings and the charge out ratios? Just maybe a little bit more of the mechanics of how that works, when that has gone into effect? And what kind of the magnitude that drives of savings that drives for Host?","Michael Bluhm","Yeah. Shaun let me I start off with the program services line, because - and I'd say the majority of what the - that entails is potential reservation system, where we expect we're probably going to save somewhere around 8 basis points in costs associated with that. And really that's a function of - and good on Marriott, really sort of rewarding the largest contributors to their system overall. And when they sort of think about fair sharing of costs, it's all taken into consideration. And so, certainly a decent margin benefit that we expect to get and continue for the year.","Operator","And this does conclude today's question and answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Risoleo for additional or closing remarks.","James Risoleo","Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and 2019 outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our second quarter results, as well as providing you with more insight into how 2019 is progressing. Have a great day.","Operator","And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gee Lingberg","Thank you, Kim. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements. In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Greg Larson, Executive Vice President, Corporate Strategy. This morning, Ed Walter will provide a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2013. Larry Harvey will then provide greater detail on our fourth quarter and full year results, including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. Despite a variety of external challenges in the financial and political world and the historic storm in the Northeast Mid-Atlantic region, 2012 generated another year of positive growth for the lodging industry and especially for our company. Driven by strong group and transient demand, combined with solid cost controls and cheaper utility prices, we were able to substantially exceed our top line and bottom line expectations issued at this time last year. In addition, our fourth quarter adjusted FFO per share exceeded both our most recent guidance and consensus estimates. Finally, we made progress on a variety of corporate initiatives designed to add or realize value, including international and domestic acquisitions, key dispositions, value-enhancement projects and debt refinancing. But before we get into the details, let's review our results for the quarter and the year.","Comparable revenues increased 3.9% for the quarter and 5.5% for the full year. Fourth quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.8% and on a calendar quarter basis, increased 6.8%. As we discussed during our last call, the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by unfavorable holiday timing, the election and fiscal cliff concerns, as well as Hurricane Sandy. The storm, which meaningfully disrupted travel in the Washington-New York corridor and resulted in the closure of 4 of our hotels with 1 hotel closed for over 2 weeks, reduced RevPAR for the quarter by at least 1%. Overall, our RevPAR growth accelerated in the second half of the year, and we outperformed the industry over that period.","For the year, comparable hotel RevPAR growth was 6.4% as our average rate was $191 per night, and our average occupancy was 74.5%. It is worth noting that while our occupancy levels now exceed our 2007 performance, we have not yet reached our historic peak levels, which exceeded 78%, and we believe that there is still upside potential, especially on the group side of our business.","F&B revenue for the year was up a solid 3.9%, although as expected, fourth quarter growth was low, increasing just 1%. Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased 80 basis points for the fourth quarter and 140 basis points for the year, resulting in a 22% increase in adjusted EBITDA to $426 million for the quarter and full year adjusted EBITDA of $1.19 billion, a 17% increase over the prior year.","Our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.40 for the fourth quarter and $1.10 for the full year, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflects a nearly 20% increase over 2011. And finally, our dividend for 2012 more than doubled compared to 2011.","Overall, the key driver of our business this year was a more than 4% increase in our group room nights, which allowed hotels to be more aggressive in increasing room rates, especially in our transient segment. As a result, roughly 60% of our RevPAR increase in 2012 was driven by higher rates. The strong recovery in our group business was led by our higher-priced association and corporate segments, which increased a combined 8% for the year and drove an overall increase in group revenues of roughly 6.5%. The calendar challenges inherent in Q4 and the impact of the storm, which was well publicized in advance of its landing, led to a lower increase in group room nights for the quarter of just 1.6%, with group revenues increasing by 4%. As of year-end, our group business has recovered more than half of the 19% in demand lost in the downturn, our average rate is just 1% short of 2000 levels.","For the full year, our transient room nights increased more than 1.5%, helping to drive strong rate increases across all segments. Average rate increased by more than 4% as transient revenues were up almost 6% for the year. Our business generally shifted towards higher-rated segments through the first 3 quarters of the year, but the fourth quarter transient mix was impacted by Hurricane Sandy, which caused some last-minute group cancellations. While hotel managers were somewhat successful in replacing the lost business with transient travelers, it generally was priced in the discount rate segment.","For the quarter, overall rate and demand were both up approximately 3%, leading to a transient revenue increase of nearly 6%. While our full year transient demand is 5% better than 2007 levels, the average rate is still 9% below the prior peak, indicating a meaningful opportunity for additional rate growth in 2013.","As I mentioned earlier, our overall occupancy level is about 0.5 point higher than where we were in 2007, but we have not yet achieved the 78%-plus occupancy we reached at the end of the '90s.","Average rate is still 6% short of 2000 levels on an absolute basis and closer to 17% below if you adjust for inflation. As we look at lodging fundamentals over the next few years, we expect supply will continue to be constrained, especially in the upper upscale segment. We would expect demand growth will exceed supply growth as international visitation continues to grow and group demand continues to improve. As group demand improves, we would expect that the hotels will benefit from continued mix shift and be able to increase rates across all segments. As a result, we would expect that RevPAR would be driven more by increases in rates, but we would still expect to experience further increases in occupancy.","For 2013, the stage is set as I just described. Our group booking pace is up 4% in room nights for the full year 2013, and up 6.5% in revenues. Revenues for the last 3 quarters of the year are up more than 8%. And overall, we expect a strong year from our group segment.","Transient bookings are also well ahead of last year's pace and we are seeing solid rate growth in virtually all segments.","Our RevPAR growth for the first month and a half is averaging more than 9%. While March results are expected to slow, primarily because of the early Easter holiday, we are certainly encouraged by our initial results.","Transaction activity across our various markets generally match the pace we experienced in 2011, although both the U.S. and Europe saw more activity in the second half of the year. For the year, we invested or committed to invest in more than $1.2 billion in acquisitions or new developments, purchased either directly or with joint venture partners. The largest of these transactions, the EUR 440 million purchased by our European JV of 5 Marriott-branded hotels located in Paris and Amsterdam closed late last quarter.","On the disposition front, we remain focused on reducing our exposure to noncore hotels located in suburban and airport locations. Consistent with that plan, we sold the San Francisco Airport Marriott, the Rocky Hill Marriott and the Toronto Airport Marriott in 2012. Additionally, we are focused on reducing our portfolio allocation in secondary markets, as demonstrated by our recent sale of the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, which reduced our presence in Atlanta from over 5% to roughly 3% of our U.S. portfolio. In total, our asset sales were $445 million, including the early January sale of the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.","Preliminary indications suggest that transaction volumes in the industry will be similar to 2012. We expect to be active on both the acquisition and disposition fronts as we look to increase our investment in target markets and look to reduce our exposure in noncore locations. On the margins, we would still intend to be a net acquirer in 2013. While we have active pipeline both in sales and acquisitions, given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing these transactions, our guidance does not assume the benefit of any acquisitions nor does it assume the impact of any sales beyond the transactions we have already closed.","In addition to transaction activity, we will continue to look to invest in income-generating additions to our portfolio, which typically drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital. In 2013, we hope to commence the final phase of the San Diego Marriott Marquis & Marina, which will provide a new ballroom and exhibit hall. Another 2013 project we are working on is the repositioning of the Newark Airport Marriott, which will include a 10,000 square foot ballroom which is scheduled to be completed before the 2014 Super Bowl, which will occur in the MetLife Stadium just outside of New York. In 2013, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $100 million on ROI and redevelopment investments.","Now let me elaborate a bit on our outlook for 2013. As I discussed earlier, we anticipate that hotel demand will continue to grow as the U.S. economy improves, leading to demand growth which will slightly exceed the less than 1% supply growth projected for 2013. The increase in net demand, combined with solid group bookings, suggests we should experience both occupancy and rate growth in our portfolio. We should also benefit from a more than 20% reduction in maintenance capital expenditures as spending declines from $366 million in 2012 to a range of $270 million to $290 million in 2013, which should reduce ongoing business disruption. With all this in mind, we are expecting comparable hotel RevPAR to increase 5% to 7% for the year. And while food and beverage and other activity is often volatile and difficult to predict, we are expecting those revenues to increase roughly 2% to 4%.","We expect margins to be up 50 to 110 basis points. This operating forecast will result in an adjusted EBIT of $1.25 billion to $1.31 billion, and adjusted FFO per share of $1.19 to $1.27.","Looking at our dividend, we announced yesterday that our first quarter common dividend would be $0.10 per share. Dividends for the rest of the year will depend both on operating results, as well as gains on asset sales.","I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is progressing well due to continued demand increases combined with low supply growth. As a result of the strong industry outlook and underlying fundamentals, we believe this cycle will continue to gain momentum through 2013 and 2014. The capital we have invested over the last several years in our hotels ensures that our portfolio is in excellent condition and able to benefit from this improving marketplace. As Larry will describe in more detail, our industry-leading balance sheet is getting only stronger, and our cost of capital remains attractive. Looking to our valuation, despite the fact that interest rates are at historic lows and supply is low, our stock is currently trading at approximately a 40% discount to replacement cost and near its average 10-year multiple. When we look at all these factors, it gives us confidence that Host is well positioned to outperform in 2013.","Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Larry K. Harvey","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Overall, we had an outstanding quarter in many markets as 10 of our top 20 U.S. markets had RevPAR growth in excess of 9%. Our top-performing market for the fourth quarter was Los Angeles with a RevPAR increase of 17.6%. Occupancy improved by over 7 percentage points to nearly 81%, while ADR was up roughly 7%. The outperformance was driven by an increase in both transient and group demand. We expect the Los Angeles market to continue to perform well in 2013.","Our Seattle hotels had a great quarter with RevPAR up 17.3%. Occupancy improved nearly 9 percentage points, as transient demand was very strong and ADR increased by 4%. We expect Seattle to be one of our top-performing markets in 2013 due to growth in both transient and group demand, which will help to drive rate and RevPAR growth.","Our Hawaii hotels significantly outperformed our expectations for the quarter with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%. Occupancy improved by nearly 4 percentage points driven by strong group and transient demand, which drove rate growth of roughly 7%. We expect Hawaii to be a solid market in 2013 due to good group bookings. Results for 2013 will be affected by the construction of the timeshare project adjacent the Hyatt Maui and a rooms renovation at the Fairmont Kea Lani in the second half of the year.","Our Houston hotels had a RevPAR increase of 11.6%. Strong group and transient demand led to an occupancy increase of nearly 6 percentage points. The ADR growth of over 3% was driven by increases of both group and transient rates. We expect our Houston hotels to have a good 2013 due to better demand which will allow us to shift the mix of business to higher-rated segments.","As we expected, our San Francisco hotels continued their excellent performance, as RevPAR increased 10.9% due to an ADR improvement of nearly 6% and an occupancy increase of 4 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by both rate increases and the shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments as both group and transient demand performed well. We expect that the San Francisco market will have a decent year in 2013, although results will be affected by the rooms renovation of the San Francisco Marriott Marquis in the first half of the year.","RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 10.2% driven by an increase in ADR and an improvement in occupancy of over 1%. The outperformance was driven by both group business, which created compression to drive rate. We expect our Boston hotels to have another good year due to solid in-house group bookings.","Our Chicago hotels also performed well in the quarter with RevPAR up 8.8%. ADR increased nearly 6%, and occupancy improved more than 2 percentage points. Strength in both group and transient bookings allowed our hotels to drive rate. We expect our Chicago hotels to continue to perform well in 2013 due to group demand and ADR improvement through better business mix and overall rate increases.","RevPAR for our New York hotels increased just 1.7%. Renovation disruption and Hurricane Sandy negatively impacted our fourth quarter results in New York, particularly at the New York Downtown Marriott, which was closed for 15 days and was well below capacity for the remainder of the quarter due to rooms out of service. In addition, the W Union Square was closed for 8 days. Excluding the Downtown Marriott and the W Union Square, our RevPAR growth in New York was 5.3% on a calendar quarter basis. We expect New York to be one of our top-performing markets in 2013 due to an increase in both group and transient demand, less renovation disruption and no Hurricane Sandy.","RevPAR for our Washington, D.C. hotels decreased 4.3% as occupancy declined roughly 3 percentage points and ADR was flat. Results were affected by cancellations related to Hurricane Sandy and renovations at 3 hotels. For the year, RevPAR was down 2.4% in 2012. With the inauguration in January, RevPAR for the month for our 4 downtown hotels was up over 24% and RevPAR for all 11 of our D.C. hotels was up 21%. While we expect 2013 to be better than last year, weakness in government travel will limit RevPAR growth.","For the full year, our best-performing markets in the U.S. were Philadelphia with a 14.4% RevPAR increase, followed by Los Angeles with a 12.3% increase and Boston with an 11.1% increase. Our worst-performing market was Orlando with a 3.9% decline in RevPAR due to extensive renovation work.","For the 11 hotels in the European joint venture that have comparable results, RevPAR increased 2% for the quarter in constant euros as ADR increased 3%, while occupancy fell 80 basis points. EBITDA margins increased 50 basis points.","The Hotel Arts Barcelona and the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam performed the best in the quarter, while the Renaissance Brussels and Sheraton Skyline underperformed.","For the full year, RevPAR for the 11 comparable hotels improved 2.9% in constant euros due to 3.3% rate growth, while margins were up 110 basis points. We expect the 18 European joint venture properties, excluding the Sheraton Roma, which was under major renovation in 2012, and including the 5 hotels recently acquired, to have RevPAR growth in the 2% to 3% range for 2013.","For the full year, comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased 140 basis points, 30 basis points of which can be attributed to the 5.5% decline in utilities for the year when compared to a normal inflationary increase. For the quarter, comparable hotel margins increased 80 basis points. Margin growth was affected by the lower level of RevPAR growth, which was driven by Hurricane Sandy and the unfavorable shift in holidays in the fourth quarter. More than half of the RevPAR growth was from occupancy growth, not rate.","For the fourth quarter of 2012, F&B revenues increased only 1%, and F&B profit declined as the quarter was challenged by an unfavorable comparison to the fourth quarter of 2011 when F&B revenues increased 6.8%.","In total, general and administrative, sales and marketing, utilities and repairs and maintenance expenses were flat. Property taxes increased 5% in the fourth quarter, primarily because we received property tax refunds in the fourth quarter of 2011.","Looking forward to 2013, we expect that RevPAR primarily will be driven by rate growth. The additional rate growth should lead to solid rooms flow-through, even with growth in wage and benefit costs. We expect unallocated cost to increase more than inflation, particularly for rewards and sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost.","Margin expansion for 2013 will be negatively affected by projected above inflationary increases in both property insurance, primarily due to Hurricane Sandy losses, and property taxes, which when combined result in a 17-basis-point impact on margins. In addition, a couple of initiatives from the brands, including incremental cost from Marriott's CITY initiative and Starwood's paid search revenue initiative, which when combined results in an incremental 10 basis points in margin as well. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 50 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 110 basis points at the high end of the range.","In looking at our comparable hotel margins for 2012, and assuming that we achieve the midpoint of our guidance for 2013, our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins will have increased 220 basis points or 110 basis points a year since 2011.","There are 2 items, in particular, that impact the comparability of EBITDA and FFO between 2012 and 2013. The first of this -- is the sale of the land to the Hyatt Maui timeshare joint venture. We recognized an $8 million gain on the sale in 2012, which reflected the profit we received from Hyatt for their 1\/3 portion of the land. In 2013, the JV expects to start the marketing process for the timeshare, and our portion of the expenses will total roughly $4 million with no offsetting income, resulting in a $12 million decline in EBITDA from 2012 to 2013.","The second item is the $9 million of business interruption proceeds related to the New Zealand earthquake that we received in 2012. While the ibis Christchurch reopened in September of last year and we expect the Novotel Christchurch to reopen later this year, the EBITDA generated will be approximately $7 million less than the 2012 EBITDA. When combined, these items generated roughly $19 million of EBITDA and FFO that will not be repeated in 2013.","In the fourth quarter, we redeemed $100 million of our 6 3\/4% Series Q senior notes. For 2012, we reduced our weighted average interest rate by 90 basis points to 5.4% and we increased our weighted average debt maturity by nearly 1 year to 5.1 years. We finished the year with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x and a fixed charge coverage of 3.2x. We have 2 debt maturities in 2013, the 4.75% $246 million loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott that is due in the second quarter and an 8.5% $33 million loan on the Westin Denver Downtown that goes into hyper amortization in December, both of which we intend to repay with available cash.","We finished the year with $417 million of cash. After adjusting for the asset sale proceeds from the Atlanta Marriott Marquis, our January dividend payment and the $100 million credit facility repayment, we currently have over $530 million of cash and $837 million of credit facility capacity.","As you are aware, Marriott recently moved to a calendar quarter year. We are thrilled to be moving to the calendar quarter, however, this year will be an interesting year of transition. In order to provide as much transparency as possible, we plan to provide you with estimated comparable revenues and margins on a calendar quarter basis for each quarter in 2012 when we report our results, which will give you an apples-to-apples comparison to the 2013 calendar quarter results. In addition, we will provide estimated adjusted EBITDA and adjusted FFO for each calendar quarter in 2012 in order to make the appropriate comparisons as we report our 2013 results for each quarter.","We realize that the transition to a calendar quarter creates challenges for us and for you with respect to spreading metrics, such as EBITDA, among the 4 quarters of the year, particularly in a year when Easter moves from the second quarter to the first quarter. At this point, we are forecasting that roughly 20% of our full year EBITDA will be earned in the first quarter. We will provide you with the spread for each of the remaining quarters on the first quarter earnings call.","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","For a quick question here, Ed, you mentioned the first month and a half of this year, RevPAR is up 9%. You may have said it, maybe I didn't catch it. If we exclude D.C. from that result, what was the RevPAR growth? And what was New York City's within the first month and a half as well?","W. Edward Walter","I'm not certain what New York City was for the first month because we are -- to be honest, we were just getting some of these results as late as last night. Our sense is that D.C. affected January RevPAR, which was about the same, it was right at the same 9%. D.C. affected January's RevPAR by  1%. So we would've been 8% in January without the strong D.C. performance.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then my next -- final question on the group. You mentioned about the group pace in the last 3 quarters of the year being up 8% versus a year ago. But the 1Q being down, have you tried to estimate what the impact was from Sandy on 1Q bookings, or to what extent it's a reason for that? And then at this point, what percentage of your anticipated total '13 group room nights are on the books right now, and how does that compare to last year?","W. Edward Walter","Okay. We have not tried to figure out what the affect of Sandy was on the first quarter this year. So I don't think we can respond to that. We've got about 75% of our group room nights for the year on the books at this point.","Operator","We'll hear from Joshua Attie from Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The 5% to 7% RevPAR guidance is for the same-store pool, which is about 85% of the portfolio. Can you share with us what you expect the total portfolio to achieve in terms of RevPAR growth, including the hotels that were recently acquired and those that were coming off renovation?","W. Edward Walter","I guess, the short answer is, Josh, is I don't have that number at my fingertips, but that's something that we can take a look at. I would probably say, broadly speaking, I would be surprised if it would be dramatically different from that, though. We have -- we're going to have a couple of hotels that are still under construction that aren't in because of that reason. But by and large I don't think there's going to be a big difference between the 2 metrics. In fact, thinking a little bit quickly on my feet, we're going to be seeing a huge increase from the Helmsley year-over-year so, to be honest, when you average that altogether, it could be a bit higher. But I honestly don't know off the top of my head the answer to that.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the margins, you explained some of the issues that are weighing on the 2013 margin growth, which does seem low relative to the RevPAR growth you're going to generate, but part of that may also be kind of slower growth of food and beverage revenue. As group business continues to get better, do you see any potential for an acceleration of food and beverage revenue growth in 2013?","W. Edward Walter","That's a great question, Josh, because that's been -- the food and beverage revenue, this recovery, has been more difficult to predict than any time that I've been with the company. Even if you look at what happened in the fourth quarter, where it was up 1%, the reality is, is if you take New York City and D.C. out of the equation for the fourth quarter, and then you'd see if you looked across the whole rest of the country, food and beverage revenues were up 4.3% in the fourth quarter. So pretty much in line with what we had seen for the rest of the year. When we look at December, we were up 5%, you look at January, we were up 7%. So at the end of the day, what we've tried to do is, because we've seen some inconsistency and because so many of the groups are really not determining their full food and beverage sort of offering until a relatively near-term period before their event actually occurs, we chose to go with what I think, hopefully, I'm hoping it's going to prove to be a conservative outlook of 2% to 4%. But it -- we generally have, on the high end of that, encompassed what we did in 2012. Certainly, there -- if we see some -- if group business comes in the way we like and people feel optimistic about spending, doing better on that front is certainly possible.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And can you just remind us what the margin sensitivity is? I know that the food and beverage outlets tend to have very low margins, but the food and beverage that's associated with meetings -- if you'll remind us what the margins are on those, and to the extent that the spending is a little bit higher, what the potential flow-through could be?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. Generally, if you look across our portfolio, our -- the absolute margins in food and beverage are kind of in that 26%, 27% range. We would typically expect to see flow-through well above that, but as you pointed out, it depends a bit on whether it comes from outlets or whether it comes from catering. To be somewhere in the 30% to 40% range on food and beverage, given that we do expect strong group business in the year, is certainly reasonable.","Operator","Felicia Hendrix from Barclays has our next question.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ed, I think this is the most bullish I've ever heard you.","W. Edward Walter","I think that may just be because of maybe what you've heard from some of the other calls. I sound the same, but it seems better.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","You don't sound the same, you sound good. So -- no, but that's actually gets to the crux of my question. So one competitor who is more cautious regarding the economy and some things that might happen with the government and then you had another competitor who is more cautious regarding the group business. And just wondering, are you leaving enough room for error?","W. Edward Walter","It's a great question, and I mean we certainly did some thinking about that on our side. I mean, we've been -- as a short answer is we think we have. But I'll be honest with everybody, is we have not -- in coming up with our outlook for this year, we have not assumed that the sequester issues snowball into a bigger problem. Say a problem similar to what we saw in the economy in the summer of 2011. We have assumed that there would be impact in D.C., which is certainly a market that is going to feel some pain as a result of the sequester. And we've seen some evidence of that already. We do think that some of the impact of that, though, will be felt perhaps more in the upscale segment than necessarily in the upper upscale segment, but I wouldn't say that we would be immune to that. But on the other hand, we've had good group on the books for the second half of last -- as we look at '13, our group bookings have been solid. We feel good about the group bookings that we have on the books for this year. We -- what we're hearing from our operators is that the group booking pace is -- that the bookings they're looking at, that they've seen so far this year, continue to be strong. Transient has been quite good. The year got off to a great start, and while D.C. was part of that, as I just commented earlier, D.C. was 1% of that growth in January. But after that, even during that period and after that, we've had very good RevPAR growth. So granted there a lot of risks out there and, frankly, as an industry we've been dealing with those risks now for probably 2 or 3 years, but when we separate ourselves from being worried about that and look at the evidence that we can evaluate, we just feel like we're going to have a good solid year. Obviously, things could happen that could be worse. But the bottom line is if we look at the facts in front of us, it feels pretty good right now.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. If we could just switch gears to Europe for a second. The hotels in your European JV, also they reported better RevPAR results than some of your peers who also operate in Europe. So I'm just -- would you attribute that to location, type of property or something else?","W. Edward Walter","I'm sure it's a little bit of both. But I -- the way I would look at Europe right now is there's sort of 2 big factors that affect what happens in European hotels, the way we look at it. The first is that there's no doubt that the weak economy in Europe has caused business travel to be lower, and so we have seen that in our special corporate business and we have seen that in some of our corporate group business. And so what we find is those months of the year that are driven primarily by local and sort of domestic travel, we tend to see weaker results. But we're in a -- the converse to that is those markets that attract international leisure, so that's London, that's Paris, that's Barcelona, that's some of the Italian markets. Those markets, because Europe is still a primary place for the entire world to visit for leisure purposes, those markets are outperforming over the cycle and they've outperformed over the last 12 months. And so, I think, to ultimately get to the answer to your question, is because we're in a lot of those leisure destinations. And as we've mentioned before, fully 40% of our business at those hotels comes from outside the EU and the U.K. The bottom line is, is we've had better performance because of that.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Helpful. And then just finally, you might have said this, and if you did, I apologize, but for your -- your 2013 disposition program, have you given us -- have you quantified what that could be?","W. Edward Walter","No. We didn't do -- in our outlook, we did not try to quantify either acquisitions or dispositions. What I would say though is that we did comment that we have sold over $400 million of hotels this year, including the Marquis as -- rather last year, including the Marquis as a 2012 sale. As we think about sales going forward in 2013, we would certainly love to do sales in at least that same level. But as always, since it's not liquidity-driven or event-driven, it's really going to be around what price we can get when we go to be a seller.","Operator","Moving on, our next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ed, you just mentioned in response to one of Felicia's questions that you're seeing some evidence of the sequester already in your business. I guess, could you be a little bit more specific just in terms of what you are seeing? Have there been any cancellations or just really a hesitancy to book? And as a follow-up, can you just remind us what percentage of your business comes from government?","W. Edward Walter","Sure. I guess I don't know that we're necessarily seeing -- let me clarify, I said that we were -- we had a conservative outlook about Washington. The reality is, is so far I wouldn't say that we have really seen anything significant that's happened in the last 45 days that we would relate to the sequester. Now what we would say more broadly, so some of this is why I -- maybe our perspective on this is different from others, we've been seeing for the -- probably the last 8 to 10 months, we've been seeing some reduced bookings from some of the government-related industries, and we certainly have not seen the same level of government business in the second half of '12 that we have seen in prior years. But I don't think we've seen anything that's happened in the last 6 or 7 weeks that we would necessarily tie to the sequester. The net of it though is recognizing that the sequester is coming, or at least appears to be at this point in time, we have assumed that our D.C. hotels would probably be a bit softer than we'd like because of the impact of that. Now as it relates to the question of around what government represents for us, I would tell you that all -- including group and transient and looking at government and government-related, so the contractors that are directly working with the government, we would generally put that somewhere in the 6% to 8% of our overall business. It would obviously be a bit higher in D.C. Now I'd also note though that this tends to be our lowest priced business. And so as we get to these higher levels of occupancy and we start to talk about mix shift, this is exactly what we're trying to shift away from, is government business. So the hotels have been focused on that, in general. And as a result, I hope that it will be less impactful than it may have seemed at first glance.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one other question. Just when I look at your leverage levels, you've certainly come down a little over a turn, over the past 2 years, but a lot of that coming from EBITDA growth. Has -- where would you like to see your leverage be as we get into later parts of the cycle and do you see the opportunity to lower your absolute debt levels from here?","W. Edward Walter","Overall, I think what we've been pretty consistent about saying is that we'd like to get to about 3x leverage. We're sort of -- comparing to where we were in the prior cycle, which was in the mid-3 range, and I'd say now thinking about appropriate debt-to-EBITDA levels, we'd like to get down to around 3x. I think the bulk of that will come from improvements in EBITDA, but it's conceivable that some of our asset sales may be applied over time to pay down debt.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Loeb from Robert W. Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And if I can throw a couple for Larry. Larry, on the pro forma quarterly information, if you could put that out sooner rather than just when you release the quarters, that would really help us a lot. Is that possible?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes, David. One of the issues is, obviously, is if we're in the process of selling assets and other things. So the comp set could change, so we're really focused on only really putting out one number one time, and not updating that for asset sales.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And given the pretty low interest rates in the debt market, would you consider doing the bond deal now even though it looks like use of proceeds would be some debt reduction now or later in the year, but given these rates, is that something that's enticing?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes -- rates are very good. We don't comment on individual bond deals in advance. Obviously, it's something that we look out on an opportunistic basis. And we also balance asset sales, proceeds, available cash and other things as we look at our debt needs. So it's something we continue to evaluate.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And, Ed, what do you think about a share buyback with the price in this range? And how do you evaluate accretion from that versus the opportunities, the returns you could get on acquisitions?","W. Edward Walter","Here's what I would say to that, David, is that, before, as we thought about share buybacks in the past, and I remember we had some fairly extensive conversations about this topic on a call, maybe a year or so ago. We generally would look to do that either from cash flow that we would generate from operations or from asset sales. So certainly, whenever we start to -- when we generate the cash flow or when we have asset sales, we tend to look at what our options are in terms of what we think is going to provide the best returns. Should we add the ballroom in San Diego? Should we buy a hotel somewhere? Or should we buy back stocks? So I'd say in general, that is something that we're always considering. I would add though that at this stage, I would say that we still, going back sort of to the prior question about leverage levels. We've been pretty consistent about the fact that we want to continue to reduce our leverage and make that balance sheet, which is already I think the strongest in our sector. We want to make it even stronger because we just think that will help our overall cost of capital and make us that much more competitive, as well as add a margin of safety in a sometimes cyclical business. So I would say we're probably a little bit more focused on the balance sheet goal than we would necessarily be on buying back stock. But a lot of that will kind of all tie in with exactly how many assets are we able to sell. And then in the context of that, what is the opportunity to -- where is the opportunity to reinvest those proceeds?","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And one more, if I can. What's your view on the acquisition market in Europe these days? Do you still have a significant advantage in terms of access to debt capital?","W. Edward Walter","I think we do. I think we do. What we've found on the portfolio that we acquired at the end of last year is that the combination of Host with the Government Investment Corporation out of Singapore combined with the large Dutch pension funds, APG, who is the third partner in that venture, that lenders seem to be far more interested in lending to 3 well-capitalized partners such as ourselves versus some of the other folks that might be active in the market. So while I know that it has been difficult, in general, to attract debt capital in Europe, we've been fortunate that we've been able to do it. And I think that continues to be an advantage as we look to acquire hotels in Europe.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And are there significant acquisition opportunities out there today?","W. Edward Walter","I would say that there are -- I wouldn't say that the pipeline in Europe or the opportunities in Europe are quite as many as what we would expect to see in the U.S. Of course, it's a smaller market in general in some ways, so that's not abnormal. But even adjusting for that, I would say there are fewer opportunities there, but there are a few. Our focus in Europe is really at this point primarily in Germany, because the portfolio is not well invested in Germany, and that represents a market we have wanted to get some exposure to. And then I also think that if we could find something that was priced appropriately, we'd be interested in buying into London. Although, we would probably prefer to be buying more off of '13 numbers than '12, given that the Olympics was there last year.","Operator","Our next question today is from Ryan Meliker from MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. And, Larry, I guess not to piggyback off of what David said, but I don't know if there's any way to get instead of the breakdown of EBITDA by quarter, maybe the calendar quarter total RevPAR levels through 2012 might help us in terms of modeling. I don't know if that's something we could get from you guys at some point. But then the other question I had was just if you had any way to quantify the impact that you think your maintenance CapEx had on your portfolio in 2012 that obviously will be a little bit more of a tailwind in 2013, that would be helpful, too.","W. Edward Walter","I guess on the first question, let me just say is that we will do our best to provide you guys with the best information we can on some of those issues. I mean to some degree, this is a very challenging exercise for Marriott and consequently, it becomes a challenging exercise for us, so we'll do the best we can to provide as much clarity as we can. As it relates to the impact of the capital improvements that we did last year on the kind of operations, I don't know that we really can give you kind of a hard number to say that last year it reduced RevPAR by a percent, because it's just so -- it varies so much by asset. Some assets it was hugely impactful and others, it wasn't. I do think that there -- it does provide more than just 25 or 30 basis points worth of wind as it relates to this year. But exactly what it will be is, frankly, hard to predict.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay. But more than 25 or 30, so at least it's material, which is helpful. And then, I guess, other question, you talked about this a little bit in response to your -- to the last question in Europe, but where are you guys focused in terms of acquisitions in 2013? Where do you think the best opportunities are? Is it in the U.S., is it Europe, is it resort, urban, full-service, select service? Where do you think Host will be spending its money?","W. Edward Walter","I would say as we -- if you did a quick tour of opportunities for us right now, our primary market that we're going to focus on is the U.S. And I'd say I think we've been pretty clear of late that we're really focused on a series of gateway markets. I think the market we'd be most interested in acquiring would be in Miami and then some of the California markets, where we are underrepresented. And I'd probably add Seattle to the mix, too, as another market that we would be interested in acquiring in. I think if you look outside of Europe or outside of the U.S., I already commented on where we would be interested in Europe, we are -- we continue to be very bullish on the Brazil market. The initial investment we have made in that market has performed extremely well, and so we would like to invest some more capital there. I think in that area on a full-service side, it would be in the form of acquiring existing assets because we would feel comfortable you could acquire those at discounts to replacement costs. We would also entertain 1 or 2 incremental investments in to-be-built properties that would probably be in the select service area because there is certainly a need for that in Brazil. When we look at Asia, the market that's most intriguing to us right now is Australia. The performance of the assets that we have acquired in Australia to date has been very strong. And as we look at how we expect Australia to perform going forward, I think we have a good understanding that demand will continue to grow. And fortunately, in those markets, somewhat similar to the U.S., supply is very low. And so that creates, in our minds, an opportunity for successful investment.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then since you mentioned development in Brazil. Obviously, you guys have the national property with White Lodging here in the U.S., any plan to do more development in the U.S.?","W. Edward Walter","The short answer is probably. I think we're looking at some opportunities right now. I think that if those opportunities would probably show up, it would be similar to the White Lodging example. Meaning that they would be in -- it would be urban limited service is what we would be looking to invest in. But I don't want to signal that we're about to engage in a big move towards development. I would view these as more isolated opportunities in target markets that I just identified. But not a thematic move on our part.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Harry Curtis from Nomura.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","How do you balance your appetite for growth versus shareholders' appetite for dividends? And as an adjunct, is there a target optimal size or locational mix that you're trying to achieve? And how much investment might it take to get there?","W. Edward Walter","Harry, I guess what I would say is on the first point is that the dividends usually, for us, is driven by what our taxable income is. So we typically not try to distribute more than what we have, what we're required to do. I imagine though, in the thinking down the road, there is clearly going to be a point in the cycle where we're going to conclude that it does not make sense to invest because the pricing is going to be too rich. And so -- and as -- if we're at that point where, hopefully, when the pricing is rich, that means that Greg and his team are actively selling a bunch of assets. So what will naturally happen as a result of that is that if we're selling assets, generating gains and not reinvesting the proceeds in new hotels, our dividend will increase because we will be dividending out the profits from asset sales. Now on the other hand, I think as we -- we have tried to be thoughtful about how our portfolio is positioned, and of course I would -- we've described a couple of times the fact that we're really, in the U.S., looking at a series of target markets. Just to make it clear to everybody where we're most interested in owning at this point, it's really Boston, New York, D.C., South Florida, Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, L.A. and San Diego. Those gateway markets are the markets that we think in the long run are going to outperform. We would like the bulk, but I don't think I'd say 100%, but certainly the bulk of our EBITDA in the U.S. to be coming out of those markets. I think we're at the point right now where we're probably at about 70% to 75% of our EBITDA coming from those markets. I'd like to see that percentage be higher. But at the same time, there are -- there are going to be -- there are some great hotels that we have that I think are more valuable in our hands than the sales prices that we might get. So we wouldn't be necessarily looking to exit those hotels until pricing improves in a material way. And I would also say looking down the road that despite the fact that we generally want to be in those target markets, I'm sure there'll be some opportunities that will turn up that we'll realize are compelling and so we'll decide to invest outside that. But I think overall, 80-plus percent in the target markets and something less than that outside of that would be -- makes sense to me today.","Harry C. Curtis - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And do you have any sense or any rough estimate of how much investment it's going to take to get you there, maybe net of divesting some of your less prioritized hotels?","W. Edward Walter","Harry, I think we could probably do it with just by reduction and reinvestment. I don't know that we have to grow. I generally have thought, though, over time that we are -- we would like -- as long as we think the growth is accretive, as long as we're generating NAV improvement, generating earnings improvement, which I would then hope would translate into share price improvement, we would generally be predisposed towards growth. But I do see -- I think you could -- well, you could certainly get there would via subtraction to.","Operator","James Sullivan from Cowen and Company has our next question.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Ed, I just want to make sure I'm clear on the adjusted EBITDA guide. I think your comments said that it included the impact of completed dispositions, but did not include any assumption for acquisitions, although at the same time, you do expect to be a net acquirer this year. Is that right?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, that's correct, Jim.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on the sale of the Atlanta Marriott, there was a $21 million gain in the first quarter and does the adjusted EBITDA number include that or exclude that?","W. Edward Walter","It does not include that.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally for me, you mentioned in your prepared comments, in terms of what gives you comfort on the demand side, continued good demand on international inward-bound travel. And I'm just curious if there are any leading indicators that you have that gives you comfort there in terms of say 2013, 2014 with demand continuing to grow from that segment?","W. Edward Walter","I think the only -- there's probably not an official publicly stated metric that -- and unfortunately a lot of the information around international travel tends to be very much delayed. But in talking with our asset management team and their conversations with the hotels, the feedback that we're getting is that we're still seeing a very strong influx of travelers from international markets, consistent with the sort of what we've been seeing over the past 24 months. So there's seeing that, whether it's Visa reform, whether it's greater wealth in those markets or in some cases better airlift, the bottom line is that the growth in international travel that we've been seeing since the great recession has sort of at least stopped going downwards, has still -- has been continuing.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then a final question for me, concerning your credit-rating. I believe you still have a split rating, and I'm curious, as you think about approaching the bond market, your bonds have traded as if they're investment-grade rated. And I'm just curious, if you -- if I'm right on that split rating, if you do become an investment-grade rated issuer, to what extent, if any, do you see some room for improvement in your spreads?","Larry K. Harvey","Being split-rated, Jim, we only picked up a little less than half of the improvement in our spreads than we'd get if we were purely investment-grade.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And you would estimate the improvement that you'd get if were investment-grade rated at how many basis points?","Larry K. Harvey","I'd say, at least 25.","Operator","We'll hear next from Susan Berliner from JPMorgan.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I just want to follow up, I guess, a little bit on that question. I guess, can you just comment where you stand on the rating agencies. And if you think that you should already -- according to our math, you should already be fully investment-grade rated? And I guess how important that rating is to you? And then another question, just when you look at the secured markets versus the unsecured market, what's kind of the differential in spreads there?","W. Edward Walter","The most important thing with investment grade is having access to capital. In very dire times, the high-yield market will shut down. They shut down for 9 months in 2008. So access to capital, it's also obviously cost of capital. At this point, where we could do a bond deal, call it in -- a 10-year at 4 \u00bc%. That's equivalent to basically where the life companies are, as well as CMBS. So they're all about at the same spot. So another way to look at that, of course, is that to the extent that we do end up with a dual investment rating then we would be borrowing at less than where we can if we're borrowing from the life companies.","Susan Berliner - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And I guess just with regards to the rating agencies, do you think you have all the metrics now that would get the rating agencies to move with the final upgrades?","W. Edward Walter","I think that -- it's probably hard for us to comment on that. Certainly, S&P -- both of the agencies took some sort of action last year. I think one was to literally upgrade us, the other was to change our outlook.","Larry K. Harvey","Giving a positive outlook.","W. Edward Walter","Positive outlook. So as you can well imagine, there's ongoing conversations with the agencies throughout the year. And I think with the fact that you're seeing some of these changes suggest that we've made good progress from their perspective. I think we would like to get the -- ultimately would like the benefit of cheaper debt with being fully investment grade. I think the bigger focus sometimes internally for us though is on making certain -- it's really on the broader balance sheet objective because we think the market has a tendency to pick up the benefit of the balance sheet in our pricing anyway. But at the end of the day, it will ultimately be beneficial to be investment-grade rated by both S&P and Moody's.","Operator","Our next question is from Carlo Santarelli from Deutsche Bank.","Carlo Santarelli - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but just really quickly, if you could talk about any specific markets where as you're out there looking to source deals, were things feel a little bit crowded either in the buy or the sell side?","W. Edward Walter","What you've seen this cycle, and it seems to me that it has been -- maybe you've seen this disparity to a greater degree, is that there has really been a focus on everybody on the debt side and on the acquisition side on the larger -- on the gateway markets, the markets that sort of come to mind first. In part because I think there's a general perception out there that those markets, the New Yorks, the D.C.s, the San Franciscos, are maybe a bit safer from a long-term perspective. And so that has clearly driven a lot of the acquisition activity and therefore the disposition activity over the course of the last 3 years. I -- we are hearing, but I don't know that there's any evidence of this yet, that folks are starting to -- both on the lending side and then on the investment side, are beginning to look at some of the next tier down markets. In some ways, I would look at our sale of the Atlanta Marquis as maybe a leading indicator of that. I think that, that was a great asset and -- but at the end of the day, that was a major sale both for us and for the buyer. And I think it's an indication of the fact that people are now starting to look outside of those markets. So it will be interesting to see, as you look at this year, how much more activity starts to happen in what previously were viewed as secondary markets.","Operator","Moving on, we'll hear from Bill Crow from Raymond James & Associates.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Ed, just a quick question. It seems to me, as we talk to investors, there's more of a focus on M&A potential today than there was 6 months ago, and I think it's just the pool of capital that's out there chasing deals, and sovereign wealth, et cetera. I guess my question is 2-part. To what extent as you look at the landscape are you interested in participating should we get another round of M&A activity? And if so, are you doing any homework at this point to be ready for it?","W. Edward Walter","Bill, I guess what I would say broadly is that we obviously have the scale to do larger transactions. And so we always are at least trying to be thoughtful about what potential transactions might be out there. We also know, though, that history has suggested that while we've done a couple of larger deals over the years, the reality is that we generally built the company one acquisition at a time. So in terms of how we're deploying resources and things like this at this point in time, it is emphatically far more focused on looking at the individual transactions that are out there, that are in our pipeline as opposed to necessarily looking at larger transactions that might fit into the M&A framework.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","But you wouldn't be averse to looking, is that a fair statement?","W. Edward Walter","I -- of course not.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just -- I don't think that you gave a comment on your expectations for RevPAR in Europe, in particular, in 2013. I know you have the company-wide, but I wonder if you could give just a little color. I imagine that's similar to what your North America ranges, but if you have commentary in Europe? And then also in North America, do you have any comments on corporate-negotiated rates and where they've ended up for 2013 and just whether that was better or worse than what you were thinking 2 or 3 months ago?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes. For the 18 properties, including the 5 we just bought, in constant euros it's 2% to 3% RevPAR growth.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That was in Q4, the 2%. That's also your expectation for 2013?","Larry K. Harvey","2% to 3%.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And the corporate...","W. Edward Walter","And then as it relates to the special corporate discussions, I think we're -- I think what we've generally seen is a plus or minus 5% to 6% in terms of special corporate rate increases. In part of -- what I will say in this area is that we bulked up in this area over the -- through 2009 and through 2010 and probably a little bit even in '11. Last year we didn't necessarily try to grow those relationships a lot, because we're looking for really trying to substitute in higher price business. And I think we've seen a little bit of a continuation on that theme. So the actual rate negotiations are probably in that mid-single digit area, but it -- we might see better performance in that overall, because some of the cheaper business is now not necessarily getting access to the hotels the same way it did a couple of years ago.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is that 5% to 6% a little bit lower than the kind of high single-digit range you might have expected for the year 2 or 3 months ago?","W. Edward Walter","I'm sure that we started -- our operators started off with a more aggressive position. But I think from our perspective, that's in line with what we thought would likely happen.","Operator","And that's all the time we have for questions today. Mr. Walter, I'll turn the conference back to you for additional or closing remarks.","W. Edward Walter","Great. Well, thank you all for joining us on this call today. I can tell from all of the reports I've seen lately that this has got to be an incredibly busy week for all of you.

You can find this information, together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer.","This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results and then will describe our current operating environment, as well as the Company's outlook for 2014. Greg will then provide greater detail on our third quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, here is Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee and good morning, everyone.","We are very pleased to report another quarter of outstanding operating results driven by strong rate in demand growth especially in group business. Strong F&B and other revenue growth, combined with improved flow-through and better than expected margin performance led to earnings results that exceeded our expectations and which allow us to improve our full year guidance.","We continue to feel quite good about the fundamentals in the business and our outlook, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. First let's review our results for the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA was $331 million for the quarter and $1.05 billion year-to-date. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 23% and exceeded a consensus estimate and our forecast for the quarter.","Our adjusted FFO per diluted share grew 36% to $0.34 per share for the quarter and stands at $1.10 year-to-date. These strong results were driven by several factors. First, our portfolio continued to achieve high occupancy levels of nearly 80% this quarter, our highest third quarter occupancy level since 2000.","The strong demand allowed our hotels to drive rate increases of 6.4% resulting in an improvement in comparable hotel RevPAR on a constant currency basis of 7.9%.","Looking at our total portfolio, pro forma RevPAR growth for the quarter was 9.2%. As Greg will describe in greater detail, our consolidated comparable international hotels continue to perform quite well, generating RevPAR growth of 11% in constant dollars in the quarter.","Our growth in the third quarter was driven primarily by strong demand in all of our group segments, especially our highly rated associated association group business, which increased nearly 14%. Our corporate business also performed well with a demand increase of more than 3.5%, complemented by a rate increase of better than 4.5%.","While group trends were favorable for the entire quarter, the calendar shift related to the Jewish holidays helped cause our September group revenues to increase by more than 15%, which was the second strongest month of the entire year. Overall group demand in the quarter increased nearly 6%, rate jumped by more than 4.5% and group revenues improved by more than 10.5%.","Not surprisingly the significant increase in group bookings limit the trends in occupancy, which declined slightly, but it positions the hotels to push trends in rate increases that average more than 6.5%, leading to transient revenue growth of more than 6%.","Benefitting from the strong group demand, our banquet and AV revenues increased 8.4% for the quarter, leading to total comparable F&B revenue growth of 6.1%.","The increase in banquet spending helped fuel better than 40% flow through in the food and beverage department, that combined with the rate driven RevPAR growth resulted in comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 305 basis points for the quarter.","Year-to-date we've seen constant currency RevPAR growth of 6.6%, which when combined with F&B revenue growth of 5.2% led to comparable total revenue growth of 6% and adjusted margin expansion of 155 basis points. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our results for the third quarter.","On the acquisition front, we continue to look for opportunities to increase our investment in our target markets. As we announced a few weeks ago, our European joint venture acquired a 90% interest in the 394 rooms Grand Hotel Esplanade in Berlin for a gross purchase price of \u20ac81 million.","The hotel is a short walk from the city's leading high-end retail street and strategically situated between the historic and the new sections of the city in proximity to many embassies. This acquisition further diversifies the current European JV portfolio, provides new exposure to a target market in Germany and created relationship with the talented local independent operator event holding group.","We also announced the acquisition of the B2 Miami Downtown Hotel for $58 million. The hotel is located in the heart of Miami's business and financial district within walking distance with the American Airlines Arena and situated on Biscayne Boulevard across from Bayfront Park ensuring that the hotel will continue to have unobstructed water views and long-term redevelopment potential.","I should note that the B2 Miami Downtown is heart of our broader strategic initiative to increase our exposure to third party operators and\/or independent or soft brands, in order to complement our existing portfolio of high quality brand manage assets in our target markets.","We intend to convert this hotel to a true independent brand and have brought in Destination Hotels and Resorts to operate the property. Acquiring properties with management and brand flexibility whether it's in the recently acquired Powell Street in San Francisco or the B2, provides us with increased exposure to the growing urban lifestyle boutique segment and allows us to further differentiate and diversify our product in a given target market.","Including the B2 Miami, we currently have seven hotels managed by third party operators and we're exploring opportunities for conversion to independent or soft brands with another three hotels we currently own.","On the disposition front, earlier this month we announced the sale of the $719 room Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel & Marina for $199 million, bringing our total sales for the year to nearly $0.5 billion. The sale of this property is consistent with our plan to reduce our exposure in non-core markets.","In addition, our European joint venture sold the Sheraton Skyline Hotel & Conference Centre for \u00a333 million. We continue to actively market properties and we expect to close on one or more transactions in the next few months with potential total incremental sales amounting to $50 million to $150 million. These contemplated sales will have minimal effect on our 2014 earnings.","Turning to our development and value enhancement projects, construction on the timeshare project at the Hyatt Regency Maui is nearly complete. It will include a 131 timeshare units, totaling nearly 240,000 square feet. It features an 8,000 square foot open air lobby with direct ocean site line, a 3300 square foot fitness center and owners lounge casual dining restaurant and pool side bar.","We contributed excess land at the hotel as well as cash and exchange for a 67% interest in the timeshare venture. Sales efforts began in October of last year and we will expect they will continue to ramp-up as we approach the anticipated mid-December resort opening.","We're also making progress on our development project in Brazil. The Ibis and Novotel hotels are substantially complete and in the process of final inspections and occupancy permit. The Ibis is scheduled to open in mid November. The Novotel should open in mid December.","Turning to capital investments, this quarter we invested approximately $28 million on ROI capital expenditures and invested approximately $57 million year-to-date. Several of these projects have included the conversion of underutilized space in our existing hotels to more profitable users.","For example, we completed the renovation of unfinished storage space on the 32nd floor of the Seaport Tower at the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego into two 2400 square foot meeting rooms with spectacular views. In addition, 11,000 square feet of meeting space is expected to be added across three other properties by yearend.","In total we invested approximately $8.5 million in these projects. I would expect to generate EBITDA lift of approximately $1.5 million per annum.","Other ROI projects include brand conversion such as the Sheraton Memphis Downtown. At this property, we are at the final stages of the assets rebranding effort, which includes a full soft and case goods renovation of the rooms, lobby, restaurant and public space, exterior facade, portico share, and various mechanical and fire light safety projects.","The hotel is now managed by Davidson Hotel Company, who has a deep understanding of the Memphis market. Since taking over management and completing the renovation plan, they have improved advanced bookings at this group oriented hotel by more than 38% at significantly higher rates.","And finally we continue to invest in projects, which reduce our energy cost. We have or are investing more than $17 million in two projects that are too large New York hotels, the Sheraton New York and the Marriott Marquis at Times Square.","It constructs low pressure boiler plants that will create steam that will create the steam we employ to heat the building and our hot water, allowing us to disconnect some of the local steam utility. Based on current utility cost, we would expect to save more than $3 million per annum from this investment.","For the full year, we would expect to spend $85 million to $100 million on redevelopment ROI and acquisition CapEx. We also expect to invest approximately $330 million to $345 million on renewal and replacement CapEx, including several large projects such as the meeting space renovations at the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego and the Grand Hyatt DC and room renovations at the JW Marriot DC, JW Marriot Houston, New Orleans Marriot and San Antonio Riverwalk Marriott.","These projects are scheduled for the fourth quarter to take advantage of softer demand period, but it worth noting that approximately 50% of our CapEx spending related to projects causing disruption to our hotels will occur in the fourth quarter.","Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. We're extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which exceeded our expectations in part because of the strength of our group production.","Following the pattern we experienced in the first half of the year, because of holiday shifts and renovation timing I just mentioned, we do expect a softer quarter from group business in the fourth quarter.","This will likely result in flat banquet revenues compared to last year where F&B revenue growth was quite strong. Offsetting the lower groups demand, our trend in demand looks quite solid through the remainder of the year.","Overall, we would expect that our second half of the year results will be better than the first half of the year, which allow us to increase our operating guidance for the year. With that in mind, we expect a comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year will increase 6% and 6.25% and comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin growth will be 120 basis points to 135 basis points.","These assumptions resulted in an EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA range of approximately $1,400,000 to $1,410,000, which represents an increase of $12.5 million at the midpoint and adjusted FFO per share guidance of $1.47 to $1.49, which represents an increase of $0.250 at the midpoint.","While it is premature to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR revenue growth for 2015, we do believe that the fundamentals for our business continue to be quite attractive. Low supply growth will remain a positive factor for the lodging industry with only a few markets trending above the longer term average.","Demand growth in the industry bolstered by robust international travel into the gateway markets has significantly outperformed the long-term average for the last three years, growing roughly at 3%.","If predictions of 3% plus GDP growth for 2015 prove to be correct, we think demand growth in 2015 could improve further. Domestic booking trends, adjusted to eliminate the impact of the Super Bowl in northern market are quite solid with both demand and rate up leading to booked revenue growth in excess of 4% and the first half of the year looks quite strong.","Perhaps more impactful both rate and room booked in 2014 for 2015 exceeds the prior year levels by approximately 5%. In fact our most recent activity in the third quarter for 2015 is even stronger with rate growth in excess of 10% suggesting momentum holding into the new year.","We expect to close 2014 with average occupancy in excess of 77%, which approaches our 2000 peak occupancy. As a result, we would expect that the bulk of our RevPAR growth going forward will be generated by increases in average rate and changes in business mix.","Overall we expect that 2015 should be another solid year for the industry, both the topline and bottom line. More to come on this front next February.","Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating performance in more detail.","Greg Larson","Thank you, Ed. I am pleased with our impressive quarter, which was highlighted by the strongest quarterly RevPAR growth in the last three years and outperformance in comparable hotel adjusted margin growth and an exceptional increase of 305 basis points.","Let me now provide our market results. Consistent with the last quarter, our Latin America hotel were the best performing hotels in the quarter with a 26% RevPAR increase. The World Cup final and the JW Mexico post-renovation lift continued to boost RevPAR for this region.","Based on certain group business in Mexico, that will not repeat in the fourth quarter and the interruptions of business during elections in Brazil this month, we do not expect the outperformance to continue into the fourth quarter.","The West region continues to outperform the portfolio with RevPAR growth of 8.9%, entirely driven by average rate and primarily a result of strong group business. Group revenues for the hotels in the West grew 11.4% enabling the hotels to drive rate improvement of 9.3%.","Seattle, San Francisco, Denver and Los Angeles performed the best with double-digit RevPAR increases. On a combined basis, these hotels grew RevPAR 13% with a combined rate increase of over 13.5%. Solid group business create a compression that allowed our managers to shift our mix into premium segment by limiting special corporate and discounted rooms. This allowed them to drive rates in these markets.","In the fourth quarter, we expect the hotels in San Francisco to continue to outperform our portfolio. We expect Seattle and Los Angeles to perform in line with our portfolio for the quarter and anticipate Denver will underperform the portfolio.","Phoenix also had high RevPAR growth of 8.7%, resulting from their successful strategy to drive transient occupancy that summer. Transient occupancy increased 7.4% and rate increased 5.1% for this market. Based on a strong booking pace, we expect the strength to continue in the fourth quarter.","Our Hawaii and San Diego markets underperformed the portfolio this quarter. The hotels in our Hawaiian markets were impacted by higher air fares during the summer, customer anticipation of two hurricanes in August and room renovations at the Fairmont Kea Lani. The San Diego hotels were affected by the meeting space renovation of the highest Manchester and the start of pre-construction efforts related to Marriott Hall at the San Diego Marriott.","For the fourth quarter, our San Diego market will continue to be impacted by renovations at these two large hotels; however, the hotels in Hawaii are strategically replacing group room nights with rated transient business and we expect that this strategy should result in outperformance in the fourth quarter.","The South Central region also posted great results with RevPAR of 7.9%. The hotels in this region had strong group performance as group revenues increased 11.9%. This led to food and beverage leverage revenue growth of more than 8% with an 11% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business.","The hotels in Atlanta and Chicago markets were the strong performers with RevPAR increases of 9.9% and 7.6% respectively. In Atlanta the four Buckhead hotels combined to grow both transient room nights and ADR by more than 7%.","Group volume growth of 8% was particularly strong in Chicago resulting in group revenue growth of 10.4%. We expect these markets to continue to outperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.","The weakness at our hotels in Houston this quarter was primarily due to weaker than expected transient business at the JW Houston and St. Regis Hotels. As you know Houston has been one of our strongest outperformers and these hotels space difficult comparisons compared to 2013.","Renovations at the JW Houston and Houston airport hotels will negatively impact the results for the Houston market in the fourth quarter. The East region reported a RevPAR increase of 6.6% with Boston up over 10% and Washington DC up 9%.","Strong transient business led to transient revenues of 15.3% and 12.6% respectively and drove the outperformance in these markets. Boston Hotels grew transient rate by 14.2% and strong September city-wide events in Downtown DC boosted transient ADR and Downtown hotels by 10%.","We do not expect the hotels in Boston or DC to continue to outperformance in the fourth quarter. Boston will have difficult comparisons from the World Series during the fourth quarter last year and renovations at the JW Marriot and Grant Hyatt hotels will negatively impact results for DC.","The hotels in New York underperformed the portfolio with RevPAR gains of 4.1%. In the third quarter, the hotels of New York experienced an 8.5% gain in group revenues, which led to a 24.4% increase in banquet and catering business. However, the hotels in New York continue to be impacted by select service supply inhibiting rate growth in that market. The hotels in New York will continue to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.","The hotels in our European joint venture also had an excellent quarter with comparable hotel RevPAR and constant currency up 4.1% and total revenues up 5.6%. Food and beverage revenues increased 11.3%, with banquet and catering revenues up over 23%. These results led to impressive EBITDA margin growth.","The RevPAR is driven by strong performance at the joint ventures hotels in Brussels and Spain. These two -- these hotels had double-digit total revenue increase and the two hotels in Spain had total revenue increase of over 20%.","The strong banquet performance at the European joint venture hotels was driven by increased corporate catering demand at nine of our hotels. Food and beverage profits at the joint venture hotels increased approximately 46%. These meaningful improvements in part are driven by the deep dives performed by our asset management team.","As you may recall from our Investor Day presentation, deep dives our productivity studies performed at our hotels to implement best practices found throughout our portfolio by examining daily routines and procedures to drive savings.","For example the deep dive analysis of the food and beverage operations at our Sheraton Warsaw resulted in the restructuring of food and beverage labor model which drove profitability at this hotel. The food and beverage margins improved 850 basis points at this property.","This hotel had negative RevPAR in the quarter posted a 90 basis point increase in its EBITDA margins. Another deep dive at our Sheraton Rome property led to over 1.4 million in annual savings also from restructuring, staffing mainly in the food and beverage operation.","We intend to continue to conduct additional deep dives at both our international and domestic properties to further improve the margins at our hotels. Speaking of margins, our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased an impressive 305 basis points in the third quarter as over 80% of the RevPAR increase was driven by strong ADR growth resulting in excellent rooms flow through of over 81%.","As described in our last quarter, RevPAR growth driven by strong ADR growth, combined with increases in our insurance and utility expenses have resulted in achievement of impressive operating profits margins.","A full year margin guidance of 120 basis points to 135 basis points anticipates that the third quarter adjusted margin will be stronger than our fourth quarter margin. However, on a half year basis, margin growth in the second half of the year will significantly outperform margin growth in the first half of the year.","As you may recall first half margins grew 80 basis points. We expect margins in the second half of the year to grow approximately 170 basis points. We're committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow.","We increased the dividend to $0.20 in the third quarter and intend to maintain that over the course of the next several quarters. If we are unable to identify appropriate acquisition candidates with which to execute a tax free exchange for the Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel, we will likely pay a modest special dividend for the fourth quarter.","In summary, we are very excited about the strong RevPAR and EBITDA performance driven primarily by group business, which enabled significant rate increases in many of our markets. This dynamic boosted our margins and resulted in outperformance this quarter.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we're now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we'll now take our first question from Andrew Didora from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Ed, maybe digging into your commentary a bit on the independent hotels, I guess why the shift right now in direction? Is this the right point in the cycle to do this?","And my second question around that is, I know you see some conversions within your current portfolio. But do you see the ability to maybe acquire and roll up more of these assets over the next 12 months or so? Thanks.","W. Edward Walter","As it relates to the shift to -- to look to purchase more of these, I think that sort of it ties in with our notion that we're trying to focus on a more limited number of markets, but then penetrate those markets more deeply.","As we look to execute on that strategy in many of those markets we already owned some of the best convention oriented hotels, or larger group hotels, so it's sort of a natural consequence of expanding our presence in those markets to look for hotels that might be in different segments of the business whether that be the urban select service or lifestyle boutique type hotel. So I think that's really what's driving that.","From a standpoint of future acquisitions and I think there is certainly given that as you can tell based on our recent history we're investing more in this area. We would certainly hope that we would be able to complete more acquisitions of this nature. It's not the easiest market to buy in right now. So we'll have to see what actually happens.","Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Understood. That's helpful. And then, maybe my second question for Greg, after the strong group results thus far, this year, where does your group currently stand as a percentage of your revenue mix? And how does that compare to last cycle?","Greg Larson","Andrew, if you look at our group business over a long period of time, it's usually right around 40%. At the peak of the last cycle, it was closer to 43% of our overall business and today it's closer to 37% of our business.","Andrew Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","Good morning, guys. Actually, just building on that brand manager strategy, comment, I'd like to broader focus on independent brand and managed hotels. The first part is, where do you see that going as a percentage of your overall platform down the road? And do you think you get there predominantly through conversions of existing hotels or is it through acquisition?","W. Edward Walter","While I am pleased that we've got a few candidates internally we should be able to convert I suspect that the growth will come more from acquisitions then it will from conversions within the portfolio.","Yes, it's hard to put a number on that and I think we would certainly be comfortable in the long run with that becoming 10% plus of the portfolio in some ways, but a lot of that's going to be driven by the ability to execute acquisitions and what we're able to get done in the near term in the market.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","And just a follow-up on maybe capital allocation is Host hasn't been necessarily a big acquirer, if you will, this cycle. Is it too late to undertake acquisitions of maybe sort of a large-scale institutional hotel, in your view?","And how do you weigh acquisitions at this juncture versus using your balance sheet capacity to instead return capital to shareholders versus -- via dividends or share repurchases?","W. Edward Walter","That's a great question. We feel good enough about the length of the cycle that I think we would be -- we certainly are evaluating and pursuing transactions whether they're of a boutique type nature, the independent type nature or our more traditional branded type of a hotel.","I think one of the challenges that we face though in going after those in each instance is the fact that we tend to look at things as we evaluate an acquisition over a 10-year timeframe and that has to -- when you're looking over that long of a period, you have to assume some period of time where operating results are a bit softer.","And so I think because we're taking that into account and that how we do that will vary by market, but how we take that into account, that I think put us maybe a bit of a competitive pricing disadvantage to folks you might be looking at more buying now and selling in their minds before the cycle turns.","And so that group which tends to use higher leverage and has a shorter holding period, I think is ending up being able to push pricing more aggressively than we would. So I think my shorter answer to your question is we would feel comfortable in buying. It would be based upon our conservative and disciplined underwriting criteria.","To the extent that we are not able to complete acquisitions like that, I think we've been pretty consistently saying for a while that we've been looking to invest outside the portfolio or inside the portfolio first on theory that drives better returns, but as we complete sales, those will naturally result in higher dividends because of the taxable income associated with those sales.","And to the extent there is not opportunities to otherwise invest in either in new -- existing or new hotels, we will be returning capital to shareholder either through a more dividend or by repurchasing stock.","Jeff Donnelly - Wells Fargo","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Michael Bilerman from Citigbank.","Kevin Barron - Citigroup","Hi. This is Kevin Barron with Michael. I just wanted to better quantify the renovation disruption in 4Q. Could you just give us a sense of what the RevPAR would be, backing out those hotels under renovation in the comparable portfolio?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we have a precise number for how it would hit that. I can tell you that just in terms of the disruption it creates in our group business for the fourth quarter though, our group business would probably be roughly 4% stronger if we didn't have the renovation disruption.","Kevin Barron - Citigroup","Okay. And then if you think about the group business momentum leading to more favorable mix shift, and then also in your opening comments you talked about the potential for better demand in 2015, we just wanted to get your thoughts on the potential for RevPAR accelerating next year from 2014 levels.","Greg Larson","I don't know I see it as a ability, the conditions that would require RevPAR to accelerate next year from the strong levels that we've experienced in the last couple of years I think tie to what are the two primary drivers of our business right now.","The two things that I think, the one would be the overall economic growth in the U.S. and secondly would be world-wide economic growth that helps generate international travel.","So as I highlighted in my comments, we've been very happy, very pleased with the overall level of international arrivals into the U.S. over the last several years and we believe that's been a primary driver and why demand over the course of the last several years has outpaced historical levels kind of on a relative basis to GDP.","So as we think about next year, we certainly are encouraged by the fact that once again most of the major forecasters are expecting stronger economic growth in '15 than what we've seen in '14.","I would caution that we probably said that for the last three years in a row, so hopefully '15 is the year that that materializes and then if we also see continued growth on the international front comparable with better than what we've seen, that creates a condition for overall stronger demand growth.","Supply does go up a bit next year not a lot. So we don't view supply as the near-term problem rather than a few markets, but overall I am not certain we would be sitting here expecting RevPAR acceleration for next year, but we certainly feel that we should see another strong year in the industry.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","And it's Michael Bilerman, I just wanted to follow-up on your comment about 4% in terms of the renovation, are you effectively saying, if group is call it 37% of the business which Greg did sort of said, that didn't have seasonal that wasn\u2019t in the fourth quarter that effectively there is a 1.5% drag on RevPAR just 4% behind what it normally would be? Is that effectively the math you want us to make? I just didn't know how to quantify what the 4% meant.","Greg Larson","Yes I think that's -- what I was trying to highlight is that our group bookings would be about 4% higher if we didn't end the fourth quarter if we didn't have the renovation.","So that it may not be too far off Michael. It's just that you got a trade off there that we will sell in some of that shortfall with Transient and so it's probably not quite as direct to what you have there, but that's probably directionally correct.","W. Edward Walter","I think that's right. As you know Michael, if we could, if group business was stronger that would also help us on the Transient side as well because really not except some of the weaker Transient and really push the Transient also.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Yes, and that would also all F&B and all the other\u2026","W. Edward Walter","That is correct.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","All right. So I just didn't know if you actually had an EBITDA number that we could sort of isolate for the fourth quarter where if he market disappointed with the fourth quarter guidance trying to put together the pieces that sort of get you from where the street was or where they were relative to where you think you're going to be? I think that's what we are trying to isolate?","Greg Larson","We don't have that number right now.","Michael Bilerman - Citigroup","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Greg Larson","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Rich Hightower from ISI Group.","Rich Hightower - ISI Group","Good morning, guys. A question on the disposition side -- I am wondering if you can tell us within the portfolio, what portion of the hotels are either unencumbered by brand entirely, or are so far along in the contract such as the breakage costs might be minimal to a potential buyer that might be interested in converting those to something else.","W. Edward Walter","Roughly about 40% of our domestic portfolio, we have either absolute contract flexibility or put it along the lines which you were describing very near term contract flexibility.","And I would tell you that we in most instances the reason we have that is because we've negotiated for it over the years, but nor surprisingly the bulk of that flexibility fits within the assets that are in non-core markets entirely or non-core sub markets within our target markets. So I think roughly 75% of the assets that we have flexibility on are assets that we could -- we would be open to selling over the next few years.","And we're well situated in part because over the years we've targeted to accomplish that to have contract flexibility for assets we would like to sell.","Rich Hightower - ISI Group","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the specifics there. And my second question concerns New York and D.C. Your revenue and EBITDA concentration in those two markets combined, I think it is still above 20%, maybe not as high as it was about a year ago.","But just over time, with the puts in takes in the portfolio that you\u2019ve talked about, where do you see the ideal concentration in those two markets in the future?","W. Edward Walter","I think over time we would be expecting to reduce our presence in New York. I don't think that as we look at these either some of our suburban assets in DC that we would be intending on selling, but we're not uncomfortable with the overall waiting in DC with using a long-term perspective, but I do think there is some reduction happening there. Over time I would like to see some reduction in New York too.","Rich Hightower - ISI Group","Okay. That's all for me.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Hey, good morning. You talked a few times high level about the setup for the U.S. lodging industry heading into 2015. Given you also have international exposure, can you just give us some initial thoughts there, too? Thank you.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I would say if you look at where we have our biggest international presence, it's Europe and I think generally Europe has been difficult to predict frankly because there are fits and starts to their economic recovery has been challenging.","I would point out though that one of the things that makes Europe a bit different than the U.S. is the importance of international travel throughout our European portfolio. Where in the U.S. we probably would think that plus or minus 20% of our demand comes from international travel. In Europe our portfolio probably gets 40% to 45% of its demand from international. So that helps pushing Europe from some of the weakness that we've seen in the economy.","Overall I think so far this year we're running around 3.5% or so in Europe on RevPAR growth. I would like to think that next year we will reach that level, but I think we're going to need to see a little bit more -- we will be interested to see what develops as we go through the budget process, try to have some better insight in the back.","Outside of that, I think in Latin America we probably will not see the same strength that we've seen this year for two reasons. One the World Cup will not be repeating in Rio De Janeiro -- in Brazil, which is going to probably drive those markets to be slightly down for next year and we've had extraordinary performance in Mexico City, but some of that's been construction delay meaning that we had construction the prior year.","So I would expect that Mexico we will see growth that's roughly comparable with folks are expecting in the U.S. And then in our assets in Australia and New Zealand we don't -- I would say there we're probably looking at may be single digit RevPAR growth.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Helpful. Thank you. And then, just one more question, playing devil's advocate here a little bit. Your RevPAR was up 8%, which is obviously very good and an acceleration from the trends we are seeing, but your peers saw it closer to 9%. Anything driving the slight underperformance for you guys versus them? Thank you.","W. Edward Walter","Again if you look at how our entire portfolio performed in the year and you include all of the assets in our portfolio and don't exclude some that we would typically exclude because of the way we approach issues around comparability, our portfolio ran at 9% in the third quarter also.","So I don't know that there was a big of a difference it may seem when you look at the numbers in a little bit more detail. I would say though maybe a little bit more broadly is that we're up against -- we're at this point now enjoying practically forever peak occupancy level and so one of the things that we're very focused on with our operators is looking drive rate.","And so a big part of our success next year is going to come down to our ability to drive rate in all forms of our business. We're quite encouraged by the improvements we were seeing in our bookings in our group business in 2014 and especially more lately I highlighted some statistics that overall rate in our bookings in 2014, 2015 was up 5% late in the third quarter, bookings in 2015 was up 10%.","As those trends -- if those trends continue and we certainly hope and expect that they will, that will certainly help us in pushing rate next year and that obviously is very beneficial on what it will do for the bottom line.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","So can one imply by those comments that you gave up a bit of occupancy index to drive rate index, which obviously benefited your EBITDA and drove the strong beat in the quarter?","W. Edward Walter","I suspect -- yes, I think if you -- compared to the broader market, not compared to our individual comp set, but compared to the broader market, I think the broader market had slightly more occupancy improvement because it starts at a far lower base than us, but we had better rate growth.","And at the end of the day, if I had a choice between the two, I would rather see higher rates.","Greg Larson","Yes, as you said Thomas, that's certainly powerful on the margin front and that's one of the reasons why our margins were up 305 basis points, which frankly probably I think that's our best margin growth in over a decade.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley","Yes congratulations. Okay. Thanks, bye.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Good morning, all. I have two questions, one on acquisitions and then one renovations. Ed, with the stuff you are looking to buy, single assets or portfolios, whether they are small or large, with what you are looking at right now would you characterize that as more fine-tuning your market and brand mix? Or is there anything in there that you would characterize as EBITDA needle movement?","W. Edward Walter","It's probably more the former than the latter. Obviously the real issue there comes down to scale and size of the acquisition and we certainly have the capability to do something larger, but I stand on what we've said for a number of years, which is we don't need to be bigger just to be bigger, it's really just about improving overall levels of growth and improving earnings per share.","So I think in the near term, it's always hard to predict the big deal is going to happen. We're certainly interested in looking, but I suspect that the more likely activity would be more along the lines of fine-tuning.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Got it. And then, with renovations, I know you are not providing anything on next year. But just given what you know about next year and the project CapEx and work that you are thinking about for next year, when you think about next year, do you think the renovation disruption in '15 is the same or less than what you have experienced in full year '14?","W. Edward Walter","I think we're going to have to wait until February to answer that. We obviously are having some disruption now. There are a couple of projects like what we will end up doing with the Philadelphia Four Seasons in converting that to a new -- a different brand or a soft brand and so things we're looking after some other projects that the actual way we proceed and whether or not there is an absolute closure of that hotel or not, will dictate to either whether the renovation effect next year is larger than this year or not.","So it's certainly something we're focused on and obviously the benefits of any projects like that to the extent that they do hit '15 we should start to see some good benefit of that in '16.","Joe Greff - JPMorgan","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Steven Kent, Goldman Sachs. Mr. Kent, your line is open.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Can you hear me?","W. Edward Walter","Now we can.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Sorry about that. Can you talk a little bit about your renovation schedule? I still don't completely understand how different it is versus the years before. And, also, and how it's going to affect you?","And then, the second is, you mentioned urban select service a couple of times. How do you see the portfolio mix between that full and select service over the next few years for Host?","W. Edward Walter","See I think there are a couple of points we were trying to make about the renovation activity. In general, the way this year is playing out, is that about 35% of our CapEx is happening in the fourth quarter.","So obviously on a weighted basis, that's a little bit higher, but more importantly as we step back and looked at which projects were being affected, we had a number of larger hotels and I had detailed them in my comments that we are undergoing either room renovations or somewhat disruptive meeting room renovations and those were happening in the fourth quarter.","When we look more broadly at the activity that was happening in the fourth quarter and we had noticed this and we were aware that last quarter as I highlighted in my comments that we expected some renovation disruption in Q4, which is one of the reasons we were saying Q3 would be stronger than Q4 as we were finishing out moving at the end of the year there.","We were saying that roughly half of the renovation CapEx that would be disruptive to our numbers EBITDA generation that's happening in the fourth quarter, I can't exactly compare that to prior years on the slide.","But it's certainly higher then where we were last year because last year we just had lighter construction activity weeks of a disruptive nature in the fourth quarter. So I think that's really why we were highlighting that here and it's highlighted in the prior quarter.","In terms of the growth of select service within our portfolio, it's still a very small percentage. I think the rate of growth will probably be meaningful in the sense that small numbers can easily be grown, but the reality is that in the near term, I don't think that it's going to rise to a significant part of our portfolio in part because these tend to be smaller properties too.","So when you are a $20 billion company, obviously you got to buy a fair amount of something just to move it up to a 1% or 2% of the size of the company. So absent a portfolio transaction, which I would generally say it's unlikely in this arena, it will grow 1% or 2% at a time.","Greg Larson","Yes, I agree with you Ed on the percentage because even if we are successful on acquiring several of these select service properties, at the same time, we could also invest in one or more upper upscale properties. So the percentages may not actually move much.","Steven Kent - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Helpful. Thank you. W. Edward Walter","W. Edward Walter","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Anthony Powell form Barclays.","Anthony Powell - Barclays","Hi. Good morning. On the stats you gave 2015, were they pace stats for overall or for group? And if they are for overall revenue, could you provide some color on how the group pace is trending for next year?","W. Edward Walter","Those stats that we gave on the call were relative to group ","Anthony Powell - Barclays","Got it. Great. Thank you. And just on the Orlando asset, it seems like that's ramping up pretty well. Could you give us an update on where you are in that ramp up, after the renovation, and how much incremental growth that could drive maybe next year?","W. Edward Walter","At this point we have finished all of the construction work at the Orlando asset. I think that some of the side work that we had -- that was so disruptive to operations was completed in the first quarter this year, but the remaining -- my sense in general is that the remaining three quarters of the year for that asset is generally not affected by construction.","So I would say that we've had very big lift this year from that asset in out of its construction site and had its work done. I suspect we will get some minor lift in the first quarter of last year and after that it should be more normalized.","Greg Larson","Yes, I think that hotel, it will have a good year next year and because of that, when we think about our hotels in Florida next year, those hotels should outperform our portfolio.","Anthony Powell - Barclays","And, one final one on the Marriott Marquis in New York. How is the retail and the signage construction going? And how much incremental EBITDA could that generate next year? Thank you.","Greg Larson","Again it's early to speculate on the actual impact of EBITDA next year because we're not exactly the marketing process has gone extremely well, but having said that Vornado has not announced any signed leases yet.","But from a construction perspective we've talked previously about a $10 million to $12 million benefit rolling from the completion of that improvement. We'll see some of that next year, but it's more likely the full benefit of that is more likely to hit '16.","From a construction perspective, my understanding is the sign is virtually complete and I think that there is probably going to be more noise and more press around that in the middle of next month, but we couldn\u2019t be happier with how that whole process has gone.","We couldn\u2019t have been happier with having Vornado as a partner here and we're very excited to get the sign operational, get the retail space leased and open and a lot of the hotels have started taking advantages of those new outside observatory jacks that will sit on top of the sign.","Anthony Powell - Barclays","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Ryan Meliker from MLV & Company.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","Hi. Good morning, guys. I just had a quick question. Most of mine have been answered. But I was hoping you could give us some color on the acquisition market and types of things you are looking for.","Obviously, you guys have done a good job being particularly disciplined this year and last year as well, with regards to acquisitions, given where cap rates are and values have really grown. But, what you have bought and what it seemed to indicate in your press release, is that you might be a little more focused today on some smaller independent assets in gateway markets.","I am just trying to figure out how you balance acquisitions of those types of assets with a like-kind exchange for a $200 million Tampa asset. Are you guys are going to be stretching valuations to try to find a like-kind exchange so that things work out from a taxation standpoint, or are you less likely to do that? Just help me think about the implications of that like-kind dynamic. Thanks.","W. Edward Walter","Sure. I think as I suggested earlier, the market is competitive. I say that we have an active pipeline of deals that we're reviewing, but compared to that I might have looked at the well four years ago. My assessment of the probability that we actually complete those transactions would suggest that we will -- our hit rate is going to be a lot lower now than it was earlier in the cycle.","I don't think there is anything about that that's unexpected that's what you would naturally expect as you work your way into the cycle that a lot of capital plays to the party and then tends to pay bigger prices, that's one of the reasons why we're active seller right now and we tend to be an active seller.","As you think about the right king of exchange element of this, I think that your question is a great question and the short answer is that we're not going to stretch on purchases, jut to complete the right kind of exchange.","Now I think we're not uncomfortable in paying a higher dividend. We're not uncomfortable in generating proceeds from deals and using that to either pay more of a dividend or buyback stock if that's the right answer. And so the reality is that I mentioned before, we're comfortable with the scale of the company. We're trying to refine the markets that we operate in.","If the deal fits our parameters or presents a unique opportunity, then we're going to -- we would be happy to be an investor, but on the other hand to the extent that we don't, we're fine looking for ways to return capital or looking for other ways to return capital.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Company","Got you. It is good to hear that the like-kind dynamic isn't a driver of acquisitions. That's all for me. Nice quarter. Thanks a lot.","W. Edward Walter","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question with Chris Woronka from Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","Hey. Good morning, guys. Just want to ask you, as you look up and down your portfolio, and certainly you have a number of kind of the large battleship and group hotels, but as you look at some of the smaller ones in nonunion markets, are you guys kind of evaluating any opportunities to almost convert those to limited service? That seems to be kind of where we are trending as an industry and just wanted your sense as to what is possible within your portfolio.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, it's an interesting question Chris. You know what I would say is that I don't know that we would think about converting them to limited service in the sense of down branding them because I doubt that the risk on the rate would be worth that, but what we are trying to do and certainly this is something we've been trying to do for a while is try to pick up some of the best elements of limited service operation and apply them to our hotel.","So in another words where we have hotels that in-house managed or operator managed food and beverage we're looking at opportunities to outsource that food and beverage platform or consolidate that food and beverage platform.","So it doesn\u2019t make it a select service or limited service hotel, but what it does is to the extent that we can outsource that or reduce the importance of that to the hotel, we're at least looking at a way or trying to identify ways to improve our margins and reduce our risk on the food and beverage side, so that more and more of our hotel is based on the rooms operations, which is we all know tends to generate higher levels of profitability.","So there are a few specific instances in our portfolio over the years where we have made the decision that best thing to do was to covert a Marriott to a courtyard and I think that's happened a couple of times.","But generally I don't think that's going to be the preferred route, but looking for ways to modify the operating model to make the hotel more efficient to king of capturing the best of the limited service operating platform, while maintaining the full service rate. That's the strategy we would like to push wherever it makes sense.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","Sure. Great. Understood. And then, just as we think about the New York market, from where we sit, we probably think that the supply maybe is having more of an impact on the Marquis, given the number of rooms. Is that a fair assessment? And is it a very significant impact if we looked at New York RevPAR ex-Marquis?","W. Edward Walter","No I wouldn\u2019t say that the Marquis is really struggling at all because of flex servicing let's say. The level of supply in New York has been high and I would say the entire New York market has felt some impact from the supply and I think most folks would describe that less about a occupancy problem and more about a challenge in being able to raise rate.","But to be honest, the hotels like the Marquis that can accommodate larger groups and plus have that kind of a ground zero location within Times Square, we're still running comfortably north of 90% at the Marquis, which is where we've been running for the last several years.","So I don't think I actually think that our in a lot of ways that you look at our performance was in New York. We've been doing slightly better than the market for the last two years and I think we're less affected by a lot of our select service supply that has come into New York then some other hotels might be and partly because we have the customer base for our key hotels is far more diversified than what a flex service hotel typically attracts.","Greg Larson","And you can that even in the third quarter Chris, where our RevPAR in New York was up 4.1%, which obviously outperformed the star data for New York.","Chris Woronka - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question with Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Group.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. And forgive me if this question relates to something you may be addressed in your prepared comments, Ed, but on the four seasons in Philadelphia, I am not sure if you\u2019ve finalized your budget or your plans there, so whatever you can give us in terms of an update on timing and cost for that conversion.","W. Edward Walter","Jim we don't have that completely finalize right now. I would broadly say that the direction we're leaning there is going to be an independent hotel, but likely soft branded. It will be affiliated with one of the major brands and the exact timing for when we will start construction is not yet set, but I suspect that some of that work will start sometime in the middle of next year.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","And do you have some preliminary budget or some range that you could share with us?","W. Edward Walter","Not at this point in time. We're still working through that with the operator that we're working with.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. The second question, just a minor question on the management fee. That line item group grew more than hotel revenues. Is that attributable to IMS in the period and can you give us an outlook for IMS as we go forward in what's a fairly robust topline environment?","Greg Larson","Hey Jim, this is Greg. I think if you look at our management fees this year, I think in general obviously base fees have been increasing. I think that this year in particular incentive management fee year-to-date the increase has been fairly minimal and there are several reason for that.","And Ed mentioned earlier in this call, we've had several negotiations with certain managers where we've been successful in sort of minimizing incentive management fees for this year.","So I think when you look at it, our incentive management fees in the first half of the year were actually down on a year-over-year basis and in the second half of the year, our incentive management fees will be up around 4%.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","And when you look out to next year, I know obviously you're not giving guidance for next year in this call, but the environment is very positive. Supply in most markets, while it is increasing, remains below demand growth. Should we be assuming that IMS will increase for the full year next year, too early to say?","Greg Larson","I think next year as you said, I think a lot of people including us were expecting very good results for next year on the topline and with EBITDA growth and I think with great EBITDA growth, we'll have sort of what I would consider normal incentive management fee growth next year.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. And a follow-up question on the earlier question about Europe. I wonder if you could talk to us about acquisition pricing in Europe, how it's moved this year versus acquisition pricing in the U.S. ","And, as you think about the comparative growth rates over the next one to two years, how strong your appetite is? I know you just announced an acquisition in Europe, but how strong your appetite is to do more acquisitions over the next -- over the coming quarters?","W. Edward Walter","Pricing in Europe is probably one way to think about it might be the cap rates there are 100 to 150 basis points higher in at least in the markets that we've been focused which would be Germany relative to what we're seeing in the U.S. pricing in London and in Paris is probably comparable to pricing in the best markets in the U.S. and so very aggressive.","Now I think you're looking at sort of in the 4% to 5% range as it relates to cap rates for either in those markets. Given that our outlook for Europe would be for slower growth than what we would be expecting in the U.S. there is -- one of the reason why we are buying in Germany is we generally think that Germany will have better growth that the rest of Europe and we think the pricing levels make more sense relative to opportunities we might see elsewhere.","I think that both Paris and London while they are spectacular long-term markets, but right now their capital is aggressively seeking assets in those markets is one of the reason why we sold the Sheraton Skyline and the pricing levels there are such that we would not view that as a good allocation of capital in the near term absent an unusual situation to be able to meaningfully create value at the hotel.","I think our we're in the process of marketing some other hotels in Europe, but we're actually trying to take advantage of some of the optimism that the broader world has in terms of investing in European hotels to see if we can reduce the size of our portfolio.","We're still interested in acquiring more, but it will be fairly selective in terms of the markets that we will enter.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. Just to kind of follow up in terms of what you just said, obviously, the long-term debt markets are very favorable in Europe. How do you balance the appeal of that with the desire to sell assets? We tend to think that assets that are not encumbered by debt are easier to sell. How do you balance those two contradictory factors?","W. Edward Walter","That's a good question. Now as we stand currently, in Europe we tend to approach our financings on an asset by asset basis, but to some degree we're not forced to confront that issue in part because we've dealt with all the financings that we need to address over the course of the last couple of years.","We've also built in the flexibility and most of those financings to be able to sell some of the assets earlier. Financing that offer tends to be shorter term than what we will typically see in the U.S. and what we would typically employ in the U.S.","So I think that we're looking at the not unlike the way we're thinking about some of the assets we would like to in the U.S. but back in the financial markets have gotten a bit more aggressive and certainly I would say that the delta in Europe is even larger than what we've seen here not that they\u2019ve gotten that much cheaper than where we are in the U.S., but the delta compared to last year they\u2019ve got a lot cheaper.","We're sort of a mind this is a good time to try to take advantage of that which is why we're marketing some of our properties there. We're not looking to sell our best assets, but I would say we're looking to sell some of the middle of the pack.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. And then finally for me and I think this is a Greg question, Greg, I wonder if you could walk us through the reasons for the difference between the $69 million positive impact of the litigation reserve reversal and the $59 million add back to get to the adjusted EBITDA?","Greg Larson","Yes, so Jim as you know we're fortunate enough to win the San Antonio case. So we're in a great -- because of that we're not going to have to put out $70 million, which is a good thing. We had $25 million in the restricted cash account that was now back in our hands.","So we're pretty happy to say the least. The other thing that happens as you pointed out is that there is a GAAP impact of $69 million, so you'll see that when you look at our GAAP earnings, but from an EBITDA perspective the impact is really, really just the interest that we've been accruing on this year.","So we've reversed out the interest from this year and then we have some interest accruals from last year that also will flow through EBITDA and so as you correctly point out in total for San Antonio the $10 million EBITDA benefit, but the flip side to that is we have an increase in other litigation expense and so net, net when you take into account that benefit and the increase in the accrual on other litigation expense it's approximately a $4 million EBITDA benefit.","And as you know, that's not -- that's not hotel EBITDA right and so obviously $4 million helps our entire EBITDA for the company, but had no impact on our margin growth -- hotel margin growth of 305 basis points.","Jim Sullivan - Cowen and Company","Okay. Very good. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll now take our next question from Wes Golladay, RBC.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Hey everyone. Can you give us an update on the supply and demand picture for group on the prime nights for group? Are you seeing the ability to push some of the group business to the softer nights?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, that one of the interesting challenges that we have as we get into this part of the cycle is that given how robust transient demand has been in a number of markets and given the fact that so many of our hotels are running very high occupancies in the middle of the week and on Saturday.","And part of what's happening on the group side now is trying to -- try to push that business to what we would describe as a shoulder night. So it's hard -- we actually had an extensive discussion about that when we were going through our quarterly review with our asset management team and I wish I had a statistic to be able to describe how successful we're being with that, but the reality is that clearly for business being booked now for '15 and '16.","Greg Larson","Yes, it's a great situation to put the group in a weaker time because you know what, when you do that, sometimes it could skew the rate growth that we are talking about for next year because if you're booking during the weaker time, that's a great outcome and allows us to book transient business in a stronger times, but if you looking at year-over-year rate growth in group, that obviously will impact and lower than number.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And can we go back to the Marquis asset? When will you guys be able to discuss the numbers more and the opportunity to dispose of the asset for the signage in retail? Is there a time we can get more color on that?","Greg Larson","You mean as it relates to our options around exercising some ability to be able to sell the retail itself.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Yes.","W. Edward Walter","To be honest, there is no reason for us to do anything there until we're comfortable that we have Vorando because they're in control of this and so Vorando has maximized the benefit of the retail space in this signage.","So the retail space I would assume will get leased over the first part of next year, the signage part of this, the retail will not be taking all of the signage. So I think there is going to be some period of time where they continue to market the signage and users get comfortable with the fact that we've now created -- or they\u2019ve created that they get TV screen in one of the best market in the world from a publicity perspective.","So I don't think that this is anything that we're going to be moving forward aggressively on in the near term in part because I think there is a big opportunity here and we would love to see that maximize it before we try to exercise any right.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. As we get to the opening of that, though, can you talk more about the value creation as maybe where you see it value at once it is opened? Or, it seems to be an ignored asset for you guys right now.","W. Edward Walter","Well, it's not an ignored asset from a perspective of what it does for EBITDA, but I think it's a good question we could try to provide more color on that in the future.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot everyone.","W. Edward Walter","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time and I would now like to hand the call back to Mr. Ed Walter for any closing remarks. Please go ahead sir.","W. Edward Walter","Great. Well thank you for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results and outlook with you and we look forward to talking with you in February to discuss our yearend results and provide much more detailed insight into 2015.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Evony. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filing with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide his remarks on our fourth quarter and full-year results, our 2018 achievements, including the acquisition of the One Hotel South Beach and conclude with our capital allocation strategy and outlook for 2019.","Michael Bluhm, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide commentary on our fourth quarter and full-year performance, including markets, margins, balance sheet and our guidance for 2019. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Risoleo","Thank you, Gee, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report another quarter that exceeded our internal expectations on both the top and bottom line and beat consensus estimates for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share.","We finished the year strong with fourth quarter comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth of 2.3% and an increase in comparable hotel EBITDA margin of 45 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre was $372 million for the quarter and adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.43, beating consensus estimates by $8 million and $0.02, respectively. 2018 was a solid year for Host with comparable RevPAR growing 2% and gross margin growing an impressive 60 basis points.","This resulted in a 3.4% EBITDAre expansion to $1.562 billion and a 4.7% increase in adjusted FFO per share to $1.77. We had a consistent beat and raise year with margins, EBITDAre and FFO, all coming in well ahead of the top-end of our initial guidance provided last February. We beat the midpoint of our original RevPAR guidance by 50 basis points, margins by 80 basis points, EBITDAre by $62 million or 4% and adjusted FFO per share by $0.12 or 7.3%.","These strong results continue to underscore the advantages of our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels, our unprecedented scale and platform to drive internal and external growth and the power and flexibility of our investment-grade balance sheet. Together, these key pillars form the foundation of Host, the premier lodging REIT.","As noted in our press release, 2018 was an incredibly active and successful year across several fronts. In addition to achieving industry-leading margin improvements, we advanced our long-term strategic vision and executed on several important initiatives that we believe better position our irreplaceable portfolio to continue outperforming the industry and creating value for Host Hotels' investors.","We sold non-core assets, including those profitability-challenged in New York as well as our international assets, all at attractive pricing and reinvested a portion of that capital into higher growth, low CapEx need assets to create long-term stockholder value.","On the disposition front, we actively reshaped the composition of our portfolio by following through on two key initiatives we setup early on in my tenure as CEO; reducing our exposure to New York and exiting our international assets to focus our attention on the U.S., where we have the greatest scale and competitive advantage.","In total, we executed on $2.2 billion of non-core asset sales, since the beginning of 2018, at a combined EBITDA multiple of 21x. As it relates to New York, on January 9, we closed on the previously announced sale of The Westin New York Grand Central for $302 million, inclusive of the FF&E reserve.","With the completion of that sale and including the New York Marriott Marquis retail and signage, we sold over $1.1 billion in the New York market or 25x EBITDA. As a result, we have reduced our percentage of hotel EBITDA from New York to less than 7%, significantly eliminating our exposure to profitability-challenged assets in the market.","On the international front, we closed on the sale of our 33% interest in our European joint venture to our two former partners, for a growth asset value of our interest of approximately \u20ac700 million and an EBITDA multiple of 17x on 2018 results. After accounting for fund level debt, we subsequently used a portion of the net proceeds of approximately \u20ac435 million to repay the outstanding \u20ac207 million draw on our credit facility, which was drawn to hedge our equity interest in the venture.","We also sold the JW Mexico City for $183 million or approximately a 15x EBITDA multiple on 2018 forecasted results. We previously held a 52% interest in the hotel in a joint venture with Marriott International. As a result of these two sales, approximately 1% of our EBITDA now comes from outside the country with only two hotels in Canada and three hotels in Brazil.","2018 was also an exciting year from an acquisition standpoint, as we further enhanced our irreplaceable portfolio by adding four world-class assets. As many of you know, we purchased three iconic and irreplaceable hotels from Hyatt in March of 2018; the Andaz Maui, Grand Hyatt San Francisco and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point in Florida.","These hotels had outperformed our underwriting and based on our 2019 budget, are currently yielding 70 basis points higher than where we initially purchased hotels last spring. This translates into a 14% growth in net operating income.","In addition, and as noted in our press release, we recently closed on the acquisition of 1 Hotel South Beach in Miami, Florida for $610 million. This extraordinary resort is located on prime beachfront real estate in the vibrant South Beach area Miami Beach, has no near-term CapEx needs and carries a RevPAR of over $488 and total RevPAR of $764, making it one of the top three in our portfolio.","Additionally, it is LEED-certified, has some of the largest guest rooms in our portfolio, over 160,000 square feet of meeting space, restaurants, pools, luxury retail space and other amenities. The property generated $45.8 million of EBITDA in 2018 or 13.3x our purchase price. This equates to $107,000 per key.","Based on our 2019 budget, the purchase price equates to 13x EBITDA and EBITDA per key of over $109,000. The 1 Hotel is expected to add $36 million in EBITDA and $0.05 of FFO per share in 2019. Our ability to convert high EBITDA multiple asset sales of non-core, high CapEx and profitability-challenged hotels into a resort of this caliber, was materially improved the overall portfolio, is an excellent example of disciplined and prudent capital recycling.","Another exciting accomplishment in 2018 was our agreement with Marriott International to execute a portfolio of transformational capital projects, beginning last year with the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and carrying through 2021. As we have described these portfolio investments will position the targeted hotels, which are some of the most notable in our portfolio to compete even better in their respective markets with the goal of enhancing long-term performance and becoming number one in their competitive sets.","Notably, Marriott will provide operating profit guarantees as protection for the anticipated disruption associated with the incremental spend and increased priority returns on the agreed upon investments, which will result in reduced incentive management fees.","We believe this is a great high return use of shareholders' capital, as transformational capital projects have typically resulted in meaningful increases in RevPAR yield index, which translate to strong improvement in EBITDA.","Turning to our capital structure. We entered 2019 with the strongest balance sheet in the Company's history, providing us with substantial flexibility to continue executing on our strategic initiatives.","Michael will discuss this in further detail, but on a high level with leverage at only 1.8x, over $1.2 billion of unrestricted cash after accounting for the sale of The Westin Grand Central and the acquisition of 1 Hotel South Beach and $945 million of capacity available under our credit facility as of the end of the year, we are well positioned to continue driving stockholder value.","Finally, in 2018, we listened to your need for greater transparency and insight into our business. We overhauled our investor presentation and added enhanced supplemental financial information that provides property level detail into the top hotels that drive our overall performance.","Looking forward, we are off to a strong start to 2019 with the acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach and the sale of The Westin Grand Central. In addition to acquisition and disposition opportunities, we will continue to mine the portfolio for value enhancement projects, including the extension of ground leases and looking for redevelopment opportunities where we can either take advantage of underutilized spaced or redevelop an area from the ground up.","As we contemplate future capital allocation, we continue to be very disciplined with respect to both our underwriting and balance sheet position. Given the $1.2 billion of cash on hand and 3x being the high-end of our leverage target range, we have total investment capacity of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.","We do not intend to move higher than our targeted leverage range, nor do we intend to invest beyond that capacity. As there has been recent speculation about Host, I want to be clear that while we are always open to opportunistically looking at value enhancing assets, we are not focusing on pursuing large scale portfolio acquisitions at this time.","We are very happy using our current investment capacity to make smart, targeted add-on acquisitions, like the 1 Hotel South Beach announced today, to invest in our portfolio, as we are doing with the Marriott transformational capital program or to buyback our stock.","We remain focused on acquisitions that have a high return and complement our iconic irreplaceable portfolio. We are thrilled with the portfolio we have today, which we believe is the best in the industry, but we'll continue to opportunistically prune it to maximize value for shareholders.","As always, our team is laser focused on maximizing portfolio operations in what remains a stable operating environment with positive fundamentals, albeit in an environment that is now 10 years into the current cycle.","As we sit here today, the U.S. economy continues to exhibit strength and appears supportive of industry growth. Importantly, the economic indicators we follow closely, including corporate profits, non-residential fixed investment and consumer confidence, while slightly lower than last year, remain quite strong relative to historical levels.","Specifically, corporate travel demand improved in 2018 and is anticipated to remain stable in 2019. And while the growth in non-residential fixed investment is anticipated to slow, it is still healthy and we anticipate it will remain that way. We expect leisure travel to continue to grow, but at a slower pace, supported by strong consumer income growth, solid employment and healthy sentiment.","On a macro level, we continue to monitor the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, the ongoing global trade dispute including its impact on businesses' willingness to invest and the performance of the overall global economy.","While a modest 2019 GDP deceleration is why we anticipated as the near-term benefits of the Tax Cut paid and the government shutdown gave the industry a slower start than we otherwise would have expected, we believe that overall industry fundamentals are on solid ground.","Taking all that into account, our initial guidance, our comparable RevPAR growth of 0% to 2% and comparable EBITDA margin guidance of minus 50 to plus 10 basis points results in adjusted EBITDAre of $1.515 billion to $1.580 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.72 to $1.81.","While our headline RevPAR is impacted by approximately 45 basis points from the incremental capital expenditures we are making this year related to the Marriott transformational capital program, because of the operating profit guarantees we are receiving from Marriott, we were able to mitigate the impact on the bottom line.","Included in our EBITDA guidance is an estimate of $23 million for the operating profit guarantee, $10 million of which is associated with comparable RevPAR. We remain focused on our bottom line results, which we continue to think will set the standard for the lodging REIT space.","Given our optimal group and transient mix, we are pleased with our position going into 2019. 2018 was a record year for group room nights, with over 5 million group rooms booked for the year. For 2019, total group revenue pace is up 1.4%.","We continue to see the group booking window extend and revenue pace is up almost 7% for the period 2020 to 2023. From a capital standpoint, we anticipate spending between $235 million and $275 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures and between $315 million and $350 million of redevelopment and ROI projects this year.","The increase over last year is primarily due to the Marriott transformational capital program for which we are being well compensated. Some major renovation projects to be completed this year includes the San Francisco Marriott Marquis, New York Marriott Downtown, Coronado Island Marriott Resort, the Santa Clara Marriott and the Whitley in Buckhead Atlanta.","Before handing the call over to Michael, I would like to reiterate that we are very pleased with yet another beat quarter, as it under - again underscores the strength and advantages of our premier lodging REIT. We are also pleased with our ability to continue to outperform on margins, despite the fact that we are in a lower RevPAR growth environment with strong employment.","Our diversified portfolio of irreplaceable assets, our unmatched scale and platform and our investment-grade balance sheet, all position us to continue to outperform in the near, medium and long-term. We will remain disciplined in our approach to capital allocation.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will discuss our operating performance and balance sheet in greater detail.","Michael Bluhm","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Building on Jim's comments, all of us at Host are pleased with our beat-and-raise performance in 2018 and a strong finish to the year. Through active portfolio management over the last 12 months, we've ensured that the Company is stronger than ever and well positioned for continued profitable growth. With that, let's discuss the details of our results.","Our comparable RevPAR for the fourth quarter on a constant currency basis increased 2.3%, driven by a 2% increase in average rate and a 20 basis point increase in occupancy. Stronger than expected group business enabled us to compress business and grow RevPAR predominantly by average rate.","We expanded our comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 45 basis points in the quarter, due to a combination of our internal initiatives and the continued benefits accruing to us from the Marriott-Starwood merger. These results led to adjusted EBITDAre of $372 million and adjusted FFO per share of $0.43, which exceeded both our internal and consensus estimates.","For the full-year, comparable RevPAR on a constant currency basis increased 2% with an impressive margin expansion of 60 basis points. Adjusted EBITDAre increased 3.4% to $1.562 billion and adjusted FFO per share increased by 4.7% to $1.77.","Turning to the segments of our business, while some transient room nights were displaced by group, the holiday calendar was less favorable for transient business travel. Group demand exceeded our expectations as revenues grew 5.6% in the quarter, driven by volume growth of 2.9% and a 2.6% increase in average rate. October and December saw significant group room nights with corporate and other group revenues growing 4.8% and 14%, respectively in the quarter.","Finally, our asset managers and enterprise analytics team in collaboration with our managers, continued to drive comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth and generate impressive profitability at our properties at this stage in the cycle.","In the fourth quarter and for the full-year, EBITDA margins grew 45 basis points and 60 basis points, respectively due to productivity gains in the rooms and F&B department and synergies from the Marriott-Starwood integration in particular reduce travel agency commissions and loyalty program expenses. We continue to believe the benefits from the Marriott-Starwood merger will generate 40 basis points to 50 basis points of incremental margin improvement annually for the near-term.","Turning to our individual markets. Our best performing domestic markets were Miami, San Antonio, San Diego and Seattle, all of which had double-digit RevPAR growth in the fourth quarter. RevPAR at a Miami hotels increased over 31%. The significant outperformance was due to the 200-plus rooms at the Miami Biscayne Bay Marriott that came back online after being out of service last year following Hurricane Irma.","The Miami hotels improved average rate by 8.5% and expanded occupancy by 13.8 percentage points through strength in both transient and group business, which also contributed to the strong increase in food and beverage revenues of 22% this quarter.","Our hotels in San Antonio grew RevPAR by 14.4% this quarter. Strong citywide led to solid group business that resulted in the ability to drive transient average rate of 8.6% and an increase in food and beverage revenue of 20%. The hotels in San Diego improved RevPAR by 11.7% this quarter, driven by the business generated from a large citywide and additional short-term transient in government-related business.","The 24% increase in group business enabled our hotels to maximize transient average rate, which increased 7.7%. In Seattle, our hotels increased RevPAR 11.6%. Strong group business at our hotels which improved over 17% this quarter enabled our manager to drive the transient average rate growth of 8.7%.","Now looking to markets that were more challenged in the quarter. Our hotels in Atlanta experienced a RevPAR decline of 9.2%. This was primarily driven by the conversion of the Ritz-Carlton in Buckhead for the Whitley. In Orlando, RevPAR declined 6.8% this quarter with an occupancy decline of 5 percentage points and average rate increase of 70 basis points.","The Orlando World Center Marriott had difficult comparisons to last year because of the hotel benefited from the post Hurricane Irma business last year and some of its competitors had rooms out of service for renovations during the fourth quarter of 2017.","Washington D.C. experienced a RevPAR decline of 3.3% in the fourth quarter, as attendance from citywides were lower than anticipated, hindering our ability to drive higher rated transient business and requiring the hotels to take more discounted business.","Moving to 2019, we expect markets such as the Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Hawaii and Miami to outperform the portfolio from below average supply growth and continued strength in corporate and leisure demand and strong citywides. Conversely, we expect Seattle, Boston and D.C. to underperform the portfolio due to above average supply or weak citywide calendars.","Moving to our balance sheet. In January, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, which included a special dividend of $0.05 per share, bringing the total dividends for the year to $0.85. This represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price and a payout ratio of 48% on our 2018 adjusted FFO per share. In addition, we announced a first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share.","We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility. We are the only lodging REIT with an investment-grade balance sheet, which we are committed to, maintaining as we believe it, is a prominent differentiator, relative to our peers and provides flexibility to take advantage of value creation opportunities throughout the cycle.","At December 31, 2018, we had unrestricted cash of $1.5 billion, not including $213 million in the FF&E escrow reserve, and $945 million of available capacity remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Subsequent to quarter end, we closed on the sale of The Westin Grand Central and the acquisition of the 1 Hotel South Beach Miami. The net effect of these transactions is a decrease to our cash balance of $308 million, resulting in unrestricted cash of $1.2 billion as we sit here today.","Total debt at the end of the year was $3.8 billion with a weighted average maturity of 4.2 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. In addition, we have no debt maturities until 2020. Our leverage ratio at the end of 2018 is approximately 1.6x as calculated under the terms of our credit facility, providing a significant dry powder for opportunities to increase long-term shareholder value including potential acquisitions, organic investments and\/or share repurchases.","Now, let me take a few minutes to discuss some assumptions included in our 2019 guidance. Our comparable RevPAR guidance for the year is 0% to 2%. Notably, we estimate a 45 basis point impact of RevPAR due to the renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital projects.","As Jim mentioned, without this impact, the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance would have been approximately 1.45%, which is mitigated by $10 million of the operating profit guarantees that has been included in our comparable hotel EBITDA.","For 2019, we expect to receive a total of $23 million of Marriott's operating profit guarantees for both comp and non-comp transformational capital projects, which have been included in our guidance for EBITDA. In addition, our outsized leverage to the Marriott-Starwood integration along with our internal initiatives from our asset management and enterprise analytics team are also driving forecasted margin outperformance.","At the midpoint, a decline of only 20 basis points on RevPAR growth of 1% is quite impressive, given the current environment of wage and benefit increases. Lastly, keep in mind; we generally earn 25% to 26% of our total EBITDA in the first quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with our strong operating results, which meaningfully be our initial guidance provided last February. Our performance continues to demonstrate that owning a portfolio of iconic, irreplaceable and geographically diversified hotels, having the scale and platform to drive value, combined with a powerful investment-grade balance sheet, creates a strong strategic position to deliver significant value to our stockholders over the long-term.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Anthony Powell with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning, everyone. You made it pretty clear that you are not focused on large scale portfolio deals right now. How many more deals like the 1 South Beach are out there? What kind of pipeline do you have for acquisitions and how confident are you in your ability to deploy that $2 billion to $2.5 billion of capacity over the next couple of years?","James Risoleo","Anthony, I'm glad you picked up on the fact that we're not interested in large scale portfolio of acquisitions. With respect to the pipeline, there are always transactions, there are always opportunities that present themselves, there are opportunities that we go after - that aren't on the market. So we will continue to look for assets that fit our profile. We will be disciplined in our underwriting criteria and we will be opportunistic in investing going forward.","So it's very difficult to talk hypothetically about any deal. But we have a number of assets that are in the pipeline that we're evaluating today and we'll just see if any of those pencil out. I can tell you with respect to the 1 South Beach, we've been working on that deal for two years. So we are very patient and we wait for the right opportunities to come to us.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Bellisario with Baird. Please go ahead.","Michael Bellisario","Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to focus on the South Beach deal. Could you maybe give us your view on that market or the Miami market broadly, your outlook and then kind of your underwriting assumptions for that asset in 2019 and 2020, because it looks like you're not assuming much growth there?","James Risoleo","Yes, couple things about South Beach, Michael. It's the second best performing - over the last 20 years, second best performing RevPAR market in the country, only following the Florida Keys; Key West in particular in the surrounding islands. So we are very bullish on the Miami Beach market. It's really, you know, there are multiple demand drivers that drive business into that market. For the 1 Hotel in particular, it's a mix of high-rated leisure business and high-rated corporate group. The segmentation is roughly 75% leisure, 25% group. It's a terrific hotel and we would expect the market to continue to exhibit growth.","You're right; we were conservative in our underwriting. I pointed out, what the hotel did last year, $45.8 million in EBITDA and we're roughly, call it $46.7 million this year. We were thoughtful about trends. We want to make certain that we put a budget out there that we're very comfortable with and that is achievable if not beatable and we're excited about some other things that are happening in that market.","In late 2019, the Convention Center will reopen, which we think is going to serve to drive additional demand into the South Beach market, into our hotel in particular. We're also have underwritten, but haven't included it in our numbers, going to be developing a beach club at the hotel.","We have a fantastic beach there. I think it's the best beach on South Beach hands down, 600 foot of white sand beach. So we think putting the beach club there will enhance topline revenues. And additionally, we will go into the property as we do on all of our assets and look for additional ways to enhance topline revenues and to bring efficiencies to the bottom line.","Lastly, I would just add that the Super Bowl is being held in Miami in 2020, so we feel confident about how 2020 is going to perform as well. So we have been conservative. We think that's the right way to approach the business today.","Operator","Moving next to Smedes Rose with Citi. Please go ahead.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask also on the 1 Hotel, you mentioned that you'd been negotiating for the last two years and I'm just wondering if you could just talk about a little more about the origins of the deal and were there other bidders at the table and it seems like a fairly favorable multiple for such a large luxury asset. I'd just be interested in hearing a little more color on the background, how you were able to get it?","James Risoleo","Sure, Smedes. I wouldn't say negotiating for two years, I would say we started our quest of the project two years ago and there were other players that were interested in the hotel, high net worth individuals, family offices, offshore interest primarily from the Middle East. At the end of the day, we distinguish ourselves above and beyond everyone else. And we're delighted to be associated with this hotel and with the 1 brand.","So we bring an institutional pedigree to the property and to the 1 brand going forward. So that's all I can say. I cannot give you dynamic on other bidders and their views of the world. I can only talk about how we view it.","Operator","Next we'll move to Bill Crow with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","William Crow","Good morning, Jim. Two part on RevPAR growth, like ex the renovation disruption, you said 1.45% midpoint for this year, should we be happy with that? I mean, it feels like that's pretty conservative to start the year and maybe that's the case, but the second part is, if you could just talk about how the renovations will progress through 2020? And is it going to be a greater impact or lesser impact as we think about next year?","James Risoleo","So I think you should be happy with the - call it a midpoint of 1.5% out of the box and that's how I would look at it. As I mentioned, we had a great year last year. We saw 2.3% RevPAR growth in the quarter. We actually saw a pickup in group in the fourth quarter that gives us confidence. As we do our bottom up budgeting process on a property by property basis, this is where we're comfortable giving initial guidance. So I think you should be comfortable with it. I think you should be really comfortable with our margin assumptions and our margin performance. So with respect to - your second question with respect to the big deal in 2020, was that it, Bill?","William Crow","Yes.","James Risoleo","Hang on one second; I'll get the data on that. We don't have it on hand, but my recollection Bill is, it's similar spend to 2019. So think about the RevPAR disruption in around the same way for 2020.","Operator","Next we'll go to Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Donnelly","Good morning, guys. Can you just give us an update on where the Hyatt three-pack and Don CeSar acquisitions finished in 2018 versus your original underwriting? I'm just curious what drove any variances there, whether it's sort of market, or just taking share, or losing share or just how your margin is sorted out?","James Risoleo","Hang on, Jeff. Let's see - I don't have the numbers for 2018 in front of me. But I can reiterate that on our 2019 budget for the three Hyatts, we expect to finish 70 basis points up, which equates to a 14% improvement in NOI. And I am happy to get the numbers for you on the Don and performance in 2018. I know that Don has performed really well in 2018.","We're well ahead of budget on that of our pro forma and I don't want to quote numbers because I don't have it in front of me, but I know we performed really strong and we had said when we bought the hotel that we anticipated turning that, I think it was 6.5% cap rate into an 8%. And last I looked and I would know we were ahead of our projections. But we'll get you the specific numbers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Richard Hightower","Hey, good morning, guys. Just want to follow-up on the earlier - what sounds like a categorical statement about not pursuing a very high profile portfolio that's potentially in the market here pretty soon. If I'm accurate in sort of describing it this way, or asking the question this way, has anything changed in terms of your thinking about that particular transaction?","Is it partially a function of the fact that you did a $600 million deal recently and you just kind of running up against capacity constraints financially or did something change philosophically or with respect to feedback from investors or just a little more color on that would be helpful?","James Risoleo","Well, Rich, I think we're not going to comment on hypothetical deals that may or may not be in the market. What I will tell you is that we're going to be opportunistic. And we're going to continue to pursue assets like the Hyatt three pack and like the 1. It's nothing more complicated than that.","We'll be opportunistic on the acquisition side and we will be opportunistic as we think about selling hotels. It's a same thing. Nothing is in guidance or additional acquisitions or additional sales, because we don't have anything to talk about. And when we have something to talk about, we'll be glad to share that with you.","Michael Bluhm","And I think just Rich to add on to that. I think we continue to be incredibly happy with our scale. We're not going to grow for growth sake. As you can see with the 1 Hotel, we can absolutely execute upon our strategic vision and the upgrading of the portfolio through other means, and certainly as we sort of think about where we are in the current environment and being thoughtful about how conservatism and underwriting into this type of environment. I think all this has to sort of play into how we think about acquisitions at any degree of scale, frankly.","And of course, again, and I guess one final point will be, right, we want to be incredibly prudent with our balance sheet. Again, at this part of the cycle, I think it's paramount that we're doing that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Woronka","Hey, good morning, guys. Had another question on the 1 Hotel and that's - can you maybe give us a little general sense or flavor on the structure of the management contract and does that involve kind of a franchise fee to the 1 brand? And along those lines, are you willing to consider other assets from that brand as it expands?","James Risoleo","The 1 Hotel is going to be - it's not a franchise fee, it's a management agreement. And it is a market negotiated management agreement with the manager that we're very comfortable with. The answer with respect to, are we willing to consider other hotels in that brand.","Again, it depends on pricing. It depends on the opportunity, but I will tell you that Barry Sternlicht has been very successful in the past, creating brands, think W. This is an incredible LEED-certified, mission-driven luxury lifestyle brand, it's inspired by nature, it fits right in with how we think about sustainability and some of the awards we received, the Leader in the Light award from NAREIT and things we've done around corporate responsibility and sustainability.","You may know that there are current hotels in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as the 1 in South Beach and there are hotels that are expected to open and he has them under control in West Hollywood, Cabo San Lucas, Kauai, Sunnyvale and we would certainly look at most of those with our focus on U.S. centric investments today probably wouldn't be looking Cabo and they have one in the works in Sanya. So it's a real brand and it's going to grow and we're excited about it.","Operator","Next we'll take a question from Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","James Risoleo","Hey, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling","Hey, how are you?","James Risoleo","Good. Hey, Stephen, let me just respond in a little more detail to Bill Crow's question about the MI transformational capital plan because we pulled the number up. Our spend in 2019 though anticipated to be $225 million, in 2020 it's anticipated to be $207 million, so slightly less. Sorry, Stephen.","Stephen Grambling","No, that's helpful too. I guess one more hotel follow-up on the 1 Hotel. Could you give a little more background on the history of the 1 Hotel on the brand change as it relates to the fundamentals of the property?","James Risoleo","Well, I think this was the flagship one, or the one in - two in New York, one in Brooklyn, one in Manhattan and this property it was really the brand. I mean, this is how the - this is where the brand was formed and founded. The property had been the Gansevoort hotels and the Gansevoort had been in financial difficulty over the years and a venture led by Starwood Capital brought the property and they invested $300 million in the asset, which is something that I hadn't pointed out.","So it's a brand new hotel. It has no near-term CapEx needs and given the high RevPAR of this asset, the ability of this property to support itself through the FF&E reserve is very strong and highly likely. So in addition to upgrading the overall metrics of our portfolio from a RevPAR - total RevPAR EBITDA per key perspective, this goes a long way to enhancing the free cash flow position of Host.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Katz with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Katz","Hi, good morning, everyone, and congrats on a good quarter and your acquisition. I hope you'll humor us and allow me to just beat the horse one more time. But with respect to the perspective large portfolio out there that - I think if we're understanding correctly, it's not formally on the market yet.","And so for that reason and that context, there wouldn't be anything to talk about at this stage, but at some point it could hit the market in whole or in part. I just want to be clear about sort of where the line is that you're drawing and is it because something is not in the market yet or available or you're setting some sort of firm boundaries that will be there when it is.","And the second part of my question was we're just trying to gauge your appetite for share repurchases, given the liquidity that you have, given the strength of the business and sort of where you are? Thank you.","James Risoleo","I'm going to take the first part of this. I'll let Michael talk about share repurchases, David. I think my comments were pretty clear. And I would encourage you to take them literally that we have - investment capacity today of between $2 billion to $2.5 billion at 3x leverage. We intend to stay within that range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion and 3x leverage. That's how we're viewing the world today. Michael, you wanted to discuss?","Michael Bluhm","Sure. I think, look David, I would say as we think about share repurchases, I put that in the context of all capital allocation decisions whether investing organically in our portfolio through capital reinvestment like we're doing with the transformational projects and the Marriott program or where we're looking externally for opportunities like the 1 Hotel, which I think is fantastic in a lot of ways as Jim's pointed out, and I think hit accretion from fairly just about every metric, whether it's earnings, free cash flow and frankly, I'd even argue on NAV, day one.","I think as you know, we do have authorization for a buyback and it is a tool that we will look to. But again it's in the context of all other investment opportunities that we think about and how we're looking out to - the sort of the outlook for 2019 and what we think that's going to bring in terms of both acquisition opportunities as well as value enhancement opportunities.","Operator","Moving next, we'll go to Jim Sullivan with BTIG. Please go ahead.","James Sullivan","Good morning, guys. Just another question on capital allocation if you would, and this really relates to the transformational Marriott program as you've described it the way you're investing some $200 million plus a year. Can you - you have talked about this as the objective in terms of operating results as to take each asset up to number one in its comp set. And I wonder if you could just help us understand how that - what kind of ROE you're projecting that to deliver on the capital investment?","James Risoleo","Sure, Jim, because obviously - before we commit any capital, we start with a detailed return on investment analysis and we did that with this deal as well. We believe that the IRR unlevered on the Marriott transformational capital program will be in the low to mid-teens. That's how we've looked at it.","We think it's a great use of our capital. The properties are clearly going to gain market share. Marriott in cases that they've already completed can see up to 6 points in yield index growth from really transforming and reinventing our hotel. We weren't even that aggressive when we did our IRR analysis, we assume somewhere between 3 points to 5 points on each asset.","Operator","Next we'll go to Patrick Schultz with SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Patrick Schultz","Hi, good morning. When we think about what markets that you'd like to get into, and others that you'd like to get out of certainly Miami getting into, New York getting out, how do you think about that going forward?","James Risoleo","Yes. Patrick, we will continue to be focused on markets that have multiple demand generators, that have high barriers to entry with respect to new supply and just good growth fundamentals all lining up from top to bottom whether it's a favorable labor environment to the support of the local or municipal authorities, and again, high barrier to growth is probably top of the list, because new supply is what can get you.","Michael Bluhm","And I think certainly, importantly diversification continued to be paramount to our overall investment strategy. So if we sort of think about different market, we certainly have a keen eye on making sure that we're not overly weighting to certain markets.","Patrick Schultz","Okay, thank you for that. And then secondly, I may have missed it. Did you say what - group pace is shaping up?","James Risoleo","What's that, Patrick? You cut out.","Patrick Schultz","I'm sorry, didn't hear you.","James Risoleo","I'm sorry. I didn't hear your question.","Patrick Schultz","Okay. I'm sorry if I missed it, did you say how your 2019 group pace is shaping up?","James Risoleo","Yes, I did. Its total group revenue pace is up 1.4%.","Operator","Next we'll go to Shaun Kelley with Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Hi, good morning, everyone. I know you're keeping it tight, so my main question was one to the Analyst Day in South Beach, but I don't know if you're going to comment there. So instead maybe you guys could just give us a little bit of color on, I think we noticed towards the end of the year there was a lot of stock market volatility, obviously, there is also a big strategic change here in terms of sort of your discussion plan around the portfolio deal.","But you didn't actually buy any stock in the fourth quarter and I'm kind of curious just big picture, how the stock buybacks fit into the broader strategy here as it relates to kind of what you're seeing out there and deployment of that capital relative to kind of what you can do with your own stock?","James Risoleo","Yes, Shaun, we think about deploying capital, obviously, we've talked about it before, but just let me hit the highlights real quick for you. Due to buying assets like the 1, investing in our portfolio like the transformational capital program or buying back stock, right. But it all starts with sources and uses of cash.","And as we sat here at the end of the year, we did not buyback any stock. We knew what we had in the works from an acquisition perspective. We knew that we had The Westin Grand Central under contract, but we had no assurance that that deal was going to close. So that's not to say that we won't be buyers of our stock in the future. We did not buy it now, because we wanted to be thoughtful about the balance sheet and where we were going. Michael has anything to add to that.","Michael Bluhm","No, I think that's a good point, I mean as I think we all know, we sat here on Wednesday - or sat here in December of last year and the market was pretty volatile, and certainly volatile in one direction. And so as we were sort of looking at things like cash flow, cash that we had coming in throughout the dispositions, acquisitions we were making there was in time where we just need to be incredibly thoughtful about balance sheet preservation.","Operator","Moving next to Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Thomas Allen","Hey, good morning. So about a year-ago, you talked about selling land at The Phoenician, where are you in that process? Thanks.","James Risoleo","It's a process, Thomas. We are moving forward. We have the entitlement. We're moving through the plotting with the City of Phoenix. We continue to be optimistic that that's going to happen, but I don't have anything to discuss right now because we don't have a deal done.","Operator","And next we'll go to Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Thanks, two questions. One is, you've talked about opportunities looking at the existing portfolio. Are there other things with other Marriott properties that are not part of the agreement you've done already? Or if not, are there other operators that have kind of expressed interest in something similar after seeing that Marriott deal or is that really a very unique sort of one-off kind of arrangement?","And then I was just going to ask a clarification on group business, you mentioned the pace being up like 1.4%, last quarter you talked about fewer citywide events in 2019. So is it just the pace coming in, but you're still expecting maybe to be down in 2019? Or has your view on the group outlook changed? Thanks.","James Risoleo","Robin, let me answer the group question first. Yes, I mean, we do have some issues, as you and anyone that owns hotels in Boston, in particular, with a reduction in citywide so this year. That 1.4% number takes that all into account and consideration. So we don't expect to see slippage in the 1.4% number.","If anything, and this is not baked into our forecast for the year, we really liked the way we're positioned this year and in those markets where we might have targeted holes, we believe that given the corporate group that we saw in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2018, that gives us some terrific opportunities to the upside.","I might also add that after the third quarter call or on the third quarter call I said, our total group revenue pace was flat. And now, it's up 1.4%. So we feel good about that. And with respect to additional transformational capital projects, there's only so much we can push through the system at any one point in time. And I will just tell you, nobody but Host could do what we're doing.","And I applaud our design and construction team, and our asset managers, and others in the organization to manage this process. We will work with our operators, both with Marriott on additional transformational opportunities as well as Hyatt on assets that we feel may need to be repositioned, but we're going to be thoughtful, cautious and judicious as we move forward on the process.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Risoleo, I would like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","James Risoleo","Well, thank you, everyone for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter results and our 2019 outlook with you. We look forward to talking with you in a few months to discuss our first quarter results as well as providing you with more insight into how 2019 is progressing. Have a great day.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"11939":["Host Hotels & Resorts (NYSE:HST) Q3 2013 Earnings Call November  5, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Gee Lingberg - Vice President","W.

Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thank you, Tiffany. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts third quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our third quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for the remainder of 2013. Greg will then provide greater detail on our third quarter results, including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to remind everyone that at the beginning of this year, we adopted calendar quarter reporting period. And to enable investors to better evaluate our performance, we have presented 2012 RevPAR and certain historical results on a calendar quarter basis we call the 2012 as-adjusted-results. The following discussion of quarterly and year-to-date operating performance will include a comparison between the 3 months and 9 months of operations ended September 30. And now here's Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of solid operating results of strong demand in our transient business and better-than-expected short-term group bookings fostered solid rate growth across all segments of our business. We are also pleased to report some activities that we believe have added value to the company. We continue to feel very positive about the fundamentals in the business and our outlook, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes.","First, lets review our results for the quarter. Overall comparable revenue growth for the quarter was 4.6%. This was driven primarily by a comparable hotel RevPAR increase of 5.5% to $150 as average rate improved 4.8% to $192, and occupancy increased to 0.5 percentage point to 78.4%. We also had comparable hotel food and beverage revenue growth of 3.1%, driven by increases in banquet sales.","As anticipated, the third quarter had difficult margin comparisons to last year, which included items that increased profit in 2012. As a result, our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter were unchanged. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased slightly to $270 million, and our adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.25, an increase of nearly 9%. On a year-to-date basis, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 5.5%, driven by a 4.3% increase in average rate and an 8 percentage point improvement in occupancy.","Total year-to-date comparable revenue growth of 4.6%, combined with adjusted operating profit margins that increased 100 basis points, resulted in year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $984 million, representing an increase of 12.5%. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 22.5% to $0.98.","The key drivers of our third quarter room revenue results were strong increases in rate across all segments of our business. We also benefited from mix shift in both our transient and group segments. In our transient business, demand in our higher-rated retail segment increased more than 10%, while lower rated Special Corporate, government and other discount rooms decreased almost 1%, primarily due to a 16% decrease in our government room nights. Overall, for the quarter, transient demand increased 4%. The combination of mix shift and rate increases in every segment led to an overall rate increase of 4.3%, which resulted in a revenue increase of 8.5%.","Our group segment also benefited from mix shift as our higher-rated corporate association business increased almost 2%, while our discount and government segment fell by more than 8%. As with our transient business, we saw rate increases across all segments, which resulted in an average rate increase of more than 3.5%. While overall demand fell by 2%, we were very pleased to see that bookings in the quarter for the quarter increased almost 12% compared to the prior year. The welcome pickup in booking activity also has benefited the fourth quarter as bookings increased more than 9%. We expect very solid group activity in the fourth quarter, as both rate and demand are running ahead of last year's pace, with book revenues indicating an increase of more than 6%. We also expect the transient demand will remain strong.","On the investment front, the company's European joint venture, in which we hold a 1\/3 interest, acquired its first hotel in Sweden, a 465-room Sheraton Stockholm Hotel for a total purchase price of $135 million. Stockholm is the business capital of Scandinavia and a regional hub for many large multinationals in the IT, banking, automotive and business service sectors, which are key drivers of corporate demand. It is also a popular leisure destination offering beautiful architecture and museums. The hotel has one of the best locations in the city situated across from the historic old town and within short walking distance to the Grand Central train station.","Looking at disposition activity, as we announced this morning, we sold the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront for $87 million or approximately 173,000 per key. Additionally, subsequent to quarter end, the company's European joint venture sold a 150-room Courtyard Parils La Defense West for EUR 19 million, which we had acquired in a portfolio transaction last year.","Overall, because we feel confident in the fundamentals of the lodging business, we are interested in completing additional acquisitions and have an active pipeline of potential deals. However, a combination of high prices and fewer attractive acquisition candidates have limited our activity this year, and we do not expect to complete any additional investments in 2013. We do intend to take advantage of these market realities by selling more assets, and we are currently marketing several hotels, some of which may close by or shortly after year end. Given the uncertainty of the timing and execution of these transactions, our guidance assumes no impact from these potential sales.","We have an outstanding portfolio of 137 hotels, from which we can extract value in various and creative ways. In the past, you've seen us partner with an expert to revamp retail space, convert an under-occupied tower to apartment, build a timeshare on an oceanfront parking lot, sell unused tennis courts to a developer and complete various redevelopment and ROI investments. We have also been successful in creating value by extending ground leases and restructuring management agreement.","For example, we recently extended the ground lease that was set to expire in 2019 at the Houston Airport Marriott, negotiating a new 40-year term. This new lease results in a reduction of ground lease payments. And as part of this agreement, we will invest approximately $35 million in the property to completely redeveloped pedestrians, public space, meeting space and modernize the mechanical systems. While we do not typically seek to invest in airport hotels, this hotel is directly connected to the airport and traditionally maintains a market share premium of nearly 30%.","We also completed the construction of a 20,000-square foot ballroom and the renovation of 25,000 square feet of meeting space at the Newark Airport Marriott, which we agreed to accomplish in time for the 2014 Super Bowl at the Meadowlands as part of our ground lease extension for that hotel, which we announced last year.","Management agreements are another source of value enhancement opportunities, especially as competition between operators is increased over time. We review management contracts on a hotel-by-hotel business and work towards obtaining the most efficient model for each hotel.","During the third quarter, we successfully converted the Memphis Marriott to the Sheraton Memphis Downtown, which will be managed by Davidson Hotel & Resorts, an independent operator, which has long ties to the Memphis market. The conversion enabled us to increase the value of the hotel by selecting the right brand, operator and capital plan for the market. We anticipate that both improved performance and the availability of the hotel as a franchise will increase the sales price in the future.","We also successfully amended the Calgary Marriott Downtown management agreement with Marriott International. The term of the agreement was extended, and we received an increase in the owner's priority threshold, which will reduce current and future management fees by more than $2 million a year.","In conjunction with these 2 transactions, we also gained the right to franchise 3 additional hotels, substantially improving the value of those hotels at the time of sale and advancing our strategy of obtaining franchise rights for hotels in the bottom half of our portfolio.","Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of the year. As we have outlined today, we continue to see strong demand trends in both our transient and group segment for the fourth quarter. However, as Greg will describe in more detail, the government shutdown has impacted us in October by costing us $6 million to $7 million in EBITDA. With that in mind, we are tightening our guidance and expect comparable hotel RevPAR for the full year to increase between 5.5% and 5.7%, with an increase in adjusted operating profit margins of 100 to 105 basis points. Based on these RevPAR margin expectations, we now expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.290 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the impact of the shutdown. This operating forecast will result in adjusted FFO per share of $1.28 to $1.30.","Looking at our dividend, our third quarter common dividend was $0.12 per share. Our fourth quarter dividend will depend on operating results and as -- activities on the sales side. While it is premature to offer any specific guidance relative to RevPAR or revenue growth for 2014, we do believe that the fundamentals for our business continue to be attractive. The single biggest factor is continued low supply growth. Overall, industry upper -- upscale supply will average roughly 1% for the next 2 years, which is about half of the long-term stabilized growth rate.","Looking at our primary markets, New York City and Washington, D.C., are the only markets with average supply growth in excess of the long-term average growth rate. Our remaining 8 target markets in the U.S. are expected to average just 0.75% in increased supply over the next few years. In particular, Boston, Hawaii, L.A. and San Francisco expect no upper upscale supply growth in 2014.","On the demand side, we are very encouraged by the indicators that we track. Business transient demand has remained strong this entire year, and the outlook for 2014 is quite positive as business investment is expected to accelerate next year.","International travel continues to grow at a multiple of domestic demand as it becomes easier for the Chinese and Latin Americans to navigate our visa process, which further stimulates transient demand. Our group booking phase for 2014 is solidly positive as group bookings in the third quarter improved by 16% over last year. As these trends continue into 2014, we see the opportunity for strong RevPAR growth, driven primarily by rate improvements and solid SMB growth, driven primarily by banquet activity.","Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Gregory J. Larson","Thank you, Ed. Before I present the individual market information, let me provide an overall summary of comparable hotel RevPAR by region. RevPAR growth was strongest in the west, increasing 10.5%, driven by 8% ADR growth. 5 markets, 4 of which represent our West Coast target markets grew RevPAR by double digits. In the central and south region, RevPAR increased 3.9%, in line with our expectation. While Atlanta and Houston have strong double-digit RevPAR growth, weak group demand in San Antonio, Tampa and New Orleans resulted in a combined 11.5% RevPAR decline.","In the East, ADR grew by only 1.6%, contributing to a 3.1% RevPAR growth. Results were slightly lower than expected, especially in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. due to declines in group demand.","With that in mind, let me begin by giving you specific market data. Houston is once again our best performing market in the third quarter. Houston has continued its impressive RevPAR growth with gains of 18.8% on a difficult comp of last year's strong third quarter. Occupancy improved 60 basis points, and ADR grew an impressive 17.8% due to the continued high transient demand from energy in energy-related business in Houston. Strong demand enables the hotels to implement a strategy of shifting the mix of business to higher-rated segment. We expect Houston to continue to perform well [ph] related to the government budget crisis and fewer fourth quarter city-wide events.","RevPAR at our San Francisco hotels continue to perform well with the robust increase of 15.8%, moving up to the #2 spot from #4 last quarter. Occupancy grew 1.9 percentage point, and ADR increased at a very strong 13.3%. The strong rate increase was mainly driven by business mix shift from contract, the higher-rated transient and group business. With continued high transient demand, we expect our San Francisco hotels to perform well in the fourth quarter.","Due to the strong third quarter citywide calendar, our Atlanta hotels grew RevPAR an impressive 15.5% as ADR improved 5.8% and occupancy grew 6.1 percentage points. The rate improvement was primarily driven by compression created by the better-than-expected demand from strong citywide. Due to a large event that will not be repeated in the fourth quarter, we do not expect Atlanta to outperform in the fourth quarter. But based on year-to-date RevPAR increase of 10.9%, we expect Atlanta to be a top performer for the year.","Driven by the strength of group business, RevPAR at our hotels in Phoenix increased 14.5%, significantly outperforming the upper upscale market performance of 5.9%. Occupancy gained 2.9 percentage points and ADR increased 8.9%. Strong business allowed the hotels to shift the mix into higher-rated transient business to drive overall ADR growth. In October, some groups canceled due to the government shutdown. So it is unlikely that the third quarter RevPAR growth will be sustained, but we still expect Phoenix to outperform in the third -- fourth quarter.","In Los Angeles, our hotel RevPAR increased 13% on occupancy gains of 1.6 percentage points and ADR growth of 10.9%. All hotels in this market have strong rate growth due to transient demand strength. We expect transient demand to remain strong through the fourth quarter but expect negative impact from a weaker group booking pace and the scheduled rooms renovation at the Marina Marriott.","Solid group base and strong transient demand propelled our Seattle hotels to another great quarter with a RevPAR increase of 12.3%, driven by a 2.1 percentage point increase in occupancy and an improvement in ADR of 9.6%. Strength in both group and transient bookings allowed our hotels to shift the mix from discount, the higher-rated retail and Special Corporate segments. We expect our Seattle hotels to have a good fourth quarter, the solid group room nights on the books to create compression to drive rate.","Our San Diego hotels RevPAR increased 10.3% with occupancy growth of 4.1 percentage points and ADR improvement of 5%. Due to strong group and transient demand at our hotels, RevPAR growth more than doubled our upper upscale market growth of 4.3%. As we look forward in the fourth quarter, we expect our San Diego hotels to continue to outperform.","In the third quarter, our hotels in New York increased rate by 3.2%, while occupancy remained relatively flat, resulting in RevPAR improvement of 3.5% despite increased supply in the market. We are still concerned about increased hotel supply in New York and the resulting impact on hotel rates that expect that our hotels should perform well when compared to the broader New York market.","Our Washington, D.C. hotels continue to struggle in the third quarter as RevPAR decreased 0.1% with occupancy increasing 1.1 percentage points while ADR declined 1.5%. However, we outperformed the upper upscale market performance as the market RevPAR increased 3.3%. Our hotels in the central business district outperformed hotels in the suburbs. Given the continued weakness in government travel and government dysfunction, we expect our hotels in D.C. to underperform the portfolio in the fourth quarter.","Tampa and New Orleans both had double-digit RevPAR decreases of approximately 14% each in the third quarter. Both were impacted by large nonrecurring events. Tampa was impacted by the absence of the Republican National Convention this quarter. New Orleans was impacted by the large Lutheran convention that did not repeat this year. We expect Tampa to underperform due to a large 2,600-room cancellation related to the government shutdown, and New Orleans to outperform in the fourth quarter due to increases in the number of citywide events for the fourth quarter.","The Pro forma RevPAR for the 19 hotels in the European joint venture, which includes the 5-hotel portfolio acquired in 2012 increased 2.8% for the quarter in constant euros. As anticipated, third quarter ADR declined 2.3% due in part to the strong rates during the London Olympics last summer. Occupancy was up 4.1 percentage points due to increases in both transient and group volume from citywide events held in Amsterdam this quarter and strong incentive demand at Westin Europa and Pullman Bercy. The best-performing hotels in the quarter were Renaissance Amsterdam, Crowne Plaza Amsterdam, Renaissance Brussels, Westin Europa & Regina and Westin Palace Milan. Sheraton Skyline and Le Meridien Piccadilly underperformed this past quarter due to difficult comps from the Olympics last quarter. Some signs of improvement in the eurozone economy give us the encouragement to be cautiously optimistic about our European hotels.","The 2013 GDP forecast in the major eurozone economies have been upgraded over the past quarter, predominantly driven by stronger-than-expected performance in Germany and France. Spain appears to have reached the bottom but Italy remains challenged. An emphatic reelection of Chancellor Merkel in Germany should offer some stability in the eurozone. Outside of the eurozone, the U.K. economy is making a faster-than-expected recovery reflected in a strengthening London hotel market. As anticipated, operating profit margin growth in the third quarter was our weakest for the year. Comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margin for the third quarter of 2013 was unchanged as third quarter 2012 was a particularly strong quarter with margins up 285 basis points. Certain items were included that increased operating profit last year, such as prior year tax refunds and utility rebates totaling $5 million, which decreases operating margin growth this quarter by 50 basis points.","In addition, as Ed commented in his prepared remarks, the conversion of a Memphis hotel to Sheraton with an independent manager increases the value of the hotel in the long term. However, in the near term, this also negatively impacted our margin performance. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that RevPAR will continue to be driven, primarily by rate growth, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through. However, the government shutdown had a onetime negative effect on the results for October. We estimate that the government shutdown impacted RevPAR for fourth quarter by over 100 basis points, which translates to approximately 25 to 30 basis points for the full year. We expect margins for the remainder of the quarter to remain at or above our year-to-date results, leading to a full year profit margin increase of 100 basis points at the low end of the range, an increase of 105 basis points at the high end of the range.","Shifting to our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we redeemed $200 million of the 6.75% Series Q senior note at a premium of $2 million. This redemption brings the total debt reduction since January 2012 for $1.2 billion, decreasing our weighted average interest rate of 4.9% and extending our weighted average debt maturity to 5.5 years. As a result of these efforts, our annual cash interest expense decreased approximately to $210 million. As of September 30, 2013, we have approximately $350 million of cash and $770 million of available capacity under the credit facility. In the quarter, we issued 6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $18.39 per share for net proceeds of approximately $109 million through our at-the-market program. This quarter, issuances complete the sales under our agreement, which had a combined capacity of $400 million.","In summary, we achieved solid RevPAR growth with double-digit RevPAR increases in markets such as Houston, San Francisco, Atlanta, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Diego. We further improved our balance sheet and now have the lowest annual cash interest expense and best interest coverage and leverage ratios in the 20-year history of the company. This completes our prepared remarks, and we are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Felicia Hendrix with Barclays.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Ed, just to touch on your group business for a minute. Last quarter, you mentioned that 2014 group was 50% booked at the time at an increased rate and pace year-over-year. I was just wondering if you could update us on that statistic.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, at this point, we probably booked about 2\/3 of our 2014 group business. Well, we would be expecting to, by the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter, we'd be expecting to be somewhere around 70% to 75% of that business booked at that point in time.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And is the pace and the rate meeting your expectations?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I'd -- we're up -- we're sort of up just short of 6% in terms of the combination of improvement in room nights and improvement in rates, so just short of 6% in terms of revenues for '14 compared to last year. I think this was one of the things as we look at this quarter that we were very encouraged by, because as I think we all know, as we had been working our way through 2013, we were typically finding that bookings in the quarter for the quarter were really not as strong as they had been in the prior year. And depending upon the individual quarter, some of the bookings for the rest of the year were not necessarily as strong as they had been. One quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but the reality is, as I indicated in my comments, our bookings in the quarter for the quarter were up meaningfully. Our bookings for the second half of the year, meaning in the third quarter for the third quarter and for the fourth quarter, were up 10% compared to the prior year. And then our bookings for '14 were up 16% compared to what we did last year. And last year was a good year for bookings for the year out. So yes, we want to be thoughtful and cautious about trying to carry this too far but the bottom line is, is we were very pleased with the increase in group bookings that we saw over the last 3 months.","Felicia R. Hendrix - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And while I have you or maybe Greg, just as a follow-up, given that commentary, assuming that you make asset sales next year, the comment referring to -- Greg, your commentary about how strong your balance sheet is the strongest it's ever been, your free cash flow should be quite attractive next year. Your balance sheet is strong and everything seems to be operating well. Just wondering how we should think about your targets for payout relative to cash available for distribution next year.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I would say that at this stage, while we're certainly -- as we think about the dividend, I think it's still going to generally be driven by what our taxable income is. That's going to be affected by 2 things. It's going to be affected by both -- how our operations perform next year, which we, of course, we would be expecting would be higher than this year. And then secondly, it's going to depend upon the asset sales that we do, the profits that we generated on those sales and whether we tax-free exchange the proceeds from those sales into other investments or not. But I'd say that in general, we certainly -- all the points you made about the strength of the balance sheet are true. And it would, in general, be our goal to continue to see our dividend increase but it will be tied to those factors in general.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Joshua Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","You mentioned improvement in group business and some other companies have as well. And it's sometimes difficult for us to translate some of the statistics into overall RevPAR growth for the portfolio. Do you think if the current momentum you're seeing in that segment is maintained, it will be enough to drive an acceleration of RevPAR growth for the company next year, or is the magnitude of the group pickup not quite that large yet?","W. Edward Walter","Josh, it's a little hard to predict that at this point in time, especially since I think the results that we've seen the last couple of years have all been pretty solid. So what I -- if the trends that we see today continue through the quarter and into next year, I think it's reasonable to assume that we would see more balanced growth between group revenues and transient revenues next year, whereas this year, it's been more -- far more heavily weighted towards transient revenue growth. So I think you'd have that opportunity for better balance. We're at pretty high occupancy levels already. So that suggests that most of what we should see should be in the rate side. And I think then it's just going to come down to how aggressively can we push rate between the 2 segments. I think it would probably suggest you might find that the occupancy increase next year is generally attributable to group, and transient will really be more of a rate story.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And separately, you've been issuing about $100 million a quarter of new equity through the ATM this year. I noticed you completed the program and you didn't put a new one in place. Can you just remind us where your leverage is today in terms of what your target is, and should we interpret the lack of putting in a new program as a sign that the future equity issuance will diminish or have you just not gotten around to putting a new program yet?","Gregory J. Larson","Josh, this is Greg. So our leverage, we ended the quarter at 3.46 leverage. And as I mentioned in my comments, it's the best leverage level in the last 20 years, so we're quite happy with that. But as you also know, our ultimate goal is to push that leverage ratio to 3x. And so what we've always sort of said consistently through the cycle that, in general, what you'll see us do, until we hit our goal of 3x, is that when we sell assets, we'll use the proceeds to pay down debt and when we buy assets, we will finance those acquisitions with about 75% to 80% equity. And I think if you look at what we've accomplished from the beginning of this cycle to today, that's exactly what's happened. And we've sold just over $1 billion worth of assets. We used those proceeds to pay down debt. We've acquired just over $2.5 billion worth of assets and refinanced those acquisitions for the past 75% to 80% equity. And I do think -- I think your point is correct that we did issue $100 million per quarter sort of in the past. But as you can tell, we're getting closer to 3x leverage and we ended the year with a pretty good cash balance. And subsequent to quarter end, we sold the Portland property for north of $80 million. So I think we're in pretty good condition at this point.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Anto Savarirajan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Anto Savarirajan for Steve Kent. Broadly, what are your internal thresholds for ROI investments? The reason I asked given the ROI investments you've made in the Newark Airport Marriott, how are bookings trending ahead of the Super Bowl and how should we, in general, think about some of these ROI investments you make?","W. Edward Walter","The thresholds that we establish for ROI investments will differ a bit based on the size of the investment and also the certainty of achieving those results. And broadly speaking, I would say to you that when we look at adding a ballroom, such as what we're doing in Newark, what we ultimately will be doing out in San Diego, we're generally looking at IRRs on those transactions that will be in the high teens. When we're looking at some of the energy saving improvements or enhancements that we've implemented over the years, we have enough of those to be perfectly honest, but we typically have targeted a threshold north of 20% just to make certain that we stay focused on the most rewarding of those types of opportunities. As it relates to bookings in Newark, I don't have any specific numbers. The ballroom just opened up in the last 30 days. Our sense is that it's certainly going to do -- we're going to do fine out there around the Super Bowl because we're so close. But obviously, what will matter more for the success of the investment is the long-term bookings for that space. We feel pretty confident, though, that, that space will be a big plus for that particular hotel.","Anto Savarirajan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Over the past few years, you've indicated to us that you -- the quality of the asset portfolio has been getting better as you prune some of your assets. Tying your commentary that you may be selling a few more assets than you actually buy, how should we think of these assets and how you're bucketing them? And really, which are these assets that you are thinking of selling over the next, say, few quarters?","W. Edward Walter","That's a good question because it's an important part of our overall strategy. Generally, what we're trying to do with asset sales is sell assets that are located in nontarget markets where we generally expect lower growth. And then, if we're selling assets that might be in target markets such as, say, the sale of the San Francisco Airport Marriott in San Francisco, what we're doing is selling an asset in a target market but it's in a part of that market where we generally have lower expectations for overall growth. So the idea is to ultimately end up with a portfolio that is generally focused in the target markets and in the best submarkets for those target markets. One thing I'd also add to that is as we gauge in the sale process because Portland is a good example of that, we try to be pretty thoughtful about exactly what's the best way to sell the hotel. So in the case of the Portland transaction, we first renovated the lobby and the meeting space for that hotel because we figured that, that would help improve the performance of the hotel. And in fact, over the last 2 years, we saw a 20% increase in RevPAR. We picked up all the market shares that we had dropped the 2 years prior. We saw a 30% increase in NOI in that asset that took us back to where we were in '07, and then we look to put the hotel on the market to take advantage of that because we generally thought that we captured most of the surge that you get in the recovery in terms of performance. And if it wasn't a primary market for us, it was a good time to be a seller of that hotel.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of clarifications. Your RevPAR guidance range for the full year at the top end is down a little bit more than the government shutdown impact. So I wonder if you could just give us some color around whether there are issues you're maybe feeling less optimistic about. And then for Q3, I just want to make sure I understand the EBITDA. The calendar shift, I think, would have been a benefit to you. I understand there was $5 million of asset sales dispositions affecting year-over-year comps and then some property-specific things last year of $5 million, but I'm still wondering why we're not seeing the benefit of the calendar shift, we're not seeing positive EBITDA, and maybe it's just there are too many moving parts of it. If you can help us with that.","W. Edward Walter","I'm going to -- we'll split this up. I'll try to answer the RevPAR question, and them I'm going to let Greg handle the EBITDA question. I think on the RevPAR, what I would -- probably the simplest answer to that is that the third quarter was solid, but it didn't outperform our expectations. And so as we looked at the high end of our guidance for the full year, it felt like we needed to make an adjustment to reflect the fact that the third quarter was in line with expectations, which would have been -- think of that more as the middle of the guidance that we've previously given as opposed to the high end. And then given the combination of the government shutdown and what that meant for that guidance, it just felt that we should -- the 5.5% to 5.7% was probably the right range for here. But in general, coming back to the -- our overall perspective on the guidance, I would say that we generally looked at this as essentially -- if you looked at the midpoint from where we were, when you look at the midpoint for where we are now, the difference there is essentially the government shutdown. So yes, we did not meaningfully outperform in the third quarter compared to our thoughts, which would have taken us to a higher level, but the bottom line is in terms of our expectations, the real difference between the 2 different forms of guidance is really related solely to the government shutdown.","Gregory J. Larson","And, Robin, look, I agree with you that this year has been difficult because of our calendar shift and that's one of the reasons why last quarter, I tried to get a little bit of color and guidance on that. What I said last quarter is that in the third quarter, our EBITDA would be about 20% to 21% of our full year EBITDA. I think if you take your full year EBITDA and multiply that by 20% to 21%, my guess is, is your EBITDA for the quarter would have been less than our 270 that we achieved.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you, just finally, remind us what remaining capacity you have for sales agency financing agreements now after the issuance in the quarter?","W. Edward Walter","You mean on the continuous equity plan?","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes.","W. Edward Walter","We exhausted it.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So there's nothing in place with any other agreements. I know you completed the ones in the quarter but nothing else at the moment in place?","W. Edward Walter","That's correct.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I appreciate the comments you've given so far on 2014, but just for our modeling, can you update us on your thoughts around seasonality and other factors that could impact RevPAR growth, just specifically how the Super Bowl could impact renovations, citywide calendar, things like that?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we're in a position to give you much insight into that right now. We haven't seen our first budget for next year. We won't see the those for a couple more weeks so we really don't have a lot of specific insights. If I were thinking quickly off the top of my head, we are certainly hoping that a Super Bowl in New York City is going to be a benefit to us. But conversely, on a year-over-year basis, while the inauguration in D.C. was not anything to write home about, it still had a favorable effect on Washington in the first quarter and roughly around the same time. So beyond that, we really haven't had a chance to think through the year from a seasonality perspective. And the one thing that should be easier for all of us next year, and Greg was sort of referring to this in his answer to the last question, is at least next year, we're going to be matching up against calendar quarters where we all have the benefit of being able to look back at both the top line and the bottom line where on a year without having to do a lot of adjustments to try to capture those numbers.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of your JV EBITDA, guidance came down slightly for the year. What drove that? And -- yes, what drove that?","W. Edward Walter","Part of that is probably related to the sale of the asset because we would have lost a chunk there. I don't know that there was any particular factor of significant -- none that I -- Greg...","Gregory J. Larson","I mean, you're right, I think our number for the full year has been only a few million. So part of it was Courtyard and maybe just a snitch from an operating perspective.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Andrew Didora with Bank of America.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Typically, in the past, the ATM was a predecessor to some transaction activity, but it certainly doesn't seem like you have anything lined up for the rest of the year. Can you maybe expand on what you're seeing on the deal front, and what does your lack of activity right now imply for your thoughts on where we are in the cycle right now?","W. Edward Walter","Yes, I would say that we have been -- we certainly feel comfortable, as I mentioned in my comments, that we'd like to be investing more. There has not been as many transactions or properties that are in the markets that we're interested in that have come on the market over the last 12 months. We are looking at a few things both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. But as I highlighted in my comments, as I look at the timing for those, I think it's unlikely that they would have any kind of an effect on this year. But I think part of what you're seeing in the U.S. is that transactions, in general, are probably being driven more by the strategy of the owner as opposed to any duress or anything like that. I think most folks would share our insight that supply is relatively low, not expected to accelerate meaningfully except in a couple of markets. And consequently, no one is sitting there sort of starting to anticipate that it's the end of the cycle, and consequently, they should be a seller because of that reason. So you're seeing good levels of activity. I think overall, the level of activity that we're seeing in the market and across the world is a little bit higher than what we saw last year. Unfortunately, a lot of that's happening in asset quality and price points that are of less interest to us.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And then just finally, one of the themes we've been seeing this earnings season has been some of the greater strength on the West Coast versus the East Coast and your results in the quarter didn't really seem to deviate from that. What do you think are the key drivers of that outperformance are, and what are your expectations for sort of East Coast versus West Coast over, call it, the next 18 to 24 months?","W. Edward Walter","I suspect that, at least looking into next year, that we'll probably see that same pattern, strength in the West, weakness in the East continue. Supply on the West coast is very low. Demand, both in the U.S. domestic demand, as well as international demand, is quite strong on the West Coast. So that same -- sort of the same set of facts that has been driving great results this year should continue to drive the West Coast next year. And then when you look at the East Coast, and I think, unfortunately, all the data that we're all looking at is suggesting that Newark is going to continue to get hit by high levels of supply. I think the numbers we're looking at right now would say industry-wide across all segments, New York will be up north of 7% next year in terms of supply. But while the story is better, considerably better in upper upscale, I think the number is closer to 2% to 2.5%. The reality is that much supply coming into a market even as strong as New York, is still going to lead to probably relatively anemic levels of RevPAR growth in that market. I think Washington, as Arnie commented last week, and we would echo, is that while the center city -- the downtown part of Washington will continue to do better than the suburbs, the overall market is still going to be facing some challenging headwinds in 2014. So as you -- if you look broadly at the East Coast, those are 2 big important markets and neither one of them will likely perform at the industry average next year.","Operator","And we'll go to Smedes Rose with Evercore.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I wanted to -- I saw in your release, you have your select service asset with White Lodging opening later this quarter. And I'm just wondering, as you look forward -- how do you think about select service assets? I mean, that one I know is a JV, and it probably doesn't really move the numbers for you, but you did buy that property in Hawaii, and kind of -- do you see that becoming a more significant piece of your portfolio going forward?","W. Edward Walter","The short answer is yes. I think we -- as we look at owning hotels in urban locations, urban select service is something that we think can work and can make sense, this means we'd love to add more properties like that. I would say that one of the things we're watching carefully in some markets in New York, witnessing the comments I just made, would be we want to be thoughtful, is that this is a segment of the business that tends to see supply first. So our investments in this area need to take the supply risk into account. But we're -- we would be comfortable owning more urban select service in the markets that we identified as targets.","Smedes Rose - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And then on -- in -- for your European joint venture, just the Stockholm asset, I was just wondering, is there any pricing commentary you can give on trailing cap rates or forward cap rates or maybe how that came to be in that transaction?","Gregory J. Larson","Yes, this was an interesting acquisition for us. The Swedish -- Sweden is not part of the eurozone from a currency perspective and so has not been dragged down by a lot of the factors that have otherwise affected Europe. So while the rest of Europe has struggled a bit over these last couple of years, the Swedish economy continue to do reasonably well and is projected to continue to do quite well. If we look at this acquisition, we paid about EUR 220 million per room in euros for the hotel. We think that's probably a 30%, 30-plus percent discount through a replacement cost. And on a cap rate basis, it's just a hair north of the southern cap rate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering if I could get a better grasp on what's driving the ADR growth. Are you raising prices across the customer segment or is it more of the mix shift that you talk about?","Gregory J. Larson","I think it's probably more that we're raising prices, although we're clearly benefiting from mix shift, too.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And how much do you think the mix shift can benefit you into 2014?","Gregory J. Larson","I've got a quick percentage off the top of my head but I see no reason why we shouldn't continue to see mix shift be a factor next year. Just simply because we're going to -- when you look at the occupancy, I think we're going to finish this year somewhere 75.5%, maybe a touch better in terms of occupancy. So we're, obviously, at a great place in terms of having -- filling up the hotels many nights during the week. So if the group booking pace continues to do well, as we feel it is at this point in time, operators are going to be pretty confident about their ability to sell out during the normal nights during the week where we sell out, which means that the discount business and the government business is already down. But those 2 segments of our business, which tend to be cheaper, will be segments that we will be trying to effectively weed out by not reducing prices to make our hotels attractive for that customer, which will lead to mix shift.","Wes Golladay - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And turning to the Memphis and Calgary opportunities you guys have this quarter, how many of those do you expect over the next few years?","W. Edward Walter","There always seem to be a few per year. It's hard to predict when opportunities like this are going to come up. So I don't know that I -- but I could tell you, it's going to be 3 or 4 a year, but we're -- we certainly have a few other hotels where we see redevelopment opportunities next year that we're trying to sort through right now. And I'd like to think that we'll -- that those sorts of things will continue to crop up in the portfolio.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joe Greff with JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Given that maybe in the near term, at least you're more of a net seller, Ed. When you look at next year and you look at the levels of capital investment you've made the last couple of years, do you think 2014 levels of capital investment, CapEx, project CapEx, however you want to categorize them, that the direction of that will be down in '14 versus what you are budgeting for '13?","Gregory J. Larson","I don't know that it will be down a lot. We'll see some reduction. My guess is, is that what we would call maintenance CapEx will be generally consistent with the levels that we've been this year. Then the acquisition CapEx is probably down a bit simply because our acquisition pace this year has been lower. So there's really not a lot of meaningful CapEx that relates to '13's acquisition. We will be finishing up some work on the 2 Hyatts that will carry into next year. And then it's the ROI piece of it that we're really looking at right now and trying to decide how much of that to do next year. We do hope to be able to start the ballroom out in San Diego, which we still are comfortable will be a good investment. So those -- that's probably the areas swings the most. Kind of flowing back to our question that occurred earlier in this conversation, these ROI investments, they generally work, and they generally drive pretty high return. So we have made a conscious internal effort to reprioritize pursuing those types of investments. I don't know how much of that will show up in '14 versus '15. But given the returns that we can get, especially compared to the other opportunities we're seeing, we'd like to exploit those opportunities in our portfolio but that will affect our investment spending.","Operator","We'll go to Nikhil Bhalla with FBR.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just a question in terms of -- you talked about seeing acceleration in bookings in the quarter for the quarter. Any signs on like why that may be the case and what's probably driving that kind of near-term acceleration?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know that we have any particular insight into that. I think we have long felt that there was -- there is linkage between employment growth and GDP growth and group bookings. It's -- you'd look at it a little bit and perhaps suggest that in general corporate America because it's really our corporate bookings that are driving this activity. Maybe on the margin, feeling a bit more optimistic and sort of looking to take advantage of whatever is happening within their individual company to try to meet more often, but I don't know that we have a great explanation for why it picked up other than that general sense that perhaps the economy is improving.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the sale of some assets that you referred to earlier. If you can probably give us some sense of what the amount is that we can think about and the possible use of the proceeds.","W. Edward Walter","It's hard to predict the amounts because they tend to be somewhat lumpy. But I guess, I would say in general, is the level of asset sales you've seen over the last couple of years from us was, Greg, has been roughly $400 million or so.","Gregory J. Larson","$450 million or so.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I mean, I would certainly think that our goal for 2014 would be in that range, conceivably higher. And what was the -- I'm sorry, what was the second part of your question?","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just the use of proceeds from...","W. Edward Walter","Use of proceeds.","Nikhil Bhalla - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yes.","W. Edward Walter","Well, Greg gave a great description of what we've done so far as we're getting so much closer to achieving our balance sheet objectives, and we certainly hope to kind of get the rest of the way there next year, primarily on EBITDA growth. When we sell an asset today, I think, one option is to invest that in incremental -- in new investments, in new hotels. Another would be some of these ROI-type investments that I described. The third option would be to invest the proceeds from that sale into paying down debt. Most of these transactions are at varying levels of tax -- generating varying levels of taxable income. So if we don't exchange the proceeds on a tax-free basis into a new investment, we're probably going to need to dividend out incremental taxable income so the dividend would go up. And then the other 2 options to really use the proceeds for and what we've been doing, which is paying down debt. And lastly, as the cycle progresses, I mean, one thing we always come back and look at is does it make sense to buy our stock as an investment as opposed to some of the other investment opportunities I described. So all of those things will get looked at as we continue our asset sale program.","Operator","We'll go to our next question from Ryan Meliker with MLV and Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the acquisition and disposition market. Are you at the point now where you're struggling to find the right acquisitions because values have gotten too steep and numbers don't pencil out? Is that reminiscent to 2006-2007 time frame of the last cycle? Are things very different in Europe and maybe outside the U.S. than what you're seeing in the U.S.? Just some color on that would be really helpful.","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I would not describe our market here as back to '06-'07 levels where in hindsight, and frankly, at that time, we felt pricing was crazy. We're not at those types of levels. I think pricing is competitive but, yes, we're not at points where people are paying what will later look like absurd prices for assets. I think the bigger issue is that while volumes a relatively high this year or higher than where they were last year, they're just -- it's been some limited service portfolios that have not been of interest to us. It has been second -- you're starting to see some pickup in some of the secondary markets. Those are not markets we're interested in acquiring. And generally, a lot of the other assets that have traded have just not been ones that we thought made sense to invest in. But I would not look at the market as it stands right now and say that it's being stretched or the people are really using unrealistic assumptions to justify a purchase. I would contrast Europe, which is really the other markets that's been more active with U.S. and say that there, you're -- there's been less activity in Europe, and the activity that you're seeing there is generally driven more by maturing debt or debt issues as opposed to the sales that are happening in the U.S., which I think are happening more because of the strategy of the individual owner. And maybe they're looking -- they own a fund to cash in essentially or if they're not a fund investor, then they're in a mode where they just want to redeploy the proceeds for other uses. So Europe activity has been at lower levels but it seems to be driven more by the debt issue than anything else so far.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And with regards to -- has the buyer pool in the U.S. change over the past few months and know that we -- maybe it's a one-off in paper, but we've now seen 2 different hedge fund opt for 2 different publicly traded companies over the past weeks. Are we at the point now where we're starting to see a lot more private equity, a lot more [indiscernible] buyers getting involved, or are we not there yet?","W. Edward Walter","Certainly, the recent offers that we've seen would suggest that we're seeing more private activity. One group -- I think right now, part of what you're seeing is that while debt issuance is certainly not back to the levels that we've been in '05, '06 and '07, you are seeing some increasing activity on the debt side. And since a lot of your opportunity fund, private buyers tend to use higher leverage than, say, the REIT universe. They probably sees them being more comfortable in bidding for assets because they're more comfortable that they're going to be able to get the best that they need to provide for that. I think the other buyer that you're seeing is the nonlisted REITs are continuing to raise capital. And so those folks, as they continue to raise capital, continue to invest. So that buyer has been active over the last 12 to 24 months, but they certainly continue to be active today, too.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

The 2012 as-adjusted first quarter results include an adjustment to add the operations for March 24, 2012 through March 31, 2012, for our Marriott-managed hotels, and an adjustment to add the March operations for our hotels managed by Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt, Starwood and other managers who report on a calendar basis, as our historical first quarter results only included January and February operations for these properties. The following discussion of operating performance will include a comparison between the 3 months of operations ended March 31 for both years.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee, and good morning, everyone. And before I get started, let me apologize in advance for the state of my voice. The allergy season in D.C. has been particularly bad for me this week. It probably wasn't the best idea I had to attend my son's lacrosse game last night, but it was a good one to have seen. I assure you, I feel much better than I sound and more importantly, I feel much better about our business than I sound.","So with that, we are pleased to report that 2013 is off to a strong start with another quarter of outstanding results for the company. Although the timing of the Easter and Passover holidays presented difficult comparisons for the month of March, overall strong rate growth, coupled with margin growth that was better than expected, led to earnings results that exceeded consensus estimates.","Consistent with our commentary on the year-end call in February, we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business and our outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. First, let's review our results for the quarter.","First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 5.1%, driven primarily by an increase in our average rate of 4%, coupled with an occupancy improvement of 0.7 percentage points, to over 72%. The calendar challenges led to a slight reduction in comparable food and beverage revenues, while other revenues jumped 5.6%, which resulted in overall revenue growth of 2.6%. These year-over-year revenue growth percentages would be roughly 100 basis points higher if 2012 had not been a leap year.","Excellent cost-containment measures, combined with strong rate growth, led to solid margin expansion, as comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins increased 85 basis points.","Adjusted EBITDA was $283 million, an increase of more than 10% over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.28, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflects a nearly 17% increase over last year. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our results.","The key drivers of our first quarter results were solid increases in transient average rate and demand. As I mentioned earlier, the shift in Easter and Passover, from April in 2012 to March in 2013, created difficult comparisons to the prior year and impacted our downtown hotels that are highly reliant on group and business travelers. However, our hotels in resort locations benefited from the holiday shift, as RevPAR increased 11.6%.","Starting with our transient business, we experienced rate increases across all of our business segments in all 3 months of the quarter, resulting in a more than 4.5% increase in rate. When adjusted for the leap year, demand was also positive in all 3 months of the quarter, and our highest-rated premium segment increased over 13%.","In addition, demand for our higher-rated promotional segments also increased double digits, while our lower-rated government segment declined 1.5%. Holiday and leisure travel positively impacted our March results, with transient demand up more than 7% and rate up 4%, leading to a revenue increase of 11.5% for the month. Overall, our first quarter transient results, when adjusted for the leap year, reflected an increase in demand of more than 5%, and combined with the rate increase, resulted in more than 10% increase in revenue.","On the group front, 2013 started strong in January with an increase in room nights of nearly 3%, coupled with the rate increase for that month of nearly 3.5%. In February, adjusted for the leap year, demand was essentially flat while average rate was up more than 1%. In March, demand was up more than 4.5% in the first 3 weeks of the month, but volume in the final holiday-impacted week declined nearly 45%, resulting in a 12.5% decline for March with rates up slightly.","Overall, group demand, adjusted for the leap year, declined by nearly 4%, but from a segment perspective, we were pleased to see an increase in our high-priced corporate business. The bulk of the decline was driven by reductions in our discount business, which included a few cancellations from government and government-related groups.","In addition, a decrease in short-term government bookings contributed to the shortfall. Group rates improved by more than 1%, leading to a revenue decline in our group business of approximately 2.5% for the quarter.","Looking at the rest of the year, while booking activity in the first quarter was weak, our booking pace remained solid for the remainder of the year, with pace up almost 3% and revenues up over 6%. At this point, we believe about 85% of our full-year group bookings are already under contract. The second and fourth quarters look quite strong, while the third quarter is essentially flat, in part due to the absence of the Republican Presidential Convention in Tampa, where our hotels served as the headquarters.","Looking further out, bookings for 2014 picked up very nicely during the first quarter, suggesting that we are seeing some lengthening of the booking cycle. As we mentioned last year, we are working on various value-enhancement projects, where we evaluate and find alternate uses for existing hotel space or excess land to enhance or generate new revenue. Specifically, this month we sold approximately 4 acres of land adjacent to the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Spa for $24 million. The land, which had previously been used for tennis courts, was sold to a luxury homebuilder and has been approved for the development and sale of 79 luxury condominiums. The company recognized a gain of $21 million, which will be included in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted FFO next quarter.","On the transaction front, we continue to expect to be active on both acquisitions and dispositions, as we look to increase our investment in target markets and look to reduce our exposure in non-core locations. We intend to be a net acquirer in 2013 and have active pipelines, both in sales and acquisitions, and anticipate acquisition activity in the range of $135 million to $150 million in the second quarter. However, given the difficulty in predicting the timing of completing transactions, our guidance does not assume the effect of any acquisitions or dispositions.","Turning to capital investments for the first quarter. We invested $21 million in redevelopment and return on investment capital projects. We completed the construction of a pavilion at the JW Marriott Desert Springs Resort & Spa, and also converted a restaurant in the meeting space at the Westin New York Grand Central. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $90 million to $100 million.","We spent approximately $15 million on acquisition projects in the first quarter. We completed the renovation of all of the 888 guestrooms at the Grand Hyatt Washington, and continued work on the guestroom renovations in the second tower of the Manchester Grand Hyatt in San Diego. For the full year, we expect to spend $40 million to $50 million in total on these projects.","In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $87 million in the first quarter and expect to spend $270 million to $290 million for the full year. Projects in the quarter included room renovations at the Philadelphia Airport Marriott, San Francisco Marriott Marquis and the San Diego Marriott Mission Valley hotels, as well as the renovation of almost 40,000 square feet of meeting space and public space at the Ritz-Carlton.","Now let me spend some time on our outlook for the remainder of 2013. With fundamentals expected to remain strong for the balance of the year, we continue to expect our comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the year to be 5% to 7%. On the margin side, given the increasing importance of rate growth, we believe we can drive incremental profitability and strong flow-through, therefore, we expect margin increases of 60 basis points to 120 basis points, which is 10 basis points higher than what we described in February.","Based on these improved operating assumptions, as well as the gain on sale of the land at the Newport Beach Resort and Spa, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.275 billion to $1.335 billion and our adjusted FFO per share for the year, between $1.25 and $1.33. Roughly 1\/2 of the improvement in FFO was related to the expected higher EBITDA and the other 1\/2 reflects the benefits of less expensive debt.","Confirming the benefits of the capital investment decisions we have made over the last few years, which are contributing to stronger operating results, the midpoint in our guidance suggests EBITDA growth of 10% over 2012. The combination of better operations, opportunistic debt refinancings and the careful use of equity to fund growth, have generated, at the midpoint, adjusted FFO per share growth of 17% over 2012.","Looking at our dividend, we increased our first quarter common dividend to $0.10 per share. Dividends for the remainder of the year will depend on operating results and gains on asset sales.","In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2013. Based on our expectations for fundamentals in the business, including a supply growth forecast that remains below historical averages, we continue to believe that the current growth cycle in lodging will be sustained. Our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from these strong fundamentals, particularly given the significant investment we have made in our assets in the form of maintenance capital, ROI and repositioning investments.","Thank you. And now let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Larry K. Harvey","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Our top-performing market for the quarter was San Antonio with RevPAR growth of 16.6%. Occupancy improved 4 percentage points and ADR improved over 10%, as the group mix shifted to higher-rated association and corporate business. We expect San Antonio to have a weaker second quarter and then perform better in the second half of the year, due to strong citywide bookings.","RevPAR for our Boston hotels increased 14.2%, driven by a 7 percentage-point increase in occupancy and an improvement in ADR of over 2%. The outperformance was driven by in-house group demand, which created compression to drive rate. We expect our Boston hotels to have a good second quarter, due to solid in-house group bookings. The marathon bombs and subsequent manhunt in Boston had a small negative impact on our hotels in the second quarter.","Our Miami\/Fort Lauderdale hotels also performed well, with RevPAR up 12.8%, as ADR increased nearly 15% and occupancy declined 1.5 percentage points. Strength in both group and transient bookings allowed our hotels to drive rate. We expect our Miami\/Fort Lauderdale hotels to perform in line with the portfolio in the second quarter.","RevPARs for our New York hotels increased 12.1%. ADR improved slightly, but occupancy increased more than 8 percentage points. Demand in New York was very strong. One component of that demand is overseas arrivals. At this point, approximately 1\/3 of the overseas arrivals into the U.S. go to New York City, which is 20 percentage points better than Los Angeles, the second highest market with 13%.","With renovations last year at the Sheraton New York, the New York Marriott Marquis and the W Union Square, our first quarter results in 2013 benefited from the favorable comparisons. Although, first quarter results this year were negatively affected by the final phase of the Sheraton New York's meeting space renovations and mechanical work at the W New York, we expect our New York hotels to continue to perform well due to an increase in both group and transient demand and less overall renovation disruption.","Our Houston hotels had a great quarter, with a RevPAR increase of 11.8%, substantially driven by improvements in ADR from both rate increases and a shift in the mix of business to higher-rated segments, as both group and transient demand were strong. Our Houston hotels will continue to perform well in the second quarter due to solid group and transient bookings.","Our Hawaiian hotels continue to outperform our expectations with a RevPAR increase of 8.4%. Occupancy improved nearly 3 percentage points to 89.4% due to strong group and transient demand, which drove rate growth to 5%. We expect our Hawaiian hotels to continue to perform well in the second quarter.","Our Seattle hotels had another good quarter with RevPAR up 7.6%. Occupancy improved nearly 4 percentage points, as transient demand was very strong and ADR increased by 1.2%. We expect Seattle to have a great second quarter due to excellent group bookings, which will help to drive rate and RevPAR growth.","RevPAR for our Washington D.C. hotels increased 2.3%, as occupancy improved 40 basis points and ADR was up roughly 2% due to the Presidential Inauguration. Our downtown hotels performed much better than the suburbs, with RevPAR up 5.3%. We expect D.C. to continue to struggle due to weakness in government and government-related travel, somewhat stemming from the sequester.","With our San Francisco Marriott Marquis under renovation, RevPAR for the quarter in San Francisco was down 2.5%. Occupancy declined roughly 4 percentage points, while rate was up 3%. RevPAR for the Marquis was down 13%. Excluding the Marquis renovation, RevPAR in San Francisco would have been up 6.7%. We expect our San Francisco hotels to perform much better in the second quarter.","Our San Diego hotels struggled in the first quarter due to poor citywide demand, and were affected by rooms renovations at 3 of our hotels in the quarter. Occupancy was down 4.6 percentage points and ADR was down nearly 2%. We expect San Diego to perform better the rest of the year.","Excluding the Sheraton Roma, which was under renovation last year, the pro forma RevPAR for the 18 hotels in the European joint venture, which includes the 5-hotel portfolio acquired by debenture in December of last year, decreased 1.5% for the quarter in constant euros, as ADR decreased roughly 1% and occupancy fell slightly. EBITDA margins decreased 220 basis points. The overall weak eurozone economies and unusually cold winter affected demand. The Paris Marriott Rive Gauche and the Renaissance Amsterdam performed the best in the quarter, while the Pullman Paris Bercy and Sheraton Skyline underperformed. We expect the euro JV hotels to perform much better in the second quarter.","For the quarter, comparable hotel adjusted operating margins increased 85 basis points. Margin growth benefited, as 80% of the RevPAR growth was driven by improvements in ADR. F&B profit declined 3.6%, as a result of leap year 2012, less group business and the movement of Easter holiday into the first quarter. Support costs, which include G&A, repair and maintenance, sales and marketing and utilities, decreased roughly 1% due to excellent cost controls at our hotels. Property taxes increased 5%.","Looking to the rest of the year, we expect that RevPAR will continue to be driven primarily by rate growth,, which should lead to solid rooms flow-through even with growth in wage and benefit costs. We expect better food and beverage revenue and profits for the rest of the year due to better group demand. We expect support costs to increase more than inflation, particularly for rewards in sales and marketing, where higher revenues will increase cost, and for utilities, where we expect rates to increase, particularly in the second half of the year. We're in the process of renewing our property insurance program on June 1.","While property insurance was up only 1% in the first quarter, we expect above-inflationary increases in our insurance costs. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 60 basis points at the low end of the range, and increase 120 basis points at the high end of the range. At this point, we are forecasting that roughly 30% to 32% of our full-year EBITDA will be earned in the second quarter.","During the quarter, we issued our first investment-grade senior notes in a $400 million offering at an interest rate of 3.75%, which is 100 basis points cheaper than any non-convertible bond coupon in our history. The bonds have a 10.5-year term and mature in October of 2023. On May 15, the proceeds of the offering, along with available cash, will be used to redeem the $400 million and 9% Series T senior notes that mature in May of 2017 at 104.5%, which reflects an $18 million call premium. The interest savings are substantial at $21 million a year.","We also called the remaining $175 million in 2004 exchangeable debentures, $174 million of which were converted into 11.7 million shares of common stock and $1 million was repaid in cash. These shares have been in our diluted FFO share count for the last few years. All in, the total cost of the 2004 exchangeable debentures was approximately 4%, well below the 6.8% interest rate that we could have issued a non-exchangeable senior notes bond in 2004.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we repaid our only meaningful debt maturity in 2013, a 4.75%, $246 million mortgage loan on the Orlando World Center Marriott. In addition, on May 2, we called $200 million of our 6.75% Series Q senior notes. We intent to draw approximately $150 million on our credit facility and fund the remaining amount with available cash in order to redeem the debt on June 3. After adjusting for these transactions, the company will have approximately $380 million in cash and cash equivalents, $692 million of available capacity under our credit facility, and $4.8 billion in debt.","At this point, our run rate cash interest expense is roughly $230 million a year and we ended the quarter with a leverage of 3.9x net debt-to-EBITDA.","In the quarter, we issued approximately 6 million shares of common stock at an average price of $16.78 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $102 million which will be utilized to fund a portion of our acquisitions for this year. Additional issuances will be based on the level of acquisition opportunities and the level of our stock price.","Lastly, there is one additional item I wanted to highlight for you. In the first quarter, we recognized a gain of approximately $11 million because the State of Georgia condemned approximately 3 acres of land at the Atlanta Perimeter Center Marriott for highway expansion. We received the cash in 2007, but cannot recognize the gain until we've completed certain requirements. While this gain is considered NAREIT FFO and has been included therein, we excluded the gain from both adjusted FFO and adjusted EBITDA.","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Joshua Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Same-store growth was up 5.1%, and -- but the total portfolio is up 6.6%. Can you talk about some of the properties in the non-comp pool that drove that upside? And do you expect a gap of that magnitude between comp and non-comp RevPAR to persist through the remainder of the year?","W. Edward Walter","Certainly, Josh. Let me try to clarify a couple of things here, though. The 6.6% change in RevPAR that Josh is referencing is a comparison of what was our RevPAR for all of our properties in the first quarter of last year compared to what is our RevPAR for -- in the first quarter of 2013 for everything that we own today. So part of what's captured in that difference, and the RevPAR in 2013 is 6.6% higher than what it was before, a big part of what's captured in there compared to our 5.1% RevPAR growth in the first quarter is the strong performance of a number of the hotels that we have invested capital in and have -- and consequently have significantly improved our operations, as well as some of the hotels that we've purchased, which are not part of our comp set, which are performing well. All of those hotels -- that subgroup that I just described, had RevPAR growth above 27% in the first quarter. The other piece, though, of the -- of that calculation that we need to remember, is that the comp set in 2012 is slightly different, or the overall number of hotels we owned in 2012 is different from what we owned in 2013. So for instance, what's in the 2012 number is the Atlanta Marquis, what's in the 2013 number is the Grand Hyatt in D.C. So there's 2 factors that are applied there. But the bottom line point, Josh, that you've identified, which is that the broader portfolio is growing a bit faster than what our comparable portfolio is growing, is true.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And do you expect that gap of 100, 150 basis points to persist for the rest of the year?","W. Edward Walter","I can't sit here and say that I've exactly looked at it. But the reality is that, other than to the extent that those numbers are affected by sales or acquisitions, which would change that relationship a little bit, the reality is it should generally continue at that level.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And if I could follow up, Ed, with one more question on equity. You issued $100 million through the ATM in the quarter and that's on top of $270 million that you issued last year. And I understand you're working toward a leverage target of 3x and that those aren't very big numbers in the context of your market cap, but they do add up over time. And at the same time, asset sales seem like they may accelerate, it could be a source of capital for you. Can you just explain the rationale for the equity issuance, and also is there an acquisition pipeline where you might be able to put some of that money to work in the near-term?","W. Edward Walter","As I highlighted in my comments, we do -- we are looking at a couple of things where we feel relatively confident we may -- we'll have a closing in the second quarter on a transaction. And so I would -- I guess I would describe the equity raise in March as pre-funding the capital required to complete that acquisition. I would also agree with you that we are intending on seeing sales accelerate over the course of this year, and in general, would like to fund most of our acquisitions out of the proceeds of asset sales.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Andrew Didora from Bank of America.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just wanted to kind of follow up on Josh's question with regards to the equity issuance and as it relates to the acquisition environment. I mean, I guess from what we've been seeing out there in terms of transactions, there hasn't been a whole lot of quality out there, to this point in time, that would probably be very accretive to your portfolio. It seems like you're probably seeing something else in terms of your pipeline. But I guess with your stock implying you guys trading around $290 [ph]  per key, does it ever make sense to maybe buying back stock at these levels rather than issuing?","W. Edward Walter","As we have described in the past, sort of the process that we go through as we sell assets and then determine what to do with those proceeds, one of the things that we would always look at is whether it made sense to buy back our stock. I guess what I would say is that, so far, as we've gone through that process, we've concluded that it either made sense to reinvest in our portfolio in the form of some of these redevelopments and ROI investments we've made, or it has -- we felt comfortable in redeploying that capital into acquisitions. Certainly, as we progressed through the cycle and we inevitably reach the point where we're a bigger seller than we are a buyer, then at that point in time, we'll again continue to look at whether it makes sense in buying back our stock [indiscernible] at the same time the leverage targets that we've described to you all that we'd like to obtain.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. And do you plan when that -- when you close on some of these acquisitions, do you plan on putting additional debt on to help fund those acquisitions, or is this going to be purely equity?","W. Edward Walter","I would say we're at the point now where we feel pretty good about where we -- we feel good about the length of the cycle. And so generally -- and we feel good about the progress that we've already made in terms of improving our balance sheet. So the reality is, as we look at incremental acquisitions, we're thinking of funding those sort of on a pro rata basis in terms of debt and equity, consistent with where the company is currently capitalized. Now you're not going to likely see that in the context of, \"Oh well, we put a secured loan on an asset right after we bought it,\" because that's just not how we do things. But when we think more broadly about our financing plan for the year, we would be envisioning if our acquisition activity heated up, and to the extent that it exceeded our asset sales activity, that we would fund that through a combination of debt and equity.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Thomas Allen, Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just on the operating environment, you talked last quarter about how good you felt around group bookings for later this year. This quarter, you and others seem to maybe be a little bit more cautious. What do you think has changed in the market that's flowing in the year bookings? Maybe I'm just coming from a Wall Street view, but the equity markets keep on going up, job numbers keep on beating expectations, kind of why are groups holding off bookings?","W. Edward Walter","I think you've accurately summarized what a number of us have seen over the past quarter. And I don't know that there is a perfect explanation for it. I mean, I would say we still feel pretty good about group. We feel, as we talked about in our comments, especially the second and fourth quarters of this year look very, very strong from a group perspective. And just as importantly, when I look out to 2014, we had a very nice jump in terms of room nights and revenues that were booked for 2014. So the longer term seems to be fairly positive. But having said that, there was a little bit of weakness during the first quarter relative to overall bookings. I think some of that is probably tied in with the weakness in government bookings. I think we did -- I think all of our operators and most of our larger properties saw some reduction in government bookings over the course, or more than some, something in the 40% range in terms of government bookings during the quarter. So I think that contributed to part of it. I also think that, while you're right about unemployment is -- or employment is improving, unemployment is declining and certainly, today's report seems to be a positive one, the reality is, compared to where we've been in other cycles, we are way behind in terms of reducing the unemployment rate. So I just looked the other day and realized that, back in '04 and '05, which was when we were starting to approach -- really rebuild our whole group pipeline and our group business, we were looking at an unemployment rate that was more in the 5% to 5.5%, not the 7.5% and above that we're facing right now. So while the data that connects employment and group business is not as tight a correlation as some of the others we've seen in the industry, I've still generally found that group, especially corporate group, accelerates when you start to see more employment growth, and today's report, in some ways, gave me some -- even more of a sense of optimism about what we might see over the latter half of the year.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Joe Greff from JPMorgan.","Joseph Greff - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have a question for you on your updated EBITDA guidance. It's up $25 million from where you were a quarter ago. And then obviously, what you accurately described, 1Q adjusted EBITDA nicely beat consensus, and now you're including a $21 million gain here in April. Can you reconcile all those pieces and whether or not 1Q was more in line and then 2Q really is unchanged, adjusted for this gain or are you saying to us, maybe 2Q through 4Q, from an EBITDA perspective, is slightly below where you were a few months ago?","W. Edward Walter","I'd say that -- I mean, first off, if you look at the guidance change that we've made, I'd say that the bulk of the lift in the EBITDA guidance is related to the recognition of the gain associated with the sale of the property in Newport Beach. But however, there is some improvement there that's tied to the fact that we feel more confident about where margins are going to come out for the year. I would not read our -- read anything more into that guidance other than the fact that we continue to feel fairly good about the whole year. We probably -- I'm trying to get a handle on the first quarter. It was maybe a little bit more challenging, given the changes in the calendar that we have faced, and we did do better than we had expected, and so as a result, I continue to feel very good about how the year is going to play out. I don't have any less of a sense of optimism regarding the last 3 quarters of the year than I did in February.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from David Loeb from Baird.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about acquisitions? It sounds like you have some specific transactions that are near closing. Can you give us a little color, if not specifically on those, on what regions you think you'll be most active in, what cap rates are like, what's the state of competition for acquisitions these days?","W. Edward Walter","Sure, David. I guess what I would say is we've been pretty clear about what the markets are that we've been most interested in investing. It's generally are the coastal markets, Chicago and Hawaii. And as we're -- I would say right now that the focus for us has -- for this year, is representing -- recognizing the strength that we already have in sort of the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic, has been to focus more on the West Coast markets with the exception of San Diego. We're certainly looking at some of the markets in Waikiki, not more in Hawaii. So probably more Waikiki, not Maui, given our presence in Maui already. And then on the East Coast, I think the one market that we're very interested in adding more exposure is Miami, because we're certainly underrepresented there. And that is a market that has done quite well, and we think will continue to do quite well. If you -- in terms of thinking about where the market is in terms of pricing and competition, I mean, I think we're -- there continues to be a slow flow of assets to the market. I wouldn't say it's a flood. I would say that that's probably reflective of the fact that people are fairly comfortable that the cycle is going to be extended. And so there is no rush to reap value before the theoretical end of the cycle. So I think that's why we haven't seen maybe as many assets on the market as folks had hoped. But having said that, the brokerage community is probably closer to the overall degree of the flow than we are. And I think they still seem to feel that the transaction activity this year will be pretty comparable to what existed last year.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","In terms of -- well, let me go back to one follow-up and then I'll ask you to come back to the cap rates. In terms of global regions, it sounds like your focus is much more U.S. at this point rather than Europe or Australia or other markets.","W. Edward Walter","Well, I would -- I guess, in part, I should correct my answer a bit. I would say we are still looking to invest globally. We have about EUR 130 million in equity commitment remaining in the European JV and our activity there is generally focused in Northern Europe, with a primary focus in Germany. We are interested in adding more exposure to Brazil, as we continue to like the fundamentals there and generally feel good about where Brazil is headed. And then in Asia, the market that's getting the most focus, it would be Australia. So you had correctly identified that. It's always hard to predict what the mix of activity's going to be. But as I've said in the past, we'd like to grow some of these international businesses. But we still expect that the bulk of our activity will happen in the U.S.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And any insight into cap rate trends?","W. Edward Walter","It's still affected by the markets, because it depends a little bit on how much the market has recovered vis-\u00e0-vis prior peaks, and then what the near-term outlook is. But the sense that we have right now, is that if you're in a leading market, high-tier, either luxury or upper upscale asset, you're probably still in that 5% to 6% range for a cap rate. And then I think if you move to select service, you might drop -- that might increase by about a point.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take the next question from Ryan Meliker from MLV & Co.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I was hoping you could give a little more color. Ed, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the lengthening of the booking window. I know Marriott talked a little bit yesterday with regards to 2014 group booking pace accelerating. Can you give us some more color on what you're seeing in terms of who's booking further out? Is it association business that's expanding? And what your pace looks like for 2014 right now?","W. Edward Walter","What we're seeing in -- as it relates to who's booking, is it seems to be a combination of both associations who are looking at slightly bigger events. I don't know that they're booking more events, but I think they're booking bigger events, is what we hear. And then I think the other element of it is improved corporate bookings, which is good to see. And so I think that has been what's been driving the improvement. Overall, the -- if you just sort of combine both room night improvements as well as rate improvements, our group bookings for 2014 are up over 6%.","Ryan Meliker - MLV & Co LLC, Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then another question I was hoping you guys can answer for me was, can you give us any update on how the developments in Rio are progressing? And if you're looking to do anything more along those lines? And certainly, I would think you guys might be at a little bit of an advantage relative to some private developers out there, given limited construction financing and your access to the capital markets. It seems to be a little stronger than, I would say, the average private developer. Any color on any -- how those developments are progressing and expansion of that development process?","W. Edward Walter","The project that's under construction that's down in the Barra da Tijuca part of Rio de Janeiro, which is not far from where the Olympics will be held, is progressing right on schedule. And so we've been very happy with our -- the developer and construction team on that project, and everything seems to be headed in the right direction. I would tell you that the activity that we're looking at in Brazil right now seems to be more on the existing side than on the new construction side. But we would be open to an additional new development project. It just seems that the current flow right now has been more attractive on the existing side because of a couple of opportunities we're looking at there.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next one from Ian Weissman from ISI Group.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Can you remind us what percentage of your hotels are currently paying out incentive management fees and how that compares to the peak?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes, for this year, based on our forecast, it's roughly, call it 43% of our hotels, will pay incentive fees and then, call it, low to mid 60s at the peak.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Do you anticipate -- I mean, I understand it's a different environment. I mean, what's your expectations about those numbers getting back to peak?","W. Edward Walter","I don't know any reason why we wouldn't get back to those levels. I mean, we're -- as we look at where this is headed, I mean, we feel good about where the industry is going and consequently, I would expect that we would get right up to those levels and depending upon which assets are missing, I don't know why we wouldn't go by it.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So well, so ultimately then, you're saying then, you believe that the pace of rate growth, which has been somewhat muted just because of obviously weak job growth, group business has been sluggish, you anticipate that the rate growth environment is significantly going to accelerate from here. Is that fair to say?","W. Edward Walter","I mean, we had pretty good rate growth this last quarter. So I would say that we still expect to see some occupancy growth. But as we look at our full year, I think you're right that we would expect, over the course of this year, there's certainly a reasonable prospect for higher rate growth than what we had in the first quarter. Trying to predict where that goes beyond 2013 is a little tricky at this point in time, but I think the main point we're trying to make is that we would expect to see -- to continue to see RevPAR growth above inflation in the future, that will allow us to have margin growth above -- margin growth. All of those factors will ultimately lead to higher NOI, higher EBITDA, and that means our partners, the operators can have higher IMF.","Ian C. Weissman - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just finally, on the deals. I mean, there's a lot of focus on which markets you guys might potentially be interested in. Is there a potential shift, or at least growing interest in acquiring limited service or select service brands at this point? Or hotels?","W. Edward Walter","Yes. I don't know that it's a shift in attitude on our part in terms of acquiring and wanting to acquire them. But I would say that there's more than a handful of transactions that we've been in discussions about, that would involve what I would describe as urban select service or in-city, not in suburbs, but in-city select service. We think it's a natural complement to the hotels that we already own. And I think it's a business we feel comfortable we understand. And so, again, I don't think it's going to -- we're not thinking in any way that we're transforming our portfolio in a different direction. But in our target markets, as a complement to the assets we own in those markets, owning some select service would make sense from our perspective.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jeff Donnelly from Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Actually, I'll start with Larry. Larry, just -- I was just curious, in the release you mentioned you had $90 million to $100 million of ROI opportunities, what sort of unleveraged returns, can you remind us, do you expect on that capital? And maybe you can talk about the depth of that reinvestment pipeline beyond 2013?","Larry K. Harvey","So looking at those assets, Jeff, I mean, we're getting, call it, mid to high teens on some of those projects. So including our ROIs, energy ROIs, we've got a couple we're working on, particularly in New York City, got a $9 million one there, very good returns. So we -- as from a pipeline, we're constantly looking for those, and as Ed mentioned, we had the meeting space, the restaurant that was converted to meeting space at the Westin Grand Central. So we've been doing them for a long time and we're trying to do a better job of getting it out there, of all the stuff we've been doing. With that, it's adding meeting space when appropriate, getting rid of unprofitable restaurants and converting them into meeting space or other uses. But there's plenty of projects that we're looking out for.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Just put differently, do you think it's -- that's a good run rate, maybe for periods beyond 2013?","W. Edward Walter","That's a tricky question. I think that if you just look at what we would typically expect to see in the portfolio, sort of exclusive of larger projects, it probably doesn't run quite that high. I think it's probably -- I think my guess is it's 2\/3 of that. Now having said that, there is a project that we've been working on for a fair amount of time, that we've talked about in the past, which is a new ballroom out at the San Diego Marriott & Marina Hotel, which would sit between our Hyatt and our Marriott. And so that project, in and of itself, is probably in the $90 million to $100 million range. So when one of those comes along, it's going to change that equation pretty radically. But I would totally agree with Larry. Between the opportunity for energy ROIs and then just looking for opportunities to improve the portfolio in different ways, we never seem to have a shortage of these types of projects.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And maybe switching gears. Larry, can you talk about the market for financing, in particularly large hotel assets? There's been a few instances in the last year, where either there have been assets in the market or even just competitors I know, who own hotels that might be $500 million to $1 billion in value. And I think there's always a question mark out there as to whether, is Host the logical buyer, or who is the buyer for those? Because the question is how do you find the financing, once you talk about mortgages north of say, $300 million? Do you have any sort of experience or color there, and maybe how underwriting terms differ from a, I guess I'd call it a more typical single-asset financing?","Larry K. Harvey","Well, Jeff, I mean, you have to just go back a little bit, the CMBS market has improved significantly this year, but if you go back to where it was in the '05 to '07 peak, it was -- the CMBS market was a $200 million -- $200 billion a year in new issuance. This year the run rate is much higher. I think the prediction for this year is, call it, $80 billion to $100 billion, and last year it was, call it, low 50s. So there has been an improvement in that market. CMBS would be the perfect market for someone to go out and finance on the hotel side, and there have been a couple of one-off larger hotels, CMBS deals done. But if you had a $200 million, $150 million to $200 million hotel, what they would do is typically just drop it into one of those securitizations. So that market has improved significantly. And we would expect that to continue.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then -- and maybe just a question or 2 for Ed. Can you just talk about where you see hotel values today, relative to replacement cost? There just seems to be more anecdotes of either buildings getting converted into hotel uses or hotels being built, and I'm curious if you think there's some instances out there where city -- pricing in certain cities is maybe converging with where replacement cost is.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, it's -- I would say, as I think across the transactions that we've been looking at, in most instances, you're finding, certainly on the full-service side, I think you're still seeing that assets are trading at a discount to replacement cost. That discount is smaller in certain markets, where the recovery has been quicker. I think some of the West Coast markets, like San Francisco, might fall into that area. But I think you're still -- you're not seeing a lot of full-service upper upscale construction even being discussed. And I think that's a sort of confirmation of the fact that values have not yet risen to a point where they exceed the cost to construct. I think, as we typically see in our business, the select service side is a bit more efficient, runs higher margins and probably, ultimately, is always -- you always find the numbers make sense there more quickly. And so I do think, in some of these hotter markets, you're starting to see a point where new construction numbers can make some sense. Doesn't mean assets aren't necessarily still trading at below replacement cost today, but it would also mean that there is -- the newer projects that are being built, they're new, they're current, they're taking advantage of the trends in the industry. And so they may be able to convince themselves that there's a little bit better yield on cost there than what you might see on an acquisition. So the market, I think was -- we're not seeing a lot of supply anywhere other than in New York. New York would obviously be a prime example of what I just described, with all the construction that's going on there. But I think, as you would expect, as the cycle matures, you're seeing -- you're slowly seeing that begin to build a bit.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I'll depart with maybe an easy one for Larry. Any estimates of what the financial impact of the Affordable Care Act might be?","Larry K. Harvey","Jeff, that's a great question. I'm not sure anybody in the government knows. We are working with the brands, and I know Arne came out with something yesterday saying 50 basis points on margins. It's -- we're working with the brands. We're waiting on them to come back to us with better answers. But frankly, I think they're having -- somewhat challenged by the fact there isn't a lot of great information out there, and there's a lot of concerns over it actually getting implemented next year.","W. Edward Walter","Jeff, the one thing to recognize in our case is that, as we've talked with our operators, a huge majority of their folks are already taking advantage of their insurance -- their benefit offerings. So while we would expect to see the requirements to provide insurance will lead to some increase there, it's -- we're not in a situation where we've had very low levels of participation by the associates at the hotels and then would, therefore, expect to see a dramatic change in expenses as a result of the act.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Robin Farley from UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, 2 questions. First is, your D.C. market RevPAR increases, you're kind of a bit below what the market overall increase was, so I just wonder if you have some color around that? And then, the second question was, since you're seeing through this dichotomy between short-term and long-term group booking trends, just to think about what percent of your group typically is booked in the year for the year versus the year before. I think that a lot of times it maybe like 70% or 75% of your group bookings are booked before the year starts. So just trying to think about, is it only sort of 25% of bookings -- or not only 25%, it's obviously sizable, but kind of what amount of in-the-year, for-the-year business should we think of as being maybe at risk of this sort of short-term slowing?","W. Edward Walter","Well, I'm going to let Larry answer the question about D.C. and then I'll come back and address your question about bookings.","Larry K. Harvey","Yes. If you look at the upper D.C. -- if you look at the market for upper up, it was up 4.5%. Our D.C. presence, if you look at our downtown hotels, as I mentioned on the call, we're up 5.3%. So it's really the outside, the downtown area. So some of our suburban hotels, such as the Gaithersburg Washingtonian and a couple of other hotels out towards the Dulles Airport that have really impacted that. So as you get closer into the city, we're a little bit ahead of where the market upper up is.","W. Edward Walter","And as it relates to the group business, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're at the point of the year where we've booked or we have under contract 85% of the room nights that we expect to do for the year. So now the way I would look at that is that you really wouldn't expect more than 15% of that business for the full year to really be at risk. Obviously, there's always a risk of cancellations, which would be included in that 85% number. And as I mentioned earlier, we had seen some cancellations that we thought were sequester-related. But the properties have generally gone back out to their group business on the government side, over the course of the last month, and I think feel relatively confident that we're not going to see more cancellations. So that risk is always there. But the reality is, for our portfolio, the good news is that 85% of the business is on the books and should show up or we should get paid for it.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there -- could you quantify, when we think about the sort of 15% of in-the-year, for-the-year that may be at risk, what level of slowing we're seeing there, kind of where that 15% may end up?","W. Edward Walter","I mean, I would -- at this stage, we would generally expect that, for the remainder of the year, we should book about the same -- we should fill in that 15%. In other words, I feel pretty good about, based on the forecast that we've been looking at and the conversations we've had with our operators, we're relatively confident that we're going to finish the year with the amount of group rooms that we expect at this point.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's just that maybe at slightly lower rates potentially?","W. Edward Walter","No, I don't think we're seeing any real softness on the rate side. I mean, clearly, group business is important to us. But it still only represents about 38%, 39% of our overall business. And so, one of the things that's happening out there right now is that our transient business is so strong that we may end up with less -- I suspect we will finish this year with a little bit less group than what we had expected probably back in January or February. But one of the reasons for that is that transient demand is solid enough that we will not be taking lower-priced group, discount group, when we feel good about the ability to fill in those rooms with better-priced transient. And so -- well, I don't know that, that was much of a factor in the first quarter. As we look out to the rest of the year, and we're in periods of the year where occupancy is a lot stronger, I think that's one other factor that will be affecting our outlook.","Larry K. Harvey","Robin, this is Larry. Just one last thing. We did also have the Hyatt Capitol Hill under renovation in the quarter, so that also impacted that difference.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Jim Sullivan, Cowen Group.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Ed, just to follow on with this -- the issue on the group business, you talked about 38% to 39% of the total business being group, and where group has been particularly weak, I think in your prepared comments, I think you talked about the government, government-related, some cancellations. And I'm assuming also, because of the flat per diem, that there was probably an attempt on your part that perhaps reduced the government business anyway this year. And I just wonder if you can help us, what percentage of your group would you characterize as government, government-related?","W. Edward Walter","Let see, government business for us, overall, represents about 6% of our room nights. And that would be about split pretty evenly between transient and group. So that would be -- the government group would be less than 10% of our group business. It seems to me, if I do the math quickly in my head, we're probably in the 7%, 8% range.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, very good. And -- but was there also, coming into this year, because of the attempt to improve the mix shift, perhaps, reduce the government business or not?","W. Edward Walter","Definitely. Government, we've talked in the past that government, in general, whether it's on the group side or on the transient side, tends to be a lower-priced business, it tends to be a business that we -- as things get -- as times get better and pricing gets higher, we naturally find that its share of our overall activity declines. The fact that government group and individual travel would be weaker this year is something that we've all -- that everybody in the industry has known for quite some time. So we certainly have been working, as we could, to transition away from that. Some properties are obviously better situated to do that than others. But we expected that business to decline as the recovery progresses and that's what's happening.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, then secondly, there's been a lot of discussion about capital allocation and markets, but -- and really, just to follow on. I know that a few weeks ago that you and your partners increased your capital commitment to the European JV. And in the -- your prepared comments, you talked about weather being a negative in the first quarter. Could you just tell us when you think about the opportunities in Europe, and I know you've identified them as Northern Europe, primarily, but when you think about the business outlook for the balance of this year, on the one hand, and then secondly, whether there is likely to be more products coming into market in Europe because of pressure on capital ratios for some of the owners, I'm just curious as you think about that and the cap rates in Europe versus North America, how you would kind of frame that opportunity vis-\u00e0-vis the coastal markets in the U.S.?","W. Edward Walter","I would say that, first of all, you've correctly diagnosed what's driving transaction activity in Europe, which is generally, outside of a few transactions, and I probably put the InterCon in London in this exclusion area, but other than a few transactions that might have been driven by strategic reasons, the bulk of the activity that's happening there seems to be in some way related to debt, maturing debt or too much debt. So that also means that I would expect the volume of activities that we would review and look at in Europe will be lighter than what we've seen in the U.S., because I think we're in a better position right now in the U.S. in terms of overall values. In terms of yields in Europe, they vary considerably by the city and the country. I would say that yields, cap rates and what we would view as a 10-year unlevered IRR, in some of the -- in the major markets, so we're talking, really, London and Paris, are comparable to what you would expect to see in the top cities in the U.S. As you move into Germany, where there's no one dominant market, I would say that those cap rates are higher and the target IRR -- so the achievable 10-year IRR in those markets would be higher than what you would see in the U.S.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then finally, for me, there was some discussion about the improving CMBS market here. And as you, again, think about that in connection with your U.S. acquisition\/disposition thinking, have you seen cap rate compression between what you would call the, kind of the primary coastal gateway markets that have been your focus on the one hand, cap rate compression between that and, say, the secondary markets, but still important markets -- and I'd facilitate [ph]  the Marriott Marquis in Atlanta this quarter -- is it more attractive now on a relative spread basis because financing is strengthening?","W. Edward Walter","Jim, I think that's a good insight, is that as the CMBS market recovers, there should be more financing available to the sort of non-gateway markets. I don't know that there's been enough transaction activity yet and enough price discovery to really establish that, that gap has closed in a material way. But I think that that's a likely outcome over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, because as the financing's available and the interest rates are attractive, capital will start to flow in that direction. Our goal's going to be to try to take advantage of that by being a seller of assets in those markets.","Operator","And at this time, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Mr. Walter for any closing or additional remarks.","W. Edward Walter","All right. Well, thank you for joining us for this call today. I again apologize for my voice, but I'm pleased to see that I hung in there all the way through the call. I assure you I'll sound better in July. Look forward to talking to you later in the summer. Have a good weekend, everybody.","Operator","That will conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation."],"11559":["Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Tejal Engman, Vice President of Investor Relations.","Tejal Engman","Thanks, Travis. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDAre in our comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's press release and our 8-K filed with the SEC and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide overview of our fourth quarter results, key business trends, and our outlook for 2020. Brian MacNamara, our Principal Financial Officer and Controller, will then provide detailed commentary on our fourth quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2020. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James Risoleo","Thank you, Tejal, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. Before I address our 2019 results and 2020 guidance, I want to take a moment to thank Michael Bluhm for his service as CFO. We had significant accomplishments under his tenure that Brian will address and we wish him well as he begins his role as Global Head of Lodging for Morgan Stanley based in Los Angeles.","2019 was another highly productive year for Host. We successfully executed large value-enhancing capital allocation transactions and delivered a solid operational performance, which exceeded our adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share expectations for the fourth quarter. We capitalized on favorable market conditions and sold 14 of our lower total RevPAR, higher capital expenditure hotels for $1.3 billion. We further upgraded the quality of our portfolio by acquiring the iconic 1 Hotel South Beach, completing 4 renovations as part of the Marriott transformational capital program, and investing in multiple value-enhancing development projects across the portfolio. We returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while further strengthening our best-in-class investment-grade balance sheet.","Finally, we delivered our strongest comparable total RevPAR and RevPAR performance for 2019 in the fourth quarter, while achieving solid margins in the year challenged by accelerating wage and benefit expense growth. We exceeded the top end of our full year 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance range, primarily due to stronger-than-expected total revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Comparable hotel total RevPAR was 190 basis points due to better-than-expected food and beverage as well as other revenues. We will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail later.","I would like to now focus on the 4 key business trends that impacted our 2019 operational performance and that are expected to impact 2020 as well. First is the strong food and beverage and other revenue growth that we experienced in the quarter and year. We delivered comparable total RevPAR growth that is 200 basis points higher than comparable room's RevPAR growth for the quarter and160 basis points higher for the year. Food and beverage revenues grew largely because of corporate in-house group business, which typically had robust contribution ratios. Other revenues were bolstered by miscellaneous increases, including higher golf and spa revenues. Our solid total RevPAR growth speaks to our ability to grow revenues through multiple channels at our hotels. Approximately, 35% of our revenues are earned from food and beverage, conference and meeting space, spa and other amenities. In an environment where the industry is near peak occupancy with modest ADR growth, our ability to grow revenues through nonroom sources is a key strength of our portfolio. While we expect continued total RevPAR growth in 2020, its growth rate should be roughly the same as RevPAR due to a tougher year-over-year comparison.","The second trend is the strong growth we've experienced in loyalty redemption revenues, which has supported our leisure demand. Some of the increase is due to structural changes that Marriott International has introduced Bonvoy redemption, such as the opportunity to earn greater redemption revenue through increased occupancy tiers. Marriott introduced Bonvoy in early 2019 with the rollout across all consumer touch points, including our property sales and marketing channels, digital, mobile and co-branded credit cards. Additionally, the launch was boosted by a multimillion dollar media campaign. In late 2019, Marriott announced peak and offpeak redemption schedule, which should further support our 2020 growth expectations. Our redemption revenues have grown well in excess of the revenues outlined in the business case Marriott made for Bonvoy in 2019. In the fourth quarter, we grew Marriott Bonvoy redemption revenues by nearly 22% for our comparable hotels and 24% for all our own Marriott hotels, with the Venetian Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Ritz-Carlton, Marina del Rey achieving the highest redemption revenues in the portfolio. Although redemption revenues will also face tough comparisons this year, Host's ability to leverage Marriott's powerful loyalty program is another key strength for our business.","The third trend is the continued acceleration in wage and benefit expense growth. Wage and benefit expenses increased 370 basis points in the quarter and 290 basis points for the year on a year-over-year basis. We were able to largely offset this expense growth through a variety of external and internal initiatives, which allows us to achieve breakeven margins at 1% RevPAR growth in 2019. Our external initiatives were driven by near-term Marriott-Starwood merger synergy, which were largely realized in 2019. Our internal initiatives, we expect smaller incremental efficiencies in 2020 relative to last year. Meanwhile, we expect wage and benefit expense growth to increase by approximately 5% in 2020 over 2019 as unemployment remains at all-time lows and job openings in the lodging sector reach record highs. ","Our 2020 guidance for comparable hotel expenses, however, is for 2.5% to 3.5% growth per available room, primarily due to productivity gain, partially offsetting wage and benefit expense growth. As a result, we expect breakeven margins at 3.5% to 4% RevPAR growth in 2020. We will further detail the impact of wage and benefit expense growth on our 2020 EBITDA margins. But here are 3 key takeaways on this issue. First, we expect the rate of wage and benefit growth to peak in 2020. Second, we are continuing to work with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that will decrease our operating costs over the long term. ","And third, our exposure to world-class operators like Marriott and Hyatt leaves us relatively well positioned in a tight labor market, given their best-in-class retention and low turnover. Finally, we see prolonged macro uncertainty continuing to negatively impact expectations for U.S. nonresidential fixed investment, which has slowed materially from 6.4% in 2018 to 2.1% in 2019 and is now expected to grow by just 70 basis points in 2020. RevPAR is highly correlated with this metric, which is being impacted by trade and political uncertainty in an election year as well as by coronavirus. A sustained increase in nonresidential fixed investment would be a positive catalyst for the industry. But until it accelerates, our expectations for business transient travel remain muted, and our managers continue to focus on driving group and leisure business.","Moving on to our outlook for group business in 2020. We are pleased to begin the year with total group revenue being 4.2% ahead of the same time last year as we benefit from a favorable citywide convention calendar 2020, with San Diego, Miami, Orlando and Washington, D.C. all pacing ahead. We had approximately 77.5% of our group rooms on the books and are 150 basis points ahead of the same time last year. Thus far, we haven't experienced a material direct impact on our business from coronavirus as Chinese travelers contribute approximately 1.5% of our room revenues. That said, the situation continues to evolve and the prevailing uncertainty could put further downward pressure on business transient revenues. ","Additionally, supply is continuing to grow this year with a 2.3% increase expected across all scales on a net basis. As a result, we expect full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between flat to up 1%. We would note that the addition of the 1 Hotel South Beach added approximately 10 basis points to our newly defined 2020 full year comparable RevPAR growth guidance as we owned the hotel for nearly all of 2019. We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 165 basis points at the low end and down 125 basis points at the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.360 billion to $1.405 billion. While the midpoint of our -- of our 2020 total EBITDA guidance reflects a 10% year-over-year decline, approximately 60% of this decline is attributable to 2019 asset sales and declines in our noncomparable hotels due to renovation. Notably, our comparable hotel EBITDA is expected to decline by only 2.5% to 5% year-over-year.","Finally, with much of the decline in EBITDA mitigated by our stock repurchase program, we expect adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.65 to $1.71. Although margins are being impacted by accelerating wage and benefit cost growth this year, it is important to note that comparable EBITDA margins have improved by 80 basis points from 28.2% in 2016 to approximately 29% last year. We have held total expense growth steady at less than 1.5% for the last 3 years through a variety of external and internal initiatives. As mentioned earlier, wage and benefit cost growth is expected to peak this year, and we are working with our operators to adopt productivity-enhancing technology that we anticipate will decrease our operating costs over the long term.","Shifting to the Marriott transformational capital program. 2 of the 4 renovations we completed last year, Coronado Island Marriott and New York Marriott Downtown have already achieved meaningful RevPAR index gains and are well positioned to accelerate EBITDA growth and stabilization. The San Francisco Marriott Marquis and Santa Clara Marriott were completed in the second half of 2019. And while it's too early to measure improvement, we have high expectations for these 2 properties. We expect to invest between $180 million to $200 million in the program this year and to complete renovations at the San Antonio Rivercenter and Minneapolis Marriott City Center in the first and second quarter, respectively, and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in the fourth quarter. We will also complete the second phases of 3-phased renovations at both the New York Marriott Marquis and the Orlando World Center. By the end of 2020, this program will be 60% to 70% complete. We are pleased to be completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment, which minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerated EBITDA growth at stabilization.","In addition to the Marriott transformational capital program, we are also implementing multiple value-enhancing ROI projects across the portfolio. We categorize these as product development, operational projects and energy efficiency or sustainability projects. Product developments include developing a 165-key AC by Marriott on excess surface parking at The Westin Kierland in Scottsdale and adding 19 new two bedroom luxury villas at the Andaz Maui. Operational projects include adding meeting space at the Orlando World Center, converting underutilized lobby space into grab-and-go marketplaces, repositioning F&B office and adding keys at several properties. Additionally, we have multiple energy efficiency projects which are an important part of our industry-leading corporate responsibility program and include major systems overhauls, LED retrofit and solar panels, among others. ","We have historically achieved a high-teens average cash-on-cash return on these ROI projects, and we expect to grow this program going forward as an important piece of our capital allocation strategy. We differentiate ourselves through extraordinary execution, which achieves both a strong business case and prioritizes our sustainability goals for these projects. We have been recognized for our leadership and performance on sustainability, earning our seventh consecutive Green Star and Overall Global Sector Leader designation as well as a 5-star rating from GRESB this year. We have also been named to the Dow Jones World Sustainability Index for the first time and the North America Sustainability Index for the third time. Have won the NAREIT Lodging and Resorts Leader in Light Award four times in the past five years and most recently have been named to CDP's A list for leading our action against climate change.","To conclude with capital allocation, let me briefly review our execution over the last two years within the context of our long-term strategic vision for Host. Since 2018, we sold $3.3 billion of relatively lower quality and lower total RevPAR assets in our portfolio. We have invested $1.6 billion into iconic assets with 2019 total RevPAR with more than double that of the assets we sold. All 4 of our acquisitions are in excellent condition, with limited near-term capital needs. We achieved higher blended cap rates and EBITDA multiples on our acquisitions than on our dispositions and have thereby minimized dilution to earnings while significantly upgrading the quality of our portfolio. In addition, we have bought nearly $610 million of stock since mid-2019, amounting to nearly 5% of our weighted average share outstanding.","Finally, we have meaningfully strengthened our balance sheet by increasing our liquidity, extending our debt maturities and lowering our borrowing costs. Our asset recycling has reduced our CapEx intensity and improved the blended cap rate and long-term NAV profile of our portfolio. Our share repurchases have been accretive to FFO per diluted share, and the enhanced flexibility of our balance sheet has provided us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders. Today, our flexibility and willingness to use the appropriate value creation tool, whether it's stock buybacks, asset recycling, development or redevelopment at the opportune time to create meaningful value for our shareholders is what best differentiates Host from most of its lodging REIT peers. We have clearly demonstrated our willingness to use these value creation tools in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020.","Our long-term strategic vision is to own iconic and irreplaceable assets with high total RevPAR and limited near-term CapEx needs in key markets with strong and diverse demand generators. Market conditions over the last couple of years have enabled us to substantially reposition our portfolio at an accelerated pace. We believe that apart from a small number of assets that we would like to eventually monetize, our portfolio is where we want to be at this point in the economic cycle.","With regard to acquisitions, while the bar remains high, we will continue to evaluate assets that meet our strategic objectives, focusing on opportunities where we can leverage our competitive advantages such as the owner, broker and operator relationships, our ability to do large transactions and our reputation for providing speed and certainty of closing and the flexibility of operating, taxes and e-structures to sellers.","Overall, we are very well positioned with a favorable citywide convention calendar supporting operational performance this year and balance sheet flexibility providing us with greater optionality to create significant long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Brian.","Brian MacNamara","Thank you, Jim. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $355 million for the quarter and $1.534 billion for the year. As mentioned, we exceeded the top end of our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre guidance mainly due to strong revenue growth at our noncomparable hotels. Noncomparable total RevPAR grew 940 basis points for the quarter, primarily due to a post renovation lift at the San Francisco Marriott Marquis and strong redemption revenues at the Ritz-Carlton Naples.","For the fourth quarter, comparable total RevPAR grew 190 basis points primarily due to higher food and beverage and other revenues. While fourth quarter comparable RevPAR declined 10 basis points, it would have been flat if adjusted for the estimated 10 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. During the quarter, occupancy was unchanged, but ADR decreased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the anticipated decline in group business, driven by an unfavorable citywide convention calendar. Transient revenue grew 270 basis points due to the growth in leisure demand which more than offset the continued business transient weakness. Although business transient revenues for the fourth quarter were down 350 basis points, driven by a room night decline of 340 basis points, we would note that the fourth quarter was the least affected by declines in business travel due to the favorable holiday shift in December.","Looking at individual market performance for the fourth quarter. Our top 5 total RevPAR growth markets were: Orlando, Florida Gulf Coast, Atlanta, Denver and Phoenix, while New Orleans, Seattle, San Antonio, Northern Virginia and Hawaii trailed the portfolio. We think an important measure of our success in 2019 was our ability to deliver strong margin performance. Comparable EBITDA margins only declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 5 basis points for the full year, in line with the midpoint of our full year 2019 guidance. We believe this is an impressive performance as wage and benefit expense grew 370 basis points, driven by hourly wage rate increases, most notably in Southern California. While California was especially affected, the unemployment rate in most of our markets was below the national average of 3.7%, driving significant increases in wage and benefit expense across the portfolio.","Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended 2019 with $3.8 billion of total debt, $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash and $1.5 billion of available capacity under our credit facility revolver. During 2019, we achieved several major financial milestones. First, we refinanced $1 billion in term loans and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. Second, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating to BBB- from BB+ by S&P Global Ratings. Third, we refinanced $650 million of senior notes by issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry, with a coupon of 3 3\/8% and yield to maturity of 3.467%. These represent the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing and overall yield achieved in our history. Lastly, we have minimal debt maturing until 2023, with a balanced debt maturity schedule with no more than 7% of our debt as a percentage of enterprise value maturing in any given year.","In summary, we have executed over $3 billion of refinancing, which resulted in extending our total weighted average debt maturity to 5.4 years, reducing our weighted average interest rate to 3.8%, all while maintaining an appropriately balanced floating rate mix of 26%.","Finally, in 2019, we returned significant value to our shareholders with $482 million of stock repurchases as well as a total cash dividend of $0.85 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on our current stock price. We also just announced the first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share.","Turning to the forecast. Let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2020 guidance. As Jim mentioned, we expect our revenue performance to be driven by group and leisure transient business as a result of the citywide calendar, growing economy and strong employment numbers. While the U.S. economy continues an unprecedented growth cycle, we have been thoughtful about the impact of the global economy and our own election cycle, which we believe continues to constrain the level of business investment. Overall, we expect our performance to be stronger in the first half of 2020 due to the strength of our group booking pace and more difficult comps in the second half of the year. We will also continue to benefit from owner's priority and operating profit guarantees related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Our forecast includes a total of $16 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott, of which $9 million is included in comparable hotel EBITDA. Equally important, we expect as more properties are completed, we should begin to see an increase in each hotel's RevPAR index, which should bolster overall EBITDA for the properties.","For modeling purposes, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter will range from 26% to 28% of our annual forecast. Lastly, total shares currently outstanding are approximately $705 million, reflecting the additional shares repurchased in the first quarter.","In conclusion, we believe that Host Hotels & Resorts is the premier lodging REIT in the industry. We have a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio whose consistent performance is driven by strong in-house analytics and by working with the best operators in the business. With the only investment-grade balance sheet among lodging REITs, we are well positioned to continue to execute on our strategic vision to create long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, we will now be happy to take questions. [Operator Instructions].","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Anthony Powell, Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Question on your commentary about cost increases peaking in 2020. I'm just curious why would that be given unemployment is still pretty low? Is it because of your own initiatives to increase productivity and efficiency? Or do you think that underlying inflation may start to decline next year and beyond?","James Risoleo","I believe that the underlying reason that we're seeing 5% increases in wages and benefits in 2020 really has to do with wage parity in certain markets. It's not a -- the 5% number is not rolled out across the portfolio, but it's in markets like Orange County, California and Houston, Texas. And we think that as we roll wage increases out, bring our associates at the hotels to parity, that we'll see more normalized wage increases going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smedes Rose, Citi.","Smedes Rose","I just wanted to ask you on your decision to change the same-store guidance. So I know that it affected for the new -- more newly acquired properties, but does it also change the timing from when renovated properties will come back into the same-store pool?","James Risoleo","It does not, Smedes. We have -- we studied this. We've thought about it and talked about it quite a bit internally. And I'm sure you're aware there is really no consistency among the lodging REIT peer group with respect to how we handle renovation projects and when renovations are deemed to be noncomp and when they come back into the comp pool. So we're still thinking about that. We obviously had a number of projects this year. There is a noncomp, and we frankly didn't think it was appropriate to make any changes with respect to the renovation side of the definition at this point in time. One thing that is consistent though that we have before not done is to report acquisitions on a pro forma basis. And everybody in the world of lodging REIT does report acquisitions on a pro forma basis, and that's why we made the change with respect to the 1 Hotel South Beach, and we will handle that in that way going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Bill Crow, Raymond James. ","William Crow","I'm actually going to ask 1.5 questions. Half a question is really focused on a follow-up from Anthony on labor costs. Just wondering how that's manifesting itself in your operations? In other words, are you seeing turnover dramatically higher? And is it fair to go back to the brands and ask for some flexibility in brand standards when it comes to labor, given the stress that everybody is under?","James Risoleo","Bill, we're not seeing inordinate amount of turnover. In fact, we benefit from the labor practices of two world-class operators who run most of our hotels, Marriott and Hyatt. They had very good retention rates. They're very attractive organizations for people to work at. So it really is solely as a result of wage parity in certain markets. That's why we're seeing the large increases this year.","William Crow","All right. And the real question is more strategic in nature. And thinking about it from a capital allocation perspective and even the share repurchase perspective, how would you do things differently if we're -- if you thought we were kind of trapped in the slow growth environment for several years?","James Risoleo","Well, Bill, you asked one question that keeps us up at night. Again, it's something that we think about from a -- not only from a capital allocation perspective, but also from an operation perspective. We have lived through some pretty meaningful down cycles. I won't go back beyond 9\/11. But of course, we learnt a lot, given what happened to our industry in the post 9\/11 world and then lived it again in 2008, 2009. So I think if we were to find ourselves in this type of tepid RevPAR growth environment or flat to negative RevPAR growth environment with resulting EBITDA declines, we would be having meaningful conversations with our operators about lasting brand standards. And that can mean everything from taking a look at restaurant offerings and hours of operation to in-room guest amenities, to guest amenities in concierge lounges and club lounges. Not that we're not doing this today. We would really push beyond those lines labor scheduling and technology. ","So I think that's one of the first things that we would do if we found ourselves near to this environment for an extended period of time. On the capital allocation front, our balance sheet has never been in better shape. We -- as we sit here today, we have $1.6 billion of unrestricted cash. And if we were to go 3x leverage today, we could buy $2.5 billion plus of assets -- $2.5 billion to $3 billion plus of assets. As we think about the macro environment that we operate in today, we are being measured in our capital allocation decisions. We like the optionality that our balance sheet gives us today. If we're in a slow growth environment, couple of things we would consider doing might include accelerating investment in our portfolio going forward. We have the ability to do that, so that our assets are very well positioned when we see a reacceleration of RevPAR. We might consider if our stock price comes under pressure, enhancing the buyback program. ","And lastly, I think that if we are in this environment for an extended period of time, you're likely to see some distress in the hotel world. We're seeing it already in New York. There's been a number of articles written regarding the level of default in New York City going up. And we like the position we're in with the balance sheet that we have, the optionality and flexibility to pivot one way or the other in good times or in tough times.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Hightower, Evercore.","Richard Hightower","So like Bill, I'm going to ask 1 question with two totally unrelated parts. So here it goes. So really quickly the first part, just talk about maybe the thought process behind a relatively narrow range of comp RevPAR guidance, 100 basis points from top to bottom? And then -- so that's the first one. And then quickly, just more on the topic of cost controls. Are you seeing -- when we think about sort of more catastrophic weather events around the country, around the world, are you seeing a tightening in insurance market, specifically? And how do you sort of think about that with respect to your Florida exposure and maybe some other at-risk areas?","James Risoleo","The tight range, Rich, was really based on our view of the group visibility that we have today with 4.2% total group revenue pace and 77.5% of our group on the books. I would add that, I didn't address this in my comments, our group business is weighted more heavily towards the first half of the year than the second half of the year, which gives us comfort and visibility. And we continue to see strong leisure business -- transient leisure business. We're not seeing anything, frankly, on the business transient side. So we were very comfortable with the range we gave, primarily based on group visibility. And your second question was related to cost controls -- was it related to insured cost?","Richard Hightower","Yes. Just related to insurance cost, specifically, as we think about your Florida, your California exposure and is -- I guess, is Host in a position where you're big enough to where you can self-insure to some extent and so you see maybe a little less inflation in that particular cost category?","James Risoleo","No, we don't self-insure. We are in a unique position given the platform that we have, the scale that we have across a very diversified set of market. Our insurance cost will be going up this year. The insurance renewals occur midyear. So we would expect to see insurance cost increase in July, going forward lapping. Insurance cost is about 10% of our total cost basis. So it's not that meaningful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario, Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Just on your development and redevelopment comments that you made in the prepared remarks, is there room to do more here? And then how do you think about returns on these types of projects and then the risk associated with doing more redevelopment and development projects at this point in the cycle?","James Risoleo","Well, returns on development and redevelopment projects will at stabilization be double-digit cash-on-cash. It's going to range from property to property. Our returns on the Andaz Maui villas given the cost associated with developing and building Hawaii is likely to be on the lower end of that range, whereas we're in the process of moving forward with a large part at the Orlando World Center Marriott, where we expect very meaningful cash-on-cash returns as a result of putting that amenity in place and what that will allow us to do is shoulder a weakened transient business. ","So the attractive returns we think that in addition to buying back our stock, which we view as incredibly inexpensive today, that investing in our portfolio is a very good place to be allocating capital. It's easier to underwrite these returns given our knowledge of the assets and the in-house expertise that we have. We have a best-in-class team, both on the asset management side and on our design construction side with years and years of experience of doing these types of projects. We are not going to say we never had a surprise, but we had very few surprises when it comes to construction budgets and timing. And we're very comfortable with our underwriting. I would just point out on the Marriott transformational capital program, where we're slightly underbudget in the aggregate for all the deals that we have undertaken today, and those are major products.","Michael Bellisario","Got it. And just fair to assume though that maybe versus 12 months ago, your appetite for doing more redevelopment and development is higher? Is that fair?","James Risoleo","I wouldn't say that -- I wouldn't really say it any differently. I mean, again, we have -- I have talked about it before. I mean we have the optionality given our balance sheet to allocate capital in a lot of different areas, whether it's within our portfolio, whether it's making acquisitions or buying back our shares.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gregory Miller, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Gregory Miller","Jim and Brian, I'm on for Patrick Scholes. Just a quick question. How sustainable do you see the dividend today given the trajectory of RevPAR margins this year and next as you mentioned earlier about the balance sheet being in -- never being in better shape?","James Risoleo","We feel that this dividend based on our forecast for this year and how we're looking out to 2021 is sustainable at its current level. If we were to take into consideration our discretionary CapEx, not our maintenance CapEx, but our discretionary CapEx, our AFFO payout ratio is approximately 70%.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Malkin, Capital One Securities.","Neil Malkin","I'm just going to ask one question with zero follow-ups. So I guess, just relating to the political landscape in California, you've seen the Oracle canceling the event in San Francisco, moving to Vegas, citing homelessness, drug, et cetera. You have split roll coming potentially at the end of this year. Just, I guess, what are you guys doing to combat these issues that seem to be garnering more and more headlines? Are you guys doing things with other peers, lobbies, et cetera? I'm just interested to know how you think about that area and your plans to navigate that going forward.","James Risoleo","Well, as I'm sure you will -- Neil will accept, myself and others at Host are very involved in various trade associations. I'm an officer of NAREIT, I'm an officer of AHLA. Struan is involved with AHLA. Nate is involved with AHLA. We are keenly focused on these issues not only at Host, but in concert with our constituent groups at those respective organizations. So when we think about split roll, it's something that we talk about internally, that we talk about at AHLA and NAREIT. And I would tell you that there is a unanimous point of view about how that will be approached going forward from a lobbying perspective and otherwise.","Neil Malkin","Okay. I guess, so in terms of like maybe San Francisco, does -- I mean do you think there's more to come, in terms of people leaving or anything like that would be helpful as well?","James Risoleo","We don't see anything more on the horizon there. Rich, actually I want to clarify something I said about insurance. I put an extra 0 behind the expense growth, it's 1% of expenses, it's not 10% of expenses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shaun Kelley, Bank of America.","Shaun Kelley","Jim, just wanted to clarify the -- maybe -- I think it was in the remarks to an earlier question, but just to make sure I caught it correctly. At least one of the big hotel operator -- brand operators did mention a little bit of positive activity on the sort of the demand or transient side over the last few weeks. Curious if you can corroborate anything you've seen in your hotels or anything that stands out maybe on the transient or the corporate side? And then -- so that would be the positive. And then on the cautious side, you gave the Chinese exposure on the coronavirus and that's really helpful. But we have seen some evidence of some group cancellations. Anything that's impacted Host Hotels or sort of just discussion points in the industry on group cancellations would be helpful.","James Risoleo","Yes, sure. On the business transient side, Shaun, we just don't see pickup. In business transient, our long history is really driven by nonresidential fixed investment. And the uncertain macro environment that we're living in today is driving nonresidential fixed investment down to a forecast of 70 basis points for 2020, off of a high -- not high, off of a 6.4% number in 2018. So I think businesses are being very cautious. Small businesses, in particular, are being cautious about spending money in this environment. So we have more clarity on the election and more clarity on coronavirus. I do think we still need clarity on trade policies. I know we've implemented a Phase 1 deal with China. I think there's a Phase 2 deal with China that needs to happen. And there's uncertainty with respect to our trading partners in Europe today. So we're not seeing it on business trend. ","I wish I could tell you that we were, but we're just not. We are comfortable with the cadence in our guidance based on our group visibility, which is weighted towards the first half of the year. And we expect to see further pickup in leisure transient going forward. So coronavirus, we've seen a total impact top line revenues of about $1.5 million. We -- this year that there's a 1 group -- Facebook canceled a meeting in San Francisco. It was about 14,000 room nights scheduled for the first week of March. We really don't know why they canceled that meeting. There's some speculation that it was as a result of coronavirus, but definitively, I can't say it was for that reason or something else. And we're not sure of anything else at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Aryeh Klein, BMO Capital Markets.","Aryeh Klein","So loyalty redemptions have been very healthy. How sustainable do you believe those are, with some of that pent-up demand post the merger and just customers essentially cashing in? And maybe if you can talk to the visibility you have there going forward?","James Risoleo","Our loyalty redemptions have been healthy. As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we saw a meaningful pickup at three of our hotels, in particular, the Ritz-Carlton Naples, The Rich-Carlton Marina del Rey and The Phoenician as well. The changes that were made to the pricing structure, the tiered pricing structure and the occupancy levels to allow the owners to benefit in a greater way than have been structured under the old bed program we think are very sustainable going forward. We saw a meaningful pickup relative to the numbers that Marriott provided us when they were making changes to Bonvoy and more than double that the business cases they provided to us. And we expect to see additional pickups this year. The other thing that happened in the latter part of 2019 was a rolled out -- Bonvoy rolled out a peak\/offpeak tier structure that we also think will provide benefits to the owners going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Woronka, Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Jim, I was hoping to get your opinion on -- as we see the big brand companies kind of introduce more and more brands and soft brands and semi-soft brands, what's your position on whether those are truly competitive with some of your, I would say, smaller kind of non-big group box properties? And at what point do you think owners -- is it something that the owners have to address with the brand companies?","James Risoleo","My personal point of view on supply is supplying that. I don't care what kind of supply it is. It's going to nip around the edges, we call it ankle biters. When we have big room houses and you've got a select-service hotel that's built in your submarket, it clearly is going to have some impact on you. The good news about our portfolio is that it's well diversified. We don't have any more than 10% of our EBITDA coming out of any one market. And it's something that we talk about with the brand all the time. I mean we are in a constant dialogue with them regarding impact of new development projects. It's just something that Host and all other owners are talking about and talking to the brands about today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Wes Golladay, RBC Capital Markets.","Wesley Golladay","Just another question on business transient trends, are you seeing much variance by region?","James Risoleo","Not really, Wes. I'd say it's fairly flat across the portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Sullivan, BTIG.","James Sullivan","Quick question on the strength of the balance sheet as well as the appetite to buy back more shares. I think in the prepared comments, Jim, you mentioned that in terms of optionality, if shares come under pressure, you could obviously buy back more stock. And I wonder if you could help us understand what kind of flexibility you have and -- whatever metric you want to give, debt-to-EBITDA, is obviously very helpful. In terms of where you think you could go in that ratio, in terms of buying back shares before you'd be, well, maybe hesitate to go any further. How much more debt can you put on the balance sheet to buy back shares before the investment-grade rating becomes an issue?","James Risoleo","Well, I think this is a very hypothetical question, Jim. But in theory, and I'm not suggesting for a moment that we would do this, we could borrow up to $2 billion and that would take us to 3x leverage. And that is not anything that we're contemplating at this stage of the cycle given the macro uncertainty that exists in the world today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anthony Powell, Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Just a question on the mix of customers. I think, historically, we thought that Host had about 2\/3 business with group and corporate transient combined. It seems like transient -- I mean corporate side has been weak for a number of years. What's the updated customer mix between group, corporate transient and leisure transient in your portfolio?","James Risoleo","Corporate transient is about 59%, Anthony. And of that 59%, roughly 60% business and 40% leisure, contracts about 5% and groups right around 36% to 37%.","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A portion. I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Risoleo.","James Risoleo","Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2020 outlook with you. Look forward to seeing you at NAREIT and talking with you in a few months to discuss our first quarter results as well as providing you with more insight into how 2020 is progressing.

Michael Bluhm our Chief Financial Officer will then provide detailed commentary on our third quarter performance, our capital position and our guidance for 2019.","Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.","Jim Risoleo","Thank you, Tejal, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. We remain focused on creating value for our shareholders on multiple fronts in the third quarter, which exceeded consensus expectations for adjusted EBITDAre and adjusted FFO per diluted share. We grew comparable hotel Total RevPAR by 120 basis points in the third quarter and delivered our strongest comparable Total RevPAR and RevPAR performance year-to-date.","We continued to successfully execute our capital allocation strategy by completing $565 million of asset sales and repurchasing $200 million of stock during the third quarter and have sold an additional $297 million of assets subsequent to quarter end. We strengthened our balance sheet by refinancing $650 million of Series Z and B bonds, with the first green bond issuance in the lodging industry and achieved the lowest effective bond pricing in the company\u2019s history.","In addition, we increased the capacity of our revolving credit in term loan facility by $500 million to $2.5 billion. And finally, we made significant progress on our pipeline of ROI projects, which we expect will unlock embedded value at several of our iconic and irreplaceable assets.","I will now discuss our comparable revenue performance, revised 2019 operational outlook, capital allocation and our pipeline of ROI projects. Michael will detail our third quarter comparable EBITDA margin performance, recap our balance sheet improvements and provide the specifics on our updated 2019 guidance.","Beginning with our third quarter revenue performance, we drove comparable total RevPAR 120 basis points higher year-over-year through relatively strong growth in food and beverage as well as other revenues. While our comparable RevPAR declined by 20 basis points, it solidly outperformed STR\u2019s 80 basis point decline for luxury and upper upscale in the top 22 Host markets. Notably, our comparable RevPAR was impacted by an estimated 50 basis points of renovation disruption related to the Marriott transformational capital program. Adjusting for which, comparable RevPAR grew by 30 basis points year-over-year.","Moreover, the tropical storms and hurricanes experienced during the quarter displaced comparable room revenue by approximately $1.2 million which impacted comparable RevPAR by another 20 basis points. Third quarter hotel occupancy was flat year-over-year, while ADR decreased by 20 basis points, primarily due to a decline in the association group business driven by a weak citywide calendar in markets such as Boston, Seattle and San Diego.","We worked closely with our managers to partially mitigate this anticipated decline by growing our corporate group business by 8.3%. Additionally, strong contribution from our corporate group helped banquet and audio-visual revenues, which grew 3.8%. Third quarter transient revenue grew 70 basis points, driven by 2.8% growth in room nights due to leisure demand, bolstered by significant loyalty program redemptions.","Loyalty program redemption revenues grew 7% driven by growth in both room nights and average rate. Our properties benefited from a solid increase in redemptions in the Florida Gulf Coast, Los Angeles and Orange County markets. We continue to realize improvements quarter-after-quarter from Bonvoy, which now has 137 million members and continues to grow rapidly.","Growth in leisure more than offset the continued weakness in business transient, which reflects greater business cautiousness. The continued uncertainty of a long-term U.S. China trade deal, domestic political turbulence and decelerating global economic conditions are impacting business investment. Full year expectations for U.S. non-residential fixed investment have declined by 140 basis points since the beginning of the year and currently stand at 2.7%, which would represent the slowest pace of business investment growth since 2016.","As discussed last quarter, we anticipated much of the revenue-led softness that the lodging industry experienced in the third quarter. As our expectations for business transient revenues have moderated further due to continuing macro uncertainties, we have revised our outlook for full year comparable constant dollar RevPAR growth to range between down 25 basis points to down 1%.","We therefore expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 20 basis points at the low end and up 10 basis points on the high end of our guidance. These assumptions result in full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.505 billion to $1.530 billion and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $1.75 to $1.78.","At the midpoint, our new adjusted FFO per diluted share is $0.01 higher than our prior forecast, primarily due to our share repurchases. Keep in mind that our revised guidance now includes a reduction of $2 million of forecasted EBITDA for the sale of Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego and a reduction of approximately $2.5 million for the impact of the tropical storms and hurricanes in the third quarter. Michael will provide further detail on our EBITDA guidance in his remarks.","Shifting to total group revenue pace, as I had discussed last quarter, our full year 2009 total group revenue pace is essentially flat, coming off a record year for group in 2018. Our fourth quarter total group revenue pace is up 1.1% and we have approximately 99% of our group business booked for 2019. 2020 is shaping up to be a better year for group business, with total group revenue pace nearly 4% ahead of the same time last year and with more than 65% of our rooms on the books. While we expect to see continued pressure on business transient, if the current macro uncertainty prevails, having a healthy total group revenue pace and group business on the books provides us with a solid base heading into next year.","Considering the current macro environment, our managers continue to focus on group revenue pace. We hold monthly group pace discussions with both property management teams and senior sales leadership at the corporate level. We also provide feedback on implementing group campaigns and promotions to drive additional group demand and seller incentives to increase closure.","We believe these incentives have helped ensure a focus on additional group pickup. Moreover, the citywide convention calendar is more favorable for our portfolio in 2020 relative to this year. Markets with better citywide demand in 2020 include Boston, Washington DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and San Diego.","Additionally, Miami is hosting Super Bowl 54 and is expected to outperform the industry. We expect notable year-over-year declines in citywide in Atlanta, which hosted the Super Bowl this year, San Francisco and Philadelphia.","As to capital allocation, we closed on the previously announced sale of eight assets for a total of $565 million during the third quarter and sold two additional assets, the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego for a total of $297 million subsequent to quarter end.","In aggregate, we have sold approximately $1.3 billion of low RevPAR capital-intensive assets this year. After taking into consideration the estimated capital we would have spent on these assets, the combined EBITDA multiple and cap rate on trailing 12-month results would be 14.1 times and 6.3% respectively.","We continue to take advantage of the current market conditions and execute on our strategy to refine our portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in key markets with strong demand generators and high revenue generation, while opportunistically by divesting a lower RevPAR, higher capital expenditure assets.","On the share repurchase front, we bought back $200 million of stock at an average price of $16.51 during the third quarter. Our buybacks through the third quarter totaled $400 million or 23 million shares on a year-to-date basis at an average price of $17.36. We have bought back an additional $14 million of stock subsequent to quarter end and have approximately $586 million of capacity remaining.","We have been actively investing in value enhancing ROI projects across our portfolio. We are constructing a 165 key premium select service AC by Marriott Hotel on excess surface parking at the Westin Kierland in Phoenix. We expect to spend a total of approximately $36 million on this project, which remains on budget and on schedule to complete construction by late May 2020 and to open around mid year.","We have also begun site development on 19 villas at Andaz Maui, which will be added to the 11 villas owned or rented within our hotel program. The existing villas in the rental program achieved a RevPAR of approximately $1,700 and exhibit strong demand throughout the year. We expect to invest a total of approximately $52 million and to complete construction by March 2021.","This expansion was not a part of our underwriting when we acquired the asset last year and we are pleased to be capitalizing on another opportunity to create value for our shareholders. Lastly, we have continued to focus on enhancing the value and profitability of our portfolio through utility and water saving ROI projects, an important part of our award-winning and industry-leading corporate responsibility program. Year-to-date, we have underwritten and approved over $19 million to be invested in energy and water savings sustainability projects, and over the four-year period ending 2018, we completed over 650 projects with sustainability attributes totaling $210 million. We recently published our second corporate responsibility report available on our website where you can see additional information on this important program.","In aggregate, we expect to invest $107 million in these value creation projects combined and to generate stabilized cash-on-cash returns in the range of 11% to 13%. Now, to an update on the 1 Hotel South Beach, which we acquired earlier this year. The hotel is performing better than our underwriting on EBITDA and the beach club ROI project is well underway with completion anticipated by year end. We expect to spend approximately $7 million and achieve a low teens stabilized yield on cost.","Finally, we have made significant progress on the Marriott transformational capital program, with work underway or expected to be completed on 13 of the 17 properties by year end. As we have previously disclosed, three of four Marriott transformational capital projects, Coronado Island Marriott, New York Marriott Downtown and the San Francisco Marriott Marquis are now complete with the final project the Santa Clara Marriott completing in another week or so.","An additional nine projects are underway. Importantly, we are close to completing nearly 40% of the total estimated spend by year end and are currently under budget for the program. The timing of the Marriott transformational capital program is highly beneficial to our shareholders. Completing these renovations in a low RevPAR growth environment minimizes the impact of the disruption and leaves us well positioned to achieve meaningful RevPAR index gains and accelerate EBITDA growth at stabilization and when RevPAR growth improves.","Additionally, we are benefiting from operating profit guarantees that support EBITDA in a low RevPAR growth environment as we negotiated for protection for the disruption associated with the renovation spend. Moreover, we have negotiated increased priority returns on our investment, which will reduce incentive management fees and further boost our long-term EBITDA growth.","Overall, we are well positioned in the currently challenging operating environment. Heading into next year, both the citywide convention calendar and the holiday calendar shift in our favor. Importantly, with leverage at 1.7 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end, our investment grade balance sheet is in its best shape ever and we remain laser-focused on driving near and long-term value creation for our shareholders.","With that, I will turn the call over to Michael.","Michael Bluhm","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We delivered adjusted EBITDAre of $312 million and adjusted FFO per diluted share of $0.35 this quarter. Adjusted EBITDAre was approximately $12 million higher than we expected, primarily due to a shift in the timing of approximately $9.5 million of corporate and other expenses from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. These were expenses related to the recent IT upgrade investments, consultancy fees as well as the office move, which is now taking place in the fourth quarter.","Note that certain costs related to our office move will be reclassified as an impairment in the fourth quarter and therefore added back to EBITDA. Finally, interest income in the third quarter exceeded our expectations by approximately $2 million. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins in the third quarter declined by 85 basis points. To put that in context, the 20 basis point decline in comparable RevPAR will typically result in a greater than 100 basis point decline in comparable EBITDA margins, assuming normal expense growth.","Moreover, the year-over-year comparable EBITDA margin comparison was negatively impacted by 31 basis points from a one-time benefit received from the sale of Marriott centralized purchasing company in the third quarter of 2018. Finally, the receipt of approximately $2 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott benefited comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 20 basis points.","Overall, expense growth is primarily driven by increased wage and benefit expense, which as anticipated from faster in the third quarter than in the first and the second quarters. We collaborate closely with our managers on a variety of internal initiatives to drive ancillary revenue growth, improved productivity and increased operating costs.","For example, food costs improved by 40 basis points and controllable expense growth was held at sub-inflation levels. Such initiatives serve to partially offset the increases in wages and benefits this quarter, which continue to accelerate in this low unemployment environment. We estimate that 60% of our margin outperformance this quarter was driven by internal initiatives.","Whereas approximately 40% of our margin outperformance is driven by benefits related to the Marriott Starwood integration. These include reduced fees related to loyalty and rewards program and lower group and transient travel agent commissions as Marriott continues to use its increased scale to improve programs and combine systems to lower charge-out rates to its owners.","While Jim detailed our comparable RevPAR performance by segment, let me provide additional color on comparable RevPAR and market basis. Our best performing domestic markets this quarter was in New Orleans, Miami, the Florida Gulf Coast, Maui and Philadelphia. We achieved RevPAR increases ranging from 4% to 17.6%. Our worst performing market this quarter was Jacksonville, where Amelia Island was evacuated and there was forced hotel closure during hurricane Dorian as well as New York, Orlando, Seattle and San Francisco. Overall, as Jim mentioned, our third quarter comparable RevPAR has outperformed STR\u2019s luxury and upper upscale segments in the top 22 Host markets by 60 basis points.","Looking at 2020, we feel optimistic about the group business in several of our key markets. Beginning with Miami, we expect special events such as the Super Bowl and the return of the Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront Park helped create compression in the first half of the year. In Phoenix, we have a strong 2020 group booking pace and the Phoenician continues to outperform the market and its competitive set through strong leisure occupancy and ADR growth.","Washington DC also had a stronger citywide calendar next year with one additional event and room nights up by double digits. But it is an election year which may impact days and session and overall demand.","The Florida Gulf Coast has a strong 2020 group pace, while the supply of new direct competitors is not a major factor. The Don CeSar and the Ritz Carlton, Naples are therefore likely to continue to outperform the market next year. While Los Angeles will still feel the impact of supply absorption, citywides are expected to be up next year and our properties are attracting a healthy group pace.","In Denver, we also have a solid group pace and expect the supply to accelerate. And finally, Boston is also gearing up for better citywide next year.","As Jim mentioned, we\u2019re pleased to be going into 2020 with a solid base of group business on the books, particularly as we expect to see continued pressure on business transient as the current macro uncertainty prevails.","Moving on to the balance sheet, we achieved several milestones in the third quarter and in October. To begin with, we achieved an upgrade of our corporate credit rating BBB minus from BB plus by S&P Global ratings. We refinanced our Series D and B bonds maturing in October 2021 and March 2022 respectively. By issuing the first green bond in the lodging industry with a coupon of [indiscernible], which is the lowest effective 10-year bond pricing in the company\u2019s history.","And as Jim mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call, we refinanced our two term loans totaling $1 billion and expanded our revolving credit facility by $500 million to $1.5 billion. In aggregate, we completed over $3 billion of bank financing and have capitalized on the low borrowing cost environment. We have extended our weighted average debt maturity from 3.7 years to 5.7 years and reduced our weighted average interest rate from 4.3% to 3.9%, with an appropriately balanced floating to fixed ratio of 26%. In addition, we have eliminated debt maturities until 2023, while maintaining a balanced pro forma debt maturity schedule with no more than approximately 7% of our debt as a percent of enterprise value maturing in any given year.","We ended the third quarter with $4.4 billion of total debt and $2 billion of cash. But subsequent to quarter end, we repaid our Series D and B bonds and completed $297 million of asset sales. As a result, our total debt is currently approximately $3.8 billion and our adjusted cash balance is approximately $1.6 billion, providing us with approximately $3 billion of liquidity, including the availability under our revolver.","At quarter end, our leverage ratio was approximately 1.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility and it\u2019s slightly lower pro forma for the asset sales completed subsequent to quarter end. In addition to the $400 million of buybacks completed year-to-date, we recently paid a regular third quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 5% on the current stock price.","Turning to guidance, let me take a few minutes to detail the assumptions underlying our 2019 guidance. To begin with, we continue to expect to receive a total of $23 million of operating profit guarantees from Marriott for both comp and non-comp transformational capital programs, with approximately $3 million in total to be received in the fourth quarter.","As Jim mentioned, we revised our comparable RevPAR guidance to a range of down 25 basis points to down 1%, indicating that we expect year-over-year RevPAR performance in the fourth quarter to be flat at the midpoint of our range. We expect the fourth quarter benefit from the lowest amount of renovation disruption in 2019 as well as a better December holiday calendar relative to 2018.","We expect comparable EBITDA margins to be down 20 basis points at the low end and up 10 basis points at the high end of our guidance, which essentially implies unchanged margins despite flexible RevPAR expectations. These assumptions result in a full year forecasted adjusted EBITDAre of $1.505 billion to $1.530 billion and adjusted FFO per share of $1.75 to $1.78.","We are revising our 2019 adjusted EBITDAre range to a new midpoint of approximately $1.518 billion, downward adjustment of $2 million from our previous guidance. The sales of the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and Sheraton San Diego, the tropical storms and hurricanes in the third quarter and the change in comparable RevPAR guidance range reduced adjusted EBITDAre by approximately $7 million at the midpoint. These were offset by approximately $5 million of lower corporate and other expenses in the fourth quarter as certain costs related to our office move will be reclassified as an impairment and therefore added back to EBITDA.","With regards to a run rate 2019 EBITDA, the net impact of our 2019 dispositions and acquisitions will lower our run rate by approximately $58 million, which includes an approximately $30 million impact from the sale of the Hyatt Regency Cambridge and the Sheraton San Diego, as well as the previously disclosed $27 million impact related to net asset sales completed in the first three quarters of the year.","To conclude, we are pleased to have delivered another quarter of successful capital allocation and to have further strengthened our balance sheet. We anticipate a much of the softness experienced by the lodging industry in the third quarter and are tightening our assumptions and guidance to reflect the incremental impact of continued macro uncertainty in the fourth quarter. We are well positioned for 2020 with a total group revenue pace of nearly 4% higher than the same time last year and with more than 65% of our rooms on the books.","With that, we\u2019ll now be happy to take questions. To ensure that we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from Anthony Powell from Barclays.","Q - Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Jim Risoleo","Good morning, Anthony.","Michael Bluhm","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Powell","Good morning. You mentioned that the Marriott capital plan is under budget and it seems to be going a bit faster than you originally guided to. Could you just update us on the total spend the cadence of the spend over the next couple of years and will there be less renovation disruption in 2021 relative to this year?","Michael Bluhm","Yes. So this is definitely going to be our biggest year of disruption, Anthony. For 2019, the CapEx spending curve associated with projects about $225 million. For 2020, it\u2019s about $200 million, and in 2021 it\u2019s $175 million. And when you sort of think about right sort of the operating profit guarantees and sort of a measurement of disruption in 2019 where we talked about it, we\u2019ve got $23 million of operating profit guarantee that we have or will receive. In 2020, that number drops down to $16 million and then closes up to $19 million in 2021.","Anthony Powell","Got it, thanks. And you also mentioned that you\u2019re seeing more redemptions from Bonvoy. What\u2019s the redemption mix in your portfolio and to those redemption of revenues continue to increase in future years?","Michael Bluhm","Yes, look. I mean, I think you saw Marriott International talk about Bonvoy redemptions up 20% or something like that last quarter. I will tell you that we saw in our loyalty program of 7.1%, it was certainly a big strong contributor to the business, and particularly in a market where we really needed the transient to lean in, given the weak group calendar.","Michael Bluhm","The dollar impact was year-over-year was about $3 million top line.","Anthony Powell","All right, great. That\u2019s it from me, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Michael Bellisario with Baird.","Michael Bellisario","Good morning everyone.","Michael Bluhm","Good morning Mike.","Jim Risoleo","Good morning.","Michael Bellisario","How are you guys, if at all changing your revenue management strategies, heading into next year? And then how do the group pace numbers that you provided, how does that compare to same time last year?","Jim Risoleo","I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re making any material change to our revenue management strategies Mike. We\u2019ve said it\u2019s really a dynamic pricing model. And it\u2019s something we think about on a weekly basis quite frankly. I did mention in my comments that we\u2019re working very closely with our managers across our hotel portfolio both at the property level and at corporate to stay more keenly focused at this point in time on group, given the fact that we are still seeing some weakness in business, transient, travel. So nothing really different from the way we manage it before. Just a difference in focus, which changes from time to time.","Additionally, you asked the question of what is our group bookings going into 2020 this year relative to last year. Last year at this time we had about 62% of our business on the books, this year we are at 65%.","Michael Bluhm","Rich just to add to Jim\u2019s comment, typically we would see sort of 60% to 65% towards the high end and make note that\u2019s coming off of the record group year with five million group rooms nights.","Jim Risoleo","Yes. One other thing I would add is Marriott is rolling out the enhanced reservation system. And we\u2019re working closely with them to really maximize revenue on a hotel-by-hotel basis by making certain that different room types, different room locations, different room categories are priced appropriately. It\u2019s just one more lever that can be pulled to enhance revenue at each property.","Michael Bellisario","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Bill Crow with Raymond James.","Bill Crow","Good morning everybody. Jim we\u2019ve heard a lot of positive comments from not only your team, but others on the group pace for next year in certain markets. I think that\u2019s all fine and good. But the problem this year has not really been group, it\u2019s been leisure, it\u2019s been business transient, it\u2019s been inbound international, it\u2019s been supply. I guess I\u2019m just trying to get how much confidence you have based solely on this uptick that you think you\u2019re going to see in a number of markets?","Jim Risoleo","Bill, we were faced with a very weak citywide calendar in 2019. And our under performance in Q3 was directly related to weakness in association group, which we anticipated. I think the number was down 4.3% for us in the quarter. So it did have a meaningful impact, 4.3% in room nights for us in the quarter on the group side of it.","You raised the issue of new supply. As we think about the business, obviously we think about our segments starting with through association, corporate group, business transient, leisure transient contract and then we always have supply to deal with as well. So you are correct in saying that supply has been a headwind, particularly in the top 25 markets where we are strongly represented in 22 of those 25 markets. I take great encouragement that we were able to handle the outperform STR in the third quarter in the top 22 market segments as related to upper upscale and luxury.","We actually picked up about 30 basis points in yield index in the quarter. So we\u2019re really focused on gaining market share and maximizing revenues through each category. When group isn\u2019t there, then we\u2019ll turn \u2013 when association group isn\u2019t there, we will turn to corporate group. When business transient isn\u2019t there, we will turn to leisure. Supply is going to tick along in 2020. But from our perspective, we see 2020 as the peak year for supply.","Bill Crow","That\u2019s helpful. If I could just follow-up with one other question, when you have these massive renovations that you\u2019re undertaking now completing, what has been your experience with TripAdvisor scores or other review scores? How hurt do they get and what do you do to kind of change the momentum once you reopen?","Jim Risoleo","Yes, of course, hotels in, let\u2019s say, not optimal condition, your TripAdvisor scores in ratings are going to be impacted. I think the example that I can point to that is from my perspective, I think, the poster child of what renovations can do for a property is the Phoenician. Prior to our renovation, the hotel was very tired. It hadn\u2019t had any investment for an extended period of time. ","And in regards to the point where meeting planners just weren\u2019t even comfortable, taking groups to the property. Even though it\u2019s a great physical asset, great volumes over 600 rooms, great indoor meeting space, great outdoor meeting space, it had a spa which was underwhelming, it had a golf course which was under whelming. And by renovating that asset in a manner that we did, we\u2019ve seen it turnaround and just outperform in an incredible way. And next year, the group pace of that property is up well and we\u2019re seeing very strong leisure bookings also.","So when a hotel is completely renovated, the TripAdvisor ratings and scores get wiped out and when it comes back online, it\u2019s re-rated at a higher level.","Bill Crow","Okay, thanks. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Rich Hightower with Evercore.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good morning guys.","Jim Risoleo","Hi Rich.","Rich Hightower","So just a really quick question on 4Q guidance. If I\u2019m doing the arithmetic correctly, it seems like the implied range there from top to bottom is something along the lines of negative 1.5% to positive 1.5%. So correct me if I\u2019m wrong there, but if I\u2019m not wrong, what would drive the low end versus the high end kind of given the number of days left in the year? And then I\u2019ve got one follow-up after that.","Michael Bluhm","Yes, let\u2019s just correct the math a little bit. On the high end, it is 1%. On the low end, it\u2019s 1.6%. At the midpoint, it\u2019s flat.","Rich Hightower","Okay. So any qualitative factors kind of driving that range at least?","Michael Bluhm","Yes, look, I think, as Jim pointed out, I think the fourth quarter is setting up to be a nice setup, right? We\u2019re going into with 1.1% up under group pace. December is in particular with Hanukkah moving to the back half of the month, really creates a nice clean December. So I think we feel like \u2013 you don\u2019t necessarily need to believe a lot to get to that level, but nonetheless anyway.","Jim Risoleo","Yes, a couple of other \u2013 I will elaborate on that a bit, Rich. I referenced in my comments that we have 99% of our total group revenue pace on the books already, and that we saw a 1.1% pickup in total group revenue pace for Q4. Our Q4 bookings are currently standing at 94%. So we have a bit of room to fill in to really drive revenues at the properties in quarter four from a group perspective. We\u2019re hoping we would see another pickup in corporate group like we did in Q3 with the higher food and beverage spend.","Two other points with respect to Q4 to give us confidence in our numbers. Number one, it\u2019s going to be the lowest renovation disruption quarter from the Marriott transformational capital program. We\u2019re anticipating about 10 basis points in renovation disruption in Q4. And lastly, we are getting an extra week in December relative to where we were last year. Given the fact that Hanukkah is virtually on top of Christmas.","Rich Hightower","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my follow-up here, if you take a step back, Host has sold something along the lines of $3 billion in assets over the past three years. I know some of that\u2019s opportunistic, some of that is part of sort of a targeted strategy of selling what you don\u2019t want to own into the next cycle and all that makes sense. But how far along do you think we are in that process and when do you sort of think we\u2019re going to have the team on the field that we want so to speak at the end of that process? Is there a way to sort of handicap that at this point in time?","Jim Risoleo","I would say, I think, we\u2019re very far along, Rich. I mean there were unique reasons why we elected to sell the Sheraton San Diego and the Hyatt Cambridge, which I\u2019ll come back and talk about in a minute, but if you look at some of the assets that we\u2019ve sold, I would describe them as profitability challenged hotels. And that was really a focus on the assets that we sold in New York City, the 2Ws and the Westin Grand Central. We made a decision to exit for the most part all of our international assets and we sold our European JV position. You may recall, we also sold the JW Marriott, Mexico City, bringing in the coast to be much more of a U.S.-centric company. We have very little international exposure today, with three hotels in Brazil and two in Canada.","So the rest of the assets and opportunistic was the sale of the Marquis retail. A lot of the other assets were really those assets that were generating very low RevPAR in markets that we view is dynamic and had high CapEx needs. And I would tell you that, I think, the Sheraton San Diego falls right into that category. The Hyatt Cambridge doesn\u2019t, and we evaluated each of those hotels on a standalone basis taking into consideration likely future performance, CapEx needs of each property and derive the whole value, and we have one buyer for both of them. I\u2019m not at liberty to disclose the buyer due to confidentiality in our documents, but we have one buyer for both hotels.","And what that allowed us to do was really to exit the Sheraton in San Diego where, as you know, we have three really terrific assets with the Manchester Grand Hyatt, which is 1,600 feet and the San Diego Marriott Marquis which is 1,300 rooms and Coronado Island Marriott. So we had keen insights into that market and really understand the dynamic of what makes that market tick in, where demand comes from and where demand goes into what properties.","Now Sheraton, I don\u2019t think we have another hotel in our portfolio like it from the perspective that it\u2019s a dysfunctional box in two towers and it\u2019s in a submarket location that I would say is probably third tier in San Diego. So as we think about it, that\u2019s probably the toughest asset that we had. We\u2019re happy to be able to exit that at what we consider to be a very fair price. The other hotel that we\u2019ve talked about from time to time is the Sheraton in New York. So we continue to explore the market for that asset and look at other alternatives for that property, but in general, I think, we\u2019re in very good shape.","Rich Hightower","Awesome, thanks for that. Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Hey, good morning guys.","Jim Risoleo","Good morning.","Chris Woronka","Good morning. One of the big surprises, I think, this year has been kind of the continuation and the strength of the out-of-room revenues, especially on the, I guess ancillary and fee side. Can you maybe share with us how impactful that\u2019s been relative to your initial expectations? And then, is there a tail to that? How long do some of those ancillary gains continue as we look out into the future?","Jim Risoleo","I think there are obviously a number of different components when we talk about ancillary revenues, Chris. And we\u2019ve seen increases in all of them, and we\u2019re going to continue to drive them because we think it\u2019s really important that while you realize RevPAR is a marker for overall performance, total RevPAR is a very good indication of how you\u2019re running your hotels and really speaks a lot to profitability of the properties. So we continue to see pickups in food and beverage and AD revenues across the portfolio. We have better capture of cancellation fees now, not that cancellations are higher, but due to automated systems.","We are still continuing to see a ramp in spa and golf revenues. I would expect we\u2019ll continue to see that through the course of 2020 at the Phoenician, as I talked about it before, we\u2019ve redone the golf course and redone the spa and it\u2019s really paying off. And as we think about the higher rated corporate group customer, they also bring a higher spend and bank what revenues. So those are areas that we\u2019re focused on. Obviously another area of ancillary revenues continues to be resort and destination fees. We are continuing to focus on greater capture at our properties, making certain that any fee that we\u2019re charging is transparent to the customer and that there is a solid value proposition received on a case-by-case basis.","Chris Woronka","Okay, great color. And just as a follow-up, it appears as if Marriott, you are based on our kind of analysis of all the numbers including your portfolio had some of their brands had lost share in the last couple of years maybe as a result of the integration, but now you know, starting with this quarter, certainly it looks like the gained relative share. Do you guys \u2013 is there a way for you guys to handicap that or underwrite that? And would you assume that the Marriott brands continue to gain relative share next year?","Jim Risoleo","Yes, I would hope so that they will continue to gain share. We gained 30 basis points in share in quarter three, and we\u2019re very excited about that actually. Marriott is working very hard to improve the Sheraton brand. I think they realized that they have an issue with Sheraton across the system, and they are also going to reinvent the W brand, which I think are probably the two laggards when it comes to market share for Marriott. So they are undertaking efforts to fix those two brands going forward.","I talked about Bonvoy, I talked about 137 million members. And what we\u2019ve seen in terms of a pickup in redemptions, it\u2019s clearly going to be a big impact going forward. And I think it will help across the system with gains in market share. It just goes without saying now as the two programs are integrated, the SPG member now has access to all the Marriott properties and the all Marriott Rewards member now has access to all of the legacy Starwood assets. So we saw a pickup in our portfolio in the third quarter and let\u2019s see what happens next year.","Michael Bluhm","A couple of other quick data points. We saw direct booking channel go up 4% as well. And the other thing, and Jim touched on this in his comments, you know how we get a large percentage of our business with Marriott and Starwood in aggregate, and for us to outperform the top 25 markets, the top 22 markets so meaningfully, I think, really speaks to the effect that our operator in particular Marriott had done throughout the quarter.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi, thanks. I just wanted to go back on the dispositions. It sounded like you\u2019re towards the end of the program, but it would be interesting just to hear any thoughts you have on the current financing environment if there\u2019s been any changes there. And then just as a point of clarification, you mentioned a multiple of 14.1 times on the asset sales. Could you provide that multiple without including the CapEx that you would have invested into the properties that you continue to own them?","Jim Risoleo","Sure. I think it\u2019s 11.3 times, Smedes. And if you look in our supplement, on Page 33 we clearly lay out and we\u2019ve done this quarter to quarter, we clearly lay out the methodology that we use in determining what the avoided CapEx is. It really is a component of our build-up to our whole value. We look at both the aggregate CapEx when we think about the reserves on the property as a marker for EBITDA and then we look at the owner-funded CapEx as a marker for cap rate. Those amounts were discounted back over a 10-year time frame, which is the way we do all of our whole values utilizing a discount rate of 8%. So it\u2019s a real number, it\u2019s in the disclosure document.","Smedes Rose","Okay, great.","Jim Risoleo","I will let Michael talk about the financing markets.","Michael Bluhm","And then with respect to the financing markets, couple of observations. From the equity side, Jim has talked about before, private equity has been the marginal buyer today for the asset sales that we\u2019ve done as well as sort of the market in general. They are sitting today with a record amount of dry powder. The debt capital markets, particularly the CMBS market continues to be wide hot, the financing, sort of the financing on strategic hotels has been talked about as a bit of a head scratcher, but super low debt yields, record low interest rates. As long as that market continues to hold up both in the conduit and single asset securitization market, I think, makes for a pretty healthy backdrop with respect to transaction activity.","Smedes Rose","Are you seeing any kind of increase in LTVs or\u2026","Michael Bluhm","No, we haven\u2019t. But interestingly enough, sort of notwithstanding how the market has sort of slowed down, the CMBS market continues to hold pretty tightly as the sort of same the debt yields even see into the past couple of years.","Smedes Rose","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Great, thanks. I wanted to ask about plans for the balance sheet. You have already investment grade and then with these asset dispositions, you have a very strong balance sheet. What\u2019s the plan for that, you know, being so kind of under-levered? Is there a potential that you want to buy something and you want to be in a position to do that, or are you just trying to be defensive going into \u2013 concerned about a downturn? How should we think about what you\u2019re likely to do with your balance sheet at these levels, the leverage level so low? Thanks.","Jim Risoleo","Robin, we certainly are not wishing for a downturn. We have been very active on the capital allocation front, and we view three outlets for capital today. One is on the acquisition side, which I\u2019ll come back and talk about in a minute. The second is investing in our portfolio, which we spend a lot of time talking about that in connection with the Marriott transformational capital program as well as the sustainability ROI projects and the other ROI projects that we\u2019re undertaking, and it is something that we continue to mine the portfolio for to look for other opportunities to create shareholder value.","And the third is obviously share buybacks. And share buybacks to date have equated to $400 million plus a little more in the third quarter. So as we think about capital allocation going forward, we will take a measured approach on when and what amount to continue to buy back stock based on our view of the macro conditions in the world and our view of the operating cadence of our business as we think about getting into the budgeting process for 2020.","On the acquisition front, in the last call, I talked about acquisitions having a high bar given the \u2013 frankly given the uncertain macro environment, but there may very well be a transaction or more than one transaction that makes sense. So it\u2019s going to depend on starting with what market the asset might be located in, what the demand drivers are, what the pricing is and what we think we can achieve going forward from asset management initiatives and improving the operating performance of a particular property. So I think there are a lot of things on the table. You never say never to anything, but by no means are we in any rush to get all this money invested.","Michael Bluhm","Yes, look \u2013 and you should say, Robin, there is no read through for what we get on the financing other than it would capitalizing on what\u2019s probably one of the best financing environment we\u2019ve seen in our lives. Again, Jim\u2019s comment earlier, you never know where you\u2019re headed, but we had a couple of maturities coming up and we went back and you look at kind of what happened in last downturn, Marriott international bond spreads grew at 1,000 basis points for almost 18 months. So it was sort of certainly, it was a pretty prudent time to really push out the maturity schedule, and clean up the balance sheet and position us for whatever market was going into the next couple of years.","Robin Farley","That makes sense. I guess maybe just one follow-up would be, is there sort of a target leverage ratio that I realize at any given point, you are evaluating share repurchase or an asset or two out there that you might want to buy? What should we think about as your targeted leverage range?","Jim Risoleo","I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s changed from where we talked about in the past, and we are thinking about leverage in the range of 2.5 times to 3 times debt to EBITDA.","Robin Farley","That leaves a pretty substantial potential in terms of what you could do with share repo transactions or acquisitions right, based from where you are now to get to 2.5 times to 3 times?","Jim Risoleo","That\u2019s about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of dry powder.","Robin Farley","Okay, all right, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question will be from Lukas Hartwich with Green Street Advisors.","David Bragg","Yes, this is David on for Lucas. Just two quick ones, for you on San Francisco. First off, just curious what your expectations are for that market next year, given your comments, Jim, on a weaker citywide calendar?","And then the second one is just I\u2019m curious what you anticipate for your two Hyatt Hotels in that market with the new Grand Hyatt opening up at the airport? Thanks.","Jim Risoleo","Yes, I\u2019ll talk about the two Hyatts first. The Hyatt at the airport is obviously an in-terminal hotel. We see it not impacting either of our properties in any material way going forward, I mean we have a lot of meeting space at Burlingame, it\u2019s really \u2013 so it\u2019s more toward a group house. I think the Hyatt at the airport is going to be transient. And Union Square is a unique hotel in an unique location.","So next year, we\u2019re probably looking at San Francisco RevPAR performance of 2.5% to 3.5%, somewhere in that range.","David Bragg","Got it. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Jim Risoleo for closing remarks.","Jim Risoleo","Thank you for joining us on the call today. We really appreciate the opportunity to discuss our third quarter results and 2019 outlook with you. Look forward to seeing you at NAREIT and talking with you in a few months to discuss our full-year results as well as providing you with 2020 guidance.","Have a great day, everyone.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Greg Larson, Executive Vice President. Please go ahead, sir.","Gregory J. Larson","Thank you. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.

","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Jeanne Lindberg, our Vice President of Investor Relations. ","This morning, Ed Walter will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results and then we'll describe the current operating environment, as well as the company's outlook for 2012. ","Larry Harvey will then provide greater detail on our first quarter results including regional and market performance. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions. ","And now, here is Ed.","W. Edward Walter","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. 2012 has gotten off to a great start as demand growth has been strong in the higher-rated segments of both our group and transient business leading to a better-than-expected topline and bottom-line growth, which resulted in earnings that exceeded consensus estimates. ","Our strong first quarter performance combined with the robust group booking page for the remainder of the year gives us confidence to raise our full year guidance. We feel very good about the fundamentals of the business and our outlook for the remainder of the year, which I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. ","So first, let's review our results for the quarter. First quarter RevPAR for our comparable hotels increased 6.1% driven by an increase in occupancy of 2.1 percentage points combined with an increase in average room rate of 2.9%. The RevPAR growth when combined with an impressive 5.9% increase in food and beverage revenues, plus the extra day on the calendar in February, generated a comparable revenue increase of 6.3% for the first quarter. Continuing a trend we saw developing in the fourth quarter of last year, our banquet and audiovisual revenue grew faster than our outlet and lounge revenue, as several of our larger hotels experienced meaningful increases in banquet activity. ","The strong revenue performance in both rooms and F&B operations drove a 100 basis point improvement in our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins for the quarter. ","Adjusted EBITDA was $176 million, an increase of more than 22% over last year. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.14, which exceeded consensus estimates and reflected a nearly 17% increase over last year. ","Overall, we are extremely pleased with our operating results and the progress we are seeing in lodging fundamentals. A key driver of our first quarter results was a solid increase in demand in the higher price segments of our group and transient business, which continues some favorable trends we have seen develop at the end of last year and should lay the foundation for improved results in the future. ","Starting with our transient business, our Special Corporate and retail segment experienced demand in rate growth of more than 3.5%, leading to a combined revenue growth of better than 7%. Our discount segment saw demand growth of more than 2%, but the level of growth was restrained because of some weakness in government travel, which declined slightly. ","Overall, our first quarter transient results reflected a 3.5% increase in rate and a 3% increase in demand resulting in a 6.5% increase in revenue. On the group front, 2012 is off to a strong start. While group bookings for the quarter started the quarter ahead of the prior year, we improved further as bookings in the quarter for the quarter improved by more than 6% leading to an overall increase in group room nights of nearly 4%. ","The improvement was generated by a double-digit increase in association business and an increase in corporate group of more than 6%, as our discount group segment declined by over 5%. Combining the demand improvement with an average rate increase of 1.5%, resulted in increased group revenues of almost 5.5%. ","Looking at the rest of the year, our outlook is even brighter. Group bookings for the remainder of the year surged by more than 13% compared to the prior year and are now approximately 7.5% ahead of last year's pace for the remaining 3 quarters and meaningfully positive in every quarter. The average rate for these bookings is up approximately 2% and our recent bookings have exceeded last year's rates by more than 8%. Both trends bode well for the future. ","While transient bookings trends are obviously a more near-term indicator, our transient bookings also continue to run well ahead of last year's levels and suggest strong rate flow. The combination of these trends suggest that we should continue to see improvements in occupancy in 2012, which will ultimately drive higher rates and additional mixed shift. We are also seeing positive group booking activity extend into 2013, indicating that our group hotels, which lag during the early stages of this recovery, are now betting -- benefiting from increased business spending. ","On the investment front, during the quarter, our JV in Asia acquired a 278 room to Citigate Perth for AUD $61 million and the JV will invest an incremental AUD $17 million to -- in the hotel to upgrade and rebrand the property as a Four Points by Sheraton. ","Even after completion of the capital investment plan, we would expect that we would have acquired this asset for at least 15 -- a 15% discount to replacement costs. The Perth lodging market directly benefits from the significant sums being invested in Australia's natural resource industry. The market has seen RevPAR increases of nearly 9% over the last 5 years, once that occupancy levels above 80% as little projected new supply and as a result, we are very pleased to have acquired this asset. ","Turning to dispositions, as we announced last month. In Q1, we sold the San Francisco Airport Marriott for $113 million. While certainly a fine property in a top market, this sale was consistent with our strategy of reducing our exposure to noncore assets located in airport markets at attractive pricing. The sale also permits us to avoid investing an incremental $15 million in capital improvements over the next couple of years. Recognizing that there has been a directive acquisition opportunities in North America, we are moving quickly to bring selected assets to the market, as we continue to look to recycle assets and improve the quality of our already outstanding portfolio. On the investment side, our pipeline is growing more active today, and we expect we will see additional assets that satisfy our criteria come to market later in the year. ","Overall, we would expect to be a net buyer this year, but we intend to remain disciplined. If pricing levels move too high, we will look to take advantage by accelerating our sale activity. Given the unpredictability of the timing of these transactions, our guidance does not assume any additional acquisitions or dispositions this year beyond what we have already announced. ","Turning to capital investments for the first quarter, we invested $48 million in redevelopment and return on investment capital projects, as we completed the redevelopment of the Atlanta Marriott Perimeter Center and phase 3 of our redevelopment of San Diego Marriott Marquis, which included the renovation of more than 95,000 square feet of meeting space. ","We continue to find construction pricing attractive and expect these investments will yield return substantially in excess of our cost of capital. For the full year, we expect to spend approximately $150 million to $170 million. ","As we mentioned last quarter, we're in the process of converting the New York Helmsley Hotel to the Westin Grand Central, where we are renovating all the guestrooms, meeting space, restaurants, as well as mechanical and fa\u00e7ade work. ","In the first quarter, we completed the first few floors of our newly renovated guestrooms at the hotel. We also completed the renovation of all the rooms at the W Union Square. We spent approximately $14 million on these and a few other acquisition-related projects this quarter and expect to spend $100 million to $110 million in total on these projects for the full year. ","In terms of maintenance capital expenditures, we spent $100 million in the first quarter and expect to spend $300 million to $330 million for the full year. Projects in the quarter included room renovations at the Ritz-Carlton, Amelia Island, the Pentagon City Residents Inn, and the meeting space renovation at the W New York. ","Now I will spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2012. As we have outlined today, we are seeing very strong demand trends. With new supply in our markets projected to be approximately 0.5% for 2012, we expect the industry fundamentals will remain strong for the balance of the year. ","Given our solid first quarter results and better-than-expected group booking activity, we have increased our comparable hotel RevPAR guidance to 5% to 7% for the year. On the margin side, even given that occupancy growth is still making a meaningful contribution to RevPAR growth, we believe we can drive incremental profitability and strong flow through. Therefore, we have adjusted -- expect an adjusted margin increase of 50 to 100 basis points resulting in adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.120 billion to a $1.165 billion. ","This operating forecast, combined with the balance sheet activity that Larry will discuss in a minute, will result in an adjusted FFO per share of $1.1 to $1.8. Looking at our dividend, we increased our first quarter common dividend to $0.06 per share. Dividends for the remainder of the year will depend on both operating results and gains on asset sales. ","I am pleased to say that the lodging recovery is continuing to progress and that we are seeing significant improvements in group business, which have lead to our increase in guidance for the year. ","We believe this positive cycle will gain momentum through the remainder of this year and into 2013, an increase in demand combined with projected low supply growth in our markets of roughly 0.5% in 2013 and 2014, should support a solid and sustained recovery. ","So thank you, and let me turn the call over to Larry Harvey, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Larry K. Harvey","Thank you, Ed. Let me start by giving you some detail on our comparable hotel RevPAR results. Our top-performing market for the quarter was Philadelphia, with a RevPAR increase of 30.8%. Occupancy improved 15 percentage points driven by strong group and transient demand, while rate increased more than 3%. ","Results for the quarter benefited from the 2011 rooms and meeting space renovations at the Downtown Marriott. RevPAR for the hotel improved over 50% for the quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","We expect Philadelphia to be a top-performing market in the second quarter due to strong group demand, which should allow us to drive pricing. RevPAR for our Chicago hotels increased by 20.3% driven by an increase in occupancy of more than 8 percentage points and an improvement in average rate of over 3%, as both citywide and overall group demand were excellent. ","We expect our Chicago hotels to continue to perform very well in the second quarter due to strong group and transient demand. ","Our Hawaiian hotels continued their outstanding performance with a RevPAR improvement of 15.1%. Occupancy increased over 10 percentage points and average rate was up nearly 2%. The out performance was driven by strong group -- corporate group and transient business, which allowed us to shift the mix of business and benefit from rate compression. ","We expect our Hawaiian properties to underperform our portfolio in the second quarter but having good second half of the year. Our Houston hotels had an excellent first quarter with RevPAR up 12.8%, ADR increased nearly 6% and occupancy improved 5 percentage points due to strength in group bookings. We expect our Houston hotels to underperform our portfolio in the second quarter due to an unfavorable comparison to the first quarter of 2011 when the city of Houston Hosted the NCAA Men's Final 4. ","As expected, our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels had another great quarter with RevPAR up 11.3%. Average rate increased by over 5.5%, while occupancy improved 4.5 percentage points. Strength in higher-rated group and transient business helped to drive the ADR growth. ","We expect our Miami and Fort Lauderdale hotels to continue to perform well in the second quarter. Our San Francisco hotels had another strong quarter as RevPAR increased 10.9% due to an ADR improvement of nearly 9% and an occupancy increase of nearly 2 percentage points. The improvement in ADR was driven by rate increases for both group and transient business. ","We expect our San Francisco hotels to continue to perform well in the second quarter as strong demand will allow us to continue to drive rate. Our Los Angeles property has also had a good quarter with a RevPAR improvement of 8.5%, strong group demand that lead to an increase in occupancy of 5 percentage points, while ADR improved over 2%. ","We expect our Los Angeles hotels to continue to perform well in the second quarter due to strength in both group and transient demand. RevPAR for our New York hotels increased 6.5% due to a rate improvement of 2.5% and an occupancy increase of nearly 3 percentage points. ","Results were negatively impacted by the second and final stage of the rooms renovations at the New York Marriott Marquis and the Sheraton New York Hotel & Towers, meeting space renovations at the W New York and a room's renovation at the W Union Square. We expect our New York hotels to have a good second quarter. ","RevPAR for our Washington DC hotels was down 3.9%, as occupancy decline roughly 1.5 points and ADR decline 1.5%. Lower levels of citywide demand led to the poor performance, although, our hotels did increase their market share in the quarter. ","As we previously discussed, 2012 will be a challenge in DC due to a weaker citywide calendar, government travel cutbacks and the lack of legislative activity which reduces demand. We expect the second quarter will be better but still underperform our portfolio. ","Lastly, our worst-performing market for the quarter was San Antonio. RevPAR declined 8% due to a slight drop in occupancy and a decrease of ADR of over 7%. Citywide and group demand were weak. We do expect our San Antonio Hotels to perform better in the second quarter but to continue to underperform our portfolio. ","Despite concerns in the European lodging market due to weak economic results and sovereign debt issues, we were presently surprised by our European joint venture operating results. Excluding the Sheraton Roma, which is under major renovation, RevPAR calculated in constant Euros increased 4.8% for the quarter. Inbound travel to the Eurozone from the U.S., U.K., Asia and the Middle East continues to be strong and is a major source of euro lodging demand. The Westin Europa & Regina in Venice, the Sheraton Warsaw, the Sheraton Skyline in London and the Pullman Paris Bercy all had double-digit RevPAR increases for the quarter. ","F&B revenues were also strong with an increase of 4.5%. Lastly, our first quarter JV results only reflect January and February. RevPAR for March for the JV excluding the Sheraton Roma, was up 6.2%. ","For the quarter, adjusted operating profit margins for our comparable hotels increased 100 basis points. Margins for the quarter benefited from better productivity as wages and benefits on a per occupied room basis were up only 60 basis points. ","Food and beverage revenues were up 5.9% and F&B profits were up 8.3%, leading to an F&B flow through of roughly 35%. We continue to see improvements in catering, meeting room rental and audiovisual revenues. General and administrative, sales and marketing and repairs and maintenance expense increased 4.4%, primarily driven by expenses that are variable with revenues including credit card commissions, reward programs and clustered and shared service allocations. ","Utility cost benefited from mild winter weather throughout most of the country and declined over 3%. Property taxes increased 3.6%, while property insurance increased nearly 15%. ","Looking to the rest of 2012, we expect that RevPAR will be driven by both occupancy and rate growth, but rate growth will be increasingly more important throughout the year. The additional rate growth should lead to solid rooms flow through even with growth in wage and benefit cost. ","We expect the positive trends in group demand to continue particularly in the second and fourth quarters, which had helped drive growth in banquet and audiovisual revenues and good F&B flow through. We expect on allocated costs to increase more than inflation particularly for rewards in sales and marketing where higher revenues will increase cost. ","We also expect property tax to increase roughly 8% and utilities to increase between 1% and 2% for the year. As a result, we expect comparable hotel adjusted operating profit margins to increase 50 basis points at the low end of the RevPAR range and increase 100 basis points at the high end of the range. ","During the quarter, we issued $350 million of 10-year senior notes at a 5.25% rate, which is more than 60 basis points lower than any bond component in the history of the company. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, proceeds from the bond deal along with available cash were used to repay the $113 million 7.5% mortgage secured by the JW Marriott Washington DC to redeem $250 million of the 6 7\/8% Series S senior notes due in 2014, and to repurchase $386 million of the 2.625% Exchangeable Senior Debentures. ","In conjunction with our refinancing activities, we intend to repay the remaining series S senior notes and reduce our overall debt by an additional $150 million. As a result of these transactions, we will have lowered our debt balance from approximately $6.1 billion at the end of the first quarter to approximately $5.2 billion, which leads to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $400 million on a pro forma basis. ","After these transactions, we have no 2012 debt maturities and less than $250 million of 2013 maturities. Our weighted average debt maturity will have increased from 4.5 years to 5.1 years. During the first quarter, we issued approximately 11.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of $15.67 per share for net proceeds of approximately $172 million to our ATM Program. ","The first quarter issuance has completed the sales program under the 2011 agreement. As detailed in earnings press release, we recently entered into a new $400 million ATM Program with BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC and Scotiabank. Any proceeds will generally be used to invest in our portfolio and for new acquisitions including joint venture investments. ","Consistent with our philosophy, our willingness to issue equity depends on our stock price and the level of acquisition opportunities. ","This completes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Was that 13% versus 7% last year? I think if I got that right. Can you give us some sense of how much is rate versus volume and then also...","W. Edward Walter","Robin, If I could interrupt you for a second, for some reason, the first part of your question didn't come through because -- why don't you -- if you could just start over again, that would probably be -- well at least be helpful for us and probably for everyone.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just -- I wanted to get a little more color on -- if I got your opening remarks correctly, you said group bookings up 13% versus 7% at the same time last year. And I was just looking for some color on how much of that is rate versus volume of that 13% increase. And then the other question I was going to ask is on your acquisitions spend, it looks like your budget, your planned spend on acquisition is up for the year. I wonder if you talk about kind of what's driving that? Is it just better capital availability or more compelling assets available? In another words, is that being driven by a specific transaction that you haven't firmed up yet? That kind of thing.","W. Edward Walter","I think if -- let's start with the group booking activity. What we were trying to communicate relative to the booking pace activity is that we were up significantly in the quarter for the quarter. And then if you look at the rest of the year, our room night for the rest of the year -- the number of rooms that we book for the remainder of the year, that was up 13%. So that was a room night number and not a revenue number. As we look overall for the full year, what we're seeing at this point now is that our overall booking pace for the full year is up actually about 8.5% on a revenue basis for the full year, but that is much stronger for the last 3 quarters of the year than it was for the first part. So actually, if you look at the last 3 quarters of the year, we're running and then -- on a revenue basis, we're running in the 9.5% to 10% area. That gets comprised of high 7% increase in room nights, combined with a couple of percent in rate. So hopefully that clarifies that. Now in the acquisitions --","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Actually, can I have -- if your number of room nights is up 13% on a revenue basis, up 9.5% to 10%, it seems there maybe rate...","W. Edward Walter","They're slightly different numbers. In other words, what we're saying -- another way to look at this is that our booking pace starting the year on a room night basis was probably below -- was around 5% or so. And so now, at this point, our booking pace through the full year is significantly higher. The reason why the overall booking pace on a room night and a revenue basis is higher than where it was at the beginning of the year is because we booked more rooms in the quarter for the quarter, and we booked more rooms for the remainder of the year than we did last year. The net result of that is the increases that we're seeing in Q2 through Q4 in terms of both room nights and then an improvement in rate, which ultimately leads to the improvement in revenue.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then on the acquisitions spend?","W. Edward Walter","On the acquisition side, I don't know that I would necessarily view what we express in my comments as a change. We still feel that we are early in the lodging cycle. We don't see supply increasing for a number of years back to the average level of supply, frankly. And therefore, we don't see supply getting back to the point where it exceeds demand for several more years. So from that, looking at where we sit in the lodging cycle, our sense is that this is still a good time to be a buyer of assets. Now we've also expressed that we also intend over time to continue to recycle assets from our portfolio, a lot of those proceeds would be reinvested in the assets that we would acquire. At this stage, where we stand, we would like to be a net buyer of assets and that would be our goal for this year. We haven't actually put a dollar amount on that externally in part, because it's somewhat contingent on availability and things like that.","Operator","Next up, we'll go to Bill Crow with Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. Ed, are you surprised at all at the speed of which staffing levels have return to hotel level?","W. Edward Walter","Yes and no. I mean, I guess the first thing I'd say, Bill, is I'm probably a little surprised at how quickly occupancy has recovered in the industry and certainly in our portfolio. So when I look at what's -- we've gone back and we keep comparing in our portfolio, where our staffing levels relative to '07 and '09, both at the associate level and at the manager level. And I think what I would say is that based on the numbers that we've looked at, staffing levels have come back. They've come back slower at the manager level than at the associate level, but they are still lower than where they would be kind of in relationship to the occupancy levels that we saw in '07. And on the manager side, I would say, if we cut about 20% of our managers in the downturn, I don't think we've even recovered half of the decrease. So maybe we're up 10% from where we were in '09 and taking into account a pretty significant occupancy increase from where we were in '09 to where we are right now. But I think our sense generally throughout the portfolio is that the operators have been thoughtful about how they've been adding staff back and part of that is as we look more broadly at productivity levels in our portfolio. Our productivity levels are certainly better now than they were during the prior recovery.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Discussion that maybe the second half of the year is going to be better for DC on a group basis, but now we get that the whole GSC -- GSA scandal in there. What are you seeing for DC in the second half of the year?","W. Edward Walter","Larry, do you have any thoughts on the second half? I think I know we expect it to be stronger.","Larry K. Harvey","Yes, we expect the second quarter to be better across the board and roughly for the full year. We're down 3, 9 in the quarter. We expect it to be -- I'd say flattish. So we do see some pickup.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then finally for me, on the acquisition front, I know you're barraged all the time by the brokers. Are you looking at potential portfolios becoming available? CMBS-related assets that may come up in the second half of the year? What do you anticipate in from an acquisition landscape?","W. Edward Walter","It's a great question, Bill. Obviously, if somebody has a larger portfolio whether it's here or outside the U.S., we will tend to get a call on that. We don't have to necessarily focus on those types of deals, because it's more about owning the right assets than necessarily getting bigger. But there are a few portfolios that are in play right now and see whether pricing gets to a point where it make sense for us to play in those. I think if you look beyond that, there seems to be still a little bit of a pricing expectation gap between sellers who would generally be of a mind to sell and where the market is right now. I think some of that is may be expectations that were developed over the course of the first and second quarter of '11 where pricing was starting to accelerate a little bit. And folks are still sort of looking for cap rates and thinking that they apply to this year is then alive when they think about the value of their assets. And that's the explanation I get from the brokerage community who why the recovery in assets being brought to market has been a little bit slower than what might have expected given that the stock market and cost of capital recovered by the beginning of the year. I think that a lot of what -- part of the reason there seems to be a sense of confidence that the second half of the year we'll see more transaction activity is driven by the belief that there are, is debt maturing in or around the second half of the year and so that would likely drive more transaction activity. Because in general, there's always specific exceptions to this. But in general, lenders are not necessarily to pretend -- not willing to pretend and extend at this point. Values have recovered enough that lenders want activity and lenders want to be paid off. So I think there's an expectation that there'll be some acceleration of activity that flows out of that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Let's move on to Jim Sullivan with Cowen and Company.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I had a question for you on the group business. You talked extensively in your prepared comments about how strong group bookings are. And I'm just curious, outside of the comments about the San Antonio asset and market, in the remainder of your large convention center hotels, have you seen a significant difference in strength between the larger group business and the smaller group business, number one, in the first quarter? And number two, as you think about those 2 businesses, that's kind of sub segments of overall group, do you expect that relative differential to continue over the balance of the year or not?","W. Edward Walter","Jim, that's an interesting question. And I know that -- I think this came up on one of the other calls maybe from a slightly different slant. If you look at how our larger hotels are doing compared to our smaller hotels, if you compare the two based on first quarter operations, broadly speaking relative to just overall revenue performance, I think what you find is that the larger -- they're both in comparison to the prior peak and roughly the same position. But the way they get there is a little bit different. The larger hotels are actually doing better on rate, but are a few point behind in terms of occupancy. And I think the reason for that is -- were the one that you were suggesting, which is that overall, the larger hotels are probably seeing -- are seeing a little bit less of their business coming from group right now than they have in the past. I think they're getting the rate, because they're well located in markets that are recovering quickly, which in part accounts the differential in rate. But they -- because we still don't -- we've not recovered close yet to our prior levels of group activity, you're just not -- you haven't quite seen the same level of group business at those larger hotels. As we look at the beginning of this year, we would see a similar result that Mariott described which is that we're seeing some heavier levels and bigger increases in the smaller hotels than we are seeing in the larger hotels. We're seeing significantly good, strong increases in both. But I think part of that comparison, you need to understand that the smaller hotels tend to book a lot of their business fairly short term. So the fact that group is coming back and coming back well in the initial stages of this, this is going to disproportionately benefit smaller -- look better, not so much benefit, but look better on a year-over-year basis for the smaller hotels, because they don't see with much group business. That same quantitative benefit when it hit the bigger hotels that already does 60% of its business on a group basis is still very meaningful. But on a comparison basis, it doesn't look quite as strong. I think as we -- part of what we're encouraged by when we look at the larger hotels is the fact the association business was better. Corporate group is better. We're hearing signs from our operators that the associations were thinking in terms of bigger events and those in days in attendance as they look out into to '13 and '14 and beyond. So I think there's a confidence in the larger groups that they're going to hold bigger events as opposed to smaller events looking outward. That will clearly benefit the larger hotels. And then coming back to my first point, when we look at the levels of -- when we look at those overall levels of occupancy, we really see a strong opportunity for those larger hotels to benefit in a material way over the next couple of years from the improving group trends.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Conclude on this point to make sure I understand it. That would suggest they do a larger assets and you have, of course, a significant chunk of those in your portfolio. It's really a lead lag time kind of issue. Then you should be looking at relatively -- good relative strength as we go forward through this recovery.","W. Edward Walter","That's certainly what we would believe.","James W. Sullivan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And second question for me regard to your appetite for international acquisitions. Obviously, there's been significant amount of uncertainty regarding currency and interest rates in the European market not withstanding your assets have done fairly well there. And I'm just curious how you asses your appetite to do more European acquisitions as opposed to perhaps more acquisitions in the Asian market going forward? How we likely to see more buying in Asia than Europe?","W. Edward Walter","A lot of that will be driven by the opportunities that present themselves. I think that there are attractive -- we would be interested investing in both markets. In Europe, I don't expect though that we will see that many assets come to market unless they're driven by debt maturities. In talking with our office there and with the folks that run that office. The amount of product that's on the market in Europe right now is relatively low, and what's there is there because debt is maturing. I think we need to be cautious investing in Europe for all the obvious reasons. But I also think that we need to remember a couple of points we've talked about before. One is that Europe is a very varied place, and so we would generally feel better about the economies in Northern Europe than the ones in Southern Europe. The major cities of Europe are incredible tourist destinations. I think one of the reasons why Europe has done far better than most of the folks -- most folks would have expected is not because of some surprising pockets of economic strength in Europe itself, but rather because the rest of the world is interested in going to Europe. I think we mentioned on our prior call that we're looking at our portfolio of assets, which is reasonably diversified portfolio of hotels, over 40% of the business that we do at our hotels comes from outside of Europe and the U.K. And I think that's one of the reasons why we've done as well as we've done in the first quarter, because so much of the business is coming to us from outside of Europe. So now that it is, we would be cautious about Europe, but if we felt like -- if we like the market, we like the price, sometimes investing in periods of risk is when you get your best returns. And part of our analysis would be to look for slightly higher returns in Europe right now that we have in the past. As you look more broadly through Asia, it's really just like -- it's a very different situation country by country. As we announced today, we had purchased a property in Perth. We would certainly be interested in acquiring more in Australia. We think that's the market that even with some of the signs of slowing growth in China, that means that a little bit of reduction in China's growth outlook does not change the outlook for Australia in our minds in a meaningful way. There's a tremendous natural resource boom that's going to continue to happen there and that the acquisition of Perth is a great way to play on that.","Operator","We'll take the next question from Josh Attie with Citi.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How much of the improvement in your group bookings would you attribute to stronger market demand versus the positive changes in Marriott Sales Force program over the last 12 months?","W. Edward Walter","Josh, I don't know that I can give a realistic answer to that. I think that they have been working through some of the bugs in the structure of Sales Force One. And I know that in talking with them -- we have regular meetings with them on this topic, they have certainly been encouraged by some of the trends that they've seen. I think it is true that if we look at our Marriott hotels, they have certainly had a strong surge in booking activity over the course of the last 6 months. So I think it's probably fair to attribute some of the improvement to them figuring that out at a better level. I also think that at the end of the day, a stronger market makes a big difference for all of us and that's the other -- that clearly is the major driver behind the improvement.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Maybe even when you look at the first quarter, how did the Marriott portion of the portfolio performe relative to the rest of it? Did you see outperformance?","W. Edward Walter","Off the top of my head, I don't know the answer to that. And I think we tend not to try to give operator data on this call. So I probably would stay away from that answer.","Joshua Attie - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. One more question. Can you update us on the European debt investment that you made? I think it's scheduled to mature in October, and do you have any sense for how that will play out?","W. Edward Walter","What I would tell you is that you're right that it matures in October. And I would also tell you that the portfolio is on the market at this point in time. As the owners look to either refinance the debt or to sell it, and we're paying close attention to what's happening with that portfolio.","Operator","Next up, we take question from Eli Hackel with Goldman Sachs.","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just 2 questions. Your commentary was very positive about group and transient. And which suggests at least in your commentary that maybe RevPAR will be up more than 5%. I'm just trying to get at what does the 5% take into account, and how much of that maybe would be attributable just to DC being weak throughout the year? And then just a second question on group. I think at one point, Ed, you talked about you used to make sure groups guaranteed a certain out of room spend whether be SNB or maybe audiovisual. Are you starting to make or your managers starting to make them guarantee sort of out of room spend as you continue to get more occupancy on the group side?","W. Edward Walter","I guess when you're talking about the 5%, you're sort of trying to look at the range that we've given and has some sense into how likely is it to be 5% versus some other number. Is that the point you're trying to get out there?","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just trying to -- no, I mean the numbers you gave in terms of group booking pace, were high single digits in terms of transient seemed to be very, very strong. And clearly, the first quarter was strong and it seems like things are looking to get better, obviously, benefited from big Philly comparisons in the first quarter. I'm just trying to get at what would cause the deceleration. Is it DC  or something else? Or is it just to take into consideration, it's still a cautious time with Europe and things like that?","W. Edward Walter","I got it now. The answer would be the second half of what you just spoke about. I mean, I think we feel good about the first -- very good about the first quarter. There is nothing that we are looking at right now that would suggest that we should see a deceleration. But we all know that there are -- just watching what's happened over the course of the last couple of years and recognizing that we are not through the sovereign debt crisis in southern Europe at this point in time, I think our sense is that it's important to just remain balance in our perspective over what's going to happen for the rest of the year. But as Larry highlighted, DC is not going to be a great market this year, but it's going -- it should start to improve. We don't expect it to be negative certainly for the rest of the year. And I -- and we're not -- I'd say generally, probably we should take comfort from the fact that if we weren't really comfortable with improving overall outlook, we would not have raised our guidance in the way that we did. Now your second question was relative on the group side?","Eli Hackel - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, on the group side. In terms of making group guarantees.","W. Edward Walter","Yes, yes, yes, okay. I don't know. We've talked about that internally, and I actually asked that question when we were speaking with our asset managers last week to just get a better feel for what was happening on that side. I think in certain markets, we are starting to get the benefit of being able to push pricing a bit around banquets and things like that. But it seems to me that we're still a little ways away from where we can really drive that improved results. Folks are showing up with a budget. The good news is they want to do the event. The bad news, if it's bad news, is that they still are showing up with a pretty defined budget that they need to stick to in order to have the event. And I think we're not quite at the point a lot of markets where we can start to say that, that budget has to go up before we can give you the meeting space. What is interesting though is, which we were not seeing last year, is a number of groups are while they may not have committed to higher spend before they get to the hotel, when the meeting planners and the senior executives or the senior folks responsible for the event get to the hotel, we are seeing some pops in activity on the food and beverage side that get determined at the very last minute. And so that has been a positive in terms of our food and beverage revenues and more often than not, we found that whatever our month out forecast is for food and beverage, we've been beating that more than listing it. And I think it is in part driven by the fact that when groups are showing up, they're comfortable that they can increase their spending.","Operator","Next up with Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora.","Andrew G. Didora - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions here. I guess, the first one is sort of a follow-up on your last commentary. It seems like your total same store revenue guidance implies F&B and other revenues will be more significantly lag room revenues than they have in the past couple of quarters. So anything specific you're seeing here in terms of the groups you have on the books for the rest of the year? And then my second question, with regards to Europe, and on the last call, you mentioned your European properties are forecasting a 3% to 5% RevPAR increase, but your guidance implied closer to flat European RevPAR. Has anything changed in your view since the last call here?","W. Edward Walter","Let me deal with your first, and I'll come back to the issue about revenue. As we had indicated in our February call, we were being fairly cautious in our approach to Europe for all the obvious reasons. We've been very happy with the results that Larry explained in terms of just how the first quarter has played out especially when you look at the calendar quarter where you get the benefit a little bit more insight into what's really going on there by including March. And when you look at those numbers, I mean the reality is that we really are seeing -- we think our overall RevPAR was above 5 and you're seeing strong food and beverage spending there, and so profit is up in a material way. Our revised forecast takes the first quarter, essentially the first quarter success into account, but recognizing that the situation there is still somewhat volatile and uncertain. We've been conservative for the rest of the year and roughly in a level where we're assuming flat performance year-over-year for Europe. I think that clearly is upside there, but we have not tried to pick that up as of yet just again, because it's hard not to have concerns about Europe when you read the paper every day. And going back to the other point, I think at the end of the day, what you should probably take out of our overall revenue numbers, we still feel pretty good about food and beverage revenue. Some of the trends relative to other revenue would probably been a bit more cautious on the other revenue side which is why when you look at the overall mix, you're seeing that revenues are down a bit from the room -- overall revenues are slightly less in where we are on room revenue. But I would tell you that more of that is happening in an area that less of a profit driver, which is the other revenue side. But food and beverage spending, we would probably estimate right now. We'll be slightly less than where room revenues are, but not a lot less.","Operator","Next up with Baird, we have David Loeb.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I had some housekeeping questions. First up, Larry, maybe for you. In the acquisition expenditure, CapEx related to acquisitions, that range went up a bit at the midpoint about $15 million. What's behind that? Are there -- the cost looking higher for the Helmsley conversion to the Westin for example?","W. Edward Walter","We've had -- budget for the Helmsley has snuck up a couple of million dollars. But the real driver behind that, this might arguably be a classification issue internally, is we've identified an opportunity at the Helmsley to change how the first floor works from a standpoint of the lobby, the bar and the restaurant. And what we're looking to do and what that budget anticipates and then getting some final numbers and actually approving it internally, is that we're going to move the whole food and beverage and bar operation into the -- what I would call the front right part of the hotel potentially either. Part of the idea will be to extend the hotel out of it into the sidewalk on 42 Street, which we think will make that a far more visible food and beverage operation. That will allow us to take what's a really nice space what I would describe as the back of the hotel that is currently our restaurant that would allow us to turn that into meeting space, which is one thing that hotel would benefit from having more of. So most of that increase really relates to the fact that, that project which a lot of ways is only happening if it hits on threshold that we're going to add that project into the mix and that's the reason for that change that you see.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And that on the order of magnitude $10 million or $12 million.","W. Edward Walter","I think it's not -- It's probably not up at that level. I think the other element -- the other part of it is just a little bit more confident. We're going to get some of these projects done this year like some of the activity at the Hyatt. The Hyatt in San Diego is part of that broader number. And some of the work that we were planning on doing there is probably going to be accelerated in terms of a spending perspective. The nature, the work isn't really changing but we think some of that work is going to get done a little bit faster. A push on our guidance to get as much of that hotel done as possible before the NAREIT of that in November this year. So they're reacting to that pressure.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just on the group side, and you've touched that from a number of different perspectives, but I guess that one perspective that I don't think I heard. Is there lower rated groups that's burning off and how much of a drag is that? And when do you start -- when do you think you'll start seeing better group rate increases because the mix is shifting towards more recent booking?","W. Edward Walter","I think we're already seeing that now. Just by virtue of the fact that some of the statistics side threw out the fact that our recent bookings are clearly up by -- are up by more than 8% percent compared to where we were last year. It's a good sign but sort of on the current basis, we're doing better. If I try to think back about it, right now, about 80% of our room nights for '12 are on the books. We probably started the year, I think, we said around 70%. We probably -- at the beginning of '11, we probably had about maybe 35% to 40% of the room nights for '12 on the books. So if you go a year further back to the year that would be relevant, at the beginning of '10, which is when the world start to get a little bit better, we probably had 20% of our room nights for '12 on the books. So I would guess that most of that business that was booked before the beginning of '10 was probably cheaper business. So maybe that means 20% of this year's room nights and some portions of the business booked in '10 would also be at lower room rate. But as you sort of think forward to '13, we'll have very little from '08 and '09 that will be on the books for '13. We'll have some obviously from '10. But hopefully gives you some feel that as we get to the end of this year and get into the beginning of next year, we should be less than -- call it 20% percent of our business would actually be still tied to a period of time where the industry were struggling.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And finally for Larry, you went through a number of markets, but you didn't mention Atlanta. Can you just give a little bit of a view of how it might have performed and what the outlook is?","Larry K. Harvey","Sure. Atlanta was actually up 4.9%, David. Very good group and citywide demand. We actually expect it even better second quarter. Got really good group and transient pace on the books and then for the rest of the year, it'll basically end up about where it was in the first quarter. So the second quarter, it should be very good. We're hopeful that the second half of the year improves on what our current forecast has, but very nice first quarter and even better second quarter.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So this sounds like it's group rotation into Atlanta. Second quarter, you're going to lap that big upper mid drop from last year, right? That should help?","Larry K. Harvey","Yes.","David Loeb - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","But this is not really that -- it's business in Atlanta, the business climate in Atlanta or the transient business is picking up. Particularly, it's much more group driven?","Larry K. Harvey","No, no. The second quarter strength is also on the transient side. So group and transient in the second quarter.","Operator","Now we'll take a question from Jeffrey Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Ed, if I could just build off maybe an earlier question on the call, we've seen just more consolidation activity happening at some of your peers, Red Lion, then maybe Gaylord. I'm just curious what's your personal sense? Do you think those could be the canary and the coalmine for more consolidation as the year progresses?","W. Edward Walter","That's an interesting question, Jeff. So if you look at the merger market right now, I guess what I would say is capital is more available. Certainly, if you can access some of the markets that we can access, and that's a critical ingredient for those types of transactions to occur. I don't know whether the capital is available necessarily for the go private alternative similar to what we'd saw happen in 5 and 6 and 7. I don't know if that debt capital is necessarily available for those types of transactions. So the capital I'm saying might more likely be available might be more company to company. And I think the company to company deal is driven so much by factors that are hard to predict. It is both a function of whether one company is not realizing the benefits of their portfolio or their structure, it gets tied into the sort of the motivations of management and what their longer-term game plan is. So you could be right. I mean, I guess what I'd say is every cycle as we work our way passed the halfway point, I think you do start to see that for a variety of reasons, transaction activity begins to increase and as we get -- right on -- we're at the halfway point, yet, in this recovery, I think we probably are not. So my guess is most of the industry would look at their portfolio and their company and be pretty optimistic about the RevPAR and NOI growth prospects for the next several years. It's just hard to really look out, say to yourself, wow, supply's going to start to pick up and things are going to start -- we're going to start to be at a risky point in the cycle. So since that's not visible, I suspect that most folks would look at it the same way that I do in some ways, which is I really feel pretty good about where we're headed and the opportunity that we have to create value. And while we, at host, would always entertain sale the company at an appropriate price for our shareholders, the reality is that I think there's a lot value to create and I'm pretty focused on trying to create that. And I suspect that if you polled all the other folks in our space, they probably would say something similar to that.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","If it's a form of company or the company transactions not necessarily out right. If you've seen a change in the attitude of the brands, disposing of their non-core assets particularly as stocks have come back. And I guess I can put you on the spot. Is it fair to say that like the large group assets, like a Gaylord owns, are not of interest to someone like you guys?","W. Edward Walter","Speaking more broadly about the brands, we're in constant conversation with the brands about assets that they may own. I think, they're -- right now, I would describe them as they're all thematically on the same path, which is that they generally would like to be more asset light than they are today. But most of them are in pretty good shape from a capital perspective, and are looking for uses for that capital more than they are looking for reasons to generate more capital. So I think you haven't seen as much activity as you might have anticipated for that reason. I think in terms of larger group assets, without talking specifically about any particular company, our focus if we were to buy larger assets like that would be to acquire assets that show the characteristics of something like the Hyatt in San Diego. It's not just because that's the large group hotel that's attractive to us, it's because it's a great hotel in a great location that can both benefit from group business, but can also benefit from transient business and general business transient business -- I meant leisure business, the business transient. If you look at the hotels that I think of that are core in our portfolio would be the 2 big ones in San Diego. It would be the Marquis in New York and the Marquis in San Francisco. Those are assets that are big hotels. They do a lot of group, but they're just in great locations that benefit from everything the city has to offer. So as we look at other hotels around the country, we're -- the large hotel, we are particularly competitive for those because of our scale. So we would -- and I also think from an asset management perspective, we have unique insight because of what we own into how to improve the operations of those hotels. So if the hotel needs the parameters sizes described, we would be interested in taking a look at it.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just a last question. I might have 2 parts to it. But more broadly, are you maybe disappointed with the pace of improvement in rate and margins in the business overall? Not necessarily just host, but maybe with more the industry? Because I guess I'm going -- many of the urban centers are running at or above prior peak occupancy group and negotiated rate business volumes seemed to be up nicely. But we don't seem to see the rate driven growth that typically accompanies that compression. And I guess I'm curious why you think that is and maybe do you just feel revenue managers in the hotels need maybe sort of a booster shot of confidence to push rate?","W. Edward Walter","I think part of the -- I mean, certainly at some markets, we've seen very significant rate growth jump. But I think if you look more broadly across the industry, part of the issue is that the level, the decline in terms of occupancy, that was created a low floor on which to grow. And I also think that the reduction in group during the last downturn was -- really played a significant role in the ability to ultimately drive rate. Not when you look at the last downturn as we've described before, at least, in our portfolio, the decline in group and transient was the same. Both of them were down about 9% in room nights. And in this cycle, we were off about -- compared to those '07, about 4% in transient room nights and closer to 18% in group. And not only is that just significant in the absolute level of the recovery, but when it comes to driving pricing, having that group business on the books, as you know, that gives the GM and the revenue manager a sense of confidence about an ability to drive rate. And that's probably one of the reasons why these last few quarters, we've been maybe more focused and more excited about what we've been seeing on the group side. Because when you play this out over the next couple of years in our hotels, when you combine almost back to the prior peak occupancy levels, we started the year a couple of points short of that. It'll be interesting to see if we don't surpass that by the end of the year. As we start to get back to those levels and more in those rooms that are booked in advance which then leads to a better revenue strategy for the individual hotel on the transient side, I think you'll see that pricing that you were expecting but you're disappointed not to have seen. I think because this was a transient-led recovery until just lately, you unfortunately are finding that because so many of those rooms are booked so close to the actual date of use that it's just been difficult for the properties to push rate as aggressively as you would like.","Jeffrey J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just last question, and I'll yield the floor. So I'm curious now with group those seemingly, they continue to build in the right direction and transient like you said has been very strong, I'm curious, when you take an early look at like 2013, as long as the economy holds in there, would you hope or expect it might look a little bit like it does right now? So about 4% to 6%, 5% to 7% growth could be sustained?","W. Edward Walter","I want to hesitate to predict '13 at this point. But I would say that at the end of the day, if economic growth is forecasted to be better in '13, I think that it is in '12, and I don't. What we see when we look across our market is that supply should not be increasing in '13. So if this year plays out the way we expect, we continue to see the growth and trends that we're seeing. And you have a good solid economic year next year combined with low supply growth. I suspect that what we'll find is -- I think RevPAR growth next year could be good, and I would be guessing that we'd start to see a lot more of RevPAR being driven by rate and by mix shift as opposed to necessarily by continued improvements and occupancy, but we will still see those because they're really still room for more appropriate on the occupancy side.","Operator","It looks like that's all the time we have for questions. I'll turn things back over to Mr. Ed Walter for any concluding or closing comments you may have.","W. Edward Walter","Well thank you, everybody, for joining us on this call today.

Good day and welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts, Incorporated Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal securities laws. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we are not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA, and comparable hotel results. You can find this information, together with reconciliation, to the most directly comparable GAAP information, in today's earning's press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","This morning, Jim Risoleo, our President and Chief Executive Officer, will provide an overview of our second quarter results, and provide our outlook for 2017. Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by markets, discuss margins, and the balance sheet. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Gee. And thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We are very pleased to report solid second quarter results, which beat our internal expectations on both the top and bottom line. Once again, we materially out-performed industry upper upscale results by over 100 basis points. As a result of our continued strong performance we are raising the midpoint of our guidance for the year across the board. We now anticipate 2017 comparable hotel RevPAR to range between 1% and 1.75%, which is a 38 basis point increase to the midpoint of our prior guidance.","We also had increased the midpoint of our prior margin guidance by 25 basis points, and now forecast corresponding margin change of minus 15 basis points to plus 15 basis points. I continue to be impressed by our ability to drive this type of margin improvement, particularly given this level of RevPAR growth. This is a testament to the scale and information benefits of our portfolio, driven primarily by our new enterprise analytics team.","As a result of these adjustments, we now anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to range between $1.46 billion and $1.495 billion. This translates to a $20 million increase to the midpoint of our prior guidance. Similarly, our adjusted FFO per share is now projected to range between $1.64 and $1.68, a $0.02 increase from our prior midpoint.","The cadence of the year is playing out as we anticipated, and as we discussed on our first quarter call. As expected, the strength we witnessed in the first quarter was somewhat offset in the second quarter, due to the Easter holiday shift. Looking forward, that same holiday shift dynamic remains, with the Jewish holidays moving back from October to September. This will negatively impact the third quarter, but positively impact the fourth quarter, which we believe will be strong, and second only to our first quarter in terms of RevPAR performance. This is consistent with our prior and current commentary, and is the basis for our forecast.","Macro-economic forecasts remain relatively unchanged from the last time we spoke, and appears supportive to overall economic and industry growth. The key statistics we follow closely, corporate profits and business investment, remain significantly above 2016 levels, and have historically been a strong leading indicator of future RevPAR growth. In addition, employment remains strong, consumer sentiment is high, industrial production is rebounding, stock markets are at or near all-time highs, and the recent decline in the U.S. dollar appears to be shifting from a recent headwind to a tailwind, particularly as it relates to increases in international arrivals.","We have yet to see the clear impact of these positive factors on our business. However, we continue to be cautiously optimistic that the stage is set for economic expansion. Offsetting that is a general uncertainty with respect to government policy, and economic initiatives, which may be putting a slight damper on corporate outlooks, and business travel.","Moving to capital allocation, we continue to selectively prune what we believe to be the most geographically diversified portfolio of iconic and irreplaceable hotels in the sector. As mentioned in our press release, the sale of the Hilton Melbourne South Wharf is imminent. The hotel is expected to be sold for $182 million, and ends our investment activity in Australia and New Zealand. In addition, we remain committed to reducing our exposure to non-core assets requiring higher capital expenditures, and in locations where lower growth is expected, assuming we can pursue asset sales at attractive pricing.","As noted in our press release, we have accounted for one additional unidentified disposition in our guidance, which we would categorize as non-core, and which we expect to close late in the third quarter.","On the acquisition front, we remain disciplined in allocating capital to new investments. While we have evaluated several investment opportunities, the pricing has not met our rigorous underwriting requirements. Our 2017 guidance does not contemplate any additional acquisitions from what we have already disclosed, this year. However, we will continue to source opportunities and sell assets, where we believe we can add value and enhance NAV per share.","Our industry leading balance sheet has never been in better shape, with leverage at 2.4 times, as determined under our credit facility. As of quarter-end, we have nearly $650 million of cash, and over $775 million of capacity under our credit facility. Depending on the economic conditions and opportunities that present themselves, this investment capacity provides us the ability to effectively allocate capital, and drive stockholder value in a number of ways. We can seek to increase earnings through disciplined external growth; judicious capital investment in our portfolio; opportune repurchases of stock under our existing $500 million buyback authorization; and returning capital to stockholders through payment of a special dividend.","We believe this flexibility to pursue a variety of outcomes sets Host apart from our peers.","One of the places where we have allocated capital, and will continue to do so, is within our existing portfolio. This is evident in the results of our non-comp hotels, where RevPAR for the quarter was up nearly 11%, building on the momentum we witnessed at these assets in the first quarter.","While this performance is not reflected in our full year RevPAR guidance, these assets are contributing significantly to our EBITDA, and represent another lever that we can pull in our diversified portfolio to successfully allocate capital.","Looking at CapEx for the full year, we expect to spend $275 million to $290 million on renewal and replacement capital expenditures, and $100 million to $110 million on redevelopment and ROI projects.","Let me now discuss our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $444 million, reflecting an increase of 1.8% and exceeding consensus estimates. Second quarter FFO per diluted share was $0.49, also exceeding consensus estimates. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was at $811 million, and FFO per diluted share was $0.94. These results were driven by several factors. While we expected to see some disruption from the Easter holiday shift, Group average rate exceeded our expectations and Transient demand was better than expected.","As a result, on a constant currency basis, our comparable RevPAR improved 1.7% in the second quarter to nearly $194, driven by an 80 basis point increase in average room rate. Better than expected demand resulted in occupancy improvement of 70 basis points, to 83.2%. Our domestic comparable properties had RevPAR growth of 1.8%, with a 10 basis point delta between total and domestic comparable RevPAR growth, a result of the tough comp at our properties in Rio de Janeiro, which benefited from pre-Olympic activity last year.","Comparable hotel revenues were luckily flat for the quarter, and up 1.4% so far this year. I am pleased to report that comparable EBITDA margin grew 15 basis points in the second quarter, and 45 basis points year-to-date. Greg will elaborate on where that margin improvement is specifically coming from.","Starting with our Transient segment, the Easter and Passover holiday shift into April, coupled with spring break travel, boosted Leisure demand for the month by 3.5%. May and June demand grew a combined 1.3% for an overall quarterly demand increase of 2%. Transient rate for the quarter increased 1%, driven by a nearly 2% rate increase in the month of May.","Our strong book of Group business allowed us to drive Transient rates. Overall, the favorable demand and rate results led to a 3.1% increase in Transient revenue for the quarter. We continue to be impressed with our Transient business, particularly Leisure, which remains strong and buoyed by high customer sentiment, lower oil prices, and strong employment.","As expected, our Group results for the quarter were also impacted by the holiday shift, as Group revenue decreased 2.7% for the second quarter, notably impacted by demand declining more than 8% in the month of April. Specifically, a result of the holiday shift from March into April. While we expect Group to continue to be impacted in the third quarter as a result of the Jewish holiday shift, these strands have been incorporated into the revised guidance we presented this morning.","Let me spend a few minutes discussing our Group outlook. We have over 90% of our Group revenues on the books for 2017, and continue to see the Group booking window extend. With nearly all of our Group business on the books, combined with record occupancies at our properties, and Transient demand strength, there isn't that much additional capacity remaining for groups to book for 2017. This means that groups are looking out to 2018 and beyond, which is a great trend that helps our managers shore up their business, shrink the hotel, and drive future Transient pricing. In fact, we were encouraged by strong booking activity for 2019 and beyond during the quarter. Combined with solid 2018 Group revenue pace, our outlook for Group business remains positive.","One additional item I'd like to address is a question which has been raised regarding a decelerating second half for our business. Please keep in mind that two one-time events, both in the first quarter and the third quarter, caused a little noise when looking at our guidance. As you know, in January we benefited from the Inauguration and the Women's March. Business we were thrilled to have, but which skewed first half results higher. As we look to the second half, it is important to remember that we expect to be impacted by the difficult comps in Brazil, due to last year's Olympics in the third quarter. When you smooth out those two events, our forecast does account for a slight deceleration in the second half, but not nearly as much as the forecast would suggest.","Looking at the remainder of the year, we remain cautiously optimistic and confident in the raised guidance we put out last evening, and would describe our outlook as, steady as she goes.","Before I turn things over to Greg, I would sum up by saying, that our geographically diversified portfolio of iconic assets continues to drive positive results, as illustrated by our performance and our upward revision to 2017 guidance. We continue our strategy of utilizing our portfolio scale and access to information to identify and generate opportunities, both internally and externally, that we expect to produce strong returns for our investors.","Finally, we continue to benefit from our disciplined capital allocation decisions, and maintain the flexibility to create value in numerous ways, due to our strong balance sheet.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. We continue to be pleased with our RevPAR and EBITDA margin growth, as our results exceeded our expectations again this quarter, allowing us to raise both our RevPAR and margin guidance. Now, I will provide an overview of some of the markets.","Our hotels in Seattle outperformed our expectation in the rest of the portfolio, with an 18.7% RevPAR increase, which was over a 1,000 basis points above the STR upper-upscale market results of 8.1%. The impressive results were driven by both occupancy and average rate increases of 5.2 percentage point, and 11.8%, respectively.","Our Seattle hotels benefited from a strong city-wide calendar, displacement from a competitor's room renovation, and tailwinds resulting from the W Seattle renovations last year.","Strong Transient Retail and Special Corporate business, coupled with solid Group business, helped our managers drive Transient ADR, which was up 14.1%.","We continue to witness strength in Phoenix, where RevPAR at our hotels grew 11.8% in the quarter, driven by a 6.6 percentage point increase in occupancy, and a 2.1% growth in average rate, more than tripling the STR upper-upscale market results of 3.6%. This was the result of the combination of strong Transient and Group business during this quarter. Specifically, Transient revenues increased 17%, while Group revenues grew 5.2%.","In addition, the continual ramp-up of the strategic 2015 redevelopment and franchising of The Camby Hotel benefited our Phoenix results in the first half of this year.","Despite the excessive lack of city-wides this quarter, our hotels in Denver grew RevPAR a significant 8.8%, driven primarily by a 7.6 percentage point increase in occupancy, mainly from Transient demand, which increased almost 23%. The RevPAR increase exceeded the STR upper-upscale results by 520 basis points.","In addition, our managers strategically targeted short-term Group business, which enabled the hotels to increase Food and Beverage revenues by almost 15% in the quarter.","Our Boston properties also amazingly outperformed our portfolio this quarter, with RevPAR growth of 8%, 380 basis points in excess of the STR upper-upscale results for the market, and better than we had we'd have anticipated. Occupancy increased 3.2 percentage points, and average rate grew 4.1%.","Two additional city-wides helped to compress the city and drive incremental ADR growth. Once again, Transient revenues were strong, with a 16.7% increase. We expect continued strength in Boston, as several companies are moving into the area or expanding. Although much of this activity is in the Seaport district, we do anticipate the overall market will benefit.","Hawaii RevPARs were 5.7%, beating STR upper-upscale market results by 110 basis points. Resorts destinations, such as Hawaii, benefited from stronger Leisure business, related to the Easter holiday shift. Average rate for the overall market at our hotels was up 7.3%, which was offset slightly by an occupancy decline of 1.4 percentage points. However, our resorts in Maui were even stronger, and saw a 15% increase in Transient average rates, as they benefited from pricing strategies that replaced lower rated Group business, with higher rated Leisure customers.","The Maui properties are also benefiting from the anemic supply growth on the island, and the low national supply growth at resort properties overall.","Shifting gears to some of more challenged markets, RevPAR at our hotels in Houston declined 12.7% mainly driven by challenges in the Group segment. These included two fewer city-wides this year, and lower than expected attendance at one large event in Houston this quarter.","Our hotels in Houston will likely continue to under-perform the portfolio, as additional supply continue to negatively impact the market, especially on the weekend. However, it remains worth noting that Houston represents only 2% of our total EBITDA.","In Atlanta, the RevPAR decrease of 3% in the second quarter was driven by a reduction in occupancy of 1.7 percentage points, and a drop of almost 1% in average rate. Both Transient and Group business were negatively impacted by the Easter holiday shift, and renovations at the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead hotel.","In San Francisco, RevPAR declined 2.8% in the second quarter, largely due to the anticipated, and well-documented, closure of the Moscone Convention Center. However, our hotels outperformed the STR upper-upscale market results by 280 basis points. Going forward, we anticipate hotels in San Francisco will continue to struggle as the Moscone Convention Center is scheduled to be completely closed in the third quarter, negatively impacting all hotels in the Bay area. However, keep in mind, that once the expansion project at the convention center is completed in 2018, we expect city-wides to return to San Francisco, and business to positively follow through in a meaningful way in 2019.","For our Domestic hotels in the second half of the year, we expect Phoenix, Los Angeles, Boston, and Hawaii to out-perform the portfolio, and Houston, New York, San Diego, and Denver to under-perform the portfolio.","Moving to International operations. Our consolidated International hotels second quarter RevPAR decreased 3.1% in constant currency. As expected, the story of these two countries continues. Out-performance in Canada, and under-performance in Brazil. RevPAR in our hotels in Canada grew 11.5%, but was offset by a RevPAR decline of 14.6% at our Latin America hotels. Specifically, the business leading up to the Olympics in Rio last year provided for difficult comp at our Brazilian hotels. We expect these difficult comps to continue into the summer, and estimate that it will impact our total portfolio RevPAR results by 100 basis points in the third quarter.","Another bright international note is the performance of the hotels in our European joint venture, which showed encouraging signs of improvement in the quarter. The portfolio continued to show signs of recovery, and is benefiting from accelerating economic growth across the continent. Many other countries where we own assets, such as Belgium, France, Germany, and Spain have increased GDP forecasts since our last call. RevPAR for the 10 hotels in the portfolio improved 8.2% in constant euros, with occupancy growth of 4.3 percentage points, and average rate increase of 2.7%. This performance was driven by strong Transient and Group business at several properties. For the full year, we expect RevPAR growth at these hotels will continue to out-pace our comparable historic result.","We remain impressed by the efforts of our managers, and asset managers, as they continue to do a phenomenal job in bringing more profit to the bottom line. We increased margins by 15 basis points with a RevPAR increase of 1.7%. And on a year-to-date basis, we have increased margins by 45 basis points, on a RevPAR increase of 2.5%. These are impressive results in an environment with rising labor costs.","Broadly speaking, our margin out performance can be broken down into three categories. First, we attribute about half of the performance to productivity gains. As we described on previous calls, a large portion of the productivity improvement is related to time and motion studies conducted by third party consultants at our hotels. We still have a portion of the portfolio where we have yet to complete such studies, so we anticipate continued benefits from this until at least next year.","We are also pursuing other initiatives to drive productivity improvement. These include continued expansion of Marriott's Green Choice program, which allows customers to forego housekeeping service in exchange for loyalty points. We have also implemented a room technology solution at many of our hotels, which facilitates more efficient deployment of housekeeping labor.","Our operational initiatives are also delivering out-performance. One example includes recently outsourcing four Starbucks operations. These were high revenue, but low profit operations, so converting them to rental income stream benefits overall margin. We have also continued efforts to restructure in-room dining operations. We now have 26 hotels in our portfolio with some form of modified, or completely eliminated in-room dining, in favor of packaged food, pick-up, or delivery.","Other smaller targeted initiatives consist of reviewing maintenance and service contracts, or food procurement practices.","Finally, further out-performance was achieved from plus inflationary growth in operating expenses not allocated to specific departments, such as administrative and general expenses, sales and marketing, and utilities. Higher purchasing card rebates, and savings in training, recruitment, and travel helped reduce A&G expenses. Savings in sales expense, through more targeted media and e-commerce spending, and reduced Group concessions held down sales and marketing expenses.","We also continue to benefit from ROI projects, such as high-efficiency central plant equipment replacement, LED lighting retrofit, and solar panel installations, which drove continued savings in utilities.","Going forward, we continue to execute on productivity improvements through our time and motion studies at our medium and small hotels. We also expect to garner cost savings from the Marriott-Starwood merger through lower OTA commissions, and better procurement costs, both of which should continue to drive future margin improvement. With the benefits of two quarters behind us, and with these productivity savings in mind, we have increased the midpoint of our margin guidance by 25 basis points this quarter, and 40 basis points since our initial guidance in February.","In July, we paid a regular first quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 4.5% on our current stock price. We continue to operate from a position of financial strength and flexibility, and believe we have one of the best balance sheets in the lodging REIT and overall, REIT space.","Importantly, these key competitive and strategic advantage enhances our ability to sustain the dividend throughout the lodging cycle, while also allowing us to invest when accretive opportunities arise to either buy assets, buyback stock or reinvest in high-yielding value-add projects.","During the quarter, we meaningfully extended the maturity of our revolver, and one of our two term loans, and lowered the interest rate margin on the term loan. This transaction demonstrates our ability to take advantage of our strong investment grade balance sheet, and our financial flexibility to opportunistically manage our maturity schedule, while remaining within our target leverage range.","As Jim mentioned, we ended the second quarter with approximately $644 million of cash, and $775 million of available capacities remaining under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Today, our leverage ratio is 2.4 times, as calculated under the terms of our credit facility.","As Jim noted in his remarks, we are excited to have reached the first half in an even better position than we anticipated. We have therefore increased the midpoint of our RevPAR and margin guidance for the year.","Finally, I'm going to urge you to keep the impact of the holiday shift and the tough comps related to the Olympics in Brazil last year in mind, as third quarter results are anticipated to be weaker than the first half of the year, with a rebound expected in the fourth quarter. Looking specifically to the third quarter, we expect 21% of our total EBITDA for 2017 will be generated in the current quarter.","Overall, we are pleased with our strong results today, particularly with the improving possibility of our assets in what continues to be a competitive market, and lower growth environment.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many of you as possible, please limit yourself to one question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And we'll go first to Barclays with Anthony Powell.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning. You mentioned the strength of Leisure demand several times in your prepared remarks. Looking back, have you seen prior examples where Leisure out-performed business transient for an extended period of time? And how long do you think this dichotomy could last?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","It's a good question, Anthony. I think that we're very, very pleased with the book of business we're seeing from the leisure traveler. So long as consumer confidence remains strong, and unemployment remains low, and people feel good about their wallet and their balance sheet, we expect to see the leisure traveler continuing to spend money. We see no slowdown. If anything, we're seeing acceleration. So, we like nothing better than to see the business traveler return and put us in a better position to yield rates in an even more aggressive manner at the hotel.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thanks. And as a follow-up, I think in the past you said Leisure made up about 30% of your overall room night mix. Has that mix changed in recent years?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","No. It's about the same.","Anthony Powell - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Great. That's it from me. Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Sure. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next we'll go to Shaun Kelley of Bank of America.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Greg, you mentioned some detail around the margins, and I think in the last part of the prepared remarks that you kind of see some benefits on the \u2013 from the Marriott-Starwood merger and integration. Do you think both in the performance that we saw this quarter, and possibly then on the RevPAR side, you're seeing any of that benefit sort of real time? Or do you think more of the opportunity from the merger is slated to come in the months and years ahead?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. I think \u2013 look, we're benefiting, obviously, from quite a few of the things I mentioned this year, the time motion study, the energy ROI project, the Green Choice program, et cetera, but I think the benefit that will accrue to us from the Starwood-Marriott merger, really that's going to happen later. Either late this year, or really into 2018 and 2019 as well.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And I guess, as we think about sort of the broader overall mix, and we look at the portfolio, it feels like this quarter we saw a demonstrable out-performance in some of the kind of non-top five or top ten cities. You know places like Denver, Phoenix, I guess even Seattle, as we head forward, A, do you think that pattern is likely to continue? And B, what's your plans for how you view your portfolio right now in terms of \u2013 I think over time, people probably try to prune and get out of some of those, the kind of \u2013 let's call it, non-top 10 markets, what's Host view towards those top 10 or 15 markets versus your overall diversification?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Shaun, that's a really good question. I think that we are very comfortable with the geographic diversity that we have in the portfolio today. I've mentioned in the past that we're very open-minded to looking beyond the top 10 to 12 markets that we had invested in, and in fact, while the Phoenician in and of itself is non-comp right now because of a renovation plan that we have ongoing, that asset is in Phoenix, that is a good example of the type of property that we'll be looking for, a large asset with scale, and an asset where we can add a lot of value. So I don't think that you will see us exiting those markets for the sake of exiting them. I think I'd go back to the comments that I made earlier. If we have a non-core hotel that is situated in a market that's under \u2013 that is likely to under-perform the rest of the portfolio over time, and is in need of a lot of capital outside of the reserve, those are the types of assets that we'll continue to prune.","Shaun C. Kelley - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks very much.","Operator","And we'll go next to Rich Hightower from Evercore.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Rich.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","So let's \u2013 I want to break down the back half guidance a little bit. So it really does sound like Brazil, combined with the holiday shifts, were throwing a wrench into the third quarter, certainly vis-\u00e0-vis the fourth quarter if not the first half, as well. I'm just trying to get a sense of \u2013 and I appreciate the color you guys give on the contribution of EBITDA, relative to the full year, and so we can sort of back into some numbers that way. But what is the breakdown between RevPAR and margins in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, if you don't mind? And if we go negative, how negative could it be in the third quarter?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Rich. This is Greg. Hey, look, I clearly agree with almost everything you just said there. Clearly we are, as we mentioned in Jim's comments, impacted in a positive way because of the Inauguration and the Women's March in the first half of the year, and my comments \u2013 as I mentioned in my comments, Brazil, even though we only own two small hotels and the JW down in Brazil, those three hotels will impact our RevPAR by 100 basis points just in the third quarter. So there is some noise, as we've all talked about. I think the other thing I would add that sort of impacts first half, second half, is we have two hotels that just became comped this year, the Camby hotel and the Logan hotel, and those two hotels are really ramping up in a meaningful way this year. Clearly had strong RevPAR growth year-to-date. Those hotels are going to perform more in line with our portfolio on the second half of the year. So that's one additional item that sort of skews first half, versus second half. But, Rich, as you know, we don't give third quarter guidance here, I do try to help you out by telling you how much EBITDA, but look, I think, when I look at the shift of the Jewish holiday, and think about, you know, 100 basis point impact from Brazil, we should think that clearly, for us, I think RevPAR is going to be negative in the third quarter. And then as Jim mentioned, it rebounds in a strong manner in the fourth quarter.","Richard Allen Hightower - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's very helpful, Greg. Thanks. And then just one quick question on some of the quarterly results from 2Q. As I kind of look at Host's performance versus the STR MSA tracks that most of us get on a weekly basis, you did out-perform in several of those markets. I'm curious though, if you take markets like San Francisco, D.C., maybe Boston as well, how your CBD assets did relative to maybe some of the suburban assets in those markets? Just given some of the particulars last quarter?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Rich. You know San Francisco might be the best example of what you just described. In total, all right our RevPAR declined 2.8% compared to the STR data, which is down 5%, 6%, obviously great out-performance. But when you look at our big hotels, the Moscone Center, it was down about 2.8%, so similar performance as some of our more, I guess, suburban properties around San Francisco. Yeah, I think, the one thing that really helped us in San Francisco is that our revenue manager, our asset managers, and our manager, we identify this quarter and this year as being, obviously it was going to be a weak year in San Francisco. And so because of that, they really focused on booking in-house Group business, which really, I think, helped us in the quarter. They also booked some, what I would say, high rated contract business, which also helps us out in the quarter. So with the benefit of hindsight, sitting here today, I think that was a great strategy and really helped our results. In fact, frankly, if you look at, sort of the branded hotels in the area around the San Francisco, Moscone property, frankly, most of those hotels were down double-digits in RevPAR.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","And Rich, I'll give you just a little bit of color on Washington, D.C., looking at suburban versus CBD hotels. So we continue to be very focused on driving performance at every property in the portfolio, and a good example of that, I think, is the Westfield's Marriott, which is not in the central core of Washington, D.C., but we had strong in-house Group performance in that property in particular. And our RevPAR for that hotel exceeded our previous forecast, as once we had the Group on the books, we were able to yield a stronger Transient business in the property, as well.","<: That's great color, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Up next, we turn to Thomas Allen from Morgan Stanley.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning. So just on the EBITDA revisions, or the 2017 guidance revisions, how much of \u2013 so what would have been the \u2013 what's the impact from the additional property sale that you're assuming? And I'm assuming that's not the Melbourne sale that you had already anticipated last earnings, right?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","That's correct, Thomas. The undisclosed disposition that we referenced in the press release and our remarks, will have an effect \u2013 a negative effect of about $2.5 million, roughly, for the balance of the year.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Which is in our guidance.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yes. Of course it's in our guidance. And so the $20 million would have been closer to $23 million.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Perfect. And then I think there's been some concern in the market, just that if you looked at the STR data, June RevPAR decelerated from May despite it should have gotten the benefit from the July 4 shift. Did you feel like there was any kind of change in demand trends in June versus the prior quarter \u2013 or prior months and quarters? Thanks.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","No, we did not, Thomas. Actually, we had a pretty good June. I'm not going to give you specific RevPAR numbers, but we're really comfortable with how June performed.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I guess July, also?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, July, and look, obviously we're still in July, but so far July has been pretty decent as well, compared to our internal forecast.","Thomas G. Allen - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Bellisario with Robert W. Baird.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Michael.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","First question just on acquisitions. Jim, how far off do you think you are on pricing? And then maybe from your seat with your investment history and acquisitions history, are you seeing others underwriting differently than you are? Or do you think it's just simply a cost of capital difference that you guys have versus your competitors out there today?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, I don't think it's necessarily a cost of capital difference, Michael. I think that as we're looking at investment opportunities today, I think, first and foremost, we don't think it's time to be a buyer of any commodity type of asset, so we are focused at this point in the cycle, on unique hotels that I would categorize as iconic and would fall into that section of the assets that we own today. We are taking into consideration the growth environment that we're operating in as we're underwriting hotels, and as we've talked before, we take into account a full 10 year capital plan, and look to solve for an un-leveraged IRR on a 10 year basis that is at least 100 basis points in excess of our cost of capital, if not higher, depending on the facts and circumstances of the particular deal.","So we have not \u2013 I wouldn't say that we're wildly off underwriting expectations, pricing the expectations of buyers today, but I would say that given the attractiveness of the debt markets, and the availability of debt capital, both from a pricing perspective and proceeds perspective, there has to be a real reason for an owner of an asset to want to sell today. So they become indifferent to a refinancing unless they can really achieve a valuation that excites them. And I think that is what's happening in the markets today.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Got it. And then just one other question on Group. Can you maybe provide some metrics on the in-the-quarter bookings for all future periods? Did you see that pace tick up or down in the second quarter?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, it depends on how you define all future periods. When we look from bookings sort of in the quarter, or for this year, but for 2018, 2019, and beyond, the bookings were actually stronger. Bookings in the year, for the year, as we expected, and as we talked about last quarter, were as expected, a little bit weaker.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. I would \u2013 I would \u2013 you know, 2018 specifically, Michael, we are ahead of Group pace in 2018, relative to where we were this time last year for 2017. So we feel pretty good about what's happening with Group in 2018, as we look at the numbers today.","Michael J. Bellisario - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Meliker of Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Hey, Jim, I guess just one for you. You've now been in the big seat for six months, obviously been with the company a lot longer, but I'm just wondering if there's anything that you've learned over the past six months that's surprised you, or has caused you to rethink some ideas you had coming into the seat?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Boy, I'd say, if anything, Ryan, I've come to appreciate better what a great company Host is. When I sit back and look at the attributes of Host Hotels & Resorts, and I look at the geographically diverse portfolio that we have, which I think is unmatched by anyone else in the industry, the scale that we have, the access to information, and the ability to utilize that information to be effective on asset management, and effective on the acquisition side, and then the balance sheet that we have never been in better shape. I'm really excited about where we sit, and I think that the results that we had for this quarter, and the fact that we were able to beat consensus and raise estimates is a testament to everything that I just referred to in many ways.","So, no surprises. Excitement, and looking at ways to move the company forward as we think about where we are in the cycle, and what the next leg might be.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it, Jim. And then as we think about going forward, as we move through the cycle, and what the next leg may be, coupled with the balance sheet that you just mentioned that's obviously in great position, where do you see Host, you know, call it five years from now? Is Host going to be a lot bigger? Are you going to continue to prune \u2013 prune the portfolio and one-off transactions, similar to what you've been doing this year? Do you see M&A on the horizon? How are you thinking about the portfolio on a go forward basis?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, you know, it's difficult to answer that question in a vacuum because it's so dependent upon what happens in the economy, and whether or not we see a re-acceleration of economic growth depending on what comes out of Washington, and general economic trends. So the thought that I have is, I want to make certain that Host is the best performing REIT in the space. And the actions we take will be with an eye towards increasing our performance, increasing our margin performance, and out-performing as we look to the future.","Ryan Meliker - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And from Deutsche Bank, we'll go next to Chris Woronka.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Morning, Chris.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Morning. I wanted to ask you about your Hyatt Hotels. I think you have about nine of them, and I know they're going through kind of a contract re-negotiation of sorts with a couple of the OTAs. What are \u2013 do you \u2013 is there any embedded \u2013 do you think there's \u2013 that's going to create any kind of friction for you temporarily in the third quarter? And I think they've sent the owners some communications about their plans, but I mean, do you see that as a potential source of surprise for you?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","You know, Chris, I'm going to be careful with how I answer this question, because we've been in close communication with Hyatt, and as you might imagine, we are among the many owners in the industry that advocate for lower distribution costs. And I feel that over time Hyatt's strategy will achieve this result for us, and really that's about all I want to say on this subject.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Also, I want to ask you on the \u2013 I know on the non-comparable hotel guidance, I think that is up $9 million or so at the midpoint versus prior. I guess the question is kind of, how much visibility do you have on that? And then, looking out to next year, maybe, Greg, can you explain to us how the comps suddenly change next year?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah. So, I mean, Chris, as you mentioned, I mean, obviously we've been very pleased with our non-comp and our comp results so far this year. In fact, if you look at year-to-date, our non-comp is up north of 13% in RevPAR growth. So I would expect when I look at the non-comp assets that are in the group, Denver Tech, the Hyatt in San Francisco, which is actually up over 20% in the quarter in RevPAR, you know the Marriott Marquis in San Diego, Axiom, and our two new acquisitions, The Don and W; I would expect all those hotels to continue to have decent results in the second half of this year.","As far as which assets will fall out? I think, the Marriott Marquis, I think becomes comp next year. But \u2013 and I know the Axiom becomes comp next year. Beyond that, really what we always try to do is have a full year sort of what we would consider normalized results, before we put it into comp. So, it's hard for me, sitting her today, knowing fairly exactly what will be non-comp next year.","Chris J. Woronka - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Very good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Up next, we'll go to Smedes Rose of Citigroup.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask you how you're thinking about your position in New York? We've just sort of heard anecdotally that buyers are perhaps more interested in the market now, given that the pace of new supply is likely to start declining. Do you think that's accurate? And maybe, just in terms of the overall portfolio re-positioning, are you interested in selling a property or more here?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Smedes, I think you are starting to see some interest in New York. There's a lot of noise in background here. The city has undertaken an initiative with respect to Midtown East rezoning, which will likely be approved and signed into law in \u2013 later in August through September of this year. I think that that could potentially open up opportunities for re-purposing of certain hotels today to office\/residential. So, we \u2013 as you know, we have a number of properties in Midtown, we're looking at a number of the assets. We've had conversations with different prospective purchasers. I would not say today that we're close to a deal, but it is something that's at the top of our list.","Smedes Rose - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you. That was it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Patrick Scholes, SunTrust.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. My question is on your expectations for the fourth quarter. Certainly you know October has a very easy Group comp, but what do you think about the strength or weakness of Group business in November and December? Thank you.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Patrick. As you probably already know, since you're a specialist on forecasting future RevPAR, you know November...","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's not bad. (52:28).","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","You know, I think November, surprisingly, even though it's a difficult time, November looks pretty decent right now. And, as Jim said in his prepared remarks, we expect a real rebound in the fourth quarter. Now having said that, we think it's probably, it's a decent quarter, but it's probably our second best quarter of the year.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Now, let me \u2013 let me \u2013 let me quiz you a little bit more here. I completely agree with you on November. This is interesting because a year ago, November, sort of a surprised to the upside. November, I would say, is one of the harder back half comps. Why do you think November looks decent for groups? And, I relate that to, when I go back and look at Smith Travel results around the election, it doesn't look like there is a terrible easy comp. I mean, group was up 15% or 17% the week after the election. I mean, what do you think might me going on for another good November here?","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","I mean, Pat, it's a great question. If you remember, you know, November of last year was really the first year that we, and I think the industry in total, actually we all feed our internal forecast after experiencing about a year, a year and a half of always sort of coming up short on internal forecast, November was a very strong month. December was a strong month, and obviously for us, the first quarter and strong quarter were both strong months, and first quarter is strong quarter, and second quarter is strong as well. So, it's a good question. Look, all I know, I don't know if I have a specific answer, but what I can tell when I look at our group booking pace in the second quarter, especially in November and December, looks real decent sitting here today.","Patrick Scholes - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the comment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Crow of Raymond James.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Good morning, Bill.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question is going back to something you said earlier about the potential savings from Starwood Marriott merger. I'm just curious, you referenced slower OTA commissions. What is the average commission, OTA commission you're paying today, and if we had to take a guess, how many basis points could we see that decline over the next year or two years?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Yeah, Bill, I think, that, you know, when we look at our sort of Starwood legacy hotels and look at the contract that they had versus Marriott. You know, I think, once those contracts are fully negotiated, you know, my guess is, we save a point or two points, which is, you know, obviously material. I mean, the other \u2013 so the \u2013 but the other thing that we're hoping for obviously, Marriott as a larger company going forward, I mean, I'm speculating now, but I'm hoping as a bigger company, they have more leverage in the future on negotiations as well.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then, the follow-up was on Europe, just with the weaker dollar here in the back half of the year. I'm just curious whether that has had an impact on your forecast for the balance of the year and whether you are contemplating now that you've kind of cleaned up Australia, whether you looked at Europe as a potential area for capital recycling?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Great question, Bill. I would say with respect to inbound international travel, it's probably neutral to up a bit. We are happy from our perspective to see the dollar weaken a bit because we do think we'll see more inbound travelers.","With respect to Europe generally, as you know, Europe contributes roughly 2.5% of our EBITDA on an annual basis, and we are invested through a joint venture with two really terrific partners, the Government of Singapore, and APG, and it's been a great relationship. We've been in the Euro JV since 2006.","That said, we are evaluating the way forward in Europe, and a couple things can cause one to stop and think, well, cost of capital in Europe is \u2013 appears to be much more aggressive than it is in the U.S. So, frankly, it makes it more difficult for us to compete. And we start with that premise, and we'll take it from there.","William A. Crow - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. That's it from me. Thank you.","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Thanks, Bill.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Donnelly of Wells Fargo.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Just first I want to ask a follow-up on Moscone. The Group booking contribution from Moscone is just marginally better in 2018 than it was in 2017, so I'm just curious, I know it's early, but is it your sense that San Francisco could commence a recovery in RevPAR as early as next year? Or is your sense that 2018 could be more of another year of, call it, transition, before we really get into that period of 2019 and 2020, where the Moscone bookings are quite strong?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Jeff, I would \u2013 I would agree with the latter comment that you made. I think that as we look at city-wide events in San Francisco for 2018, it is not as strong as 2017 or 2016. We really start to see Group room nights come back on the books in 2019. 2019 is the year when we're likely to see performance levels in total Group room nights of 2016.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then \u2013 and then, just another question on the expense growth. I mean, it's been pretty low this year. Can you maybe talk about how much longevity you feel there is to holding expense growth low? Is that going to be isolated to 2017, and pretty persistent to 2018, if you think RevPAR, you know, kind of remains around this 1% to 2% level? And I guess, maybe a second part to that. We had estimated some of the synergies that you guys might face from the Marriott Starwood combination to ultimately approach call it 50 basis points to 100 basis points cumulative on margins over the next few years. Do you think that's a reasonable estimate of the tailwind you could get from Marriott Starwood?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Jeff, to answer your first question is it sustainable? We're working really hard at making it sustainable. As we mentioned, we have completed time and motion studies at a number of the hotels in the portfolio. We're continuing to roll those studies out throughout the portfolio to improve productivity and improve margin on a regular basis. So Greg also mentioned that when he talked about other avenues that we're taking along with our managers to enhance productivity like how you schedule housekeeping rooms and the Green Choice. I mean, we're looking for continuous and working with our managers to find new initiatives that's going to allow us to be more productive in our hotels and keep costs down.","Answering your question regarding the impact of the Marriott Starwood merger going forward, I don't think that your assumption is unreasonable at all. Over the next two years to three years as the companies are fully integrated we will likely see benefits top line as well once the rewards programs are fully integrated, hopefully by the end of 2018. So when I look at margin performance I think it's difficult in many ways to separate margin performance from RevPAR performance. So all in all we feel really good about what's happening with the Marriott Starwood integration and the fact that the Marriott is managing 81% of our rooms.","Jeff J. Donnelly - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","From UBS we turn next to Robin Farley.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Two questions. One is just looking at your change in RevPAR guidance for the year it mostly has sort of gone up by the amount of the beat in the second quarter just at the midpoint. So how should we think about \u2013 is your outlook for the second half pretty much the same as what you thought it was a quarter or so ago? Is that the best way to think about that? And then I have another question. Thanks.","Gregory J. Larson - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Hey, Robin. This is Greg. Yeah, I think that you're generally right that our increase in \u2013 if you look at the midpoint of our RevPAR guidance increasing nearly 38 basis points, it's primarily because of the success that we've had in the both the first and second quarter beating our internal forecast. And I think we pretty much sitting here today have a similar outlook for the second half of the year.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just in the opening comments, Jim, you'd mentioned that you've like looked at some opportunities that didn't meet your IRR standards, and can you give us a sense of just what type \u2013 were they portfolios, or individual property similar to the Don and the W acquisitions you've made, where they just sort of individual properties, and is it that there were other bidders that, you know, had a lower cost of capital or something?","James F. Risoleo - Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.","Well, I'm not certain that \u2013 Robin, I don't think I said that the other bidders had a lower cost of capital. I think, we're very comfortable with our cost of capital, and that puts us in a position to compete, to create accretive value over time, and we underwrite for that perspective. So, they were not portfolios, they were single asset deals, and we spent a lot of time in one in particular, we were very close on it, and frankly, as I mentioned earlier in a response to, I think, a question that Michael raised, when a buyer can go out and borrow at very attractive rates \u2013 I'm sorry, in order to go out and borrow very attractive rates or high proceeds levels, yes, they change their mind. And they decide they want to own the asset, I think for many of the same reasons that we continue to be cautiously optimistic about where we're going.","Robin M. Farley - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Risoleo for closing remarks.","James F.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Eric. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts first quarter 2016 earnings call. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed, and we're not obligated to publicly update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today's earnings press release, and our 8-K filed with the SEC, and the supplemental financial information on our website at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our first quarter results, and then we'll discuss our disposition and redevelopment activity, as well as our Company's outlook for 2016. Greg will then provide greater detail on our first quarter performance by markets. Following their remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now I would like to turn the call over to Ed.","Edward Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report that 2016 is off to a solid start on multiple fronts. Less disruption from renovation allowed our hotels to outperform the industry on the topline in the quarter and contributed to better-than-expected improvements in margins and profitability. We also continue to make progress on the initiatives we commenced in 2015 to position Host Hotels for continued growth and value creation, including the disposition of non-core assets and returning capital to shareholders.","Let's start with a review of our results. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $345 million, which reflects an increase of 7.5% over last year, and which exceeded both our expectations and consensus estimates. Our first quarter adjusted FFO per diluted share was $0.41, exceeding consensus estimates and reflecting a 17% increase over last year.","These results were driven by several factors. First, demand growth in our portfolio was quite strong, as comparable hotel occupancy grew by 2.1 percentage points, allowing the portfolio to achieve 75.5% occupancy, which represents our highest Q1 occupancy rate since 2000.","While we attribute roughly half of this occupancy growth to the reduced levels of construction disruption, overall it still reflects solid demand growth for our hotels. When combined with average rate growth of 0.7%, the comparable hotel portfolio achieved RevPAR growth 3.6% in constant currency, which exceeded the industry luxury upper-upscale average by 170 basis points.","The strong demand growth we experienced was driven primarily by our transient segments. Our transient demand, reduced for the effect of the extra day related to leap year, was up 5%, with solid improvements across all segments other than special corporate. Transient demand growth was the highest in February and March, with the latter aided by the early Easter holiday, which accelerated spring break travel.","Conversely, our Group business experienced a demand decrease of slightly more than 2% for the quarter, which was generally caused by a very weak March, driven by the shift in the Easter holiday. In what we viewed as a favorable sign, corporate group actually increased 2.7% during the quarter. However, that increase was offset by a slight decline in association business and a larger decline in other group, which related in part to the change in the venue of the NBA All-Star game from New York in 2015 to Toronto in 2016.","Strong increases in corporate group rates helped drive an overall group ADR increase of 1.8%, which translated into a slight increase in total group revenues. The expected lower level of group activity contributed to a moderate comparable hotel F&B revenue growth of just 1%, as banquet growth increased slightly less than 1% and outlets grew by 1.4%. We expect these growth levels to improve going forward as group activity picks up again in subsequent quarters. With other revenue growth improving by 3.7%, overall revenue grew by 3.2%.","As Greg will describe in more detail, lower utility costs and the implementation of new operating methods allowed us to increase comparable hotel EBITDA margins by 90 basis points, which exceeded our expectations and contributed to solid hotel EBITDA growth of 6.8%.","As we've discussed on prior calls, we are very focused on actively managing our portfolio and efficiently allocating capital. We continue to make good progress on our asset sales program, with three asset sales completed during the first quarter, generating proceeds of over $120 million. We have five additional assets under contract, representing gross proceeds of $340 million, with closings anticipated during the second quarter.","Given our general goal of upgrading the portfolio as we complete these sales, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR of these sold or under contract hotels is $112, which falls far short of our first quarter portfolio average of $166. In addition to these expected dispositions, we are currently marketing roughly another $0.5 billion worth of assets. While the market is not as robust as last year, we are seeing some signs of improvement in the debt markets and believe that we will be successful in selling additional hotels through the remainder of the year, assuming current market conditions continue.","As we have previously discussed, these asset sales will generate tax gains which will likely require a special dividend at year-end. Given that our current stock price is trading at a meaningful discount to NAV, we believe that the primary use of sale proceeds in excess of dividend and debt repayment requirements is to buy back our stock. We repurchased an additional $81 million in stock this quarter, bringing our total to $758 million since the institution of our initial program in April of last year. In combination with our recent dividend payment, we have returned more than $230 million to shareholders in the last 60 days.","Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2016. As I mentioned, our results in Q1 exceeded our expectations and we continue to anticipate even stronger results in Q2 and Q3. Given that our group revenue pace in these two quarters is up more than 6.5%, and the generally high occupancies we typically run during those months, usually in excess of 80%, should help drive better improvement in ADR.","At this point, we anticipate that we will experience a more muted but still positive fourth quarter, as the Jewish holiday shift and nationwide election night will reduce group demand, and the traditionally lower occupancy occupancies in the fourth quarter could restrain rate growth.","Looking at comparable hotel RevPAR on a full-year perspective, we remain very comfortable with our full-year range of 3% to 4%. Given our strong first quarter comparable hotel EBITDA margin growth, we are increasing our range of full-year improvement to 25 to 65 basis points. This would translate to a full-year adjusted EBITDA of $1.440 billion to $1.475 billion FFO per share of $1.65 to $1.69.","It is important to note that our EBITDA estimate for the year was previously reduced by $14 million for the sales that we had closed or under contract in February, and it has been reduced by an incremental $16 million today for the additional sales we have identified. Had we not placed these latter assets under contract, our EBITDA range would have increased by approximately $9 million at the midpoint from our prior guidance?","That being said, we are confident that we are taking a disciplined approach to portfolio management and continuing to dispose of non-core assets will better position us in the long run for future growth and success. In summary, we are very pleased with our strong first quarter results and remain confident about our outlook for the remainder of 2016.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in much greater detail. ","Gregory Larson","Thank you, Ed. Overall, we are pleased with our solid results this quarter. The domestic markets that outperformed the portfolio were San Francisco, Los Angeles, DC, and Atlanta, while Latin America was the outperformer in our international markets. Several of our hotels in markets such as Denver, Boston, San Diego, Phoenix ,and Chicago had a slower start, but are expected to improve throughout the rest of the year.","First, I will provide some specific commentary on our major markets. Our hotels in San Francisco had an impressive quarter, with RevPAR growing 12.5% on a difficult comp of 15.4% growth last year. San Francisco hosted the Super Bowl this quarter, and all of the RevPAR growth came from double-digit ADR gains, for a total increase in ADR of 12.7%.","In addition, occupancy remained stable at a very high 80%. However, we expect the expansion of the Moscone Convention Center will negatively impact the San Francisco hotels for the remainder of 2016. As a result, our San Francisco hotels may underperform our portfolio in the remaining quarters.","RevPAR at our properties in Los Angeles grew at 12.2% in the first quarter, driven by an 8.7% increase in ADR and a 2.6 percentage point increase in occupancy to 83.2%. A solid group base at our Marina Del Rey Ritz-Carlton and Marriott hotels, strong transient demand at several of our other hotels, and tailwinds from the Newport Beach, Bayview and Westin South Coast Plaza renovations last year drove a RevPAR increase this quarter.","Looking forward, group booking pace in Los Angeles looks very strong, as the market is expected to host additional citywides this year. As a result, we expect good performance from our Los Angeles properties.","Despite the negative impact of the major East Coast snowstorm in January, RevPAR at our DC hotels increased 7.3%, significantly outperforming the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR increase of only 0.4%. This increase was primarily driven by a 4.3 percentage point increase in occupancy, as well as average rate growth of 0.7%. Several of our DC hotels benefited from renovations completed last year.","Based on strong group booking pace for these hotels, combined with our expectations that we will continue to see benefits from our completed renovation, we expect our properties in DC to achieve solid results in the second quarter. In Atlanta, RevPAR increased 5.2% for the quarter as a result of average rate growth of 3.5% and occupancy increase of 1.2 percentage point.","Our hotel operator successfully executed on their strategy to grow weekend and [show their] room night. With supply in the market well below the historical average and strong group revenues on the books for the second quarter, we expect our assets in Atlanta to continue to outperform the portfolio in the second quarter.","Shifting to markets that underperformed the portfolio this quarter, Denver was the worst performing market in the portfolio with a RevPAR decline of 2.8%. We primarily attribute this to the renovations at the Westin Denver Hotel and a supply increase in the downtown corridor, which is impacting the hotel's ability to drive rate and occupancy. Despite these factors, our Denver hotels outpaced the STAR upper-upscale result by 90 basis points. We expect results to improve at our hotels in Denver in the second quarter. ","Our Boston hotels experienced a RevPAR decline of 1.9% in the first quarter, driven entirely by a rate decrease of 3%, while occupancy improved 80 basis points. A decrease in citywides this quarter caused our hotel operators shift from higher rated group business to lower rated transient business.","The entire Boston market was challenged, as evidenced by the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR decline of 30 basis points. We anticipate that with additional citywide events scheduled at the Hynes Convention Center for the remainder of the year, results at our Boston hotels will strengthen going forward.","RevPAR at our assets in San Diego declined 80 basis points this quarter due to the renovation of the Coronado Marriott and a higher mix of lower rated group business to offset a shortage of citywide room nights. Despite the slow start in San Diego, we expect the hotels in this market will strengthen through the rest of 2016, as the city is expected to benefit from an increase in citywide room nights for the remainder of the year, especially in the third quarter.","Moving to Phoenix, hotel RevPAR increased 10 basis points in the quarter due to the difficult comparison of the Super Bowl benefit last year. Despite that, we outperformed the STAR upper-upscale RevPAR by 70 basis points. Phoenix is another market with supply still projected to be below the historical average. That, combined with a strong booking pace for the second and fourth quarters, should translate to our properties outperforming our portfolio for the rest of the year.","Our hotels in Florida underperformed the portfolio with a RevPAR increase of only 40 basis points. Milder weather in the Midwest and Northeast, plus cold weather in January and February in Florida, the media coverage of the Zika virus, decrease in international travel, and continued new supply hampered growth in the first quarter. Based on the weakness experienced in the first quarter, we anticipate our hotels in Florida to underperform the portfolio in the second quarter.","While RevPAR at our Chicago assets improved just 30 basis points, our properties outperformed the STAR upper-upscale market by 860 basis points due to the benefits from room renovations at several of our hotels in 2015. The Chicago market was negatively impacted by a 53% decline in citywide room nights this quarter. Citywide room nights continue to decline in the market. However, we expect to benefit from strong in-house groups, which will result in improved performance at our Chicago hotels going forward.","Despite the negative impact of the January snowstorm, the abundant new supply, our New York hotels experienced a positive 0.6% increase in RevPAR in the first quarter, outperforming the STAR upper-upscale market RevPAR decline of 2.1%. Our hotel managers in New York changed their strategy and began to add wholesale transient business three months out, which helped boost occupancy by 4.3% in a challenging rate environment.","In addition, the New York Airport Marriott benefited from last year's renovation. Going forward, the New York market is expected to remain challenged as it continues to absorb new supply and, as a result, our hotels will likely underperform the portfolio in the second quarter.","Moving to our international assets, these hotels had an impressive constant dollar RevPAR growth of 9.6% in the quarter. Latin America drove much of the international growth, with a constant dollar RevPAR increase of 22%, primarily from pre-Olympic test business in Rio. The Group booking pace our hotels in Rio due to the upcoming Olympics this summer, although demand in Brazil could be impacted by the potential presidential impeachment, continued weakness in oil, and concerns over Zika.","Shifting to our European joint venture, terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels negatively impacted our results, with a RevPAR decline of 3.1% in constant euros this quarter. Negative results in Paris, Brussels, and London were somewhat mitigated by positive results in Amsterdam, Berlin, Barcelona, and Madrid.","We expect continued weakness in Paris, Brussels, and London as travel alerts and warnings continue to be issued. However, positive market fundamentals still exist in Europe, including the fact that supply remains low at approximately 1% and the weak euro to the U.S. dollar could drive demand from the US to Europe.","Moving to our margins, our comparable EBITDA margin expansion of 90 basis points is very impressive; especially considering the majority of the RevPAR increase this quarter was attributable to occupancy growth. Part of this notable EBITDA margin growth is the result of our cost savings initiatives, such as time and motion studies to improve productivity at many of our hotels, as well as energy ROI projects.","The third-party time and motion studies, combined with our internal initiatives, resulted in sustainable productivity improvements of 17 basis points this quarter. The utility cost decline was the result of the mild winter and favorable gas and electric prices, in addition to our properties beginning to realize the benefits of our cost-saving energy ROI initiatives. We have invested in numerous projects over the past year, from small projects such as the conversion to LED lighting and replacement of showerheads, to major projects such as solar panels in Maui, and steam-to-gas conversions in New York.","In the first quarter, hotels that had completed energy ROI projects decreased their utility costs by approximately 16.5%, which is seven percentage points better than those hotels that did not have energy ROI projects. Given the positive margin results in the first quarter, we now expect 2016 comparable EBITDA margin to increase 25 to 65 basis points. We also expect approximately 29% to 30% of our total EBITDA to be generated in the second quarter.","As discussed in our press release, during the first quarter, we repurchased 5.1 million shares for a total purchase price of $81 million. Since the inception of this share repurchase program in April 2015, we have now bought back 43.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $758 million. We currently have $242 million of capacity remaining under the repurchase program.","In addition, we paid a regular first quarter cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of 5.1% on the current stock price. Given our strong operating outlook and significant free cash flow generation, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend.","In addition, based on the disposition plan for non-core assets we have outlined and continue to execute on, we anticipate that asset sales will likely result in taxable gains, which could lead to a special dividend. While special dividends will vary and be one-time distributions, it should result in a meaningful return of capital to our stockholders.","Moving to one of the key pillars of strength and competitive advantage, our balance sheet. We had approximately $234 million of cash and $4 billion of debt. We continue to maintain a leverage ratio as calculated under our credit facility of 2.8 times, which is approximately half that of our lodging peers, and one-third that of our REIT peers.","Subsequent to quarter end, we drew on the credit facility to repay the $100 billion mortgage loan secured by the Hyatt Regency Reston hotel, bringing our encumbered properties to just three consolidated assets in Asia. Upon exiting the Asia market, we will no longer have any consolidated assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt.","Finally, as we mentioned in today's press release, due to the adoption of the new accounting pronouncement regarding consolidation, we deconsolidated the partnership that owns the Harbor Beach Marriott and recasted the prior period to reflect the new treatment.","As a result of the adoption, the operations of the property are no longer presented in other revenues on our income statement, and instead reported as a net amount in equity and earnings of affiliates. Therefore, revenues for the first quarter 2016 and 2015 exclude rental income of $15 million earned by the partnership. However, the adoption does not affect net income, adjusted EBITDA, or adjusted FFO.","In summary, we are pleased with our results this quarter as our assets are benefiting from aggressive asset management strategies and the tailwinds from our comprehensive capital program in 2015. ","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have. To ensure we have time to address questions from as many as possible, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","Hi, good morning, thanks. I wanted to ask you just to clarify something. You had mentioned that there was $16 million of incremental EBITDA associated with assets being sold. Is that associated with the five hotels that you put in your press release as under contract for $340 million?","Edward Walter","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Smedes Rose","Okay, so those are being sold at over 20 times EBITDA?","Edward Walter","That's probably a little bit of an overstatement, because we are giving you the EBITDA that we will lose over the course of the remainder of the year compared to our original expectations.","Gregory Larson","That's right. The other thing I would add is in our prior press release, in our prior quarter, we had five assets, two under contract, two sold, three under contract for I think a total of $215 million. So to look at the proceeds, you have to take the proceeds of $340 million from this press release, subtract that from the $215 million, and then do the math that you were suggesting with the EBITDA.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thanks. And then Ed, I just wanted to ask you, are group revenues for the year still tracking at around 6% in total? And have you - are you hearing any sort of change in tenor on corporation\u2019s willingness to send people either out on the transient front or on the group front, given GDP was pretty disappointing yesterday? Just kind of any color around that.","Edward Walter","Sure. Overall group revenues are trending lower than 6%. I think we identified back in February that, while we were running at roughly 6% up in bookings back in February, that we had assumed, because we had booked so many rooms in advance, that that number would likely decline over the course of the year.","In fact, we continue to believe that and we continue to expect that our group revenues would fall within the range of overall RevPAR growth that we suggested, but likely towards the higher-end of that range. As it relates to corporate demand, we have seen special corporate drop, not every month, but in general, so there has been some weakness on that side. But as you look at corporate activity and translate that into group activity, our corporate business was actually up in the first quarter, which we viewed as a good sign.","So, I am assuming that, given that we had a 0.5% GDP growth in the first quarter, we will likely see some choppiness over the course of the year from the corporate sector. That will depend a lot on particular industries, with finance being the one that seems to be a bit weaker. But we are not necessarily \u2013 we are certainly not seeing a wholesale trend across all corporations that they are cutting back.","Smedes Rose","Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.","Gregory Larson","Smedes, I also would just like to clarify my first answer. So, on page 3 of the press release, if you add the hotels under contract for $340 million, plus the total sales, that obviously \u2013 adding those two together would get you to $461 million. If you do the same thing from our prior quarter's press release, you had $215 million. So the additional proceeds from those three additional assets are really $246 million. ","Smedes Rose","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Next will be Rich Hightower with Evercore ISI.","Rich Hightower","Hey, good morning guys.","Edward Walter","Good morning, Rich.","Rich Hightower","So I just want to go back to a quick comment that Ed made in the prepared remarks about debt markets improving in the context of future asset sales. So my question here is, if you could sort of characterize for us the composition of the buyer pool and which of those buyers are more debt dependent, more leveraged buyers, than maybe more equitized buyers that have a different cost of capital, different time horizon, and some of those considerations.","Edward Walter","Yes. I would say right now, given that the REITs are generally, with maybe an exception or two, out of the acquisition market, that the two broadly defined groups of buyers would be international capital, which seems to generally be less leverage sensitive, and then domestic capital, which I think tends to be real estate opportunity funds or operators aligned with financial partners. And that group, it does seem to be fairly sensitive to changes in debt availability.","So, I would say by \u2013 just to provide a little clarification around my comment, we are not saying that the debt markets are anywhere near as strong as they were last year. But we were seeing a very severe trend in the end of last year, beginning of this year, and sort of weakening in terms of turns. And we are starting to hear some signs that availability has improved a little bit. In some cases, spreads have come in a little bit. But again, not back to where it was in the past, but at least a better trend than what we were feeling at the end of the last year or the first month or two of this year. ","Rich Hightower","All right, that is helpful, Ed. And then one quick follow-up. Is there any specific reason that share repurchase volume in the first quarter decelerated somewhat meaningfully from the fourth quarter, for instance? Or is it just a question of timing with the asset sales, or something else?","Edward Walter","I think it was primarily related to the fact that the asset sales had not yet closed. As I think we said last quarter, we are comfortable right now with the environment that we are in, sort of stage of the cycle we are in with where our leverage is.","So, in general, while it's not specifically tied to asset sales, the pace of our stock buyback activity will generally relate or correlate with our ability to get asset sales done. So we are very encouraged by the overall pace of our activity. But I guess I would say we have all been around long enough to know that just because you are under contract with money at risk doesn't necessarily mean things are going to close. So, we are waiting to get those closings completed before we necessarily accelerate activity.","Rich Hightower","All right. That makes sense, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Hi, I thought it was interesting that your occupancy was a strong as it was in the first quarter in the context that industry occupancy was down. I mean you obviously had renovation tailwinds this year, as occupancy was down 70 basis points last year. But can you just given any more color on what is driving the occupancy and how to think about it for the rest of the year? Thank you.","Edward Walter","Yes, I would agree with you that we certainly \u2013 as we looked at our results and compared them to what we saw in the industry, we were very pleased to see the occupancy growth that we had. Now, some chunk of that was due to the fact that there were rooms out of service, but I think largely we attribute it to the fact that we had very good leisure demand. Perhaps not in Florida, but in pretty much all of our other markets. And on a relative basis to the industry, I suspect our group demand was fairly strong, too.","So, as we look through the rest of the year, given the fact that we've got a very strong group base, we are expecting to see \u2013 I don't know that we would necessarily expect to see occupancy growth at the same rate going forward as we have right now. We probably would expect to see our RevPAR growth lean a little bit more towards rate growth going forward, just because these next couple quarters are months where we start off with a really strong occupancy base. But we would still expect to see some gains in occupancy throughout the rest of the year.","Thomas Allen","And then just my follow-up. Were you tempted at all to bring up the high-end of your RevPAR guidance after this quarter? I mean you have Hilton and Marriott guiding at three to five. You had stronger first quarter results than them, so were you tempted at all to bring it up?","Edward Walter","We are always tempted. But I guess what I would say is that we were pleased with the way the first quarter played out. I think that we took what we thought was an appropriately conservative perspective on RevPAR at the beginning of the year. Our properties are more optimistic right now than we are. But on the other hand is what was demonstrated in first quarter GDP is the economies maybe not quite as robust as we all would like to see. So, I think for right now, sitting where we are and feeling very comfortable with where we are, it was the right answer for us.","Thomas Allen","Thank you.","Operator","Next will be Robin Farley with UBS.","Arpine Kocharian","Hi, thank you. This is actually Arpine for Robin. And to follow-up on that question, actually, you had mentioned the tougher comps in Q1 and Q4. And it seems like Q1 came in slightly better than what you expected. Does that mean the shift impact on Q2 is a little bit less now, unless there is a shift within your guidance range? And then do you still expect Q3 to be strongest in group business?","Edward Walter","Yes, so I don't know that we necessarily were commenting on tough comps in Q1. I think what I was saying in my prepared remarks, and I will elaborate a bit, is that we have exceptionally strong group bookings in Q2 and Q3. And those are months where we run at higher occupancy levels. And it is what we have been seeing of late, is in general, when we are running at higher occupancy levels that seems to be when we have the best opportunity to push rate. So that\u2019s why we feel very good about Q2 and Q3.","And I would confirm what you said, which is that today our group bookings for Q3 are the strongest that we have throughout the entire year. Q4 is impacted by a number of things. I think what probably matters most is the shift in the Jewish holiday, which will now impact October.","And secondly, the fact that this year's election will probably Q1 that most people want to pay attention to. The net of those two things is we would expect less group business in the fourth quarter.","And then finally, the other reason why we expect the fourth quarter to be a hair weaker is the fact that November and December tend \u2013 the second half of November and December tend to be lower occupancy months. So what we experienced last year was that it was more difficult to push rate in those months. We are expecting that same sort of a scenario will apply again this year.","Arpine Kocharian","Right, thank you. And if I may, a quick follow-up. Now that we know that two of your large hotel managers are combining, as an owner of those assets could you talk a bit about the general sentiment among owners, what this could mean, whether in terms of loyalty programs, occupancy sharing, and just balancing of issues and opportunities?","Edward Walter","Well, I am not going to try and speak for what other owners might think, but I guess I would say from our perspective, we see both positives and benefits from this. I think what probably matters in some ways in the near-term, assuming that they navigate and we expect that they will - the challenges that exist around the integration. When we compare our cost structures leaving out management fees, between Starwood and Marriott.","Right now Marriott - if our Starwood hotels sat within the Marriott system, we would be able to save costs and improve margins. So we are hoping that they execute as we expect they will, and that we ultimately get the benefit from that. I think that the challenge that the industry in general has identified with the combination is that there will be a number of brands that will all sit beneath one family, under one company, and it will be important to be thoughtful about how to continue to distinguish those brands. We look forward to working with Marriott in order to make certain that happens in a cost-effective manner.","Arpine Kocharian","Thank you.","Edward Walter","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Steven Kent","Hi, can you hear me.","Edward Walter","Now we can.","Steven Kent","Sorry about that. Can you just \u2013 I just have a question broadly on some of the hotel loyalty programs on booking direct. Has that impact did you positively or negatively? And then the other thing is, just on the pacing of asset sales over the next 12 months, what does the transaction environment look like? How are you thinking about that over the next year or two?","Edward Walter","Steve, it's a little hard right now for us to get a clear indication on how some of the booking direct programs were impacting us. We do know that, in an effort to drive more bookings directly to the website, there were some \u2013 there are some rate reductions. I would say I think that's probably contributed to less growth in our transient rate than what we might have normally seen in the past. Maybe and from that standpoint, a slight negative.","The flipside is, of course, is that when you look at what gets through the bottom line, the cost of booking a reservation directly with an operator is significantly cheaper than if it were to happen through one of the OTAs. So we are certainly supportive of the overall strategy and we look forward to working with them to fine tune that as they move forward.","As it relates to the asset sales, I think that market is clearly not as robust as it was last year. We do - as I indicated in my prepared remarks, in addition to the assets that are under contract at this point that we identified in the press release, we have another $0.5 billion of activity that we are working hard on and I would feel we are making good progress on.","At this point, we would expect to attempt to sell additional assets in the second half of the year, but a lot of that will depend upon how we see the market evolve over the course of the summer and what the outlook seems to be for the second half of the year for transaction activity. So I\u2019m feeling relatively good about where we stand right now. I think we certainly were one of the first in the industry to begin to look to sell assets. We did not just come up with this idea in the last six to eight months.","And I think we're made great progress overall on the sale program. I am hopeful that we will be able to keep going. But at this stage, I think we will have to take a little bit of a wait-and- see attitude for the second half of the year.","Steven Kent","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","And the next question is from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Kelley","Hey, good morning, guys. I just was wondering, I think in the prepared remarks you mentioned a little bit about some of the cost savings initiatives, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about where we are in the roll - in the timing of the rollout of those. Like, is there a lot more to come on this? Are we relatively early on?","Edward Walter","I would guess it's a little hard to judge that in a vacuum. But I think we are probably about halfway through. My guess is we have implemented more than half of those measures already. And I would also tell you that we are not - just because we are - when I say we are halfway through, we are halfway through the first, call it, 20 to 25 hotels that we ran the program on. We are operating on a scaled down basis; been executing the program on some of our mid-sized hotels. The benefits there will not be as significant in a total dollar context as they were on the larger hotels, simply because the hotels are smaller.","But as we work our way through getting the benefits from this, part of the structure of this program is that there is a bit of a cost-sharing relationship with the company that is helping us with that. And so, part of what we are - the second of the benefit we don't really pay for anything. Consequently, there is an opportunity for further pickup there. ","So, I would say we have certainly gotten meaningful benefits. We would expect to continue to get more going forward.","Shaun Kelley","Great, thanks. And then my second or follow-up question would be to go back to the implications of Marriott and Starwood on the merger front. We had seen in the past around some of these prior integrations and with Marriott's rollout of Sales Force One some churn and some challenges that worked themselves out over time, but in the sales organization specifically.","And you guys are obviously a very big group house for both of these brands. So, could you talk a little bit about what you think the sales impact might be as they start to integrate some of the direct property level sales managers and all of that? Is that something you think they are well prepared for and they have reached out to you on yet? Or how do you think that is going to play out?","Edward Walter","Shaun, it's probably a little early for us to try to have any informed comment on that. We have talked with them about some of their preliminary thoughts. And it certainly \u2013 the issues that you are identifying and the concerns that you are identifying are concerns that we have. But specifically how they are going to approach that, they have not given us any details on that yet. So, I think I am sure we will learn more as they move forward with consummating the merger and then working towards the integration. But they are not at the point now where they have given us significant detail on that.","Shaun Kelley","Thank you very much.","Operator","Next will be Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","Hi, good morning everyone. Could you comment on how group production for future periods trended so far this year? Have you seen corporations pull back at all on their future group plans?","Edward Walter","Generally, the answer is that we have not seen corporations pulling back on the businesses that they already had on their books. There were some markets where we saw some slight \u2013 we saw some reduction in production compared to prior levels on smaller groups. But the larger \u2013 we are not seeing any \u2013 certainly not seeing any trend of significant cancellations.","We are not seeing a trend of significant attrition compared to the levels that might have been under contract. It was interesting on the food and beverage side, just because that is something that we are clearly watching in this area, we actually saw in the first quarter that our spend for our food and beverage spend per group room night actually was up somewhere between 2.5% and 3%, which we viewed as fairly favorable, especially given some of the overall economic headwinds.","Anthony Powell","Right, got it, thanks. And we have heard some other REITs talk about better international inbound demand trends across the balance of the year. Are you seeing that and where could that be most impactful for your portfolio?","Edward Walter","That is always a little tricky to get information that we fully trust on that area. Our sense was that we were still down in the first quarter on international travel. Now, I would say we were fairly encouraged by some of the arrival data that we have been tracking, which goes through February, which showed that Europe was up mid-single digits, that China was up nearly 20%. Japan, actually \u2013 arrivals from Japan actually trended up, which was a nice change compared to what we saw last year.","The two major inbound markets that we saw were down from the standpoint of air arrivals were Canada and Brazil, which were both down about 1%. So those were two markets where \u2013 I think in Brazil it is probably an economic situation; in Canada I think that's really being hit by the dollar.","There was some discussion that \u2013 actually at our recent GM's meeting, that there was a feeling that we may start to see international improve in the summer, both because of some better circumstances in some of those countries, and also the fact that \u2013 if the U.S. dollar does not continue to strengthen, then the year-over-year change in the dollar is not as dramatic as what we saw in 2015. But that is on the come. We don't know whether or not that is actually going to happen.","Anthony Powell","All right, thank you.","Operator","Next question will be from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","To ask you on the RevPAR guidance, which has been at three to four since last time you reported. And it is a tighter range, obviously, than many of the others. Can we read into that, that maybe you have already grouped up a bit for the rest of the year, and that a lot of this is baked? And the question really is do you have I guess adequate if transient does reaccelerate, do you think you have a lot of upside to the number? Or is it the tighter range more a reflection of having more group and maybe a little bit less variability?","Edward Walter","I think to answer the last part of your question first, I think that the group activity that we have is very strong. And of course, as you know, it represents 37%, 38% of our overall business. We have always been more significantly weighted to group than the industry. I am comfortable that with that base, that to the extent that we saw a reacceleration in corporate transient, that we would \u2013 that would not present a problem for us, because that would just be directly reflected in the form of higher rates that we would be able to charge transient customers.","And in fact, that is one of the reasons why we like to have a very solid group base. I think if you look more broadly at why we are where we are and others may be where they are in terms of outlook, I think some of this is the fact that we do have a very diversified portfolio.","So, no market represents more than 11% of our EBITDA. We have got some exposure to some lower supply markets, whether it's Phoenix, Atlanta, or maybe New Orleans, where we are looking at very strong growth this year out of those markets. The fact that we have a significant chunk of our portfolio in some key resort assets I think also helps, because so far the trend we have been seeing this year is very strong leisure demand, and we hope that that continues.","Then lastly, back to the group point, the large number of big group hotels that we have, which contribute meaningfully to our profitability, they are all in good physical condition. We've invested significantly in them, and this is the part of the cycle where they have an opportunity to truly perform, both at the top and the bottom.","So, as I stated in response to a question before, we continue to be conservative in our approach to guidance. But we are \u2013 we feel very comfortable with where we are right now based on the information that we can evaluate.","Chris Woronka","Great, thanks. And just a quick follow-up. On the Marriott-Starwood merger, I think on paper the consensus this is going to have a lot of long-term benefits. Do you guys as you look out, whether it is second half or maybe even next year, is there any concern that there is any near-term slippage that maybe some of the larger competing brands try to take some of that business away temporarily as Marriott and Starwood sort some things out at the property levels?","Edward Walter","I guess what I would say is that we are certainly concerned, as anyone should be, that when two large companies that represent a significant chunk of your portfolio are merging, you hope that that merger happens and that integration happen as effectively and as quickly as it can.","We have no doubt, based on our conversations with the folks at Marriott, that they understand the importance of getting that right. Not just for our own sake but obviously for their own success. They are a talented group of people and the one thing that Marriott has always been very good at execution.","So, I don't want to underestimate the challenges that they face, but I certainly think that they are aware of what they are heading into and doing the best they can to manage that process. At the property \u2013 some of that - there obviously is activity that happens above the property on the marketing side.","But I don't want to leave everybody with a sense that \u2013 when you look at who is running the hotel on a day-to-day basis, those folks are on-site at the property. As we just - again, we had a meeting with all of our GMs a week ago, and it was clear that in talking to both the Starwood and the Marriott GMs, they are all very enthusiastic about this combination. It dramatically improves their opportunity. It will facilitate cooperation in an appropriate manner in various markets where we may have assets branded under both companies.","And I think in a lot of ways, at the property level, they are very fired up about what the future might bring. So, we are very focused on making certain that they stay focused on what they are doing, but we are very much aligned with those property GMs in terms of their activities. Again, we are certainly paying attention to this and we will be staying as close as we can to making certain that every effort is being made to complete the integration as quickly and completely as they can get it done. But I suspect we will be okay.","Chris Woronka","Okay, very good. Thanks, Ed.","Operator","And we\u2019ll go next to Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Not to beat a dead horse, but I just want to talk a little bit about RevPAR growth. You guys came in the upper half of your range in the first quarter, with RevPAR coming in flat. And it sounds like your pace is up 6.5% in 2Q and 3Q.","So, is there any reason for us to believe that RevPAR growth is not really going to accelerate over the next couple of quarters unless we see a fall-off on the transit side, which obviously the brands aren't forecasting and people seem to be getting more comfortable surrounding the macro, not less? Are there any particular portfolio-specific challenges that you see that might limit that RevPAR growth, is another way of asking that question.","Edward Walter","No, I think in general, what you described is generally what we expect, which is to see some improvement in Q2 and Q3, especially in Q3. And then I think Q4 is the part that is a little harder to judge at this point.","Ryan Meliker","Sure, and that's helpful. And then on the margin front, you guys were able to institute a lot of cost controls, grow margins pretty materially on a modest RevPAR growth environment. So do you think that you'll see similar type margin growth on increased RevPAR growth in 2Q and 3Q or are you lapping some challenges?","Gregory Larson","Ryan, I am not sure 90 basis points of margin growth with 3.6% RevPAR growth was stronger than what we would have predicted, so maybe we will be pleasantly surprised as we move forward as well. But sitting here today, as Ed said, we are expecting stronger RevPAR growth in both Q2 and especially in Q3. So that certainly should be helpful in margins.","Obviously Ed, also mentioned that we expect to continue to have occupancy increases, but it will be more - the RevPAR increase will be more balanced between rate and occupancy, which also will be helpful for us.","But having said that I don\u2019t know that that we can sit here and count on utility costs always being down 11% or more. So we will see. Obviously, we tried to take into account the success that we had in the first quarter and then we tried to - frankly, my view for the rest of the year is slightly stronger than what it was just a quarter ago. So we tried to take into account both of those things to come up with our new guidance of 25 basis points to 65 basis points.","Ryan Meliker","No, that is really helpful. Thanks, Greg. And then just one quick follow-up with regards to asset sales. If I think about this correctly, it sounds like you have got about $30 million of lost EBITDA this year from the $461 million in asset sales. A couple of those assets were sold in the middle of the first quarter, a few being sold later in this quarter, if we just assume roughly four months of ownership across the group.","And that would mean that you have got eight months left, so we would true up the $30 million to roughly $45 million in annual EBITDA at $461 million. That is about 10 times EBITDA. Is that the right way to think about it? And then from the buyer perspective, how material are these PIPs? Are these guys paying significant CapEx that brings what they are paying even lower on an EBITDA multiple basis?","Gregory Larson","Ryan, I always appreciate fuzzy math to come up with multiples. But I think if you look at the eight assets that we talked about in our press release, the three that we have sold and the five under contract, and look at an aggregate EBITDA multiple, it is around 11 times. And so it is pretty - obviously pretty close to the multiple where our stock trades today.","Ryan Meliker","Sure. Any color on what type of PIPs that buyers might be looking at? Are these material PIPs, or has everything pretty much already been done on the assets that have been sold and the ones that you are looking to sell?","Edward Walter","It varies by asset. So in some cases, there is a sizable PIP, and in other cases there is virtually no capital required.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, thanks. Appreciate it.","Edward Walter","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from David Loeb with Baird.","David Loeb","Just to continue on the asset sales, I just want to clarify, are there three new transactions since the fourth quarter call? So did the two carry over or did some fall out?","Edward Walter","There are three new ones and two that we had \u2013 two assets that were identified on the fourth quarter call have just not yet closed.","David Loeb","Okay. And is one of those a New York City hotel?","Edward Walter","New York City Hotel is not in the group of assets we've identified so far. That continues to be a priority. And I would hope that we would be able to announce further progress down the road on that, but we are not there yet.","David Loeb","Okay, great, thank you.","Gregory Larson","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Kris Trafton with Credit Suisse.","Kris Trafton","On the Marriott-Starwood merger. How we think about the potential risk of a nonunion hotel force in the collective bargaining, similar to what would happen with the IHG-Kimpton merger?","Edward Walter","Yes, I think that is certainly one of the issues that needs to be studied as part of this. And it's a unique thing to each individual market, so we don\u2019t have anything there that we are necessarily prepared to disclose, but that is certainly something that we are looking at as part of the valuating the overall impact of the merger.","Kris Trafton","Okay, great. And then just one more. With social issues oftentimes the main impediment to consolidation, what are your thoughts on taking a closer look at RLJ, with Tom moving over to Hilton?","Edward Walter","As tempting as it would be to discuss M&A activity, I just \u2013 I've generally found that the best answer to those sorts of things is to just not try to comment on potential M&A transactions until they are announced.","Kris Trafton","Okay, fair enough. Thanks guys.","Operator","And we will take our final question from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","Yes, good morning everyone. You mentioned that group pace was trending a little bit lower than a 6% due to the elevated booking pace. What is your year-end expectation? Was that around the 4%? If I was hearing your comment correctly, is that a good goal for the year? And how much of that would be occupancy versus rate?","Edward Walter","Yes, I would say \u2013 I would probably would say we are somewhat \u2013 we are in the 3% to 4% range, and then we're expecting to be at the upper end of that range right now. I don\u2019t know that we got a clear delineation on what it is between occupancy and rate, but I would imagine it is about a 50-50 break.","Wes Golladay","Okay. And then going to the New York transaction market, what are you seeing on the ground there? It looks like \u2013 what is the depth of the buyer pool? And then also, on the selling side, it looks like a lot of people want to exit the market. How does that compare versus maybe six months ago?","Edward Walter","I think there has been a high volume of transactions on the market from New York, for more than just the last six months. I would say that there is a high degree of buyer interest in the transactions that are there. As I mentioned on the last call, our sense is that the properties that have attracted the most interest are ones where there is potentially brand flexibility, or use of the building flexibility. Because that broadens the pool of folks that would be interested in a particular asset. So, I don't think there's any doubt that a lot of people are interested in looking at New York right now, but I would also agree with what you are implying, which is there's a lot of assets on the market.","Wes Golladay","Okay, thank you.","End of Q&A","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Walter, at this time, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional remarks.","Edward Walter","Well, thank you, everybody, for joining us on the call today. We appreciated the opportunity to discuss our first quarter results and our outlook for the rest of the year. We look forward to providing you with more insight into how 2016 is playing out in our second quarter call in July. Have a great weekend everyone.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s call.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. ","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gee Lingberg, Vice President. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Gee Lingberg","Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Host Hotels & Resorts second quarter 2015 earnings call. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind everyone that many of the comments made today are considered to be forward-looking statements under Federal Securities laws.","As described in our filings with the SEC, these statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause future results to differ from those expressed and we are not obligated to publically update or revise these forward-looking statements.","In addition, on today\u2019s call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial information such as FFO, adjusted EBITDA and comparable hotel results. You can find this information together with reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP information in today\u2019s earnings press release, in our 8-K filed with the SEC and on our Web site at hosthotels.com.","With me on the call today is Ed Walter, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, Ed will provide a brief overview of our second quarter results and then will describe the current operating environment as well as the company\u2019s outlook for 2015. Greg will then provide greater detail on our second quarter performance by market. Following the remarks, we will be available to respond to your questions.","And now, here\u2019s Ed.","Ed Walter","Thanks, Gee. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report another quarter of positive results for the company, driven by strong rate growth and solid group demand. We\u2019re also quite pleased with our progress on various transactions and value creation opportunities throughout our portfolio.","First, let\u2019s review our results for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $422 million for the quarter and 743 million year-to-date, reflecting a year-to-date increase of 3.3%. Our adjusted FFO was $0.46 per share for the second quarter and $0.81 per share year-to-date, reflecting a 6.6% increase over last year. Both earning measures are in line with the consensus. These results were driven by several factors. ","First RevPAR for our comparable domestic portfolio increased by 5.3%, which matched upper upscale industry performance despite continuing drag from ongoing renovation at a number of our hotels. Well Greg will provide more detailed insight shortly, we were pleased to see that overall with the exception of Houston and New York, our portfolio performed in line or better than we had expected for the quarter. The strong domestic performance was driven by our group segment, which benefited from a 13% increase in association business leading to group demand growth of 2.7% and rate growth of 4.4% which translated to group revenue growth of more than 7%.","Our transient segment benefited from mix shift as our top rated segment which represent slightly less than half of our overall transient business improved demand by more than 2%. Planned reductions in our lower priced segments resulted in a modest transient demand decline, but overall rate was up 4.9% and our transient revenues increased by more than 4%. ","Within the quarter for our domestic hotels, June was our strongest month as April was affected by renovation impact, and it suffered from difficult prior year comparison. Our group revenue growth outpaced transient growth each month, although because of successful rate mix strategies, our transient rate growth was stronger in all months except May. ","Evaluated on a constant currency basis, our international portfolio performed well, selling 9% in the quarter when we exclude the Calgary Marriott, which was undergoing a very disruptive room renovation and the JW in Rio, which benefited significantly from the World Cup last year. Excluding those hotels, group room demand increased nearly 9%, while transient rates rose solidly. When all of our comparable international hotels were included, we had a constant currency RevPAR decline of 5.9% for the quarter. ","Overall the comparable portfolio generated constant currency RevPAR growth of 4.8%, driven by rate growth of 4.5% and a slight increase in occupancy. Year-to-date RevPAR increased 4.4% reflecting rate growth of 4.7%, partially offset by a slight decline in occupancy. I would note that the USALI mandated changes in accounting approach artificially reduced each of these figures by about 20 basis points. ","Given the strength in the U.S. dollar, we have been watching international travels trends carefully. Overseas arrivals excluding Canada and Mexico are up about 3% year-to-date through the end of May, with Asia travel up nearly 5%. However, Europe and South American travel are both down by roughly a 0.5%. Data from our properties confirms that we have seen weakness in travel from the EU especially on the East Coast, but continuing strength on the West Coast where more travel originates from Asia.","Comparable F&B revenues grew almost 5% in the quarter or approximately 2% on USALI adjusted basis, with excellent flow through as F&B profit improved by more than 7%. Overall total comparable revenue growth was 4% for the quarter and 3.6% year-to-date. Comparable hotel EBITDA margins expanded 25 basis points for the quarter and 40 basis points year-to-date. Again USALI negatively impacted both of these figures by 20 basis points.","On the acquisition front, as we announced in June, we acquired the 643 rooms Phoenician, a luxury selection resort for 400 million. This hotel is ideally located in one of the premium resort markets in the Southwest, in close proximity to nightlife, galleries, museums and businesses of downtown Scottsdale. It is a terrific hotel that we are excited to acquire and it also has several opportunities for value enhancement and redevelopment that we plan to take advantage of going forward.","On the disposition front, we sold three non-core assets during the quarter, including the Sheraton Needham for $54 million which we announced in June and the Park Ridge Marriott and the Chicago Marriott O'Hare for approximately 89 million. Our European JV also sold the Crowne Plaza Amsterdam for EUR106 million. I would also note that we have a small non-core asset currently under contract for sale and expect to close on that transaction within the next few weeks for nearly $10 million.","I would note that these activities have combined to improve the overall quality of our portfolio, while RevPAR is not always the best indicator of quality, it is worth noting that the average RevPAR in the domestic assets we sold this year is less than $100, while the Phoenician RevPAR is north of 220.","While the scale of our acquisition activity has outpaced our disposition so far this year, because of seasonality, we expect that the net -- of these transactions as a reduction of approximately 5 million in 2015 EBITDA. However on a full year pro forma basis, the favorable impact from these activities would be north of 12 million and we expect these transactions to benefit our 2016 EBITDA by this amount.","We continue to actively market properties both domestically and internationally. Given our current level of activity, we anticipate that we could realize proceeds of 100 million to 200 million from international sales by the end of the year. Domestically we expect the market 100 million to 250 million of assets this fall, but any closings resulting from these activities would likely not occur until late in the year or early 2016. Proceeds from these transactions would generally be used to pay dividends, repurchase stocks or invest in new or existing assets. Given the uncertainty with respect to timing of these transactions, the guidance I will discuss in a few minutes does not assume that we complete incremental sales other than a 10 million asset I just referenced.","During the second quarter, we completed a number of highly disruptive capital projects, including the rooms' renovation of the Calgary Marriott, the Newark Airport Marriott, the JW Marriott, Houston and the JW Marriott, Washington DC as well as the lobby meeting space project at the Grand Hyatt DC.","Year-to-date, the company has invested a 101 million in ROI redevelopment project and $220 million in renewal and replacement CapEx project. Construction activity in the second half of the year will remain robust, with ROI redev is estimated to range from 170 million to 185 million and renewal CapEx ranging from 150 million to 135 million. However, it is worth noting that we expect disruptions from these projects to not be as significant as we experienced in the first half of the year.","As we have previously discussed, we continually look to match operator on property types and brand in an effort to maximize our operating results and asset value. Last month, we reached an agreement to franchise the Sheraton Parsippany Hotel and ATI has assumed control of the property as the operator. We currently have 12 third party managed hotels, two of which are independent. We are currently reviewing two other near term opportunities for conversion.","Now let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the remainder of 2015 as there are number of factors to keep us optimistic about our future results. Our group bookings this year have been very soft and that trend continued in the second quarter. Group bookings during Q2 for the third and fourth quarter grew by more than 20% in terms of revenue. Because there is a well documented calendar challenges both by the late Labor Day holiday and the timing of the Jewish holiday, our booked revenues are essentially flat to last year for the third quarter, but up by more than 6% for the fourth quarter.","We have been pleased with our efforts to shift business into higher rated -- within our year-to-date occupancy running north of 77%, we expect that this trend will continue although it would be more pronounced in Q4. Overall we expect RevPAR in the second half the entire portfolio will exceed our first half result.","Despite these positive trends, we are reducing our EBIT outlook for the full year because our operating performance at the Four Seasons Philadelphia and Ritz-Carlton, Phoenix was weaker than we anticipated as those hotels approach their closing date. And the severance expenses of these and other management transitions have increased slightly. We have also seen slight increases in the amount of business disrupted by some of our more significant capital projects, especially at the Calgary and Newark Marriott.","In addition as I discussed earlier, the net impact of our acquisition and disposition activity for the full year will reduce 2015 adjusted EBITDA by approximately $5 million. So finally while our overall operating outlook across the country is generally consistent with our slightly above our first quarter outlook, we do anticipate that both Houston and the New York will underperform our previous expectations.","With all this in mind, we expect our comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the year to be 4.5% to 5%. On the margin side given expected rate growth and solid group demand, we expect our adjusted margin increase to be 35 basis points to 55 basis points for the full year. Based on these operating assumptions, our adjusted EBITDA will be 1.410 billion to 1.425 billion, which is a reduction of 17.5 million at the mid-point.","I would stress that guidance for adjusted FFO remains at $1.52 per share to $1.55 per share as savings on interest expenses due to our ability to access new debt re-financings at low prices and the benefit of our stock repurchases have largely offset the impact of expected reduction in adjusted EBITDA.","In summary, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and outside of the challenges posted by New York and Houston, we remain confident about the industry and our outlook for the second half of 2015. ","Looking into 2016, we are seeing very strong group bookings as corporations have booking events earlier to ensure that they have access to the best hotels on the desired date. We\u2019ve been ahead on room nights for 2016 since the beginning of the year. Now we are seeing strength in rate too. Next year we will also have considerably less disruption from capital project and we will start to see the benefits of our redevelopment project. We feel very good about the health of the industry and how we are positioned for next year.","Thank you and now let me turn the call over to Greg Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our operating and financial performance in more detail.","Greg Larson","Thank you, Ed. Now let me provide some commentary on our market. The market Southwest continues to be the strongest performing markets with a RevPAR increase of 10.2%. These markets benefited from strong transient and group business in the second quarter. Transient revenues grew 10% over last year and group revenues were up 13.5% with an increase in average rate over 7% for both segments. ","San Diego, Seattle, San Francisco and Hawaii all achieved double-digit RevPAR growth in the second quarter. RevPAR for our hotels in San Diego market grew an impressive 16% beating STAR upper upscale RevPAR growth by almost 500 basis points this quarter. The Grand Hyatt Manchester benefited from having full meeting space inventory as its renovations were completed in the fourth quarter last year. This enabled our managers to book in-house group business that created compression, which drove group and transient average rates."," For our hotels in San Diego, group revenues increased 19% and transient revenues grew 12%. Strong group business facilitated the 32% increase in food and beverage revenues with a 40% increase in the more profitable banquet and catering business.","Our Seattle hotels grew RevPAR 15.4%, predominantly driven by a 13% increase in average rates. This growth was driven by solid market demand from city wide and the nearby US Open, which created compression and drove ADR. Group revenues increased 16% and transient revenues increased 14%. Stronger business resulted in impressive growth in food and beverage revenues, which increased nearly 17% primarily from a 24% increase in banquet and catering revenues.","San Francisco continued to outperform the portfolio with RevPAR increasing 10% this quarter. Strong transient demand and solid association group business helped the hotels and grew transient and group average rates, which were up 6.7% and 5.6% respectively, resulting in transient revenues of over 9% and group revenues of 8%. ","Looking at the remainder of the year, our hotels in the San Francisco market are expected to perform only slightly above our portfolio in the second half of the year, with one property that will begin its renovation in the fourth quarter and as construction at the Moscone Convention Center has negatively impacted group booking pattern.","Our Hawaiian hotels generated RevPAR growth of 12.6% which exceeded STAR upper upscale RevPAR growth by 500 basis points in the second quarter. Without the USALI resort fee allocation change, the second quarter RevPAR would have been up nearly 18%. This was driven by strong group and transient demand from stable airfare and an airlift increase of 15% for last year as well as the completion of the renovation at the Fairmont Kea Lani.","Food and beverage revenues increased 27% this quarter from solid increases in both banquet and catering and outlet sales. Transient and group revenues were equally strong, both increased over 20% for the quarter. As strong as Hawaii was in the first half of the year, we expect our hotels in Hawaii to underperform the portfolio in the second half of the year due to weaker city wide events and a decrease for Japanese travelers.","Our Atlanta property increased RevPAR by 12.6%, driven by an occupancy increase of 5 percentage points in addition to average rate growth of 5.5%. Our hotels in Atlanta exceeded the STAR upper upscale market RevPAR growth by 220 basis points. The room renovation at the Westin Buckhead last year contributed to the market's outperformance this quarter.","Food and beverage revenues were up 15%, driven by banquet increases from solid group room nights at the Buckhead hotel. In part, due to the renovations to the Westin Buckhead and Grand Hyatt Buckhead that were completed in the third quarter of last year, we expect Atlanta property to outperform the portfolio in the second half of this year.","Our hotels in the DC market increased RevPAR 6.8% with excellent average rate growth of 8% as properties shifted from lower rated transient business to higher rated group segment. Group room nights increased 12%, while transient room nights fell 11%. Both group and transient average rates increased by 6.7% and 10.8% respectively, resulting in group revenue growth of 19%, offsetting a transient revenue decline of 2%. ","The hotels in DC underperformed the STAR upper upscale market result due to the renovation of three major hotels during the quarter. These renovations were completed in the second quarter. The third quarter for DC will be challenging as certain city wides will not repeat in this quarter as well as the shift of the holiday into September this year. However, fourth quarter looks good as the property start to benefit from the renovations that began in December of last year and there will be no mid-term elections this year. ","Unfortunately RevPAR growth in New York, Houston and Calgary continued to be constrained in the second quarter due to a combination of increased supply, renovation and oil issues. All these markets experienced declines in RevPAR for the quarter. Our initial expectation was for RevPAR growth in New York to turn slightly positive in the second quarter and that did not transpire. However, although RevPAR declined 1.5% in the quarter, it is worth noting the positive momentum throughout the quarter as RevPAR sequentially improved each month with June resulting in positive RevPAR growth of 3.3%. This was a positive sign.","Having said that, the ability to increase rates has been hindered by supply that continues to negatively impact the New York market as well as a decrease in demand from international travelers due to the strength in the U.S. dollar. Based on these issues, we have decreased our forecast for the remainder of the year, so we are still predicting slightly positive RevPAR in the second half due to easier comps, the completion of the renovations at the Newark Airport Marriott and a better group booking pace in the second half of the year when compared to first half of the year.","In Houston, while the renovation at the JW Houston was completed in April, RevPAR at our hotels in this market declined 8.4%. One major reason was the flooding that occurred in Houston in May. In addition, declines related to the energy in this industry continue to negatively impact the Houston market.","Further, Middle Eastern medical patient business declined at the St. Regis which affected average rate in the quarter. We should also note that the Medical Center Marriott will undergo a rooms renovation beginning in September which will cause some disruption. ","Finally, our Calgary Marriott had a RevPAR decline of 40% for the second quarter, mainly due to the continued extensive renovation at the hotel that was completed at June and also partially impacted by declining energy business as a result of falling oil prices. The decline in energy business will continue to impact our Calgary hotel for the remainder of the year. Third quarter is expected to improve from second quarter levels that will continue to be challenged by oil issues. However, results for the fourth quarter should significantly improve to be positive as comparable results become easier due to the renovations that began in November of last year.","Shifting to our European joint venture, our assets in Europe had an outstanding quarter with constant euro RevPAR increase of 5.3%, resulting from a 5.5% increase in average rates. Increase was driven by strong transient business. Transient revenues increased 10%, primarily from a 9.5% increase in average rates. Group revenues decreased 1.8% as occupancy decreased 5%, but it is important to note that average rates increased 3.5%.","Eight of the 18 European joint venture hotels achieved RevPAR results in excess of 9% in the second quarter. With major events in Venice and Milan, our properties in these markets had RevPAR growth of 32% and 16% respectively for the quarter. Our outlook for the European assets remains encouraging even with the issues surrounding Greece and a potential exit from the euro zone. EVP performance across the region is improving, most notably in Spain and the Netherlands.","Since our last call, Spain's GDP forecast increased 50 basis points to 3% and the Netherlands forecast increased 40 basis points to 2%. Consumer confidence in these countries has been on the rise and tourism has been a large contributor to Spain's economic recovery. International travel demand has been strong into European countries with a weakened euro. Year-to-date U.S. travel into our hotels in Europe has increased approximately 5%, but the third quarter figure is looking stronger. This goes well for the band of our European portfolio for the remaining summer months.","Moving to our forecast for the rest of the year, we expect RevPAR to accelerate in the second half of this year with fourth quarter performance significantly exceeding our third quarter performance. As many of you are aware, third quarter last year was our best performing quarter and as a result, it will provide for a difficult comp for the upcoming third quarter; coupled that with the negative calendar impact from the later Labor Day, and the shifting of the Jewish holidays; we expect slower RevPAR growth in the third quarter than the first half of this year. Inversely, because of the calendar shift and easier comp than last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we expect the fourth quarter will be the strongest performing quarter of the year. As a result, we expect third quarter to generate only 45% of the remaining EBITDA for the year. ","During the second quarter, we repurchased 6.55 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of 131 million. We have 369 million of repurchase capacity under the program. With regards to dividend, we paid a regular second quarter dividend of $0.20 per share, which represents a yield of approximately 4% on the current stock price. Given our strong extended operating outlook and significant amount of free cash flow, we are committed to sustaining a meaningful dividend.","In summary, we feel good about the industry fundamentals and our results. Our domestic portfolio performance has been solid and the positive pace of the industry upper upscale RevPAR results and we expect our comparable RevPAR to accelerate in the second half of the year.","This concludes our prepared remarks. We are now interested in answering any questions you may have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.","Smedes Rose","I wanted to ask you just on the portfolio sales, I think you said you have a total of 200 million to 350 million of international and domestic properties currently being marketed. What are your thoughts around acquisitions I guess at this point? And kind of what kind of markets would you be primarily focused on?","Ed Walter","Smedes, I think we are -- I want to correct what you said about the sales, we have a number of international sales that are on the market now. We\u2019re expecting to put a lot of domestic properties on the market more in the fall, which is why the closings on that are going to be a bit delayed. I think on the acquisition side, we are looking at opportunities that would be in markets where we\u2019re underrepresented some of the West Coast market, especially around say LA or in Seattle are markets we might still be trying to buy and certain markets in South Florida too. I think we\u2019re being provided reasons including where our stock price sits in order to move forward with an acquisition, it needs to make sense in the context of an alternative of buying our stock back and so I wouldn\u2019t put us in the aggressive path in terms of acquisitions, but whether the right opportunity to create value we\u2019d like -- well, we'll look to take advantage of it.","Smedes Rose","And I just wanted to ask you maybe just kind of bigger picture sort of I guess strategy. I mean you guys are always trying to sort of I think recycle the bottom kind of tier of your assets. Would you ever think about maybe pulling that forward and possibly spinning out kind of a subset or carving out or potentially selling to another REIT to whom those kinds of asset might be attractive or to kind of just overall improve the quality of your portfolio more quickly rather than over a period of years?","Ed Walter","No, I think certainly that is a thought that we\u2019ve looked at repeatedly over the course of the last probably 18 to 24 months. I think probably the more efficient execution in the long run would be a sale as oppose to a spin out. I think there is a spin out, well it looks good on paper, you really got to be thoughtful about the kind of company that you\u2019re creating and making certain that that company has a [indiscernible] on its own or you\u2019re not going to get the valuation that you might think you get. So if there are opportunities to sell whether it was to other REITs or other parties in scale, we would certainly be open to that. Again I think we found so far, every time we have tested some of those theories about doing a larger sale, the reality is we've come back to the fact that the best way to maximize pricing is one-off transactions that are heavily marketed.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll here from Anthony Powell with Barclays.","Anthony Powell","On the group demand, how is it in the quarter for the quarter group booking pace in the second quarter and how do you expect that to trend over the rest of the year?","Ed Walter","We were modestly down in the quarter for the quarter because we had started the quarter in such a strong position. I would say as we look towards the end of the year, I think we'd probably for the third quarter I would imagine that we would -- we might trend just a touch. Fourth quarter, I would expect to see that we\u2019ll see more bookings based on the trending that we\u2019ve been seeing which is that we\u2019re booking more as you look at least a quarter out, we\u2019ve been booking more in those quarters for the last three quarters in a row right now.","I think what we are experiencing here which is a good think -- and I think we've had this confirmed by all of our operators is that corporations are starting -- recognizing that hotels especially hotels that can accommodate groups running at high occupancies and are getting increasingly filled up. And so consequently, we are seeing better bookings as we look outwards for the second half of \u201915 or \u201916 even for \u201917 as company start to realize that they need to lock in the spaces that they want for the events that they want to have in order to make it certain that they are getting the right date in the right hotel, so I think that\u2019s a very favorable trend.","Greg Larson","I agree with that, the long-term trends are good, but I would also say that even the short term trends the bookings in the quarter for the entire year for 2015 if you look at that way, the volume was up 13.5% and the average rate book it was up approximately 4.5%.","Anthony Powell","And switching gears I guess to some of your franchising activity, you completed a number of these transactions this year and you have some more to go. Could you just broadly discuss the economics of these deals? Are you paying lower fees? Have you had more control over the asset or how are you looking broadly at this going more towards a franchise and third-party operator model?","Ed Walter","I think what we\u2019re finding, there is a variety of different situations that we've had this year, so in some cases it just moved. We may or may not be changing the brand and may or may not be creating a different type of a hotel by become -- looking to be something like what we\u2019re doing at the Logan or at the Canby, so there is no one great story, but I think broadly speaking what we\u2019re finding as we evaluate these opportunities to convert to a franchise operator and a little bit more of the local market focus on the marketing side. So we are expecting in each instance to varying degrees to see a better revenue blocking. And in most cases, this is because these hotels are less dependent on group business and a little bit more focused on corporate transient. And then we\u2019re definitely seeing a leaner expense model which is lean enough or more lean than our existing model enough to offset the slight increase in fees that we incur in some instances when we convert from a managed to a franchise model. So the bottom-line is in each instance like we\u2019re making the switch, we are ending up with what we expect to be an improved NOI once the new operator have had an opportunity to come into the hotel and for operations to stabilize.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll here from Steven Kent with Goldman Sachs.","Anto Savarirajan","This is Anto Savarirajan for Steve Kent. You periodically review your exposure to different markets. Understand your view that you would like to have your footprint concentrated in the major markets. But given current trends, would you say you are overweight in a few markets that you would like to move out off and I mean New York City we understand the longer term view there, but is there a view that you are overweight in the market and would like to trim exposure in maybe few of those markets? And the second question, you did mentioned that New York, you have towed down your expectations for the back half of the year, when we look through to 2016 and 2017, how are you thinking about the ability to get back pricing as the supply pipeline accelerates? And are there things that we are missing that perhaps you have a better view off?","Ed Walter","Well, I don't know that I necessarily know everything that you know, so it may be hard for me to figure out what you're missing. But I can certainly understand the thrust of your question. As we look certainly New York's been a challenging market and while we expected to be stronger in the second half of the year in terms of 2015, it has been a challenging market for us too. As we look at next year, I would agree with your point that supply look to be increasing next year. I would note that as we all look at those statistics is that at least as we -- based on the numbers that we\u2019ve look at, it tends to be a consistent over prediction a year out of the supply that's going to be delivered in New York and then what it has actually delivered is less. I can\u2019t assure you that that trend will happen in 2016, but we have seen that trend happen in the last two years or three years. ","Having said that I think that supply will be the concern again next year. The thing that could offset that would be stronger predicted growth in the U.S. in general in terms of economic growth and investment and to the extent that that also would perhaps benefit in terms of additional activity in the financial sector that would clearly be a plus for New York.","International travel has been a big benefit to New York. I think this year is probably a bit of a drag on New York. This is one of the reasons why we've seen some weaker performance there. I can\u2019t predict what happens with currencies for 2016, but if the delta and the change in currency with the dollar relative to the oil and some other things would perhaps potentially be different next year than it has been this year where the increase in the dollar's value is not as great. That could vote favorably for New York and these trips that were postponed from 2015 happen in 2016. ","I'd say the other thing that I would note is that as we look at the booking pace for next year at least as it relates to our portfolios, we were looking at a considerably down booking pace in 2015, we are looking at essentially a flat booking pace at this point for 2016, which again is certainly trending in a better direction than where it was.","As it relates to our exposure in New York, I think we\u2019re probably a little over allocated to New York. Having said that I think we\u2019re looking seriously at marketing one of our assets and there will probably be -- I think any sale that we would do in New York would be certainly contingent on getting a very attractive price. We do view the markets in the long run as an important market to be invested in and it's not easy for us to find assets that we like in the market, so we would want to be thoughtful about exiting one of our hotels, but if we can attract the right size, we would be open to consummating a transaction.","Greg Larson","And Anto, keep in mind based on obviously our acquisition this year the small disposition that we have this year in New York and actually the underperformance of New York this year, if you look at New York as a percentage of our EBITDA at the end of this year, it's going to be closer to 12%.","Anto Savarirajan","And you spoke of the Phoenician a very large asset. Not a lot of people would have the wherewithal to do such a transaction, Host can. When you look at your opportunity set, do you lean one way or the other where you find that you have an edge with some of these larger transactions compared to some of the other opportunities? And again, would Host at some point think about adding on a select service portfolio, given the popularity it seems to be enjoying now? ","Ed Walter","I'm sorry, didn\u2019t hear, what type of portfolio?","Anto Savarirajan","Select service hotels.","Ed Walter","Select service, I would say that to your first point, we certainly recognize that on larger transactions because of our scale and because of our excess capitals that we have an ability to buy those and other and maybe in environment where it's a little less competition than what we might see in other properties, that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re just going to focus on those opportunities, but it is something we certainly recognize as we look at different acquisitions. In terms of adding a select service portfolio, I think I would -- that we would be comfortable on adding select service assets. There is no reason why you could do or purchase a portfolio of those assets, but that would really be driven far more by where those assets were located and what the growth prospects were for those assets","located and what the growth prospects were for those assets as opposed to making a strategic movement to adding select service per say.","Operator","And next we will hear from Thomas Allen of Morgan Stanley.","Thomas Allen","Can you just help us bridge your revised 2015 EBITDA guidance? I think you cut the low end by $10 million, cut the high end by $25 million. You obviously cut the high end of your RevPAR guidance and then you also named a number of other kind of drivers. But can you just like maybe quantify each one of them if you could? That would be very helpful. Thank you.","Greg Larson","Yes. I think the simple way to do this really is that if you look in terms at the midpoint where we talked about $17.5 million decline, look just a hair over 5 of that is attributable to that the delta between the EBITDA generated by the Phoenician and the EBITDA that's lost by the asset delta we have consummated already this year. As you look at the other three sources that we identified for the reason why the EBITDA declined, it's pretty much an even allocation across those three items.","Thomas Allen","And then just as a follow up. Can you just help us with The Phoenician seasonality? I believe that's a very seasonal property where you actually lose money during the summer, but could you just help us think about it?","Greg Larson","Yes. I'd say that you are right in your assessment of the property, it's probably a desperate season during the course of the summer and it probably generates about two-third's, actually it probably generates about three quarters of its profit during the first five months of the year and about one quarter of its profit over the remaining seven months of the year.","Operator","And next we will hear from Wes Golladay with RBC Capital Markets.","Wes Golladay","You mentioned about the group outlook getting a little tighter, people scrambling to get rooms forward out. Are you seeing any interest in moving to secondary markets and out of these high occupancy gateway markets?","Ed Walter","We don\u2019t have a lot of hotels in those secondary markets necessarily. So it'd be probably be a little bit -- we probably don\u2019t have great way to quantify that, but I think one of the reasons why you're seeing the secondary markets at some of the lower price points, begin to perform better is because they have -- they run at lower occupancies and then they have had an office, so they have more room to take on groups and things like that. So I think that's why when you look at what -- as broadly across the industry, the secondary markets have for about last 12 months had bigger occupancy gains and I think it's in part because of what you identified.","Greg Larson","It's certainly helping out Atlanta for instance, that's right.","Wes Golladay","And then when we look at New York, we always hear about the crisis of confidence in that market. I was just wondering how much of that do you think that was actually potentially mix shift is getting more of the lower rated leisure customers in the market. Just curious about how the business transient customer is in that market? Are you able to have pricing power with that customer?","Greg Larson","I would say that off the markets across the country, New York is one of those ones where you have the least pricing power right now. I think that's frankly part of the problem that we have all been grappling with. Now you got to remember when you look at New York is that the first quarter you had a very difficult comp that related back to the Super Bowl. And the first quarter of New York has always tends to be the quarter where New York runs at lower occupancy levels compared to its overall stabilized level of occupancy for the year.","So in the environment where you have some increase in new supply slightly demand than what we have experienced in the prior year leaving out the Super Bowl equation, you ended up with a fairly competitive environment, even despite the factors that markets landed at a very high overall occupancy level. We do think that as you work your way into the fourth quarter that scenario starts to look a little bit more effective because the market runs at even higher occupancy levels in fourth quarter than it does the rest of the year. Having said that, I think we are still finding that it's not easy to push rates especially for transient business.","Operator","And we will now hear from Robin Farley with UBS.","Robin Farley","Two questions; one is you may have said this in your introductory comments and I missed it, but you mentioned the group bookings were up for 2016. But I don't think you gave the same, didn't give the percentage numbers the way you did for second half. So I wonder if you could just be a little more specific on group bookings for 2016?","Ed Walter ","Yes. Robin at this point, it looks like our group bookings for \u201916 are trending up close to 6% from a revenue perspective. ","Robin Farley","Okay. And then the construction disruption, previously you guys had quantified that as being 25 million for the full year. Is that, there wasn\u2019t a reference to that figure in today\u2019s release. I America just wondering if you felt that was still the best way to quantify it.","Ed Walter ","Okay. Now remember Robin that number refers to the disruption that we were expecting to see in our non-comparable hotels as opposed to the comparable ones. So that number is capturing the delta that we are experiencing year over year in say the Ritz Carlson in Phoenix or the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, the Axiom in San Francisco. Those hotels where they\u2019re being closed for part of the year or in the case of the San Diego Marquis where we eliminated a major chunk of our meeting space in order to build the new ballroom. I would say that number had trended up just and that is really what part of what we were referring to in our comment about the increased loss in effect because of the severance and weaker operations at the Ritz Carlson and the Four Seasons in the spring. But in the bottom-line those Hotels was simply that with as the hotels were focusing -- essentially as the management teams and employees focusing more on closing and what they were going to do next, and we overestimated the profits that we thought we would generate during next period. We have been conservative but it just turned out to be weaker. The good news is with that problem has no impact on what happens with the hotel next year.","Greg Larson","Correct. Obviously increased severance cost this year, obviously we\u2019ll not impact next year.","Robin Farley","Okay. That is great, thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the group comments for 2016, the revenue up close to 6%. What was specifically the Q2 bookings in Q2 for 2016, the change?","Ed Walter ","Robin, I don\u2019t have those handy.","Robin Farley","Okay, no problem. Thank you. I can get that.","Ed Walter ","The bottom line though is the same trend that we had otherwise been seeing was that we were our situation in \u201916 and in \u201917 during the course for the second quarter.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to the question from Ryan Meliker with Canaccord Genuity.","Ryan Meliker","I just had a couple of follow-ups for you, just to piggyback off what Smedes was asking earlier with the potential to sell incremental assets. You guys are obviously doing a lot of things that are creating value whether it be ticking off assets to sell one by one, or converting to third-party operations, or buying back stock at lower levels, which all make sense but none of it seems to move the needle that much given your scale. You mentioned the willingness potentially to do a larger portfolio transaction. Obviously you guys have historically trimmed the portfolio on the bottom end. But if you were going to do a larger portfolio transaction I guess how do you guys think about your portfolio in terms of the size that you might be willing to dispose of given the right opportunity in the market?","Ed Walter ","Ryan I think that\u2019s a hard question to answer any abstract. And I wouldn't want to leave people with the sense that we think we need to sell a large number of our assets. We think we have a very strong portfolio at this point and we\u2019re very happy with how the bulk of it is performing. So I think it really comes down to, we\u2019re going to continue to, as you described, we\u2019re going to sell if the weaker assets within the portfolio. And as we continue to do this over the course for the last number of years, the quality of what we\u2019re seeing continue to improve. But I wouldn\u2019t want to start to speculate on what a larger transaction might look like, because I wouldn\u2019t want to raise the expectations that something like that was likely.","Ryan Meliker","Okay, that is fair enough. And then just the second question I had was, Greg, you had mentioned that New York started to turn in June but you are still somewhat wary about New York because of slowing international travel. We've heard from others that they haven't seen any slowing in international travel. I know the airline data is lagging, but that is not showing any slowing in terms of the in-planements and de-planements for travel abroad. Is this specific to data that you're getting from your hotels associated with international bookings or is there some other data source; I guess what gives you confidence that you are seeing a slowing in international travel to New York?","Ed Walter","I think the airlines added that we are seeing nationwide is suggesting that travel from Europe is off a bit, and specific data that we\u2019ve got in for our individual hotels in the market has suggested that we have seen weaker travels from Europe over the course of the first half of this year. Now as you then look at -- I would point out that on Europe, a lot of the analysis on Europe has been EU currency countries are down in terms of travel. The UK where the currency has been stronger and travel from Switzerland which I think has been much smaller piece of it, has actually been up a bit.","But we\u2019ve also seen, I think in some of our assets we have seen that travel from Asia has offset this decline in EU and in other hotels we have not seen that I think that in a lot of cases this has to do with for travel booking that the individual hotels have gone after, it has to do with their group pattern. So it is tricky to draw broad conclusions. We\u2019ve done the best we could to interpret sort of variety of different data points to give you a sense that when we look at it overall we feel as if international travels been off slightly from New York this year.","Ryan Meliker","And then just one last follow-up on New York. It sounds like sequentially things got much better in June. We heard from one of the smaller hotel REITs that their New York in July was up 7%. Are you seeing continued sequential improvement? I am not asking for guidance or detail, but just are you seeing that trend that you saw in June persist well into July? ","Ed Walter","We look at the first few weeks of July; I say we\u2019re roughly in line with what we saw in June. I want to say we\u2019ve seen acceleration. But I think we\u2019re still comfortably positive. So hopefully that will continue for this week and to the rest of the summer.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move to a question from Jeff Donnelly with Wells Fargo.","Jeff Donnelly","Just sticking with New York, I mean the supply\/demand outlook there for 2015 and 2016 certainly seems challenging. I think it has been talked about quite a bit. And it could cause some maybe rockiness in cash flows. I am curious, Ed, what is your perspective on the direction of asset prices in New York in light of that environment? Because we certainly had robust prices; it seems to have disconnected a little bit from the operating cash flows. Do you expect that to sort of reconnect one way or another?","Ed Walter","Imagine that the cap rates will say low Jeff, just because there is no inherent attraction to the market, but I would say that I would, is that one of the things that I think we\u2019re going to find out over the course of the fall, with our intention to move forward in marketing and asset is to get a sense of exactly how strong the market would be. A lot of the activity that you've seen so far as the more attractive prices has been international buyers. I think they are going to continue to be attracted to the market, because they have perhaps a longer perspective in terms of what\u2019s going about the attractiveness in the New York market and they may have different motivations in terms of the returns that they are trying to achieve with their capital. So overall I would expect that at least when looked at in the context of cap rates then New York will continue to be one of the more attractively priced markets. One of the issue will be what the NOI is that that cap rate is going to be applied to. ","Jeff Donnelly","And if it will be -- I am thinking, my recollection is that you guys couldn't take action on it until sometime in early second quarter maybe of next year. Are you contemplating bringing it to market in advance of that? Will the closing sort of be well-timed? Or do you feel you need to wait until you are clear to sell that you can begin marketing? ","Ed Walter","I would say that we are not looking at one of our two largest assets in terms of marketing we are looking at one of our more mid-sized assets, that we think has a more unique story that could be successful -- successfully executed in today's market there.","Jeff Donnelly","And just maybe I'll switch gears, and correct me if I am wrong. I thought your original 2015 guidance had no assumption for net investment activity. So is the reason that the year-to-date net investment that we have seen of about $260 million is impacting your 2015 guidance simply just a timing issue? In effect the seasonal contribution of The Phoenician as you mentioned in the second half just isn't enough to offset what is probably a pretty high cap rate on the non-core asset sales?","Ed Walter","I would say that it's a high cap rate on a non-core sales just to make that a general point there. We have been selling -- that assets that we have sold when you take into account the asset and then you -- that might be associated which is I think only significant in the phase of one of the sales. We have been getting very attractive cap rate and this fixes for those deals.","It is what you survive which is fireline as it's in the desert, you make your money in the first part of the year. And you don\u2019t make that much in the last seven months of the year. The assets that we sold -- you think about Boston and some of those other markets, even Chicago tend to be stronger in the summer and in the fall and tend to be relatively weak in the winter and in the very early spring. So we just ended up in the scenario when you look at it for '15 is we ended up buying an asset that's strongest performance has been in the period of time before we acquired it. And the assets that we were selling not to the same degree, but to some degree have a stronger second half of the year than the first half which is why the net delta is negative this year, but on a pro forma basis would be positive and certainly we would be expecting when we look at it in the context of 2016, we are confident we have added to EBITDA of 2016 virtue of our assets. ","Operator","And now we will move on to a question from Ian Weissman with Credit Suisse.","Ian Weissman","Yes. Good morning. Just shifting gears a little bit on Houston. Clearly it came in weaker than you had anticipated. I guess my question is, is the business drop-off in that market just companies delaying business or you are seeing cancellations?","Greg Larson","I think it's a little bit of both Ian. And as I mentioned we also had some other issues in the quarter whether it is disruption or the flooding that I talked about. I think when we look out into the second half of the year, certainly Houston was better than the RevPAR decline that we announced this morning for the second quarter. But having said that, I think when we look at our second half forecast today for Houston, it's slightly lower than what we were predicting a quarter ago for Houston.","Ian Weissman","Your expectations for Houston I mean today Shell announced they are laying off 6,500 people and 1,000 of those will be felt in the Houston marketplace. Is your expectations for Houston taking into account a worse economic environment and more job layoffs or are you feeling like your outlook is on sort of steady as you goes, business operations in that market?","Greg Larson","Right. We try to take into account all those factors. The negative factors that you just mentioned, the group booking pace actually the third quarter is actually quite weak, the flip side is that the group bookings phase in the fourth quarter in Houston is extremely strong. And so we are trying to take into account all those things including the fact that some of our disruption will be behind at this time.","Ian Weissman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Greg Larson","Yes, I think trying to keep in mind, Ian, is that Houston is really about 2.5% to 3% of our -- So obviously pretty likely move for us.","Operator","And now we will hear from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Kelley","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to talk a little bit more about some of the international hotels in the portfolio. So thinking about what we are seeing out of Brazil and Canada which have been obviously particularly weak. A question sort of is as you look forward Ed, and you are starting to focus a little bit more on refranchising or franchising away from managing in some of the US markets, do you think that some of these smaller international markets are starting to become bigger distractions and those are areas where you could look to prune the portfolio a little bit or are these still I think part and parcel to the Host strategy at this point?","Greg Larson","No I think we are. I would say that we have a disproportionate number of international hotels in the market right now. And some of that is a I say that part of that's strategic and part of that is also tactical from a standpoint that we look across the portfolio, there are five different metrics that we use in purchase deciding what asset to sale. These were assets there moved up on the listing - I would say that in terms of what's happening in real and what's happening in Calgary and the back of the growth international RevPAR down significantly. The Calgary has been a challenging room renovate, but long-term it's been a good market for us. Short-term it's suffering both for the renovation and","long-term it\u2019s been a good market for us, short permit suffering both from the renovation and then some of the same issues that exist in Houston, because that\u2019s also, that\u2019s probably and it\u2019s equivalent of the Houston market. But certainly as a general asset, but I wouldn\u2019t see that as a distraction. In the case of the real assets we continued to understand what's happening in that market from capital flows and things like that. We know we got a strong year probably next year with the Olympic, I think if we saw the right opportunity to execute to sale, we would be open to that. But we also want to be thoughtful about capturing good prices there too.","Shaun Kelley","Thanks, Ed, I think it is really clear. And just to be, just to go back to the international or the marketing of the hotels that you talked about, because I missed some of the upfront comments. Just to be clear, included in any of the international sales are you a net seller in Europe or are you actually -- is nothing in I guess the JV contemplated there?","Ed Walter ","I would say, we expect to be a net seller in Europe this year. We are still -- that is the market that we are still interest in acquiring. So that is what we are certainly looking aggressively there. But I would say looking in our overall level of activity and handicapping that, I would say that we have already sold one asset there. We got very good pricing on that. And I think we\u2019re more likely to be, we\u2019ll be in net seller in Europe this year more likely than a net buyer.","Operator","And now we\u2019ll move to question from Chris Woronka with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Woronka","Just one for me. Can you guys maybe talk a little bit about as you look out to next year and I\u2019m really not asking for guidance? But on the renovations, which obviously have had kind of a disproportionate impact for you this year, how much comfort do you have that those, that the impact will kind of naturally reverse in terms of whether it is group bookings at some hotels or your discussions with the corporate room buyers or anything like that?","Ed Walter ","Chris, as it relates, as we talk about those non-comp hotels which is where the bulk of the problem this year, the one that have been close. We\u2019re certainly based on the initial results we\u2019re seeing, We feel good about how those properties will perform next year. But having said that, but also say that we\u2019re in the midst of construction; our management company has just taken over. All of those hotels tend to be a little bit more transient than group dominated, I am thinking more specifically of the one in San Francisco as well as both Phoenix and the Philly assets.","So I don\u2019t know that we have a lot of good indicators right now other than our overall underwriting of how those assets is performing in those market. We should have better insight into that as we get into the third quarter fall, and certainly as we get into the next year\u2019s first fall, only from the standpoint, but that point the operators will be in place, the product will start to be more visible in the market and we\u2019ll have a better sense of the bookings. But we\u2019re expecting across the board in those hotels, but not only recapture the loss EBITDA from this year, but also to be adding meaningfully to EBITDA over the course with 16 and 17. So I think that I\u2019m certainly confident that we\u2019ll recapture most of the, all of a lots EBITDA next year. And then the real question is how much is that expect to growth and we have been 16 versus 17.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Walter for any additional or closing remarks.","Ed Walter","Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate the opportunity to discuss our second quarter results and outlook with you. We look forward to providing you with more insight in the remainder of 2015 and third quarter call in the fall. Have a great day. Enjoy the rest of the summer. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We do thank you all for your participation."]}}
